EU packaging waste generation sees biggest increase in 10 years,"From parcels for online purchases to coffee-to-go cups, packaging is almost everywhere, and the recent figures published by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, unveil the scale of packaging waste in the EU. According to these figures, the generation of packaging waste per inhabitant rose by 10.8 kg between 2020 and 2021, the biggest increase seen in the last 10 years. Since these figures compare the start of the Covid-19 pandemic with the year that followed, the end of lockdowns and other restrictions, as well as the return to offices, could be seen as potential driving forces. Except that this mass of waste has soared by almost 32 kg compared to 2011. All in all, a European generates a total of 188.7 kg of packaging waste per year. As a result, the EU generated a total of 84 million tonnes of packaging waste in 2021, of which 40.3% were paper and cardboard. The rest was composed of plastic (19%), glass (18.5%), wood (17.1%) and metal (4.9%). The good news is that plastics are being recycled better than ever before. Over the last decade, between 2011 and 2021, the quantity of this type of waste has risen by 26.7%, while the recycling rate has also risen to 38.1%. Today, the average European generates 35.9 kg of plastic packaging waste, of which 14.2 kg is recycled. However, the situation varies from one EU member state to another. Some, such as Slovenia (50%), Belgium (49.2%) and the Netherlands (48.9%), manage to give a second life to almost half of all plastic, whereas this is the case for less than a quarter of such waste in Malta (20.5%), France (23.1%) and Sweden (23.8%). As far as the rest of the world is concerned, few countries provide with statistics as detailed as the European Union regarding the production and recycling of packaging waste, but the OECD figures show a constant and very rapid increase in the quantity of packaging produced every year."
Acai berry craze: boon or threat for the Amazon rainforest in Brazil?,"Consumed without further processing, in juice or sorbet, or incorporated into the formula of certain cosmetic products such as moisturizing lotions or shampoos, açaí berries have become the darling of superfood enthusiasts around the world. Brazil is the world’s leading producer of acai berries. Para, the source of 90 percent of the country’s crop, produced almost 1.4 million tonnes of it in 2021, worth more than USD 1 billion for the state’s economy, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). From there, acai went on to win fans worldwide, from the United States to Europe, Australia and Japan. Brazilian exports of acai and its derivatives surged from 60 kilograms in 1999 to more than 15,000 tonnes in 2021. However, the global success of the black berries is reshaping the world’s biggest rainforest — for better and worse. In the Amazonian state of Para during the harvest season, farmers can fill up to 25 large baskets of about 14kg each, bringing home between 300 and 625 reais (USD 60 to USD128). Middlemen buy the berries and bring them by boat to Belem, the state capital, where they are sold as quickly as possible, before the fragile fruit goes bad. Acai production has long been presented as a model of “bio-economy”, a source of income for local populations in the Amazon without cutting into the rainforest. But studies show the expansion of acai palms (also called açaizeiros) in is causing a loss of biodiversity in some regions by replacing other species. ""Leave nature to its own devices, and you get 50 or maybe 100 acai plants per hectare,"" says biologist Madson Freitas of the Museu Goeldi research institute in Belem. ""When you go beyond 200, you lose 60 percent of the diversity of other native species."" He has published a study on the phenomenon, which he calls ""acai-ification."" According to Freitas, the loss of other plant species in turn has a negative effect on acai, which becomes less productive because of a loss of pollinators such as bees, ants and wasps. Longer dry periods in the Amazon, which may be exacerbated by climate change, are also hurting acai, which tends to grow on land that floods during the rainy season. Freitas says that sustainable acai production is possible but that stronger conservation laws and policing — as well as incentives for farmers — are needed to combat single-crop farming and preserve the rainforest. Salomão Santos, a local leader in Igarape São João, admits acai’s dominance could become a problem. ""Those of us who live in the Amazon know we can’t live on one single species,"" he says. He recalls the commodity booms and busts of the past, such as sugar cane and rubber. He wants compensation for local communities who preserve the Amazon, whose hundreds of billions of carbon-absorbing trees are a vital resource against climate change."
"Voluntary deforestation carbon credits failing, study finds","As climate change accelerates and pressure mounts on corporations and countries to slash emissions, the market for carbon credits has exploded. The principle is quite simple: to offset the carbon emissions linked to their activities, companies buy carbon credits, which will be used to invest in forest protection or tree planting projects. In carbon markets, a single credit represents one tonne of CO2 that is either removed from the atmosphere by growing trees, or prevented from entering it through avoided deforestation. Such schemes, however, have long been dogged by charges of poor transparency, dodgy accounting practices, and in-built conflicts of interest. To accurately assess the effectiveness of projects financed by carbon credits, an international team of researchers explored the effects of several projects to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) launched in six countries across the world. [1] The results of the study, which were published Thursday, August 24 in the journal Science, provide a clear conclusion: “Most projects have not significantly reduced deforestation.” Only 5.4 million out of 89 million credits — about six percent — actually resulted in carbon reduction through forest preservation, the study found. Although some projects were successful, the reductions were significantly lower than what had been announced. According to the study: “Methodologies used to construct deforestation baselines for carbon offset interventions need urgent revisions to correctly attribute reduced deforestation to the projects, thus maintaining both incentives for forest conservation and the integrity of global carbon accounting.” ""Carbon credits provide major polluters with some semblance of climate credentials,"" said senior author Andreas Kontoleon, a professor in the University of Cambridge’s department of land economy. ""Yet we can see that claims of saving vast swathes of forest from the chainsaw to balance emissions are overblown."" ""These carbon credits are essentially predicting whether someone will chop down a tree and selling that prediction,"" he added in a statement. ""If you exaggerate or get it wrong — intentionally or not — you are selling hot air."" The new study is among the first peer-reviewed assessments across a number of representative projects. To assess the performance of 18 forest protection schemes in different countries, the researchers identified parallel sites within each region with similar conditions but without forest protection schemes. Of the 18 projects, 16 claimed to have avoided far more deforestation than took place at the comparison sites. There are several possible reasons that protection schemes have fallen so far short of their carbon sequestration claims. One is that they are calculated on the basis of historical trends that can be inaccurate or deliberately inflated. The operation must also project deforestation or afforestation rates over an extended period of time, which is difficult. In addition, projects may be located in areas where substantial conservation would have occurred in any case. The entire methodology serving as the basis for these carbon credits must therefore be reconsidered!"
"Protecting corals requires a multifactorial approach, study finds","The study published the journal Nature, which is based on 20 years of data from the US island of Hawaii, says that combining local efforts to limit the impact of humans on both the land and sea give coral reefs a greater chance at bouncing back. [1] ""We found that both land-based (for example wastewater pollution) and sea-based human impacts (for example fishing) must be reduced together to ensure coral reef persistence,"" the study’s co-lead author Gareth Williams, a marine ecologist at the UK’s Bangor University, told AFP. The release came just days after it was revealed that the temperature of the world’s oceans rose to their hottest level ever recorded on July 30. Using high-resolution data and thousands of hours of underwater surveys, the researchers looked at connections between human impacts and the recovery of the reef. They found that not all coral reefs suffer equally during heatwaves. In 18 percent of the reefs surveyed during an unprecedented marine heatwave in Hawaii in 2015, coral cover remained unchanged — and in some cases, increased — despite the heat. Their ability to recover was dependent on how strained they were by various human pollutants and how many algae-eating fish were around to pave the way for regrowth, the study said. The more negative impacts that were remedied, the better the reefs recovered, offering a potential path ahead for conservation efforts. The researchers carried out modelling which indicated that simultaneously reducing these problems on land and sea gave reefs an up to six times higher chance of regrowing after a heatwave than if the efforts were carried out separately. ""Resource managers have aspired to manage land and sea together, but because governance tends to be centralised, most terrestrial- and ocean-management efforts remain siloed,"" said the study’s co-lead author Jamison Grove of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But the researchers warned that the frequency and severity of coral bleaching as ocean temperatures rise due to human-caused climate change could ""simply overwhelm the positive effects of local management actions"". According to the IPCC, since 1982, marine heat waves have been twice as frequent as befor. And by 2100, they could be 10 times more intense if greenhouse gas emissions are not drastically reduced."
"Plastic litter in oceans overestimated but still a concern, study suggests","Scientists based in the Netherlands and Germany carried out 3D computer modelling using extensive observational data and measurements taken from surface water, beaches and the deep ocean from 1980 to 2020. The modelling study estimated that pieces of plastic bigger than 25 millimetres (one inch) make up over 95 percent of plastic floating on the ocean. While most plastic particles in the ocean are very small, the total mass of these microplastics — defined as less than five millimetres (0.2 inches) — is relatively low. “The majority of plastic mass is contained in the large plastic items (>25 mm),” which float more easily, said the authors of the study. Commenting the results, recently published in Nature Geoscience [1], the researchers said the preponderance of larger floating pieces suggests that the total amount of plastic in the ocean is ""much lower"" than previously thought. But the study also showed that the total amount of plastic on the ocean surface — about 3.2 million tons — is much higher that initially estimated. However, the model also found that less new plastic finds its way to the ocean every year than previously thought — about half a million tonnes instead of four to 12 million tonnes — stemming largely from coastlines and fishing activity. The fact that the plastic is floating around in large pieces could with help clean-up efforts. ""Large, floating pieces on the surface are easier to clean up than microplastics,"" the study’s co-author Erik van Sebille of Utrecht University in the Netherlands said in a statement. However, the combination of more surface plastic and less new plastic suggests that ""it will take longer until the effects of measures to combat plastic waste will be visible,"" the study’s lead Mikael Kaandorp said. ""If we don’t take action now, the effects will be felt for much longer,"" he added. And the amount of plastic pollution in the world’s oceans is still growing. Without further mitigation and clean-up, the lingering plastic litter could double within two decades, according to the study’s authors. Concern over the impact of plastics on the environment and human well-being has surged in recent years. Plastic debris is estimated to kill more than a million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals each year, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. The new study comes as the world awaits the first draft of a highly anticipated international UN treaty to combat plastic pollution, expected in November."
Consumers in Asia and Europe think sustainable goods are too pricey,"Doing more for the planet as an individual and embracing more environmentally-friendly practices can be a complicated matter, with progress being made but significant obstacles in the way. As heatwaves affect large swathes of the planet — and researchers suggesting that these episodes have been made more likely by human-caused climate change — we’re reminded of how urgent it is to find solutions to better preserve the environment. However, consumers in Europe and Asia seem willing to do their part of the job, albeit with reservations… A report commissioned by Chinese group Alibaba from UK-based consultancy firm Yonder Consulting indicates that consumers have a deep-seated desire to take action for the preservation of the planet [1]. Nearly three-quarters (73%) of a sample of over 14,000 consumers surveyed in Europe, the Middle East and Asia say they want to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle. In emerging Asian markets this proportion rises to 87%. However the obstacles preventing consumers from purchasing more sustainable products are the same in Europe and Asia. Greenwashing, for example, is a major issue. Some 38% of consumers worldwide question the trustworthiness of brands marketing products as sustainable, with 56% of Thais, 48% of French and 47% of Singaporeans expressing doubts about the real motivation of such companies. These are the three countries in the world where consumers are most likely to believe that a company’s environmental claims are another way for it to justify selling more expensive products. And pricing is the other area where Asia and Europe find common ground. For 45% of consumers worldwide, sustainable products are too expensive. And it’s hard to be a more responsible consumer when everyday products are so expensive — a view shared the world over. Thirty-three percent of this large sample indicate that if sustainable products were more accessibly priced, it would be easier to make choices that are more in line with protecting the planet. For 84% of Thais, sustainable purchasing is prohibitively expensive, which was the case for 41% of the United Arab Emirates respondents and 37% of Spaniards. Among the regions surveyed, Asians show the greatest motivation and interest in finding information in order to make their patterns of consuming more sustainable. Consumers in the Philippines (93%) and Indonesia (91%) are the most likely to welcome getting more information about becoming sustainable. More than anywhere else, people in emerging Asian markets are keen to know how to make more sustainable online purchases (88% vs. 66% in Europe)."
Global decarbonation: Carbon ’capture’ technologies are booming,"CCS syphons off CO2 from the exhaust, or flue gas, of fossil fuel-fired power plants as well as heavy industry. The exhaust from a coal-fired power plant is about 12 percent CO2, while in steel and cement production it is typically double that. Unlike CCS, which by itself only prevents additional carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere, DAC extracts CO2 molecules already there. Crucially, this makes DAC a ""negative emissions"" technology. It can therefore generate credits for companies seeking to offset their greenhouse gas output — but only if the captured CO2 is permanently stored underground, such as in depleted oil and gas reservoirs or in saline aquifers. The concentration of carbon dioxide in ambient air is only 420 parts per million (about 0.04 percent), so corralling CO2 using DAC is far more energy intensive and the cost is much higher. Once isolated using either CCS or DAC, CO2 can be used to make products such as building materials or ""green"" aviation fuel, plastic bottles, fragrance ingredients or fragrance alcohol. Although some of that CO2 will seep back into the air, these practices are believed to result in a significant reduction in new carbon emissions. The fossil fuel industry has been using CCS since the 1970s but not to prevent CO2 from leaching into the atmosphere. Rather, oil and gas companies inject CO2 into oil fields to extract more crude more quickly. Historically, bolting CCS facilities onto coal- and gas-fired power plants and then storing the CO2 to reduce emissions has proven technically feasible but uneconomical. The world’s largest CCS plant, the Petra Nova facility in Texas, was mothballed three years after opening in 2017. But the looming climate crisis and government subsidies have revived interest in CCS for the power sector and beyond. At the end of 2022, there were 35 commercial-scale facilities worldwide applying carbon capture technology to industry, fuel transformation or power generation, isolating a total of 45 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). DAC, by contrast, is very new. A total of 18 DAC plants globally only captured about as much CO2 last year (10,000 tonnes) as the world emits in 10 seconds. Both CCS and DAC must be massively scaled up if they are to play a significant role in decarbonising the global economy. To keep the mid-century net-zero target in play, CCS will need to divert 1.3 billion tonnes a year from power and industry — 30 times more than last year — by 2030, according to the IEA. And DAC will have to remove 60 million tonnes of CO2 per year by that date, several thousand-fold more than today. But the nascent industry is burgeoning with new actors, and the first million-tonne-per-year plant is scheduled to come on line in the United States next year, with others following. ""It’s a huge challenge but it’s not unprecedented,"" University of Wisconsin–Madison professor Gregory Nemet told AFP, citing other technologies, including solar panels, that have scaled up dramatically in a matter of decades. Preparing a site to stock CO2 can take up to 10 years, so storage could become a serious bottleneck for both CCS and DAC development. CCS costs USD 15 to USD 20 per tonne for industrial processes with highly concentrated streams of CO2, and USD 40 to USD 120 per tonne for more diluted gas streams, such as in power generation. And DAC — still in its infancy — has much higher costs, ranging today from USD 600 to USD 1,000 per tonne of CO2 captured. Those costs are projected to drop sharply to USD 100-USD 300 per tonne by 2050, according to the inaugural ""State of Carbon Dioxide Removal"" report, published earlier this year. As countries and companies feel the pinch from decarbonisation timetables and net-zero commitments, more money — public and private — is flowing toward both CCS and DAC. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) earmarks billions of dollars in tax credits for CCS. The earlier Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provides about USD 12 billion over five years. Canada’s 2022 budget also extends an investment tax credit that cuts the cost of CCS projects in half. South Korea and China are also investing heavily in the sector, with China opening a 500,000-tonne plant last month in Jiangsu Province. In Europe, support comes at the national level and is oriented toward industry and storage, especially in the North Sea. For DAC, a range of companies — Alphabet, Shopify, Meta, Stripe, Microsoft and H&M Group — have paid into a fund with a promise to collectively buy at least USD 1 billion of ""permanent carbon removal"" between 2022 and 200. Last month, JP Morgan struck a $20 million, nine-year carbon removal deal with DAC pioneer Climeworks, based in Switzerland."
Why is Israel’s city of Eilat promoting sunscreens that nourish corals?,"Tourists use between 16,000 and 25,000 tonnes of sunscreen each year in tropical regions, potentially releasing between 4,000 and 6,000 tonnes of sunscreen into reef areas, according to the findings of a study published in the scientific journal Environmental Health Perspectives. While it’s impossible, and even totally inadvisable, to stop protecting ourselves from the harmful effects of ultraviolet rays, many brands are now working to offer sun protection products claiming a lower impact on the marine environment. This includes eliminating some UV filters, such as oxybenzone and octinoxate. In order to go even further, Eilat, a seaside town in southern Israel which is home to the Coral Beach underwater reserve, featuring around a hundred species of coral and several hundred species of fish, has solicited scientists to create products that could actually reverse — as far as possible — the mechanism that contributes to coral bleaching. Marine scientists and skincare experts have worked hand in hand to develop a new formulation based on a non-nano, titanium-dioxide-based, mineral sunscreen. The base formula is Ecocert compliant and has undergone extensive aquatic safety testing.  The added reef nourishing formula is a bespoke blend of FDA-compliant trace minerals used by coral farmers to feed and support healthy growth in coral. ""The development of a sunscreen that not only doesn’t harm coral, but has the potential to feed and nourish our reefs, is an important step towards protecting and preserving our oceans,"" said Giovanni Giallongo, Marine Biologist at the Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Eilat. From a technical point of view, there’s nothing revolutionary! Actually, the goal is to clarify claims related to the protection of the marine environment through the introduction of a new industry-wide standard dubbed RPF (for Reef Protection Factor) that would help consumers make informed choices. “An increasing number of products claim to be ’reef-friendly’ or ’reef-safe’, but there is a lack of regulation in this area which means that consumers are easily being misled. It’s hoped that the new RPF marque will become an industry standard and spread beyond Israel, worldwide, helping consumers make responsible choices,” the experts behind the initiative explain in a statement. “This is a way of identifying sunscreen that truly cares for coral,” added Giovanni Giallongo. Last year, a class action lawsuit was launched in the United States against Australian brand Bondi Sands over alleged false claims in relation to reef protection. Other actions have been launched on a similar basis against several other manufacturers."
"“We abuse plastic, it’s so cheap,” says UN Environment chief","What are the main obstacles to an ambitious treaty? Inger Andersen - Today, virgin raw polymer is cheaper than recycled polymer. So here’s the question: What will allow us move from that linear ’we take it, we make it, we waste it’ reality to a circular approach? Right now, it’s so inexpensive you can just throw plastic away. But the cost to the environment and human health is huge, and it is not taxed anywhere. I’m a big believer in product redesign. Today, we want many products to be in liquid form: our shampoo, our toothpaste or even our washing powder. But there are a lot of things that we can ’de-liquefy’ and transport solid in boxes."" Is recycling today a credible solution? Inger Andersen - We can’t recycle our way out of this mess. But recycling is one of the many keys that we will need to make this work. Today, we simply throw plastic away because it has no value. When I was a little girl growing up in Denmark with very limited pocket money, my brothers and I collected plastic bottles every Saturday because we could get two krone. It wasn’t much, but it made it worthwhile. Now imagine the day that this stuff has value — we would think about and treat that garbage very differently! What changes in attitude or mentality do you think we need to see? Inger Andersen - Awareness is step one. Which is not to say the burden falls entirely on consumers — at the end of the day, it’s business and governments that have to take that responsibility. But every consumer has a choice. Let’s say we have a party. Do we need single-use cups and plastic bags? If that bag I use to carry home five tomatoes is a heavy polymer, it will sit in a landfill for hundreds of years, maybe a thousand. Why are supermarket bananas in a plastic bag? Nature already delivered them with their own packaging. So there are choices we can make. Children get it, and are already holding their parents to account.  But the bigger system shifts will come from agreements such as the one we are negotiating. Plastic pollution has not been a priority on the international agenda until quite recently. What changed? Inger Andersen - The popular demand for solutions has become powerful, and it’s coming across the board from left to right in most countries. I put it down to activism across a broad spectrum, and I am very, very grateful. I ask all those activists to keep the heat on to ensure that the treaty had ambitious and binding elements. Many green groups are worried that the plastics industry will have an undue influence in the talks. Inger Andersen - For this second round of negotiations we have 2,800 participants — 908 from government and 1,712 from non-government organisations (NGOs). There are ten industry associations represented. They have a role to play. Take ozone, which is probably our most successful treaty. We couldn’t find a solution to the manufactured gases depleting the ozone layer without having industry at the table. Here’s what I say to business: this is coming to a movie theatre near you soon. You might as well lean into it and be part of the change, because we will get a treaty and it will be ambitious. Once we make the enabling legislation, business will follow. Can the world do without plastics at all? Inger Andersen - Plastic is everywhere. We’re still going to need light switches, steering wheels, metro seats, whatever. But we need to think about the single-use dimension. We are abusing plastic because it’s so cheap. But this has consequences in the environment, in the oceans, to our health. The interview has been edited for concision and clarity."
Fight against pollution: New plastic-eating fungi may help for recycling,"""A total of 184 fungal and 55 bacterial strains capable of breaking down,"" various plastics were found in the Jiangsu province of eastern China, the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew said in a statement. Researchers from China and the UK in May 2021 sampled microorganisms from China’s Dafeng, a UNESCO-protected site near the coast of the Yellow Sea. Researchers said they found a distinct ""terrestrial plastisphere"", described as a ""man-made ecological niche"", which is an ecosystem that has evolved to live with the presence of coastal plastic debris. Because of their longevity and hydrophobic surface, plastics in aquatic ecosystems have the potential to create a sort of ‘microbial reef’ for fungi and bacteria to attach to. And certain plastics can provide microbes with a source of carbon to metabolize – a food source. At Dafeng, the researchers collected 50 samples of plastic waste from seven different types of petroleum-based polymers: polyethylene terephthalate (PET), expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyethylene (PE), polyurethane (PU), polyamide (PA), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Among the samples, the researchers identified 14 genera of fungi, including the plant pathogens Fusarium and Neocosmospora. The study’s findings indicate these fungi may be better at degrading polycaprolactone (PCL) plastics and other synthetic polymers than saprotrophic fungi. ""Scientists are increasingly looking at microorganisms, such as fungi and bacteria, to help tackle some of the most pressing challenges of the modern age, including the rising tide of plastic pollution,"" Kew Gardens said. In the wild, fungi play a key role in breaking down organic matter. Over millions of years, their ability to break down many complex and naturally occurring polymers, such as cellulose, has made them able to produce enzymes that are extremely efficient at breaking down complex organic compounds. The new findings contribute to existing studies on plastic-degrading microorganisms with some 436 species of fungi and bacteria found capable of breaking down plastic to date. RGB Kew scientists believe their latest findings could lead to the development of efficient enzymes designed to biologically degrade plastic waste. French start-up Carbios has pioneered the enzymatic recycling of plastic, more specifically PET. Thanks to their demonstration unit in Clermont-Ferrand, they have demonstrated the technical feasibility of using enzymes in an energy-efficient recycling process, paving the way for the construction of a first commercial plant whose commissioning is scheduled for 2025. In 2021, Carbios and L’Oréal unveiled the first plastic bottles made using enzymatic recycling technology. Carbios recently accelerated its micro-organism screening process with a microfluidic technology developed in partnership with the Paul Pascal Research Centre (a joint research unit of the CNRS and the University of Bordeaux, France) in order to reduce the time required to develop and produce new enzymes capable of breaking down different types of plastic polymers. The discovery of new plastic-eating strains should contribute to feed this research!"
Circular economy: How paperboard production improves Finland’s farm fields,"Metsä Board has partnered with Finnish circular economy company Soilfood for the upcycling of side stream fibre fractions created during paperboard production. In practical terms, Soilfood produces wood-based soil improvement fibres from fractions produced as side streams at Metsä Board’s cardboard mills. These fibres increase the fertility of the soil and improve its water retention capacity. The use of wood fibre is also an effective method of water conservation as it can reduce the run-off of phosphorus from fields by up to 50%. Thus, what was once considered waste, is now re-utilised into soil improvement fibres. “The result is a product that not only recycles the nutrients of wood fibre back into soil, but also stores the carbon of the wood into soil,” explains Metsä Board in a statement. Each weekday, Soilfood currently collects at least two truckloads worth of side streams from Metsä Board’s mills in Kemi and Äänekoski, Finland. In addition to Soilfood’s soil improvement fibres, the side streams from Metsä Board’s mills are being utilised for energy production and landscaping purposes. ""Together with farmers and our industrial partners, we are replacing virgin raw materials with recycled ones and using natural resources wisely. The demand for recycled nutrients and soil improvement fibres has been growing strongly in recent years. The growth is currently limited mainly by the availability of raw materials,"" says Sampo Järnefelt, Chief Commercial Officer at Soilfood. Metsä Board’s cooperation with Soilfood started with a research project initiated in 2015 by the Natural Resources Institute Finland to study the ability of wood based fibre sludge to stabilise the structure of field soil and thus reduce erosion and nutrient leaching from fields to water bodies. The field experiments of this study have found soil improvement fibres to reduce the risk of nutrient leaching by up to 50%. [1] Side streams can be burned to create energy, but using them as soil improvement fibres is more valuable from a circular economy perspective. The nutrients in the wood-based material are returned to the soil and part of the carbon is stored for the long term. In one treatment cycle, the farmer adds up to 5 tonnes of carbon to the field, some of which is broken down by biological processes to feed the microbiota of the soil and some of which is sequestered in the soil forming a carbon storage for more than 20 years. The utilisation of side streams is also included in Metsä Board’s 2030 sustainability targets. ""Currently, more than 99 per cent of our production side streams are used either as materials or energy. We aim to make 100% use of all production side streams to ensure our processes do not generate any landfill waste after 2030,"" says Markku Leskelä, Development Director at Metsä Board. ""Our cooperation with Soilfood is a good example of a circular economy that benefits all parties involved,"" he concludes."
G7 members commit to zero plastic pollution ahead of international treaty,"G7 members (United States, Japan, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy and Canada) committed to zero plastic pollution by 2040 — an attainable goal thanks to the rise of the circular economy and the reduction or banning of single-use plastics and non-recyclables, according to the final statement. The announcement has come just before the UN has its next meeting on the plastics treaty, late May in Paris, when the details will be discussed. The declaration states that G7 members will cooperate constructively on the UN convention “including mandatory measures” and “covering the entire life cycle of plastics”. A year ago in Nairobi, 175 countries convened to put an end to plastic pollution worldwide by developing a legally-binding United Nations treaty by the end of 2024. The next session to negotiate the treaty is scheduled for May in Paris. Among the anticipated measures is a global ban on single-use plastics, the establishment of a ""polluter-pays"" system and a tax on the production of new plastic. Indeed, the current situation is considered of very high concern. Global plastic production almost doubled between 2000 and 2019, from 234 million tonnes to 460 million tonnes, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Plastic waste more than doubled in that time, reaching 353 million tonnes in 2019. But global production fell slightly in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic for only the third time in the history of modern industry, according to trade association Plastics Europe. The OECD said 22 million tonnes of plastic were discarded in the environment in 2019 alone, with six million tonnes ending up in waterways, lakes and oceans. Plastic makes up at least 85 percent of total marine waste, according to the UN Environment Assembly. More than half of the plastic came from Asia in 2020, with China representing almost one-third of the global total. Plastic production in the world’s second-largest economy jumped by 82 percent between 2010 and 2020, well above the global growth average of 30 percent, according to a Plastics Europe report. Europe’s production in 2020 was 55 million tonnes, a five-percent fall on 2019 levels. The growth mostly came from the United States and the Middle East as primary materials there are much cheaper, and from China because its demand is growing more strongly, said Jean-Yves Daclin, Plastics Europe’s director general for France. A 2021 report by the World Wildlife Fund estimated that global plastic production would double by 2040. Recycling is the main solution to halt the relentless march of plastic pollution. Although Europe recycles more than one-third of its plastic waste, globally only around nine percent of plastic waste was recycled in 2019, according to the OECD. However, promising recycling technologies, such as enzymatic recycling developed by French-based Carbios are emerging. Other solutions include developing packaging-free products, returnable items and eco-friendly designs with long lifespans. Plastic made from agricultural resources — such as sugar, starch, corn and wheat — represents less than one percent of global production. The use of agricultural land and water resources limits their development as a way of reducing oil consumption in plastic production. Even worse, these plastics are rarely completely biodegradable or compostable and ""in reality only dodge the issue"", according to the Heinrich Boell Foundation, an environmental think tank in Germany. The problem has spurred the development of second- and third-generation plastics sourced from vegetable waste or algae. Another – ambitious – technique is making plastic from the carbon dioxide belched out into the atmosphere by industry. Tests have been conducted by L’Oréal, LanzaTech and Total with the creation of the first cosmetic plastic bottle made from industrial carbon emissions."
Coty launches new Gucci fragrance with 100% carbon-captured alcohol,"Available in stores since April 1, 2023, Where My Heart Beats Eau de Parfum – the latest addition in Gucci’s The Alchemist’s Garden collection – is the world’s first globally distributed fragrance manufactured using 100% carbon-captured alcohol. The fragrance uses CarbonSmart alcohol produced by biotech company LanzaTech. This novel technology process captures carbon from industrial emissions and, after a clean-up step, transforms it through fermentation into ethanol for use in fine fragrances. Previously, Coty introduced CarbonSmart ethanol into its fragrance portfolio (which includes brands such as Calvin Klein, Burberry, Boss, Gucci, Chloé, Marc Jacobs Perfume, etc.) by blending it with traditional alcohol. For the launch of Where My Heart Beats Eau de Parfum, Coty has segregated the supply of carbon-captured alcohol to ensure the product is made only from recycled carbon. “Coty is the first company to introduce carbon-captured alcohol into fine fragrances for global distribution. This is an inspiring example for sustainability being the ultimate driver of innovation. Beyond the science, there is something magical in upcycling industrial emissions into alcohol pure enough for use in fine fragrances,” said Coty Chief Scientific & Sustainability Officer, Dr. Shimei Fan. Coty announced its partnership with LanzaTech in March 2021 and started production of the world’s first globally distributed fragrances made using this technology in January 2022. To produce this new generation ethanol, LanzaTech captures carbon from different emission sources (industry, solid organic waste) or even in ambient air, through an electrolysis process. The collected CO2 is then cleaned-up before being transformed into ethanol through fermentation. Ethanol is a core ingredient in fine fragrance products, enabling the efficient dispersion of the scent. As most other fragrance producers, Coty uses ethanol sourced from a range of natural raw materials - including sugar cane and sugar beet, which require farm land, water and fertilizers. By employing a new source of alcohol transformed from carbon emissions through LanzaTech’s technology, Coty intends to reduce the beauty industry’s environmental impact. A life cycle assessment by independent sustainability consultancy Quantis has shown a significantly reduced overall environment impact. “Through this novel carbon capture approach, carbon emissions, which would typically be released into the atmosphere, are recycled into alcohol pure enough for use in fine fragrances. Furthermore, this process uses less water and reduces the need for agricultural land compared to traditional methods of alcohol production,” Coty explains. Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) in the chemical industry could lead to a dramatical reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, according to a recent exploratory study by the Renewable Carbon Initiative (RCI), CO2 Value Europe (CVE) and nova-Institute."
How plastic waste could be used to produce hydrogen and glycolic acid,"Plastic recycling is a key environmental issue. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), more than 400 million tons of plastic are produced each year in the world, 85% of which ends up in landfills or dumped in nature where it takes hundreds of years to decompose. But what if, in the future, this plastic waste could be used to produce hydrogen and glycolic acid? Today, plastic can be transformed into a multitude of products, including paints and solvents. It is even possible to recycle plastic into gasoline by incorporating certain additives. However, turning it into hydrogen could represent a cleaner alternative for the environment. A team of researchers at the UK’s University of Cambridge [1] is working on a process that can convert not only plastic, but also CO2, into two chemical products: syngas, a source of hydrogen, and glycolic acid, which is widely used in the cosmetics industry. This technique consists of integrating catalysts that accelerate a chemical reaction into a system powered by solar energy. In fact, the chemical reaction is produced thanks to this exposure. Ultimately, this technology could reduce plastic waste and CO2 emissions, while producing two valuable chemical products. The next step is to move from a laboratory experiment to full-scale production by exploring ways to commercialize this process. The researchers’ findings are published in the journal, Nature."
"Rise in ocean plastic pollution ’unprecedented’ since 2005, study found","Research published on Wednesday found that there are an estimated 170 trillion pieces of plastic, mainly microplastics, on the surface of the world’s oceans today, much of it discarded since 2005. ""Plastic pollution in the world’s oceans during the past 15 years has reached unprecedented levels,"" said the study, published in open-access journal PLOS One [1] The amounts were higher than previous estimates, and the study found that the rate of plastic entering the oceans could accelerate several-fold in the coming decades if left unchecked. Researchers took plastic samples from over 11,000 stations around the world focusing on a 40-year period between 1979 and 2019. They found no trends until 1990, then a fluctuation in trends between 1990 and 2005. After that, the samples skyrocket. ""We see a really rapid increase since 2005 because there is a rapid increase in production and also a limited number of policies that are controlling the release of plastic into the ocean,"" contributing author Lisa Erdle told AFP. The sources of plastic pollution in the ocean are numerous. Fishing gear like nets and buoys often end up in the middle of the ocean, dumped or dropped by accident, while things like clothing, car tyres and single-use plastics often pollute nearer to the coast. They eventually break down into microplastics, which Erdle said can look like ""confetti on the surface of the ocean"". On current trends, plastic use will nearly double from 2019 across G20 countries by 2050, reaching 451 million tonnes each year, according to the report, jointly produced by Economist Impact and The Nippon Foundation. In 1950, only two million tonnes of plastic were produced worldwide. Recycling, even in countries with advanced waste management systems, has done little to help the pollution problem since just a small percentage of plastics are properly recycled and much often ending up in landfills instead. If landfills are not properly managed, plastic waste can leech into the environment, eventually making its way to oceans. ""We really we see a lack of recycling, a flood of toxic products and packaging,"" Erdle said. The rates of plastic waste were seen to recede at some points between 1990 and 2005, in part because there were some effective policies in place to control pollution. That includes the 1988 MARPOL treaty, a legally binding agreement among 154 countries to end the discharge of plastics from naval, fishing and shipping fleets. But with so much more plastic being produced today, the study’s authors said a new, wide-ranging treaty is needed to not only reduce plastic production and use but also better manage its disposal. ""Environmental recovery of plastic has limited merit, so solution strategies must address those systems that restrict emissions of plastic pollution in the first place,"" the study] said. Last year, 175 nations agreed to end plastic pollution under a legally binding United Nations agreement that could be finalised as soon as next year. Among the key actions under negotiation are a global ban on single-use plastics, a ""polluter pays"" scheme, and a tax on new plastic production. The total weight of the plastic pollution detected in the ocean today is estimated at 2.3 million tonnes, the PLOS study] said."
Carbon credits: a contested tool to fight deforestation,"Walt Disney, J.P. Morgan Bank and other major corporations have been accused of purchasing carbon credits from forest protection projects in areas that were not actually at risk of deforestation. Separately, a company responsible for managing 600,000 hectares of land in the United States has reportedly earned USD 53 million over the past two years from carbon credits that did not significantly alter its forest management practices. None of these projects sequestered carbon beyond that which would have been absorbed by trees through photosynthesis in a business-as-usual scenario. Still, companies counted the resulting carbon credits towards their own reduction targets, allowing them to offset emissions in the carbon accounting of their operations. Leaders and experts from around the world will gather in the Gabonese capital Libreville on March 1 and 2 for the One Forest Summit. Co-presided by France and Gabon, the meeting will focus on improving financial instruments aimed at protecting the world’s forests. Carbon credits are already widely used. According to various estimates, the number of tons of CO2 they represent (with one credit equivalent to one ton) could increase tenfold by 2030, to around two billion tons. “The risky aspect of the carbon credit market is that it is not self-regulating,” said Cesar Dugast from French environmental consultancy Carbone 4, in an interview with AFP. “Everyone has an interest in maximizing the quantity of carbon credits. It enables the project developers to spread the total cost over a maximum number of credits, offering a lower cost to buyers. Even the certifiers have an interest in the proliferation of projects,” he added. In mid-January, The Guardian, Die Zeit and an NGO revealed that more than 90 percent of projects certified by leading verifier Verra for forest conservation under the UN programme to reduce deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) were likely “ghost credits” that did not represent “real emissions reductions”. Verra’s CEO, David Antonioli, rejected these findings, arguing that “REDD projects are not some abstract concept on a piece of paper; they represent real projects on the ground that deliver life-affirming benefits.” After the story came out, the price of nature-related carbon credits has dropped, according to Paula VanLaningham, global head of carbon at S&P Global. The revelations about REDD+ projects have sparked a wider debate about the entire carbon credit system. “Are the projects themselves a good vehicle for carbon finance in a way that actually leads to a just transition? Probably both yes and no,” she told AFP. Several independent rating agencies have since defended their methodologies, stressing the crucial need for financing projects protecting nature. “The first issue we look at is additionality: would the project have happened in absence of the carbon markets?”, Donna Lee, co-founder of Calyx Global, an independent rating agency for carbon projects, told AFP. “We then look at how the baseline was set and what would have happened in the absence of the project.”
 The core issue with initiatives aimed at halting deforestation is the challenge of proving that deforestation would have occurred without the funding. “We look at patterns of deforestation in the region... a lot of scientific studies show that there are certain things like roads, population, distance to the forest edge, that are often associated with deforestation,” Lee said, while admitting that improvements are needed. Above all, the companies that buy these credits should be “more transparent” by clearly indicating where credits are sourced and how they reduce their own emissions, she added. “We need to move from a mentality of compensating to a mindset of contributing,”  said Dugast from Carbone 4. In other words, companies financing forests to offset carbon emissions is acceptable, but not as a loophole to avoid reducing their own emissions."
"’Home compostable’ plastic packaging is largely greenwashing, study says","It’s not that easy to home compost plastic packaging! Actually, this solution might not be as environmentally friendly as it would appear at first sight. Such is the conclusion of a survey conducted by researchers at University College London, published in the journal Frontiers in Sustainability [1]. ""Compostable and biodegradable plastics are growing in popularity, but their environmental credentials need to be more fully assessed to determine how they can be a part of the solution to the plastic waste crisis,"" write the researchers, who set out to investigate such claims. Using a citizen science approach, the research sought to survey consumers to find out more about their purchasing habits for so-called ""biodegradable"" and ""home compostable"" plastic products, their knowledge of how to recycle them properly, and the actual performance of such packaging. The survey was conducted over a two-year period among 9,700 people across the UK. When asked if they were more likely to buy products with packaging marked ""compostable"" or ""biodegradable,"" 85% answered ""yes."" Of the participants, 1,648 actively engaged in a home-composting experiment (but only 902 completed it). The experiment involved examining the contents of the compost after depositing packaging (cups, jars, cutlery, newspaper wrappers) for traces of plastic. If 90% of the carbon in the test materials was gone within six months, they were considered compostable. The results show that, on the whole, deciphering labels featuring terms like ""compostable"" and ""biodegradable"" remains difficult for consumers. ""Despite our best efforts to guide the participants only to compost items marked clearly as ‘home compostable,’ many items that are marked as industrially compostable or just as biodegradable have been entered into the experiment,"" note the researchers. The study also suggests that laboratory testing for these materials is not working, which is a broader problem for the plastics industry, and calls into question whether these product standards actually protect the environment. ""The diversity of microbial communities, the catalytic pathways of nutrient transformation, the material chemical differences cannot be fully controlled and reproduced in vitro and hence home compostability standards are likely to be unreliable,"" note the study authors. They conclude: ""home composting is not an effective or environmentally beneficial waste processing method for biodegradable or compostable packaging in the UK."" Indeed, the only real solution is to use less plastic."
Blue whales eat 10 million pieces of microplastic a day: study,"The tiny fragments of plastic have been found everywhere from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains, and even inside human organs and blood. Now a modelling study published in the journal Nature Communications [1] has estimated how much is being ingested by whales. A US-led research team put tags on 191 blue, fin and humpback whales that live off the coast of California to observe their movements. ""It’s basically like an Apple Watch, just on the back of a whale,"" said Shirel Kahane-Rapport, a researcher at California State University, Fullerton and the study’s first author. The whales mostly fed at depths of between 50 to 250 metres (165-820 feet), which is home to the ""greatest concentration of microplastics in the water column,"" Kahane-Rapport told AFP. The researchers then estimated the size and number of mouthfuls the whales had daily and what was filtered out, modelling three different scenarios. Under the most likely scenario, the blue whales ate up to 10 million microplastic pieces a day. Over the 90-120 day annual feeding season, that represents more than a billion pieces a year. The largest animal to live on Earth is also likely the biggest microplastic consumer, eating up to 43.6 kilogrammes a day, the study said. ""Imagine carrying around an extra 45 kilogrammes — yes, you’re a very big whale, but that will take up space,"" Kahane-Rapport said. Humpback whales were estimated to eat around four million pieces a day. While it is easy to imagine whales sucking in vast amounts of microplastics as they gulp their way through the ocean, the researchers found that was not the case. Instead, 99 percent of the microplastics entered the whales because they were already inside their prey. ""That’s concerning for us,"" Kahane-Rapport said, because humans eat that prey. ""We also eat anchovies and sardines,"" she said, adding that ""krill is the basis of the food web"". Previous research has shown that if krill are in a tank with microplastic, ""they will eat it,"" Kahane-Rapport said. Now that the researchers know how much microplastic is being consumed by whales, next they aim to determine how much harm it could be doing. ""The dose defines the poison,"" Kahane-Rapport said."
UK takes aim at company ’greenwashing’,"The Financial Conduct Authority said it was proposing regulations, including investment product sustainability labels and restrictions on terms such as ""green"", ""sustainable"" and ""ESG"" (environmental, social, and governance). According to the FCA, there has been growth in the number of investment products marketed as ‘green’ or making wider sustainability claims. However, the agency considers exaggerated, misleading or unsubstantiated claims about ESG credentials damage confidence in these products. ""Greenwashing misleads consumers and erodes trust in all ESG products,"" said Sacha Sadan, FCA’s Director of Environment Social and Governance. ""Consumers must be confident when products claim to be sustainable that they actually are. Our proposed rules will help consumers and firms build trust in this sector."" The FCA is proposing to introduce: sustainable investment product labels, restrictions on how certain sustainability-related terms – such as ‘ESG’, ‘green’ or ‘sustainable’ – can be used in product names and marketing for products which don’t qualify for the sustainable investment labels, consumer-facing disclosures, more detailed disclosures, suitable for institutional investors or retail investors that want to know more, requirements for distributors of products, such as investment platforms, to ensure that the labels and consumer-facing disclosures are accessible and clear to consumers. The FCA is running a consultation on its proposals until January 25, ahead of publishing final rules by the end of June. Last week, a British watchdog hit out at HSBC for adverts promoting its green initiatives that failed to highlight the bank’s contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. The Advertising Standards Authority banned further use of HSBC posters that appeared a year ago ahead of the COP26 climate summit hosted by Britain. HSBC insisted that the financial sector had ""a responsibility to communicate its role in the low carbon transition to raise public awareness and engage its customers"". But it also acknowledged the need to ""consider how best to do this"" as it delivers on the bank’s ""ambitious net zero commitments"". UK multinationals seeking to meet a British government target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 are frequently accused of ""greenwashing"" by environmentalists."
"Plastic recycling remains a ’myth’ in the USA, finds Greenpeace study","Titled ""Circular Claims Fall Flat Again,"" the study found that of 51 million tons of plastic waste generated by US households in 2021, only 2.4 million tons were recycled, or around five percent. After peaking in 2014 at 10 percent, the trend has been decreasing, especially since China stopped accepting the West’s plastic waste in 2018. Virgin production — of non-recycled plastic, that is — meanwhile is rapidly rising as the petrochemical industry expands, lowering costs. ""Industry groups and big corporations have been pushing for recycling as a solution,"" Greenpeace USA campaigner Lisa Ramsden told AFP. ""By doing that, they have shirked all responsibility"" for ensuring that recycling actually works, she added. She named Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Unilever and Nestle as prime offenders. According to Greenpeace USA’s survey, only two types of plastic are widely accepted at the nation’s 375 material recovery facilities. The first is polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is commonly used in water and soda bottles; and the second is high density polyethylene (HDPE), seen in milk jugs, shampoo bottles and cleaning product containers. These are numbered ""1"" and ""2"" according to a standardized system in which there are seven plastic types. But being recyclable in theory doesn’t mean products are being recycled in practice. The report found that PET and HDPE products had actual reprocessing rates of 20.9 percent and 10.3 percent, respectively — both down slightly from Greenpeace USA’s last survey in 2020. Plastic types ""3"" through ""7"" — including children’s toys, plastic bags, produce wrappings, yogurt and margarine tubs, coffee cups and to-go food containers — were reprocessed at rates of less than five percent. Despite often carrying the recycling symbol on their labels, products that use plastic types ""3"" through ""7"" fail to meet the Federal Trade Commission classification of recyclable. This is because recycling facilities for these types aren’t available to a ""substantial majority"" of the population, defined as 60 percent, and because the collected products are not being used in the manufacturing or assembly of new items. According to the report, there were five main reasons why plastic recycling is a ""failed concept."" First, plastic waste is generated in vast quantities and is extremely difficult to collect — as becomes clear during what the report called ineffective ""volunteer cleanup stunts"" funded by nonprofits such as ""Keep America Beautiful."" Second, even if it were all collected, mixed plastic waste cannot be recycled together, and it would be ""functionally impossible to sort the trillions of pieces of consumer plastic waste produced each year,"" the report said. Third, the recycling process itself is environmentally harmful, exposing workers to toxic chemicals and itself generating microplastics. Fourth, recycled plastic carries toxicity risks through contamination with other plastic types in collection bins, preventing it from becoming food-grade material again. Fifth and finally, the process of recycling is prohibitively expensive. ""New plastic directly competes with recycled plastic, and it’s far cheaper to produce and of higher quality,"" said the report. Ramsden called on corporations to support a Global Plastics Treaty, which United Nations members agreed to create in February, and move toward refill and reuse strategies. ""This isn’t actually a new concept — it’s how the milkman used to be, it’s how Coca-Cola used to get its beverages to people. They would drink their beverage, give the glass bottle back, and it would be sanitized and reused,"" she said. Some countries are leading the way, including India, which recently banned 19 single-use plastic items. Austria has set reuse targets of 25 percent by 2025 and at least 30 percent by 2030 for beverage packaging, while Portugal has also set the 30 percent by 2030 goal. Chile is moving to phase out single-use cutlery and mandating refillable bottles."
"Waterless, refillable, upcycled: Circular cosmetic products are mushrooming","Among recent launches, there is an increasing number of waterless products, highlights Ecovia Intelligence. Brands are launching shampoo bars, sheet masks and related products. By not containing water, such products have lower environmental impact as they require less packaging, have lower transportation and distribution costs, and can be self-preserving. Garnier, Aveda, and Klorane are some of the established brands launching waterless products in the last couple of years. In June, P&G joined the bandwagon and announced that it will launch solid shampoos and conditioners under its Head & Shoulders, Pantene, Herbal Essences and Aussie brands. Waterless innovations are now spreading to colour cosmetics, although powders and sticks have long been common in this category. Newcomers like SBTRCT are making a step further with plastic-free and zero waste products. Skin care appears to be the very next frontier for waterless products. Emerging brands such as Yodi, Mono Skincare and Maison Dakōta are pioneering the category, with suppliers such as Aircos or Superga Beauty, among others, multiplying innovations. To close their packaging loops, brands are also moving away from single-use plastics and refillable packaging is becoming prominent. In addition, Terracycle has expanded its Loop platform for refillable packaging to various countries. Labelled the circular reuse platform, Loop works with cosmetic companies and retailers so consumers can return product packaging for re-use. In the deodorants sector, innovations are involving refillable packaging. Fussy and Wild Cosmetics, for instance, are UK brands that have launched sustainable deodorants in refillable deodorants. Fussy deodorants have clean formulations and are housed in plastic-free compostable packaging; the products are marketed as the ‘next generation’ deodorant. As far as ingredients are concerned, upcycling is becoming increasingly popular as the cosmetic industry looks to valorise waste streams. Leading ingredient firms, such as Dow Chemical and Laboratories Expanscience, are using food byproducts to create new natural ingredients. Fruit kernels, vegetable peels, and coffee grounds are some of the waste materials used. The Finnish start-up Innomost is making cosmetic ingredients from birch bark side streams. Dr. Craft, O’right, UpCircle and Kadalys are some of the brands developing dedicated product ranges with ‘repurposed ingredients’. The move towards circularity is also encouraging collaborations. Clariant, Beiersdorf, Borealis and Siegwerk have teamed up to create circular packaging innovations. The Design4Circularity initiative has created a colourless polyolefin bottle made from 100% post-consumer recycled material. The packaging materials can be recovered and fully recyclable for the same application. As the circular beauty trend is gaining impetus in the cosmetics industry, Ecovia Intelligence believes its success will hinge on customer behaviour. Shoppers will buy novel products if they are aware of their sustainability merits. Consumers also need to be educated on how to use waterless products, what packaging to recycle, where and how to refill. “The cosmetics industry is making sustainable products, however are consumers being prepared for them,” asks Ecovia Intelligence. Sustainable Cosmetics Summit - European Edition Waterless cosmetics, upcycled ingredients, refillable packaging, new packaging materials, and customer behaviour will be featured in the upcoming Sustainable Cosmetics Summit. Lush, Terracycle, SBTRCT, Clariant, Dow Chemical, L’Oreal (Garnier), Fussy and Kadalys will be sharing their experiences at the event. Since 2009, the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit has been covering sustainability issues in the cosmetic & personal care industry. The European edition will be hosted at the Paris Marriott Champs-Élysées hotel on 7-9th November 2022. More information is available from www.sustainablecosmeticssummit.com/Europe/ "
"Despite very low collection rates, Nigeria tries to recycle wastes","In Africa’s biggest economy and most populous country, collecting, sorting and recycling trash is despairingly rare. But there is also good news. Some entrepreneurs are working hard to tackle the rubbish mountain, despite the many challenges. Romco Metals started recycling aluminium at its factory outside Lagos in 2015, drawn by global demand for the light, strong and flexible metal. Buoyed by good results, it built a second facility outside Ghana’s capital Accra and now plans to open at least three new plants across Africa and triple production by 2025. Aluminium is the world’s second most-used metal after steel and used widely in construction, medicine, car-making and packaging. ""Electric vehicles require more durable lighter material such as aluminium, and that’s where our materials end up,"" said the company’s youthful founder, 32-year-old Raymond Onovwigun. A British-registered company, Romco melts down and recycles around 1,500 tonnes of discarded aluminium per month, out of a capacity of 3,000 tonnes.  It says it has created 450 direct jobs — 5,000 in total, in this labour-intensive sector — and plans to double that number within a year. Among those who have most benefited from Romco’s business are material suppliers like Mohammed Ashiru Madugu, who delivers several truckloads of metal scrap each week. Madugu has a warehouse in northwestern Katsina, where suppliers from across the state and even neighbouring states bring him discarded metal. He loads the goods onto trucks and sends them all the way to Lagos, more than a thousand kilometres (600 miles) away. For one truck, he can get paid up to 26 million naira (about $60,000 dollars) although the price fluctuates. The scrap supplier said those trips required escorts because of the risk of ambushes by criminal gangs on the road [1]. However, only a tiny fraction of waste is recycled in Nigeria, a country of some 210 million consumers. Plastic, metal and glass  are mostly tossed out. Each year, Nigeria disgorges 200,000 tonnes of plastic into the Atlantic, the UN Industrial Development Organisation reported last year. In Lagos alone, a city of more than 20 million people, less than 10 percent total recyclables are currently collected, Ibrahim Adejuwon Odumboni, managing director of the Lagos State Management Agency told AFP. By comparison, in the UK, more than 41 percent of waste picked up by local authorities was recycled last year, according to local statistics. For Odumboni, recycling initiatives are to be commended but more should be done by the companies making aluminium beverage cans and other products. ""We need the manufacturers to invest in the collection system. In many parts of the world, a portion of what producers sell is going into the recovery of products. We currently don’t have that in Nigeria,"" he said. If companies selling aluminium products ""are not held responsible (for collecting waste) then it doesn’t make any sense — we’re just going round and round in circle."" He blames poor legislation but says an improved law on Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is currently being discussed in the state house of assembly. EPR is an environmental policy in place in many countries that gives producers incentives to take responsibility for their products after they are used. Another challenge for recyclers is carbon emissions from the energy they use to crush, shred or melt old materials. Romco, for instance, uses compressed natural gas to turn the aluminium into ingots. ""(It) is still a fossil fuel but the best, most efficient fossil fuel. It doesn’t contain lead or sulphur,"" said Onovwigun. The company says, however, that it wants to be independent of fossil fuels and is ""exploring the potential of using solar, green hydrogen, and biofuels."""
L’Oréal North Asia Zone achieves carbon neutrality across all sites,"Mainland China was the first market worldwide to achieve carbon neutrality for all L’Oréal sites in 2019. Now with Japan achieving carbon neutrality for its sites in July 2022, L’Oréal North Asia became the first zone of the L’Oréal Group to achieve carbon neutrality for all the sites the beauty giant operates. The North Asia Zone spans five geographic markets, including: Mainland China, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan. ""With the United Nations warning that every country, city, organisation should adopt plans for net zero – the call to act has seen L’Oréal North Asia Zone rise to the challenge and show true leadership. As a company, we recognized the gravity of the global environmental crisis more than 20 years ago and began reducing our environmental footprint in our manufacturing plants and distribution centers back in 2009. With the launch of our ambitious sustainability commitment in 2020 - L’Oréal for the Future - which states that all L’Oréal sites worldwide must reach carbon neutrality by 2025, the North Asia Zone accelerated its efforts to achieve its goals, which we are immensely proud of,"" said Mr. Fabrice Megarbane, President of L’Oréal North Asia and CEO of L’Oréal China. Mr. Megarbane announced the news at 2022 L’Oréal North Asia & China Indirect Sourcing Supplier Day in Shanghai, where the company brought together around 100 strategic suppliers and key stakeholders to discuss collective efforts and solutions on CO2 emissions reduction. In North Asia, L’Oréal have implemented dynamic measures and a variety of strategic approaches across the different sites that have contributed to the goal of reaching carbon neutrality for each of them. – Generating renewable energy onsite. In both Mainland China and South Korea, CO2 emissions reduction through installing onsite renewable energy generating facilities has been an important contribution to the overall effort.  At L’Oréal’s BeautyCos plant in Suzhou, onsite solar panels have been generating 1.2M kWh of electricity every year since 2015. Similarly, the rooftop solar panels installed at L’Oréal’s distribution centre in Suzhou provided 100% of its 4.4M kWh electricity needs since 2019. – Onsite facilities adopting diverse renewable energy solutions. L’Oréal’s BeautyCos plant is a showcase of how diverse sustainable energy solutions work together to achieve CO2emissions reduction goals.  In addition to its solar power generating system, a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system was built onsite to use biogas to produce steam, electricity and heat with high efficiency. The biogas is generated by a biomass energy project at Suzhou Industrial Park, which uses kitchen and landscaping waste as raw materials for energy generation. Combining solar power generation, CHP system installation and sourcing renewable electricity nearby, BeautyCos achieved carbon neutrality in 2019. – Sourcing local renewable energy in five markets. In addition to having onsite facilities generating renewable energy, L’Oréal sites in North Asia aimed to source local renewable energy. In Mainland China, L’Oréal’s Yichang Tianmei Plant achieved carbon neutrality with 100% use of hydropower in 2018.  Other L’Oréal China offices and campuses adopted solutions to reduce drastically their CO2 emissions through partnerships with a renewable energy project in Jiangsu Province. L’Oréal Korea started participating in Korea’s RE100-system (a global initiative on renewable power) in 2021 and received renewable energy certification from Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) for the energy used across all its offices and distribution centres. In its Japanese plant in Gotemba, L’Oréal has installed new electrical boilers using renewable electricity. L’Oréal Japan met its carbon neutrality goals by participating in the Green Power and Heat Certificates initiative for its research & innovation centre, offices and plant. The initiative sponsors renewable energy generation facilities that are validated by the local authorities that encompass areas such as wind, biomass, hydro, and solar power stations. L’Oréal Taiwan is the first company in the market to channel its renewable energy efforts through Power Purchasing Agreements with local authorities and the landlord of the commercial building where it operates. This enabled the organization to achieve its carbon neutrality status in late 2021. Similarly, L’Oréal Hong Kong site achieved carbon neutrality in 2020 with the implementation of energy efficiency measures the installation of LED lighting to reduce energy consumption and sourcing local renewable electricity for its office. ""From today, in North Asia, each L’Oréal product is produced and stored in plants and warehouses that are carbon neutral. Going forward, we will further collaborate with our stakeholders to reduce CO2 emissions along the entire industry value chain through product innovation and consumer empowerment programs, transportation upgrading and collaboration with strategic suppliers,"" Mr. Pankaj Gupta, SVP of L’Oréal North Asia and China Operations. The L’Oréal Group has set long-term goals to reduce all its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2030 in absolute terms compared to 2016, and aims to reach net zero emissions by 2050. These goals were set in accordance with the Science Based Targets, which aim to limit global warming to 1.5°C, according to climate scientist recommendations, as set by the Paris Agreement."
How to make perfumes enter the Symbiocene age? A study,"According to the two specialists, “perfume is one the most packed products in the world, with a most unfavourable container/content ratio”. In this exclusive study structured in four chapters, Pascale Brousse, founder of the Trend Sourcing Agency, and Gérald Martines, founder of the packaging innovation consulting company In•Signes, provide a multitude of areas of focus and food for thought to reverse the current trend and make this product category enter a new sustainable luxury world. “The study is aimed to offer operational tools that help understand what we can do to improve perfumes’ environmental impact by relying on sociology and drawing inspiration from experiences in related fields,” explains Gérald Martines. As an introduction, Pascale Brousse makes an update on the mindset of this industry, whose players have definitely started to think green. “Today, it is almost suspicious to launch a perfume that does not offer at least one ‘sustainable’ feature. Even the most conventional brands and composition companies have reviewed their offerings accordingly,” she says. However, to her, it is essential to go even further towards a new age called “the Symbiocene” [1], an era of symbiosis with nature, as opposed to the current period sometimes called “Anthropocene”. “The Anthropocene is the geological age when Man acquired the monumental power to modify the very structure of the Earth System, the biosphere, the oceans, the climate… It is a state that cannot be sustained and generates irreversible damage. As a consequence, we should give up on our lifestyle, as predators of natural resources, and enter the Symbiocene age, an era to be invented and where Man would live in symbiosis with Nature,” says Gérald Martines. He also reminds that the most pragmatic eco-design tool is to implement the 3Rs, in the right order: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. “There is actually a fourth R, which stands for Refuse. Consumers are the deciders: if they are not convinced, they will refuse the product,” warns Gérald Martines. To proceed, the study invites companies to broaden their vision beyond the standard model consisting of an alcohol-based juice, a glass bottle and a spray, and imagine new gestures, new galenic forms, and draw inspiration from related fields. “We have already observed many experiments with unconventional galenic forms, packaging, and gestures. Solid perfumes are being reinvented, gels and pencils have emerged… But we need to go further. Right now, there are many new solutions in the skincare category consisting of concentrated formulas to be diluted. Why could it not be considered for perfumes? Perfumes that could be diluted at home? Or In&Out perfumes? The most widely known format still has bright days ahead, but young consumers are very fond of new experiences,” explains Pascale Brousse. “If we mention these different galenic forms, it is because this choice is far from environmentally neutral. Each galenic form goes with a pack and a gesture. These dimensions have a significant influence on the environmental impact,” adds Gérald Martines. Then, the study explores four major themes: lightening, circularity, regeneration, and the Symbiocene. The concept of lightening is related to the sociology of lightness. “This approach should be applied to everything. The bottle, but also the cap, pump, decoration… Some brands no longer use caps, like Escentric Molecules. Floratropia does not use bottles, but pouches…,” explain the experts. The notion of circularity includes reuse and recycling. “Even the notion of ‘flaw’ will change: it will be a differentiating point. The idea is that nothing will be thrown away, everything will have a value. Glassmaking typically generates high waste levels up to over 40%: four bottles out of 10 are thrown away! Sometimes for a tiny visual imperfection without any effect on functionality. This notion of imperfection can be questioned: why could we not consider flaws as singularities that shape the personality and unicity of each bottle?” ask the two specialists. The issue of regeneration is closely related to that of carbon emissions. “In the years to come, we are going to have to focus on restoration and repair. Some makeup brands are already emerging with concepts based on regenerative agroforestry, which consists in working on soils to bring them back to life. It can definitely be an option in the perfume industry,” explains Pascale Brousse. “We also deal with initiatives like Coty’s and L’Oréal’s. They use ethanol or plastic based on captured CO2. It is a step in the right direction. There is a new eco-design strategy which will consist in systematically checking whether resources can be drawn from the waste available, and it even works with CO2,” adds Gérald Martines. Lastly, the study closes with a hoped-for entrance in the Symbiocene age and what a perfume industry in symbiosis with nature would look like…"
Polystyrene-munching superworms could hold key to plastic upcycling,"Scientists at Australia’s University of Queensland have now discovered that superworms — the larvae of Zophobas morio darkling beetles — are able to dine on polystyrene, and their gut enzymes could hold the key to higher recycling rates. Chris Rinke, who led a study that was published last week in the journal Microbial Genomics [1], told AFP previous reports had shown that tiny waxworms and mealworms (which are also beetle larvae) had a good track record when it came to eating plastic, ""so we hypothesized that the much larger superworms can eat even more."" Superworms can grow up to two inches (five centimeters) and are bred as a food source for reptiles and birds, or even for humans in countries such as Thailand and Mexico. Rinke and his team fed superworms different diets over a three week period, with some given polystyrene foam, commonly known as styrofoam, some bran, and others not fed at all. ""We confirmed that superworms can survive on a sole polystyrene diet, and even gain a small amount of weight — compared to a starvation control group — which suggests that the worms can gain energy from eating polystyrene,"" he said. Although the polystyrene-reared superworms completed their life cycle, becoming pupae and then fully developed adult beetles, tests revealed a loss of microbial diversity in their guts and potential pathogens. These findings suggested that while the bugs can survive on polystyrene, it is not a nutritious diet and impacts their health. Next, the team used a technique called metagenomics to analyze the microbial gut community and find which gene-encoded enzymes were involved in degrading the plastic. One way to put the findings to use would be to provide superworms with food waste or agricultural bioproducts to consume alongside polystyrene. ""This could be a way to improve the health of the worms and to deal with the large amount of food waste in Western countries,"" said Rinke. But while breeding more worms for this purpose is possible, he envisages another route: creating recycling plants that mimic what the larvae do, which is to first shred the plastic in their mouths then digest it through bacterial enzymes. ""Ultimately, we want to take the superworms out of the equation,"" he said, and he now plans more research aimed at finding the most efficient enzymes, then enhancing them further through enzyme engineering. The breakdown products by these new generation enzymes could then be fed to other microbes to create high-value compounds, such as bioplastics, in what he hopes would become an economically viable ""upcycling"" approach."
"Global plastic waste on track to triple by 2060, but recycling could help","In the absence of bold new policies, the annual production of fossil-fuel-based plastics is set to top 1.2 billion tonnes by 2060 and waste to exceed one billion tonnes, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Plastic production is expected to grow faster than the one of most raw materials. The growth will be fastest in developing and emerging countries in Africa and Asia, although the 38 OECD members will still produce much more plastic waste per person (238 kg per year on average) in 2060 than non-OECD countries (77 kg). Even with aggressive action to cut demand and improve efficiencies, plastic production would almost double in less than 40 years, the international organisation projects. However, such globally coordinated policies could hugely boost the share of future plastic waste that is recycled, from 12 to 40 percent. “If we want a world that is free of plastic pollution, in line with the ambitions of the United Nations Environment Assembly, we will need to take much more stringent and globally co-ordinated action,” OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said. There is increasing international alarm over volume and omnipresence of plastics pollution, and its impact. Infiltrating the most remote and otherwise pristine regions of the planet, microplastics have been discovered inside fish in the deepest recesses of the ocean and locked inside Arctic ice. The debris is estimated to cause the deaths of more than a million seabirds and over 100,000 marine mammals each year. ""Plastic pollution is one of the great environmental challenges of the 21st century, causing wide-ranging damage to ecosystems and human health,"" Mathias Cormann added. Since the 1950s, roughly 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic have been produced with more than 60 percent of that tossed into landfills, burned or dumped directly into rivers and oceans. Some 460 million tonnes of plastics were used in 2019, twice as much as 20 years earlier. The amount of plastic waste has also nearly doubled, exceeding 350 million tonnes, with less than 10 percent of it recycled. The report contrasts a business-as-usual trajectory with the benefits of more ambitious global policies of reduced plastic use and pollution. Driven by economic growth and an expanding population, plastics production is set to increase under either scenario, the OECD warns. Where policies can make a huge difference is in the handling of waste. The report looks at the impact of two potential scenarios. The first, a regional action scenario comprising a mix of fiscal and regulatory policies primarily in OECD countries could decrease plastic waste by almost a fifth and more than halve plastic leakage into the environment without a substantial impact on global GDP, which would be lower by 0.3% by 2060. The second, a global action scenario comprising more stringent policies implemented worldwide, could decrease plastic waste by a third and almost completely eliminate plastic leakage to the environment while lowering global GDP by an estimated 0.8%. Currently, nearly 100 million tonnes of plastic waste is either mismanaged or allowed to leak into the environment. ""Co-ordinated and ambitious global efforts can almost eliminate plastic pollution by 2060,"" the report concludes. According to the OECD, policies to reduce the environmental impacts of plastics and encourage a more circular use of them should include: taxes on plastics, including on plastic packaging; incentives to reuse and repair plastic items; targets for recycled content in new plastic products; extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes; improved waste management infrastructure; increased litter collection rates. Earlier this year, the United Nations set in motion a process to develop an internationally binding treaty to limit plastic pollution."
Decarbonization: Pochet prepares the future of glass at its Guimerville plant,"A highly energy-consuming process, glass bottle manufacturing has a big environmental footprint, in particular in terms of CO2 emissions. The production of a single 100-ml bottle typically composed of 200 grams of glass in a standard gas furnace (they are the most widely used) would result in 180 grams of CO2 emitted [1]. Committed to reducing its environmental impact, Groupe Pochet has announced the building of a 100% electric furnace in their Guimerville plant. Scheduled for July 2024, the work should be completed by the end of 2024. This new electric furnace is part of the Groupe Pochet’s global decarbonization plan, which aims to reduce its CO2 emissions and fight global warming. Since 2014, the Groupe Pochet has reduced its CO2 emissions by 32% by ton of fired glass vs 2011, in particular thanks to the renovation or reconstruction of several furnaces. The group aims to reach a 50% reduction by 2033. To achieve these goal, Pochet will power the furnace with carbon-free electricity. ""This electric furnace will be the very first French furnace dedicated to luxury bottles. It will enable us to drastically reduce our CO2 emissions by producing a largely carbon-free glass that will guarantee the beauty of tomorrow,"" emphasizes Benoit Marszalek, Pochet du Courval’s Chief Operating Officer. Decarbonization is one of the major challenges for the glass industry. Earlier this year, Verescence also announced the construction of an electric furnace in 2025 in its Mers-les-Bains plant. Another way to reduce the energy consumption of glass production, the use of recycled cullet in the process is also one of the options preferred by Pochet. Using one tonne of cullet saves 1.2 tonnes of raw materials and reduces energy consumption, as cullet is easier to melt than sand. Like all other glassmakers, Pochet already uses its own production scrap in its manufacturing process. Actually, the main challenge is to increase the quantity of post-consumer recycled glass (PCR) without altering the legendary transparency of the glass signed by the company, which will celebrate its 400th anniversary in 2023. To achieve a 15% rate of PCR cullet, Pochet created a sorting loop dedicated to extra-flint glass, in partnership with Sibelco. The reconstruction plan of this furnace comes at a time of boom in demand for Pochet, which also plans new investments to continue the automation and ergonomic improvement of workstations for 2025. More than 400 additional staffs have been recruited at the Guimerville plant over the past year to respond to the increase in activity."
Industrial use of captured carbon could dramatically reduce GHG emissions,"Today, the production of chemicals and derived materials heavily relies on the use of fossil carbon. Industrial processes need hydrocarbons to provide process energy (electricity and heat) and to provide embedded carbon (i.e. the carbon bound in molecular structures) of diverse substances. Beyond fossil hydrocarbons, CO2 capture can also provide a useful source of embedded carbon. Fragrance giant Coty, for instance, recently started manufacturing fragrances using ethanol made from recycled carbon. The company aims to integrate sustainable ethanol into the majority of its fragrance portfolio by 2023 through its partnership with LanzaTech. A pioneer in carbon capture LanzaTech has also joined forces with France’s beauty L’Oréal group and energy giant Total to develop a plastic bottle made with polyethylene derived from captured and recycled carbon emissions. After a successful test, L’Oréal, Total and Lanzatech expect the industrialization phase to be completed by 2024. In an exploratory scenario, the study “CO2 reduction potential of the chemical industry through CCU” [1] investigates the greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions that can be achieved in the global chemical and derived material industries if the entire demand for embedded carbon is met solely and exclusively via CO2 instead of from fossil sources. Major simplifications are used in the study. For instance, methanol (CH3OH) is considered to cover the needs for hydrocarbons for chemicals and derived materials among the various chemical intermediates as a representative pathway for renewable carbon. The examined production route includes CO2 capture as a mix of direct air capture (DAC) and capture from different point sources, hydrogen supply and the hydrogenation reaction for methanol synthesis. The GHG emissions related to CCU-based methanol synthesis depend on the emissions of the renewable energy production. According to the study, emissions of CCU-based methanol could be 67 to 77% lower compared to emissions from releasing embedded carbon of fossil fuels, when using current energy supply based on photovoltaics. With improvements in renewable energy production, the reduction could increase to levels between 96 and 100%. Meeting the annual global demand for carbon embedded in chemicals and derived materials (450 million tonnes of carbon today and maybe 1,000 million tonnes by 2050) with CCU-based methanol would cause an immense demand of renewable energy. Enormous efforts would have to be made to deploy sufficient renewable energy, but the results are worth it. Indeed, with fully decarbonised energy supply, an amount of 3.7 Gt CO2 per year can be saved. “These GHG emission savings are significant - even in comparison to today’s global emissions of 55.6 Gt CO2 eq/year. The result shows that CCU is a promising technology to reduce GHG emissions related to embedded carbon supply - if sufficient renewable energy is available,” said the authors of the study. As a conclusion, while CCU-based carbon could be an important pillar of a future build on renewable carbon, complementing carbon from recycling and from biomass, the production of renewable energies must be rapidly expanded to enable the full deployment of the technology."
Beiersdorf to launch the world’s first skincare product with recycled CO2,"In the wake of Coty, which announced earlier this year they have started producing fragrances using ethanol made from recycled carbon, it is up to the owner of the Nivea, Eucerin, Labello, La Prairie or Chantecaille brands to opt for the carbon capture and utilization (CCU) process. Indeed, the new Nivea Men “Climate Care Moisturizer”, which is scheduled to be launched as a limited edition in Germany in early June 2022, will be the first skin-care product to use an ingredient (ethanol) obtained from recycled carbon dioxide. Exactly as Coty, Beiersdorf uses a carbon dioxide recycling technology that collects industrial emissions. First, the carbon dioxide is collected at specific locations such as industrial chimneys and diverted to a bioreactor, where it is then fermented and processed into a cosmetic ethanol. The Nivea Men “Climate Care Moisturizer”contains a total of 14 percent ethanol that has been obtained through alternative methods. Moreover, the formula is 100 percent free of microplastics, silicones, mineral oils, and PEG/PEG derivatives. This men’s skin care product is manufactured using electricity from 100 percent renewable sources and is climate-neutralized. Indeed, the remaining CO2 emissions linked to the production have been compensated through certified climate projects. Furthermore, the formula is 99 percent biodegradable, with fully recyclable packaging. “This new men’s skin care product with the innovative CO2-recycling technology represents an important milestone for us,” says Jean-Francois Pascal, Vice President Sustainability at Beiersdorf. The group has set itself ambitious carbon-reduction targets, aiming to achieve an absolute decrease of 30 percent of its scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions and 10 percent of its scope 3 emissions group-wide by 2025 (using 2018 as a basis)."
The cosmetics industry joins forces to create a global environmental scoring,"The initiative, which was launched last September by Henkel, L’Oréal, LVMH, Natura &Co, and Unilever, is now taking the form of a new coalition to develop an industry-wide environmental impact assessment and scoring system for cosmetics products. So far, the EcoBeautyScore Consortium gathers 36 small and large companies and associations from four continents [1]. It remains open for other potential members to join. According to its founding members, the purpose of the EcoBeautyScore Consortium is to help consumers to make sustainable choices regarding cosmetic and personal care products. They have therefore started building up an industry-wide scoring system, based on a common science-based methodology, in order to provide consumers with ""clear, transparent, and comparable"" information on the environmental impact of products. The new assessment and scoring system will encompass the formula, packaging and usage of each product. To ensure a robust and scientific approach to co-build an assessment methodology and scoring system, the consortium is working with sustainability consultancy Quantis, who founded the Sustainable Packaging Initiative for CosmEtics (SPICE) together with L’Oréal four years ago. The measurement of environmental impacts throughout the lifecycle of products will be backed by the principles of the “Product Environmental Footprint” (the European Union’s PEF scientific method based on life cycle assessment of products). Common databases on the environmental impact of formula ingredients and packaging materials will also be implemented. The 36 members of the EcoBeautyScore Consortium have aleady started to work together organized in thematic working groups. A footprinting and scoring prototype is targeted for end of 2022, providing the environmental scoring for a selection of product categories at first. It will then be verified by independent parties. The Consortium said it will also consult external experts, including scientists, academics, and NGOs ""to make sure the process is as inclusive as possible."""
Only 9% of plastic recycled worldwide: OECD calling for “global solutions”,"A new report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report [1] found that 460 million tonnes of plastics were used in 2019, the number nearly doubling since 2000. The amount of plastic waste had more than doubled during that time to 353 million tonnes, the Paris-based OECD said. ""After taking into account losses during recycling, only nine percent of plastic waste was ultimately recycled, while 19 percent was incinerated and almost 50 percent went to sanitary landfills,"" it said in its Global Plastics Outlook. ""The remaining 22 percent was disposed of in uncontrolled dumpsites, burned in open pits or leaked into the environment."" Plastic waste generated annually per person varies from 221 kg in the United States and 114 kg in European OECD countries to 69 kg, on average, for Japan and Korea. The Covid-19 pandemic saw the use of plastics drop by 2.2 percent in 2020 compared to the previous year. However single-use plastics rose and overall use is ""projected to pick up again"" as the economy rebounds. Plastics contributed 3.4 percent of global greenhouse emissions in 2019, 90 percent of it from ""production and conversion from fossil fuels"", the report also said. In the face of rampant global warming and pollution, it is ""crucial that countries respond to the challenge with coordinated and global solutions"", OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said in the report. The OECD proposed a series of ""levers"" to address the issue, including developing the market for recycled plastics, which only represent six percent of the total - largely because they are more expensive. Among other actions, the organisation suggests increasing the number of “extended producer responsibility” regulations for waste management, or imposing minimum thresholds for the use of recycled plastic. It added that new technologies related to decreasing the environmental footprint of plastic represented only 1.2 percent of all innovation concerning the product. While calling for ""a more circular plastics lifecycle"", the OECD said that policies must also restrain overall consumption. It also called for ""major investments in basic waste management infrastructure"", including 25 billion euros ($28 billion) a year to go towards efforts in low and middle-income countries. The report comes less than a week before the UN Environment Assembly begins on February 28 in Nairobi, where formal talks are expected to begin on a future international plastics treaty, the scope of which will be discussed. Shardul Agrawala, the head of the OECD’s environment and economy integration division, said Tuesday’s report ""further accentuates the need for countries to come together to start looking towards a global agreement to address this very important problem"". Asked about the priorities of the treaty to be discussed in Nairobi, he said that ""there is an urgent waste management problem which is responsible for the bulk of the leakage to the environment"". ""But we should not limit our focus just to the end of pipe solutions, there is a greater need in the long term to forge international cooperation and agreement towards alignment of standards,"" he told an online press briefing Monday. In a survey published Tuesday by polling firm Ipsos for the World Wildlife Fund, 88 percent of respondents stressed the importance of an international treaty to combat plastic pollution. In the 28 countries surveyed, 23 percent of the respondents said such a treaty was ""fairly important"", 31 percent said it was ""very important"" and 34 percent found it ""essential"". Awareness level ranges from 96% in Mexico or 95% in China, to 78% in the United States and 70% in Japan."
"Plastic, chemical pollution beyond planet’s safe limit: study","There are an estimated 350,000 different manufactured chemicals on the market and large volumes of them end up in the environment. ""The impacts that we’re starting to see today are large enough to be impacting crucial functions of planet Earth and its systems"", Bethanie Carney Almroth, co-author of a new study told AFP in an interview. The study, by the Stockholm Resilience Centre, comes ahead of a UN meeting in Nairobi at the end of the month on tackling plastic pollution ""from source to sea"", UN Environment Programme head Inger Andersen said on Monday. Chemicals and plastics are affecting biodiversity, piling additional stress on already stressed ecosystems. Pesticides kill living organisms indiscriminately and plastics are ingested by living things. ""Some chemicals are interfering with hormone systems, disrupting growth, metabolism and reproduction in wildlife,"" Carney Almroth said. While greater efforts are needed to prevent these substances being released into the environment, scientists are now pushing for more drastic solutions, such as production caps. In particular as recycling has so far yielded only mediocre results. Less than 10 percent of the world’s plastic is currently recycled, even as production has doubled to 367 million tonnes since 2000. Today, the total weight of plastic on Earth is now four times the biomass of all living animals, according to recent studies. ""What we’re trying to say is that maybe we have to say, ’Enough is enough’. Maybe we can’t tolerate more,"" the Sweden-based researcher said. ""Maybe we have to put a cap on production. Maybe we need to say, ’We can’t produce more than this’."" For several years, the Stockholm Resilience Centre has been conducting studies on ""planetary boundaries"" in nine areas that influence Earth’s stability, such as greenhouse gas emissions, freshwater usage and the ozone layer. The aim is to determine if mankind is in a ""safe operating space"" or if the limits are being exceeded and threaten the future of the planet. The impact of so-called ""novel entities"" - or man-made chemical products such as plastics, antibiotics, pesticides, and non-natural metals - has until now been a big question. And the answer is complex. ""We are only beginning to understand the large-scale, long-term effects of these exposures,"" Carney Almroth said. Not only are there thousands of these products but the data on the risks they pose is often non-existent or classified as corporate secrets. Additionally, the chemicals are relatively recent, most of them developed in the past 70 years. “And we’re talking about 350,000 different substances,” Carney Almroth said. ""We don’t have knowledge on the vast majority of those, in terms of how much are produced or their stability. Or their fate in the environment or their toxicity. We know what some of them are. For most of them, we have no clue,” she added. Even the most comprehensive databases, such as the European Union’s REACH inventory, only cover 150,000 products, and only a third of those have been the subject of detailed toxicity studies. As a result, the team of researchers focused on what is known, and this partial information was enough to draw an alarming conclusion. ""Looking at changes over time and trends in production volumes lost in the environment ... and connecting that to the little bit we do know about impacts, we could say that every arrow is pointing in the wrong direction"", Carney Almroth said. There is still ""time to revert this situation"" but it will take ""urgent and ambitious actions ... at an international level"", she added. Furthermore, there’s no ‘silver bullet’. ""No one answer is going to solve all of this, because a lot of these chemicals and materials are things that we use and that are necessary for our lives as of right now,"" Carney Almroth explained. Regardless of how much effort is made during the production or waste management phase, production volumes need to come down, she stressed. ""This seems very obvious to say but it’s only recently accepted as truth: The more you produce, the more you release""."
Decarbonization: Verescence launches the electrification of its glass furnaces,"Verescence has unveiled the first steps of its decarbonization roadmap, which should enable the group to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 40% by 2034 for scopes 1 (direct emissions) and 2 (emissions related to energies). The glassmaker has announced the electrification of its furnaces around the world, starting with the Furnace 1 at the Mers-les-Bains plant in France. This initiative is part of Verescence’s commitment in 2020 to setting a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target by 2022 aligned with the trajectory of the so-called “well-below 2° Celsius” scenario proposed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Its aim is to set targets that are consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. “I’m pleased to announce this major development which will allow us to decrease by half our CO2 emissions in less than 10 years in France and bring us even closer to our zero-carbon ambition by 2050. Our new electric furnace 1 on which we have been working for more than a year will be the Group’s pilot furnace,” said Hélène Marchand, General Manager France. Verescence had already committed in 2020 to the R&D project VERCANE (carbon-neutral glass), supported by the French Agency for Ecological Transition (ADEME), aimed at identifying the different energy sources capable of powering glass production in a sustainable way, including electricity. At the time of its reconstruction in 2025, an operation that is required every 15 to 20 years, Furnace 1 at the Mers-les-Bains plant in France will be fully electrified and will be the group’s first furnace to use this technology. Verescence should then carry out the gradual electrification of its other melting furnaces in France, Spain, the United States and South Korea, a key step towards achieving the group’s objective of reducing its emissions by 40% by 2034. Praised for being indefinitely recyclable, it still requires high energy consumption during the manufacturing phase. The environmental footprint is considerable, in particular in terms of CO2 emissions. Various eco-design techniques already contribute to reducing the energetic content of glass bottles. A pioneer in premium recycled glass for luxury bottles (with the launch of the iconic Verre Infini, in 2008), Verescence announced in November that Infini 20, which contains 20% recycled cullet, would now be its standard glass composition produced by all the group’s pants around the world. Since its melting temperature is lower than that of raw materials, it is estimated that using recycled glass during the manufacturing phase allows to reduce emissions by 2.5% for every 10%. For brands wishing to go further in eco-design, Verescence therefore offers Infini 40, a second version of its Verre Infini that contains 40% recycled glass. Verescence has been ranked among the best performing companies in the EcoVadis assessment for three years now and announced last December that it had obtained an A score from CDP for tackling water security and an A- for leading effort against climate change. Note that between 2016 and 2019 Verescence had reduced its emissions by 10%."
Coty starts production of fragrances made using carbon-captured ethanol,"Mid-January, Coty has begun production of fragrances made using LanzaTech carbon-captured ethanol in its Granollers manufacturing facility in Spain. The first Coty fragrances made using this new ethanol will reach stores in the coming months. Coty said to be ahead of schedule on its goal to integrate sustainable ethanol into a majority of its fragrance portfolio by 2023, including Calvin Klein, Burberry, Boss, Gucci, Chloé, Marc Jacobs Perfume, etc. The beauty group is making these fragrances using CarbonSmart, an ethanol produced by LanzaTech by capturing carbon emitted by industrial activity before it is released to the atmosphere. Collected through an electrolysis process, carbon dioxide is then cleaned-up before being transformed into ethanol through fermentation. Ethyl alcohol is a key ingredient in most fragrances where it is used - in concentrations up to 96% - as a support to the perfuming concentrate. Logically, ethanol is Coty’s top fragrance ingredient by volume. By transforming carbon into a new source of ethanol, Coty and LanzaTech aim to move forward towards reducing the beauty industry’s environmental impact. Indeed, carbon-captured ethanol involves nearly zero water consumption and reduces the need for agricultural land. An independent analysis conducted by sustainability consultancy Quantis has shown a significantly reduced overall environmental footprint. In particular, LanzaTech’s CarbonSmart helps Coty to reduce its carbon emissions related to fragrance production. “Fragrances made using carbon-captured ethanol represents the ground-breaking sustainability progress that I joined Coty to lead,” said Dr. Shimei Fan, who was appointed as the group’s Chief Scientific Officer on January. Coty says the ethanol produced by LanzaTech meets the group’s strict specifications for use in perfumery and is very much in line with other high quality ethyl alcohols found in the market. “LanzaTech is proud to have made our first delivery of carbon-captured ethanol to Coty ahead of schedule,” said Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, Chief Executive Officer of LanzaTech. “After two years of working side by side with Coty scientists to develop a high-purity ethanol suitable for use in fine fragrances, we are excited to see Coty bring the first globally distributed fragrances made from CarbonSmart ethanol to market, so consumers can choose products made from recycled carbon.” Beyond this captured-carbon ethanol project, LanzaTech has also joined forces with France’s beauty L’Oréal group and energy giant Total to develop a plastic bottle made with polyethylene derived from captured and recycled carbon emissions. After a successful test, L’Oréal, Total and Lanzatech expect the industrialization phase to be completed by 2024."
Plastics recycling: Eastman and Loop to invest in new facilities in France,"Major investments are under way to bring the consumer goods industry into the circular economy era. Eastman and Loop Industries have just announced new investments that are expected to significantly increase plastic packaging recycling capacity in Europe. Global specialty materials producer Eastman plans to invest up to USD 1 billion in a material-to-material molecular recycling facility in France. This facility would use Eastman’s polyester renewal technology to recycle up to 160,000 metric tons annually of hard-to-recycle plastic waste that is currently being incinerated. According to Eastman, the investment would recycle enough plastic waste annually to fill Stade de France national football stadium 2.5 times, while also creating virgin-quality material with a significantly lower carbon footprint. Eastman also plans to establish an innovation center for molecular recycling that would enable France to sustain a leadership role in the circular economy. This innovation center would advance alternative recycling methods and applications to curb plastic waste incineration and leave fossil feedstock in the ground. The plant and innovation center - whose location has yet to be decided - are expected to be operational by 2025, creating employment for approximately 350 people and leading to an additional 1,500 indirect jobs in recycling, energy and infrastructure. Eastman’s project has also garnered support from numerous brands, including: LVMH Beauty, The Estée Lauder Companies, Clarins, Procter & Gamble, L’Oréal and Danone are leading the way by signing letters of intent for multiyear supply agreements from this facility. For its part, the Canadian group Loop Industries, which specializes in the production of 100% recycled PET [1] plastic, is investing in its first European Infinite Loop manufacturing facility, in partnership with French environmental services group Suez. The two companies have selected a 130,000 m² parcel of land in the region of Normandy in Northern France. The capital investment required for the project is expected to be EUR 250 million. Construction of the facility is expected to begin in 2023, with commissioning approximately 18 months later. The new facility is designed to produce 70,000 tons of PET resin made from 100% recycled content per year. It will provide an opportunity for global CPG brands based in France to gain access to locally produced virgin-quality PET plastic and polyester fiber made entirely from waste material. At full capacity, the facility is projected to save over 255,000 tons of CO2 annually, when compared to virgin PET resin made from fossil fuels. “The majority of the incoming waste plastic feedstock for the facility is currently not recycled and contributes to the waste plastic pollution problem,” said Loop Industries in a statement. “We are very pleased to know that Loop technology will soon be available in France to supply recycled PET plastic for our products,” said Jacques Playe, Head of Packaging & Development at L’Oréal. Loop client and international cosmetics brand L’Occitane en Provence also voiced its support of the project. “This new Loop Industries plant in France will enable us access to locally sourced, 100% recycled PET plastic. The innovative technology they provide is a game-changer that can help us fundamentally contribute to solving the growing global concern about plastic pollution,” stated David Bayard, R&D Packaging Director at L’Occitane."
"United States is world’s biggest plastic polluter, report finds","Overall, the US contributed around 42 million metric tons (MMT) in plastic waste in 2016 — more than twice as much as China and more than the countries of the European Union combined, unveiled a recent report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. [1] On average, every American generates 130 kilograms (286 pounds) of plastic waste per year, with Britain next on the list at 99 kilos per person per year, followed by South Korea at 88 kilos per year. According to Margaret Spring, chief science officer of Monterey Bay Aquarium, who chaired the committee of experts that compiled the report, the success of plastics in the 20th century has produced “a global scale deluge of plastic waste.” She added global plastic waste was an ""environmental and social crisis"" that impacted inland and coastal communities, polluted rivers, lakes and beaches, and placed economic burdens on communities, endangered wildlife and contaminated waters that humans depend on for food. Global plastic production rose from 20 million metric tons in 1966 to 381 million metric tons in 2015, a 20-fold increase over half a century, the report said. It is now known that almost any plastic on land has the potential to reach the oceans via rivers and streams, the report added. An estimated 8 million metric tons of plastic waste enters the world annually, ""the equivalent of dumping a garbage truck of plastic waste into the ocean every minute."" At the current rate, the amount of plastics discharged into the ocean could reach up to 53 million metric tons per year by 2030, roughly half of the total weight of fish caught from the ocean annually, it said. The report says today’s recycling processes and infrastructure are grossly insufficient to manage the complexity and quantity of plastic waste produced, and that a large portion of plastic waste is disposed of in landfills. Part of the reason is that while the generation of plastic waste has exploded, particularly since 1980, the scale of recycling capabilities has not kept up. The report recommends the U.S. establish a coherent and comprehensive federal policy and research strategy by the end of 2022, to reduce its contribution of plastic waste to the environment and ocean. The suggested actions to address the crisis include reducing virgin plastic production, for example by establishing a national cap, using materials that degrade more quickly and are more easily recycled, the reduction of certain single-use plastics, and improved waste management."
CTPA urges the beauty industry to move forward to end packaging waste,"“While the cosmetics industry is working towards reducing or removing unnecessary packaging, and the adoption of reuse and refill models where appropriate, the challenge of certain types of cosmetic packaging not being recycled must be addressed,” said CTPA [1] in a call to action about packaging waste. The organisation considers that, as far as cosmetic packaging is concerned, the ultimate goal of the industry should be that none ends up as waste. To discuss the issue, CTPA held a stakeholder roundtable on Monday 15 November 2021. The meeting was attended by industry representatives, Resources and Waste Minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), Jo Churchill, Defra officials, representatives from WRAP UK, a charity which works with governments, businesses and individuals to promote sustainability, OPRL, an NGO that aims to encourage packaging reuse and material recycling, the Flexible Plastic Fund and Terracycle. Take-back schemes, refill and reuse systems and dedicated collection points emerged as key topics during the discussion. The CTPA recognised that these models should exist on a larger, industry-wide scale to increase awareness and recover more packaging. “As an industry we have to recognise that a lot of our packaging is not recycled, so the onus is on us to be responsible and develop solutions to reduce the amount of waste. Take-back schemes could be a major step in helping to achieve this and there was huge appetite at the roundtable to drive this forward,” said Dr Emma Meredith, Director-General of CTPA. In light of the conclusions made at the roundtable, the CTPA joined forces with the Recycle Now team at WRAP to add information on how to recycle cosmetics packaging to its Recycling Locator tool. The digital platform helps consumers to locate nearby recycling stations in order to dispose of their beauty items in the most effective way. The aim is to increase the number of cosmetic brands that are highlighting this opportunity to their consumers. “For citizens any recycling scheme needs to be easy to use, they need to be motivated to use it and they need to know where to recycle. We are very pleased to be supporting citizens to do this through our Recycling Locator and working with the CTPA to increase awareness of the take back schemes currently available,” said Sarah Clayton, Head of Citizen Behaviour Change at WRAP UK. The Recycling Locator Tool is already up and running with brands adding the locations for their schemes. However, Clayton highlighted that instore take back schemes can only go so far in helping to avoid packaging going to landfill. “Reuse and refill options, eliminating packaging where it is not necessary as well as more packaging that uses widely recyclable materials are all key steps that need further future investigation in order to move towards a sustainable circular economy,” she added. Resources and Waste Minister at Defra, Jo Churchill, meanwhile, said that: “All sectors of the economy are now changing how they design their products and I am looking forward to the cosmetics industry leading the way and driving further innovation in their ambition to cut waste.”"
‘Carbon negative’ plastic AirCarbon sparks the interest of luxury brands,"Last year, L’Oréal has teamed up with carbon recycling company biotech LanzaTech and fuel company Total to produce the first cosmetic plastic bottle made from industrial carbon emissions. Today, the scope of possibilities continues to widen for applications intended to reduce the carbon footprint of consumer goods. Designing carbon-neutral clothing and accessories no longer belongs simply to the realm of science fiction. In fact, now, with just a few clicks on the web, it is possible to buy glasses, bags, and sleeves for smartphones and laptops that are made from greenhouse gases! AirCarbon: that’s the name given to this carbon-negative biomaterial that California start-up Newlight Technologies developed over more than a decade. It is produced by naturally occurring microorganisms in the ocean — now also found in large tanks filled with salt water mixed with methane in the company’s factory — that feed primarily on air and greenhouse gases, converted in their cells into polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). It is this biodegradable polymer, ""a material made by life that bonds us to the natural world,"" that is now being used to make luxury accessories under the name AirCarbon. The start-up specifies that the biomaterial can be melted and then cooled, opening the door to infinite possibilities for making fibres, sheet, or even solid parts. AirCarbon could replace synthetic plastic and animal leather, and be recycled endlessly. Fashion giants are paying attention to this innovation; Nike concluded a partnership with Newlight Technologies at the end of August to explore ""the use of AirCarbon in a variety of applications"" in order to reduce its carbon footprint while continuing to offer technical products to consumers. A collaboration that could quickly give rise to carbon-neutral accessories, even sneakers, neutral, made from this new biomaterial, and stamped with the famous swoosh. But Newlight Technologies does not simply sell their biodegradable polymer to fashion brands or manufacturers. The company’s strength also lies in its ability to offer its own accessories made from AirCarbon. Through its Covalent brand, Newlight Technologies retails carbon-neutral sunglasses, tote bags, purses, small leather goods, and smartphone and laptop pouches. The brand makes all the information related to the carbon footprint of the products and their manufacture available to the public. For example, the Poppy tote bag, handmade in California, was designed from 51% AirCarbon, 14% bio-derived materials and 35% synthetic ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA). A product with a negative carbon footprint, the bag would have diverted 16.7 kilograms of CO2 equivalent from the air through its manufacture. However, being kind to our planet will require spending 480 dollars (approximately 413 euros). This new material adds to an already rich list of innovative and environmentally friendly materials intended to replace oil-based plastics. However, it provides an additional benefit as it could allow several industries to significantly reduce their environmental footprint."
Five cosmetics giants team up to create environmental scoring system,"The five multinationals say their aim is to meet growing consumer demand for greater transparency about the environmental impact of cosmetics products (formula, packaging and usage), thus helping consumers to make more sustainable consumption choices. The harmonized scoring system could, for example, use a score ranging from A to E. The new consortium will be open to all cosmetics companies wishing to join and contribute to designing a system that allows consumers to compare cosmetics products within the same category. The ambition is for the overall score to inform consumers of the environmental impact of products, taking into account their whole product life cycle. Sustainability consultancy Quantis, which launched the Sustainable Packaging Initiative for CosmEtics (SPICE) in 2018, should lead the project to ensure a robust and scientific approach. The assessment of environmental impacts throughout the life cycle of products, will be backed by the principles of the “Product Environmental Footprint” (the European Union’s PEF scientific method for quantifying the environmental footprint of products). Furthermore, a common database of environmental impacts of standard ingredients and raw materials used in formulas and packaging, as well as during product usage, will need to be created. This global initiative is intended to be open to all cosmetics companies, regardless of their size or resources. The convening five companies will pool their experience and knowledge in developing environmental impact assessment methodologies (as is the case for Henkel, LVMH, Natura &Co, and Unilever) and an environmental and social labelling system (as developed by L’Oréal). “All companies will benefit from this pre-existing work and are invited to contribute their own experience,” said the five groups in a statement. The work developed by the consortium will be published and made accessible on a strictly voluntary basis by both consortium participants and all other interested parties. Cosmetics Europe has been actively following the process. For several years, companies or NGOs have tried to launch environmental scoring systems for cosmetic products, but these initiatives are based on various methodologies making comparisons difficult. The approach of the giants of the sector could thus impose itself rather quickly."
ReBubble: new life for used soap and jobs for disabled workers,"In Aachen, Germany, students collect hotel soaps and recycle them with the help of workers with disabilities to produce new, sustainable and solidarity-based soaps. Each second, 300 soaps from hotels are thrown away in the world, which equals about 950 million soaps going to the incinerator each year, whereas they are barely used. In order to fight against this waste, the Rebubble project proposes a second life to these soaps. Thanks to a partnership between four big hospitality groups, the voluntary students who created RBbubble organize the collection of used soaps. They are then sent to a working center who partners the project, where people with disabilities recycle the soaps: they are chipped, cooked and cast to create new ones. The soap production is then sold locally. This soap recycling process is made up of simple gestures, designed to be inclusive and accessible to everyone. Recycling hotel soaps has an ecological dimension, allowing big hotels to reduce their carbon footprint and it also has a social utility, allowing people with disabilities to access a fairly paid work."
Long-term ingestion of microplastic harms growth and reproduction in fish,"The world’s fish are increasingly threatened by microplastics that pollute seas, lakes and oceans. Published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials [1], this new research was conducted by scientists from France’s INRAE, IFREMER, and the universities of Bordeaux (France) and Orebrö (Sweden). The study focused on two specific fish species: the so-called zebrafish (Danio rerio), which lives in freshwater, and the marine medaka (Oryzias latipes), which, as its name suggests, lives in saltwater. The health of these two species of fish was studied over a four-month period. The objective was to determine the adverse effects of chronic ingestion of plastic microparticles by these fish. The researchers focused on polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microplastics, which are among the most common materials used to make plastic packaging and objects. The researchers found a 20-35% reduction in size and weight in both fish species, regardless of the type of plastic ingested. ""These effects were considerably greater after four months than after two, which highlights how essential it is to conduct long-term studies when assessing the toxicity of microplastics,"" note the scientists, who also note a more marked reduction in growth in females, ""probably due to their greater energy needs during reproduction compared with those of males."" In the long term, the ingestion of plastic particles could also decrease the reproduction rates of these fish by up to 50%. This risk was found to vary significantly depending on the duration of exposure, the type of plastic ingested, the presence of associated organic pollutants and the fish species studied. In zebrafish, combined exposure to PVC-BaP and PVC-BP3, for example, leads to a delay in the onset of spawning, while exposure to PE-BP3 (as well as to all PVCs) - whether untreated or carrying pollutants - leads to a decrease in the number of eggs laid. In marine medaka, exposure to almost all microplastics induces a delay in the onset of spawning and a decrease in the number of eggs produced by females. Exposure to PVC-BP3 also causes behavioural problems in the larval offspring, the study says. ""These results provide stark evidence of problems in both growth and reproduction for fish exposed to microplastics over extended periods, potentially leading to serious failures in the functioning of ecosystems,"" explain the study authors. ""This understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the biological disturbances caused by microplastics will enable us to assess the extent to which these effects can be extrapolated to all microplastic types, making it possible, for example, to prioritize the regulation of emissions,"" the scientists conclude."
Thailand’s marine national parks ban sunscreens suspected to damage corals,"Thailand’s sandy beaches have long been popular destinations for millions of tourists but concerns are growing that the lotions they use as protection from the tropical sun are harming delicate, slow-growing corals. An order came into force on August 4th banning sun lotions containing substances that could have a harmful effect on coral reefs from the kingdom’s marine national parks. The banned sunscreens are those containing oxybenzone, octinoxate, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor, which are usually used as UV filters, and butylparaben, that is used as a preservative or as a fragrance. These substances are suspected to be endocrine disruptors and to affect the development of corals, even in small quantities. Thai authorities said available scientific data showed these chemicals ""deteriorate coral reefs, destroy coral larvae, obstruct their reproductive system and cause coral reef bleaching."" While officials have not said how they plan to enforce the new rule, violators would face a fine of up to 100,000 Thai baht (about USD 3,000 or EUR 2,530). Thailand is not the first country to introduce such a ban. On January 1, 2020, the Pacific island of Palau banned the sale and import of sun products containing 11 components deemed toxic to the environment. In 2018, the State of Hawaii also announced its intention to ban oxybenzone and octinoxate from sun lotions marketed on the islands. This measure has been applied since January 1st, 2021. Since an initial alert in 2008, several studies have highlighted that certain substances contained in sunscreens could have a negative impact on marine species. For instance, a research published in 2015 showed that oxybenzone could be harmful to coral reefs by accelerating the bleaching of corals and threatening their resilience in front of climate change. [1] In France, as part of the “Mission Océans” launched in 2018, the Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) was charged to carry out an inventory of the chemical substances that are particularly toxic for marine ecosystems and coral reefs while being present in consumer products such as cosmetics, sunscreens or detergents. However, the impact of sunscreens on coral reefs is denied by a part of the industry which considers that global warming is the main cause of the poor health of corals. However, products claiming to protect the skin from the sun while preserving the oceans are increasingly available on the market. And to help consumers that do not want to harm oceans, US-based Haereticus Environmental Laboratory publishes a list of eco-responsible sunscreens every year."
"Hair today, green tomorrow: UK stylists join eco-drive","At an east London salon, Fry Taylor, one of the founders of the Green Salon Collective, demonstrates spare hair being used in depolluting filters. He shows how a cotton net stuffed with hair, swept across the surface of a tank of water contaminated with motor oil, instantly cleans up the pollutant. ""The hair just naturally will absorb the oil and hold on to the oil, that’s the important factor,"" Taylor, a former hairdresser, told AFP. A kilo of hair can absorb up to eight litres (two gallons) of oil, according to experts. The idea of using hair filters originated in the United States and has already been tested in real disasters, such as when a Japanese tanker sank off the coast of Mauritius a year ago. Britain was lagging behind in recycling unwanted hair when the collective formed last summer, according to Taylor. ""There are, in other countries around the world, recycling systems for hairdressing salons,"" he said. ""In the UK and Ireland, they just don’t have the infrastructure. We’re not going to wait another five or 10 years for governments and councils to have these systems in place, let’s just do it ourselves,"" he added. The waste produced by the hairdressing industry in the UK each year could fill 50 football stadiums, the collective said. Most rubbish, including aluminium foil, coloured tubes and 99 percent of cut hair, is sent to a landfill site, it added. Another big problem is chemical waste such as dyes and bleaches. ""There are currently approximately 30,000 salons and another 100,000 freelancers,"" who are pouring hydrogen peroxide and ammonia into water systems, Taylor said. The collective is encouraging salons to save these products in a small bin, which it then collects and sends to a facility to produce electricity. Hair stylist Adam Reed, who owns a salon in London’s trendy Spitalfields neighbourhood, is a recent convert to the recycling mission and proudly explains his system to customers. Saying he was ""blown away"" by what the Green Salon Collective had taught him, the internationally-renowned hairdresser added he ""didn’t quite realise the enormity of it"" beforehand. ""It made me realise that sustainability in salons is something that had been missing and it’s really easy to bring into the salon,"" he said. ""We have our bins, all labelled, so it’s easy to navigate."" Hair, protective equipment, metals, papers and plastics each have their own bin. The salon, which pays a £120-fee ($192, 140 euros) to be a member of the collective, also recycles leftover dye product. Reed charges clients a ""green tax"" of one or two pounds, and has so far received a ""very positive response"". Composting is another green use of hair, whose rich nitrogen content makes it an ideal fertiliser supplement. Collective member Ryan Crawford, owner of a salon in the town of Milton Keynes, northwest of London, has experimented with hair on his vegetables in the garden. On a sunny July day, he showed AFP two young cabbage shoots: one, surrounded by hair, is intact; the other, planted without hair, is skeletal and gnawed. ""It’s like a protective barrier around the base of the new seedlings,"" he said. ""It’s definitely worked keeping things like slugs or snails off,"" he added, saying that putting hair directly into the soil also helps retain moisture and acts as ""a super-food for the earth,"" replenishing nitrogen levels. Over the last year, around 600 salons in the UK and Ireland have joined the collective, which has amassed around 500 kilos of hair. It has been used to clean up waterways, an oil spill in Northern Ireland in May and for composting. The collective has also gathered 3.5 tonnes of metal, which is being recycled. It now hopes to export the model on a large scale across Europe."
L’Oréal unveils cosmetic bottles made from Carbios’ enzymatic recycling process,"This new-generation cosmetic bottle is the first one designed in plastic entirely recycled thanks to Carbios’ enzymatic technology, which is suitable for all types of PET - clear, coloured, opaque and multilayer - and makes these plastics infinitely recyclable. Until now, existing mechanical recycling processes have not been able to recover all polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste, which is one of the most common plastics in consumer goods. Carbios explains that ""only clear plastic [could] be recycled in closed loops, with a loss of quality in each cycle, making it difficult to obtain new products from 100% recycled PET.” A problem the French company’s enzymatic technology is now able to solve. “Our innovation allows infinite recycling of all types of PET waste as well as the production of 100% recycled and 100% recyclable PET products, without loss of quality."" Furthermore, this can be achieved at high speed: breaking down 97% of plastic in just 16 hours, that is to say10,000 times more efficient than any biological plastic recycling trial to date. After four years of close collaboration with L’Oréal to develop this technology — as well as with Nestlé Waters, PepsiCo and Suntory Beverage & Food Europe - capacities of the new recycling process are being scaled up. Biotherm could be the first brand of the French group to launch a product in this bottle, with the production launch currently scheduled for 2025. ""We have been working with Carbios since 2017 to develop this first bottle made from PET derived from enzymatic recycling technology, an alternative to mechanical recycling. We are pleased to announce today the feasibility of these bottles in a pilot phase and are delighted to be in a position to create the packaging of the future with our partners. This is a promising innovation for the years to come that demonstrates our commitment to bring to market more environmentally friendly packaging and which is part of a circularity initiative begun more than 15 years ago,"" said Jacques Playe, L’Oréal’s Global Head of Packaging and Product Development. Note that this technology has been used to create other sample bottles for everyday products. Perrier, Pepsi Max and Orangina may also soon offer new packaging for some of their iconic products. This innovation should help L’Oréal achieve its objectives set out in its ""L’Oréal for the Future"" sustainability program. These include achieving 100% refillable, reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging by 2025, and 100% recycled or biobased plastic packaging by 2030. To achieve these objectives, L’Oréal is working with a number of strategic partners, giving it access to the best technologies. As well as Carbios, L’Oréal is collaborating with Albéa, the global leader in beauty packaging, with whom the Group developed the first cosmetic tube including FSC-certified carton in 2019, Purecycle, for the production of solvolysis-recycled polypropylene (PP), and LanzaTech and Total, with whom, in October 2020, L’Oréal announced a world first: the production of a polyethylene (PE) cosmetic bottle made from recycled industrial carbon emissions."
Unilever to launch its first paper-based detergent bottle,"A prototype of the first-ever paper-based laundry detergent bottle has been made for Unilever’s OMO brand (also known as Persil, Skip and Breeze) and is supposed and is set to debut in Brazil by early 2022, with an ambition for roll-out in Europe and other countries soon after. Unilever says they are also piloting the same technology to create paper-based hair care bottles. The bottle is made of sustainably sourced cellulosic pulp and designed to be recycled in the paper waste stream. It is sprayed inside with a proprietary coating that repels water, enabling the paper-based packaging material to hold liquid products like laundry detergent, shampoo and conditioners, which contain surfactants, fragrances and other active ingredients. Creating recyclable, paper-based packaging without additional plastic layers is a huge challenge. According to Unilever, Pulpex’s patented packaging provides a promising solution to radically reduce the use of plastic. “To tackle plastic waste, we need to completely rethink how we design and package products. This requires a drastic change that can only be achieved through industry-wide collaboration,"" said Richard Slater, Unilever Chief R&D Officer. As consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the impact of products on the planet, Unilever relies on the Pulpex paper-based bottle technology to achieve their goal to halve their use of virgin plastic materials by 2025. A few paper-based packaging solutions are already on the market: the bottles made by Ecologic Brands for Seed Phytonutrients, or the tubes made by Albéa for La Roche Posay and Garnier. However, these solutions contain significant parts of plastics and are not always easy to recycle. The solution developed by Pulpex therefore represents a significant step forward. Large-scale production of paper bottles is in preparation, with Finnish papermaker Stora Enso having started to supply Pulpex with the necessary materials. This should help Diageo to keep its commitment to launch a paper bottle for its Johnnie Walker brand this year, and Unilever to apply this technology to its detergents by 2022, before moving on to shampoos. Recently, the Paboco consortium, which gathers companies such as BillerudKorsnäs, Alpla, Carlsberg, The Absolut Company (Pernod-Ricard), L’Oréal and Coca-Cola Europe, also presented its prototype of a paper bottle with a bio-based inner coating. A project to keep on the radar!"
Pierre Fabre Group looks to boost transparency with environmental rating,"To meet the demand for transparency with regard to cosmetic products, the French-based group has chosen a very simple tool based on grades from A to D. This ‘Green Impact Index’ was designed to easily inform consumers about the environmental and societal impact of the group’s various cosmetic brands. Pierre Fabre’s Green Impact Index has been used internally for already two years to guarantee the ""eco-socio-design"" (grade A or B) of the group’s new cosmetics. Precisely, in addition to informing consumers, the Green Impact Index should also enable Pierre Fabre to improve the eco-societal profile of its products, in line with the aim of ensuring that half of its portfolio is eco-socio-designed by 2023. The new tool was built using the 3,000 Life-Cycle Analyses (LCAs) that the Group has conducted for over 10 years. It is based on the evaluation of 20 criteria: 14 environmental impact criteria (including the eco-design of the packaging, the eco-design of the formula, the impact of the manufacturing of the product and the transportation of raw materials, etc.), representing two thirds of the final score, and 6 societal impact criteria (including Made in France, Bio, Fair Trade, France Guaranteed Origin and Vegan certifications or labeling, as well as the brand’s corporate social responsibility programs. These 6 criteria represent one third of the final score. To ensure the reliability and validity of their rating system, Pierre Fabre has entrusted AFNOR Certification, an independent third-party organization, “to conduct an annual audit to verify and guarantee the reliability of the ratings carried out by Pierre Fabre on its products.” For the time being, the scores of certain products are available online, spanning the Pierre Fabre brands Avène, A-Derma, Ducray, Klorane, René Furterer, Naturactive, Elgydium and Arthrodont, and products ranging from face and body creams to shampoos, shower gels and toothpaste, not to mention essential oils and nutritional supplements. The aim now is to regularly add scores for new products, adding them directly to brand websites in the coming months. ""The Green Impact Index is a response to the growing distrust on the part of consumers and patients when it comes to brands and their ability to respect the environment, demonstrate corporate social responsibility and communicate information on these subjects in a transparent and verifiable manner.... For the first time, consumers will be able to choose a cosmetic or family health product with full knowledge of its eco-societal impact and with the assurance of reliable and detailed information, in a simple and straightforward manner,"" said Éric Ducournau, CEO of the Pierre Fabre Group in a statement."
Toward a zero-waste beauty routine?,"The transition is undoubtedly underway, the figures show that consumers have already started to remove all unnecessary products from their bathrooms to embrace a cleaner beauty routine with natural fibres, solid cosmetics, and washable, reusable accessories. While its far from being a magical solution, reducing waste production first requires to recycle, or upcycle, packaging or to degrade them biologically. It is on these issues that cosmetic brands are now focusing their research, and some have already begun to provide innovative solutions. Juni Cosmetics is one of the brands that have gone big on recycling. Founded by makeup artist Madeleine White, the brand worked with designers to eliminate plastic from its beauty products. The result is a capsule collection of high-end lipsticks (""Luxury Hydrating Lipstick"") with strong moisturizing power, formulated with organic oils, vitamin E and plant hyaluronic acid, whose tubes are made entirely of aluminum, therefore fully recyclable. Note that the entire lipstick tube is made of aluminum, including the mechanism’s cogs, giving consumers the option to recycle the product without having to disassemble it. Certified vegan, the lipstick contains only organic and sustainably sourced ingredients. In the same vein, the brand Izzy Zero Waste Beauty has introduced the world’s first reusable and recyclable mascara, which therefore generates no waste. Made of a stainless steel tube, ""Zero Waste Mascara"" is delivered without any packaging in reusable envelopes made from recycled materials. A subscription service allows consumers the possibility to receive a new sterilized and filled mascara every three months, accompanied by a prepaid envelope to return the previous mascara which will be completely cleaned and refilled for a second life. Initially specializing in sustainable writing tools, Danish company Sprout World has also taken a step towards a circular beauty routine. It recently released a plantable eyeliner. Its ""Sprout eyeliner,"" totally free of microplastics, is used like any other eyeliner with one exception. At the end of its life, it can be planted in a pot, then watered, to turn into flowers. This is made possible thanks to the capsule nestled at the end of the product, which contains seeds. These may seem like small innovations but they prove that brands have already started to work on sustainable alternatives to traditional cosmetics to make bathrooms greener and less polluting."
Beiersdorf partners with SABIC to launch climate-neutralized Nivea products,"Starting from June, the face care products of the Nivea Naturally Good product range will be released in 30 countries featuring a jar made from certified renewable polypropylene (PP). The range will thus be switched from fossil-based virgin plastic to renewable plastic. For this, Beiersdorf will use the certified polypropylene (PP) from SABIC’s Trucicle portfolio, derived from tall oil, a by-product of the forestry and paper industries. While aiming to increase the sustainability of its products’ packaging, Beiersdorf wanted to avoid any ay compromise on the quality. The company therefore started with a comprehensive analysis of the market for alternative plastics. The packaging had to fulfil many requirements, beginning with the "" visual and tactile features  that our Nivea consumers are acquainted to,” explains Michael Becker, Head of Global Packaging Development at Beiersdorf. The other important criteria were the packaging recyclability and the raw material from which the final packaging would be derived. Indeed, Beiersdorf chose to reject any material derived from sugar cane or corn or any other source of food. “The certified renewable plastic we source from SABIC has no visual effects or other adverse properties. Accordingly, the jar made of renewable PP is neither visually nor haptically distinguishable from the previous packaging. In addition, SABIC pursues a holistic sustainability approach with its feedstock concept. That convinced us,"" explains Hannah Rasel, Senior Packaging Specialist at Beiersdorf. To accelerate the transformation of their packaging towards more sustainability, Beiersdorf has brought SABIC to work directly with Berry Global, a long-time partner of the group for the production of face care jars. This collaboration allowed a rapid market introduction, where between the first idea to the implementation, it took just nine months. ""We are now getting involved much earlier and deeper in the supply chain,” says Isabel Hochgesand, Beiersdorf’s Chief Procurement Officer. Converting the packaging to renewable plastic has the benefit of conserving fossil resources, but also reduces carbon dioxide emissions. According to Beiersdorf, 76g of CO2 are saved per jar, with a reduction of around 60% compared to the fossil-based jar. This project contributes to the company’s climate target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% absolutely across the entire value chain by 2025. It completes Beiersdorf’s initiative to produce with 100% energy from renewable sources since 2019. Any remaining emissions that cannot be avoided or further reduced during the manufacturing of the product are - for the first time - climate-neutralized via carbon offsetting, through afforestation projects. This step is new for Beiersdorf and its largest skin care brand. The Nivea Naturally Good face care range comprised of eight products will be clearly recognizable as ‘climate-neutralized’ on pack and on shelf."
RT-Twist by Techniplast widens the range of perfume refill options,"The RT-Twist system was developed in 2014 by French company Techniplast, who had already developed the RT-Plug and RT-Lift technologies featured in perfume sources at points of sale, and which Mugler, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Cartier, Idole de Lancôme, and others had already adopted. “We aimed to offer an alternative to in-store refills, because we thought brands would be increasingly interested in reusing the original bottles, but that not all of them would be able to offer this service in their stores: their staff would not be available for it or they would lack space for their fountains,” explains Loïc Bouet, Sales Director of Techniplast. The system is easy-to-use. The RT-Twist cap is interdependent with the refill delivered. The latter is screwed on the bottle to be refilled, so the neck needs to be a screw-top. The connexion opens the refill bottle and releases the perfume. The RT-Twist technology regulates the liquid flow and automatically stops it when the bottle is full. “This way, overflows and funnel handling issues are prevented, even with opaque bottles,” says Loïc Bouet. The single-material, polypropylene-based RT-Twist is delivered screwed on a glass refill bottle or an aluminium-based container. Then, it can be separated to recycle the different components. The original bottle becomes an object to keep with you, with a strong valorization potential. The RT-Twist technology revives the notion of luxury regarding perfume bottles, while minimizing their environmental impact. “2020 was an opportunity for us to plan significant launches, like My Way by Armani and Sauvage by Dior, but our solution has convinced many other brands which will take the plunge this year. The cap is reliable, clean, and it meets the demand for better-controlled environmental impact. Customers can buy 200 ml of juice and refill their 50-ml bottles four times – the impact is much more limited,” says Loïc Bouet. Techniplast is working on several new projects. Some brands chose to invest and get a cap with a customized design, while others ordered a standard RT-Twist cap. Indeed, the company offers a generic model available with different necks that meet glassmaking standards, and with different capacities. “This marks the comeback of crimp necks on most bottles, so recycling is possible,” adds the Sales Director."
Coty partners with LanzaTech to use carbon-captured ethanol in fragrances,"Coty’s scientists have worked alongside LanzaTech and production partners over the past two years to develop a high-purity sustainable ethanol that is suitable for use in fragrances. Based on this efforts, Coty intends to incorporate carbon-captured ethanol into its fragrance manufacturing process, with the goal of having the majority of its fragrance portfolio using ethanol sourced from carbon-capture by 2023. Ethanol is a core ingredient in fragrance products, enabling the efficient dispersion of the scent. As most other fragrance producers, Coty uses ethanol sourced from a range of natural raw materials - including sugar cane and sugar beet, which require farm land, water and fertilizers. The use of a new generation of sustainable ethanol produced from carbon-capture needs near-zero water consumption and reduces the requirement for agricultural land. Working with the independent sustainability consultancy Quantis, Coty has conducted a screening life cycle assessment which shows a significantly reduced overall environment impact. To produce this new generation sustainable ethanol, LanzaTech captures carbon from different emission sources (industry, solid organic waste) or even in ambient air, through an electrolysis process. The collected CO2 is then cleaned-up before being transformed into ethanol through fermentation. “Single use carbon must be a thing of the past and this project exemplifies our vision of a CarbonSmart future where consumers are able to choose products made from recycled carbon,” said Jennifer Holmgren, Chief Executive Officer of LanzaTech. The partnership with LanzaTech is an important step for Coty as it continues its journey to becoming a more circular business. The company’s ‘Beauty That Lasts’ strategy sets out a range of time-bound targets, including a 30% reduction in absolute CO2 emissions by 2030. “Ethanol is the number one ingredient purchased for the fragrance category and over time this partnership with LanzaTech will significantly reduce the environmental impact of our products. It’s not only the right thing to do, but it makes commercial sense too - with today’s consumer rightly demanding that their favourite brands share their commitment to sustainability,” commented Sue Y. Nabi, Chief Executive Officer of Coty. Carbon recycling is making significant progress and is emerging as an environmentally attractive alternative to carbon from agricultural sources. Late last year, LanzaTech, Total and L’Oréal announced the production of the first plastic cosmetic bottle produced with industrial carbon emissions."
L’Oréal expands the use of paper bottles across its portfolio,"As early as 2018, for the launch of Seed Phytonutrients in the United States, the L’Oréal group partnered with sustainable packaging supplier Ecologic Brands - recently acquired by Jabil Inc. - to create the first paper bottle for the bathroom able to resist to the bathroom humidity. Ecologic Brands’ paper bottle technology offers the advantage of an unmatched level of commercial maturity. It has been used for several years by laundry brand Seventh Generation. The technology consists of a cardboard shell in which is inserted a thin bag made of recycled food-grade plastic. “Ecologic and L’Oréal broke new ground when we incubated the world’s first shower-safe paper bottle for the Seed Phytonutrients project. We’re taking things a step further by bringing this innovative packaging solution to our market-leading Matrix and Redken brands,” said Shane Wolf, president worldwide, American Professional Brands, L’Oréal Professional Products Division. L’Oréal has also announced its brands La Roche Posay and Khiel’s would soon use cardboard bottles developed by the start-up Paboco, founded by Billerudkorsnäs and Alpla, of which L’Oréal has been a partner since its inception. The technology developed by Paboco is designed to create 100% recyclable bottles made of wood cellulose with a bio-material based barrier capable of resisting liquids, CO2 and oxygen, and suitable for liquid goods such as carbonated and still drinks, beauty products and more. The high barrier properties (the ability to withstand gas permeability) required for the bottle are provided by a thin layer of PEF (polyethylene furanoate) by Dutch company Avantium. PEF is a 100% plant-based and recyclable polymer. Thus, it is possible to fully recycle the Paper Bottle by separating the paper and PEF. While it has the advantage of recyclability, the Paboco bottle has not yet been tested on the market, unlike the one developed by Ecologic Brands. Last year, La Roche Posay launched the first cosmetic tubes incorporating a part of cardboard. Developed in partnership with Albéa, they allow to reduce by 45% the quantity of plastic required for its manufacture compared to a conventional tube. Garnier, another flagship brand of the group, is also committed to using these tubes as part of their environmental targets."
Perfumes: Towards ecoresponsible exploitation of guaiac wood with Nelixia,"With its very dry subtropical climate, the forest of the Paraguayan Chaco region, a real haven for biodiversity, is the only area that shelters Bulnesia sarmientoi. But since Paraguay allowed virgin forest land to be turned into pasture for cattle, this tall tree with very dense wood has been massively cut. “Unfortunately, the roots are also cut, which prevents the trees from regenerating, whereas one should wait for 30 years before extracting them,” explains Elisa Aragon, co-founder of Nelixia, with Jean-Marie Maizener. “As a matter of fact, it is very tricky to replant cuttings, because guaiac wood grows in clusters on veins of salt. It is actually impossible to determine beforehand whether the soil conditions will be adapted to its growth or not,” she adds. So, to encourage local players to implement sustainable exploitation methods, CITES took action in 2011, classifying guaiacwood as a “species whose exploitation must be regulated in order to keep it out of danger”. To foster concrete action, CITES has blocked the import of guaiac wood several times since 2015, including last March. As a matter of fact, for the past two years, Nelixia has worked on new management plans for the forest of Chaco in order to set up an ecoresponsible production chain. “We can evolve and act differently, for example by focusing on new exploitation methods that better preserve the forest’s ecosystem”, says Elisa Aragon. With two production sites in Guatemala and Honduras, Nelixia has acquired genuine expertise in developing sustainable raw material chains. As part of this project, the company has just opened a production site in Paraguay. This inauguration completes the implementation of management plans for the forest of Chaco approved by INFONA (national forestry office). Nelixia first convinced land owners that a non-exploited forest could actually be profitable. Then, they had to make an accurate inventory of the forest to divide it into parcels and determine a quantity of exploitable guaiac wood: annual cutting units from which wood would be extracted over a minimum period of 20 years. This method prevents the roots from being cut, so that the resource is never exhausted. Since machines are banned, tree extraction is mainly carried out by hand, from cutting to loading timber in vehicles, which are also prohibited around the forest. Ultimately, these plans are aimed to take only a small number of trees per hectare using responsible methods. Today, Nelixia manages almost 5,000 hectares and intends to “reach 20,000 by 2025 to make sure the ingredient remains out of danger in the long run,” says Jean-Marie Maizener. Thanks to this new exploitation method, in 2021, Nelixia will be able to distribute a “responsible”, soon-to-be-certified guaiac essential oil on the market, provided the CITES import ban is lifted in the following weeks. Right now, Nelixia has 1,800 tonnes of cut wood ready to be distilled, which makes about 70 tonnes of essential oil. Since the guaiac essence is widely used, because it is cheap, this sustainable production chain would prevent thousands of perfumes from being reformulated. Nelixia’s expertise is based on several assets, including experienced partners, like the Paraguaya Foundation, a pioneer NGO in this field, since they have taken action since 1985. For example, they created the very efficient “stoplight” programme aimed to stop poverty, in particular by setting up farming schools to train rural entrepreneurs, whose education is financed by their own business. That is why Nelixia established their distillery near a farming school: the idea was to create new jobs thanks to guaiac oil production. Although they are fully involved in developing a responsible, sustainable guaiac production chain, Nelixia does not aim to hold a monopoly. “It is likely these two exploitation methods will coexist for some time, but we do hope to encourage and democratize these management plans to create a sustainable guaiac wood  sourcing chain,” explains Elisa Aragon."
L’Oréal starts capturing carbon to create sustainable shampoo bottles,"Claimed to be a “worldwide premiere”, the production of this bottle is based on a three-step process in which each of the three companies has a specific role: LanzaTech captures industrial carbon emissions and converts them into ethanol using a unique biological process, Total transforms ethanol into ethylene before polymerizing it into polyethylene, and finally L’Oréal uses this polyethylene to produce the plastic packaging. While the conversion process has been successfully tested it still has to be industrialized. This second phase could be completed by 2024. The source of this innovation is the carbon monoxide capture process developed by LanzaTech. Basically, the idea is to convert industrial gazes typically produced by steel manufacturing plants, oil refineries or the chemical industry. These gases are sent to a bioreactor where LanzaTech proprietary bacteria transform the carbon monoxide into ethanol and various co-products during a fermentation process. Once separated, the ethanol can be used as fuel or as a chemical raw material. Thus, the gases recycled from steel mill emissions in China, where LanzaTech has installed a recycling unit, were used to produce ethanol for the Podtz and Migos Plus lines of household products marketed since this summer by Mibelle Group in Switzerland. Considering the environmental footprint of the process, recycling carbon emissions is an interesting alternative to the production of ethanol from sugar, since it does not need to use agricultural land and helps reducing greenhouse gases emissions that would otherwise warm the climate further. The process is tolerant to different levels of hydrogen and to the presence of various contaminants typically found in industrial gases. To transform ethanol into ethylene, Total uses a dehydration process jointly developed with IFP Axens. Like the sugar ethanol transformation process implemented by Braskem in Brazil, this technology makes it possible to obtain ethylene, then polyethylene, with exactly the same characteristics than polyethylene obtained from fossil oil. Now that the possibility to produce plastic packaging from industrial carbon emissions has been demonstrated, the three partners now intend to continue working together on scaling the production of these sustainable plastics. This will involve the construction of a LanzaTech gas recovery unit, currently underway near an Arcelor Mittal steel plant in Belgium, as well as the development of ethanol processing facilities. “We have the ambition to use this sustainable material in our bottle of shampoo and conditioner by 2024 and we hope other companies will join us in using this breakthrough innovation,” said Jacques Playe L’Oréal Packaging & Development Director, L’Oréal."
A new ecodesign tool to help cosmetics makers develop sustainable packaging,"Dubbed SPICE Tool, the solution aims to solve one of the key sustainability challenges facing the beauty industry: embedding ecodesign into the packaging development process. After having developed a methodology for measuring the environmental footprint of cosmetic packaging, SPICE has translated it into an online tool, open to all the companies in the sector, thus allowing them to measure and reduce the environmental footprint of any cosmetic packaging throughout its entire life cycle. The platform features a free Demo version and a Pro version, available by licence. The solution calculates a holistic environmental footprint of packaging, covering 16 environmental indicators that assess impacts on climate change as well as resource depletion, water use, biodiversity and more, across the full lifecycle of a product’s packaging (from production to end-of-life). The tool thus facilitates the choice between the different material options, the amount of recycled material, the different types of refills ... ""The previously existing multi-criteria Life Cycle Analysis tools made it possible to measure the environmental impact of a packaging, but a choice had to be made, for example, between lowering CO2 emissions or water consumption. SPICE makes it possible, for the first time, to determine the most favourable solution by weighing all of the environmental criteria,” explains the French Beauty Federation (FEBEA), which participated in the development of the tool as a member of SPICE. SPICE Tool is science-based and illustrated by empirical case studies. It is consistent with major international standards, including the European PEF method, ISO quality standards and the recommendations of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Along with the Tool, SPICE also released a set of best practice materials, including environmental claims guidelines that establish minimum requirements and strong recommendations for providing credible packaging sustainability information to consumers and other audiences. “The cost of developing a robust environmental footprinting tool has been a barrier for many small and medium-sized cosmetics companies that want to implement ecodesign in packaging development. By making the SPICE Tool publicly available, the SPICE Initiative helps the whole industry move forward, getting everyone on board to design the future of sustainable packaging,” noted Patrick O’Quin, President of FEBEA. Co-founded in 2018 by L’Oréal and sustainability consulting firm Quantis, SPICE is an industry-led organisation now includes 25 members working together to develop solutions that will accelerate progress toward sustainable packaging for cosmetics."
L’Oréal wants all their plastic packaging to be recycled or bio-based by 2030,"Following similar announcements from other consumer goods giants, such as Unilever, the world’s leading cosmetics maker, which owns a portfolio of 36 brands, has set new quantified targets for 2030 to fight climate change. “L’Oréal is accelerating its transformation towards a model respecting planetary boundaries,” said the company in a statement. In recent report, sustainability consulting firm Quatis estimated the contribution of the cosmetics industry to global CO2 emissions anywhere between 0.5% to 5%. By 2025, all of the sites operated by L’Oréal will be carbon neutral thanks to the improvement of their energy efficiency and the use of 100% renewable energy. Furthermore, by 2030, 100% of the plastics used to pack L’Oréal’s products will be either from recycled or bio-based sources, announced the company. Earlier this year, the group launched under La Roche Posay brand the first tube incorporating cardboard, thus reducing by 45% the quantity of plastic required for its manufacture compared to a conventional tube. L’Oréal is also committed to reduce by 25% per finished product, compared to 2016, its entire greenhouse gas emissions (and by 50% the emissions linked to their transport). In addition, the group will launch a “Product Environmental & Social Impact Labelling” mechanism. The labelling will include a score on a scale from A to E, with an “A” product considered as “best in class” in terms of environmental impacts. The method was endorsed by independent scientific experts and data have been verified by Bureau Veritas Certification, an independent auditor. The labels and scores will be accessible on products’ web pages. The first brand to implement the new methodology as of 2020 is Garnier for its hair care products, third beauty brand worldwide and leader of the market in France. This labelling will progressively be extended to other countries, L’Oréal’s brands and product categories. ""It is a real transformation of the way in which L’Oréal creates formulas, sources raw materials, makes packaging, and manufactures products in its factories"", said the group’s CEO Jean-Paul Agon to AFP. In addition to these quantified targets, L’Oréal will also support actions carried out by NGOs to address urgent social and environmental issues with two priorities: climate and women in vulnerable situations. Therefore, L’Oréal is engaging EUR 50 million to finance damaged natural marine and forest ecosystems restoration projects through a fund called the L’Oréal Fund for Nature Regeneration. Another EUR 50 million will be directed to financing projects linked to the circular economy. Eventually, to help vulnerable women, L’Oréal is also creating a EUR 50 million charitable endowment fund. It will support field organizations and local charities in their efforts to fight poverty, help women achieve social and professional integration, provide emergency assistance to refugee and disabled women, prevent violence against women, and support victims. “Over the past decade, we have profoundly transformed our company, putting sustainability at the very core of our business model. With our new commitments, we are entering a new phase of acceleration of that transformation: going beyond our direct environmental impact, helping consumers to make more sustainable choices, as well as generating positive social and environmental contribution”, concluded Alexandra Palt, L’Oréal Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer. In 2019, L’Oréal generated sales of almost 30 billion euros. At the end of the year, the group already had 35 carbon neutral sites (meaning they use 100% renewable energy), including 14 factories. Furthermore, 85% of the products created or renovated in 2019 had an improved environmental and social profile."
Unilever wants all their products to be net zero emissions by 2039,"As far as climate change is concerned, Unilever has already committed to have no carbon emissions from their own operations, and to halve the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint of their products across the value chain, by 2030. In response to the scale and urgency of the climate crisis, the group is now additionally committing to net zero emissions from all their products by 2039 - from the sourcing of the materials, up to the point of sale of their products in the store. To achieve this goal, Unilever said they will prioritise building partnerships with suppliers who have set and committed to their own science-based targets. The group will set up a system for their suppliers to declare, on each invoice, the carbon footprint of the goods and services provided and will create partnerships with other businesses and organisations to standardise data collection, sharing and communication. Unilever wants also to go further in the fight against deforestation and achieve a deforestation-free supply chain by 2023. The group therefore wants to have visibility on exact sourcing locations, and no longer rely on the mass balance system, which does not allow for accurate verification. In order to increase traceability and transparency, the group will use emerging digital technologies - such as satellite monitoring, geolocation tracking and blockchain. Other commitments include: – To empower a new generation of farmers and smallholders who are committed to protecting and regenerating their farm environment.
– To introduce a pioneering Regenerative Agriculture Code for all their suppliers.
– To implement water stewardship programmes for local communities in 100 locations by 2030.
– To join the 2030 Water Resources Group, a multi-stakeholder platform hosted by the World Bank, to contribute to transformative change and building resilience in water management in key water-stressed markets.
– To make all product formulations biodegradable by 2030, to minimise their impact on water and the aquatic ecosystems. To accelerate action, Unilever’s brands will collectively invest EUR 1 billion in a new dedicated Climate & Nature Fund. “This will be used over the next ten years to take meaningful and decisive action, with projects likely to include landscape restoration, reforestation, carbon sequestration, wildlife protection and water preservation,” said the group in a statement."
"Beauty brands need to take critical actions to get sustainable, finds new study","Quantis latest report, Make Up the Future: Levers of change for a sustainable cosmetics business, is a call to action for beauty players to join forces to fill critical data gaps to enhance understanding of the industry’s environmental impacts. It points out the top issues the global cosmetics industry faces today and delivers a palette of science-based solutions. Drawing on Quantis’ scientific expertise as well as concrete examples from industry sustainability leaders, including BeautyCounter, Chanel, Coty, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., French Federation for Beauty Companies (Fédération des Entreprises de la Beauté - FEBEA), Groupe Rocher, L’Oréal, the Personal Care and Cosmetics Council (PCPC), among others, the report encourages sustainability managers, corporate decision-makers and their teams to: – Prioritize efforts and resources on the topics that will make a meaningful difference;
– Identify opportunities for collaboration and innovation within companies and across the industry; 
– Collect high-quality, consistent and representative data to understand environmental impacts across the value chain;
– Set bold environmental goals that will lay the foundation for resilience in a resource-constrained world; and
– Accelerate industry-wide action to make up a sustainable future for cosmetics. The report also takes a critical look at cosmetics’ environmental data gaps. “Data can be a major catalyst for meaningful change. For the cosmetics industry to catch up to FMCG categories more advanced on sustainability, it will need more, high-quality, comprehensive data to understand the full scale and scope of its environmental impacts,” says Quantis in a statement. Based on currently available data, Quantis puts the contribution of the cosmetics industry to global CO2 emissions anywhere between 0.5% to 5%, highlighting the need for additional data to calculate a more complete picture of the industry’s impacts. “What the estimated footprint data can identify, however, is that the raw materials, packaging, transportation and use phase stages are the main areas where innovative and science-backed solutions can lead to significant impact reduction,” emphasizes the consulting firm. Quantis, L’Oréal and other sustainability leaders in beauty will share their experiences in a webinar on June 10, 2020."
Superga Beauty implements an exclusive eco-design tool for promotions and gifts,"Dubbed GOGREEN, this new eco-design tool was created for Superga Beauty by sustainability consulting group Quantis. It makes it possible to assess the environmental impact of the products manufactured by the company (bags, cases accessories) from the design stage and throughout their life cycle. “Environmentally-friendly initiatives are firmly rooted in our company’s ethos. We developed GOGREEN in response to questions asked by our clients and to offer support in their CSR strategies in a pragmatic and objective manner,” outlines Leslie Bréau Meniger, Director General - Superga Beauty. In concrete terms, Superga Beauty has made the tool available to their clients since March with the aim to better address their expectations related to sustainable development and CSR issues, from the very beginning of a project. The tool’s core is based on the Ecoinvent database - the global benchmark for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), used in over 40 countries, which provides the basics of the GOGREEN analysis. It includes data from all stages of the lifecycle, including end of life. In addition, over 200 materials are listed, as well as 40 transformation processes and 20 decorative processes. GOGREEN thus makes it possible to quantify the carbon footprint and water consumption of each manufacturing campaign, taking account of the entire product lifecycle. “We can simulate design and material options to best assess their carbon footprint. To improve a product profile, we can activate five different levers: material, closure, decoration, packaging, shipping,” explains Leslie Bréau Meniger. By facilitating responses to very concrete questions (How to understand the effect of changing a material? Is it best to use cotton or hessian? What about PU?), GOGREEN allows brand fine tuning the different parameters of a project and thus reducing the carbon footprint of their gift campaigns. Example of the improved environmental impact of a toilet bag for a campaign of 100,000 units. – 10 litres of water saved per toilet bag, by changing the material, equating to 250 Olympic swimming pools 
– Carbon footprint reduction of 20%, through removal of the metal eyelet which is the equivalent of 70 return trips from Paris to New York 
– More responsible sourcing through use of RPET which uses recycled plastics   “Not only does the tool guide us in our developments, but also in our innovation. Our aim is not to replace our clients, but to offer clarification in their choices, and allow them to measure progress and communicate with consumers,” concludes the company’s DG. A subsidiary of Superga Invest, founded and directed by Alain Bréau since 2001, Superga Beauty is organised around three distinct divisions: Sub-Contracting (manufacture of care products & perfumes, filling, packaging, copacking), Promotion & Retail (design and manufacture of packaging, luggage, brushes and dispensers), Full Service (manufacturing, brand-free products, Full Buy). Superga Beauty owns five industrial sites based in France and has a team of some 350 employees spanning three continents."
Clean beauty : Coty achieves Cradle to Cradle certification for CK Everyone,"CK One, Calvin Klein’s iconic fragrance is once again adapting to the taste of the day with an eco-designed version. The CK Everyone Eau de toilette offers a genderless fragrance based on 77% of naturally derived and vegan ingredients. The formula is also designed to be clean, that is to say free from any ingredient considered as toxic to health or the environment. As far as the packaging is concerned, the CK Everyone bottle and external pack were created from recycled materials. The transparent glass bottle contains 10% of post-consumer recycled (PCR) materials and is recyclable with the removal of the pump and the elastic while the folding carton contains 30% of post-consumer recycled materials. In support of these eco-design efforts, the Coty group, which owns the Calvin Klein perfumery license, announced that it has achieved a Material Health Certificate at the Silver level from the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute for CK Everyone Eau de toilette. According to Coty, the certification indicates that 100% of the chemical substances in CK Everyone Eau de toilette have been assessed and are compliant with the Cradle to Cradle Certified Product Standard material health requirements at the Silver level. “These achievements also serve as the foundation of a material health optimization strategy for further improving the environmental safety of the fragrance over time,” added the group in a statement. The Cradle to Cradle Certified™ Material Health Certificate is based on the rigorous, globally recognized material health assessment methodology of the Cradle to Cradle Certified Product Standard, one of the world’s leading standards for designing and making products for the circular economy. It provides manufacturers with a means of assessing, optimizing and verifying their product chemistries for safety and the environment. The evaluation was executed by MBDC, a third-party Cradle to Cradle accredited assessor. “Achieving a Cradle to Cradle Material Health certificate for CK Everyone Eau de toilette is another positive step in moving the beauty industry towards the universal use of materials that are safe, circular and responsible,” said Dr. Christina Raab, Vice President of Strategy and Development for the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute. CK Everyone Eau de toilette is a citrus fragrance, uplifted with zesty organic orange oil, a blue tea accord, and a cedarwood base. The fragrance, which exudes freshness was crafted by master perfumer and creator of the original CK One fragrance, Alberto Morillas. CK Everyone is available globally in a 50ml, 100ml, and 200ml, Eau de toilette spray."
TNT Manufacturing promotes the responsible choice of Zamak,"Zamak, an alloy composed of 95% zinc, 4% aluminium, and 1% copper, is a material that is still hardly used in the perfume industry - it is mainly part of decoration accessories and caps. The industries that use it more often include the building, furniture, automotive, electricity, and electronics industries. This highly-resistant alloy is 100% infinitely reusable in its end-of-life, without losing any properties during the recycling process. Indeed, controlled recycling preserves chemical, physical and mechanical properties, however many remelting operations are needed. As a result, it is a first-rate material for brands willing to make their packaging more responsible. “Customers know very little about this alloy. They think it is recyclable, but not recycled,” explains Thomas Diezinger, President of TNT Global Manufacturing France. “We studied how it could actually be recycled, and we aim to provide the whole value chain with a comprehensive solution.” Therefore, the manufacturer contacted one of the main European zinc alloy leaders: the REAZN Group. A huge part of the zinc alloy volume produced on the group’s Belgian production site is derived from recycled secondary zinc units from industrial by-products. The metal part derived from post-consumer recycling is still low, since collection and sorting chains do not work very well yet. “For our industry to meet recycling companies’ demand for PCR, we offer to use what already exists, i.e. the network that retrieves empty packs set up by a major French perfume and cosmetics retail brand in partnership with waste management company CEDRE. The company retrieves 15 tonnes of empty cosmetic products per week,” explains Thomas Diezinger. This incentive consists in inviting consumers to bring back their own empty perfume bottles to stores and get a 20% discount on the next perfume purchased. “The main material retrieved and recycled is glass; the other components undergo thermal recycling by incineration. So, we offered CEDRE to retrieve Zamak and resell it to REAZN,” says TNT’s Director. Operators organize the manual sorting of Zamak parts that can be valorized, depending on their quality, and then resold to the foundry owner who needs them. To promote and authenticate this initiative aimed to set up a recyclability chain, TNT Manufacturing created a logo which might pave the way for a future label guaranteeing the material’s traceability. “I strongly encourage brands to use Zamak, because it is perfectly adapted to the circular economy concept,” adds Thomas Diezinger."
Eco-refill solutions now extend to leave-on cosmetics,"When they created CoZie (Cosmétique Objectif Zéro Environmental Impact), 3 years ago, the three young entrepreneurs - Arnaud Lancelot, Émeric Baracat and Louise Salvati - wanted to fully exploit the clean beauty concept, well beyond formulas. ""This required to also work on the pack and, in our opinion, the most effective solution was the waste that we don’t generate, and therefore to have the possibility of refilling empty packagings. An idea put forward by Louise who is a zero-waste influencer,"" explains Arnaud Lancelot. But to be achieved, this indeed virtuous idea, had to overcome a set of major challenges: an unprecedented initiative in the personal care segment, a non-existent distribution technology at the time, the necessary consideration of the microbial development risk criteria, regulatory compliance, adequacy with POS, packaging management… ""For this type of product, a complete mastery of safety and traceability issues was needed. So we decided to create everything ourselves from scratch. Our idea was to recreate a mini lab at the POS, respecting good cosmetic manufacturing practices, in the same way as in an industrial site,"" describes the co-founder. Two years were necessary for the development phase, led by Émeric, an engineer by training and with a 10-year career in a large cosmetic group, supported by different engineering offices. But down the road, the challenge was successfully met: this patented equipment, like non other worldwide, encompasses a number of technical solutions to protect the formula from air, light and dust. ""There is no contact between the product and the outside: it goes directly from the machine to the bottle,"" confirms Arnaud Lancelot, thereby guaranteeing a product protection, against any risks of bacterial contamination. This ""Dosing"" device not only brings together a set of dedicated fountains to deliver the 9 product references of CoZie, but once the refill is completed, it also prints a specific label with the batch number, the best before date and the volume chosen by the customer. ""Our machine is also connected, which allows us to collect and centralize all the data on a server, to ensure traceability in the event of a problem. We know where and when a given batch number was sold,"" added the entrepreneur. Another issue to solve, was the cleanliness of glass bottles before refill. A responsibility which, in the opinion of the founders, lied with the brand. The solution found to rule out all risks: the bottle deposit. Each bottle is brought back by the customer who is given a new empty and clean bottle, which is filled with the desired quantity, with a reduction of 1.5 euros in the product price. ""Across the country, we have set up an industrial washing loop. All the used bottles recovered are sent to one of our washing centres where all cosmetic hygiene conditions are met: the bottles are washed, dried and re-labelled."" While multi-material pumps are directed to a specific and dedicated recycling channel. ""It is impossible to wash these pumps on an industrial scale. We have sought for solutions from suppliers, without success to date,"" notes Arnaud Lancelot. From the retailer’s point of view, the operation is almost neutral. The machine, which uses little space, only needs to be installed, connected and refilled. No maintenance is required and the machine is operated by the consumer. The brand already owns 49 machines mainly installed in organic stores and zero waste stores, with the aim of accelerating the supply to new pharmacies and beauty networks in the coming months. Today, the three founders intend to share their concept with other players in the industry.  A first experiment was successfully carried out; it consisted in assisting the Beauty Kitchen brand in the U.K. ""At first we provided advice. This refill system raises many technical and legal issues among other, which we went through. This allows saving a lot of time. Then, we supplied the machine, custom designed for the brand, on a Private Label mode,"" describes Arnaud Lancelot. Building on this success, the team will assist two other major French brands next March, for new launches of cosmetic refills. Still relatively confidential, in the sphere of beauty, the solution of refillable cosmetic products in POS is nonetheless slowly but surely winning over new consumers. Among the pioneering players, the brand of natural products, Panier des Sens, has been testing the system since 2016 in its 3 stores, for its flagship reference, its liquid Marseille soap. ""It is a fairly complex project to set up. We developed it more out of conviction than out of interest, but today demand is increasing,"" admits Aurélie Muntaner, Marketing Director. More recently, L’Occitane has launched an experimental fountain device for three of its shower gel references in several of its retails stores. With CoZie, the approach is now reaching a new segment. ""We have a 40 to 60% rate of bottle returns, which is very high for a small brand like ours and shows that there is a real desire for re-purchase. This experiment encourages strong customer loyalty and things are actually going faster than we had thought,"" highlighted Arnaud Lancelot."
REN Clean Skincare and Aptar join forces to support a novel plastic recycling technology,"Due to the environmental emergency linked to plastic, manufacturers find themselves committed to developing post-consumer plastic recycling processes. In addition to traditional mechanical recycling, the SABIC Group has perfected the post-consumer plastic packs conversion into polyolefin. ""The plastic challenge has shed light on the need to provide additional solutions. It has made possible to unlock and deepen a whole series of technological innovations, in particular the novel application of pyrolysis for this new recycling technology proposed by SABIC,"" notes Frédéric Dreux. ""But beware, these techniques do not free yourself from improving eco-design, key to achieve mono-material packs, these efforts remain a priority and an absolute necessity. These new technologies are also not meant to replace mechanical recycling. It is a necessary addition to further increase recycling capacities,"" he adds. Besides reducing the carbon impact compared to virgin plastics of fossil origin, the advantage of this technology lies in the possibility to focus on the recycling of packs which are known to be more difficult to recycle using a mechanical process, and which are therefore commonly sent to incineration or landfill. ""These are often packagings that do not fit into the ’guidelines’ of what recyclers are able to process, such as flexible pouches or complex multi-material products. High quality mechanical recycling requires huge sorting efforts upstream, because once re-melted into pellets, it will be impossible to separate the materials. Here, we are talking about molecular fragmentation, which means the technology is less sensitive to the mix of PP + PE materials in the same batch. Traces of PET, or even of metal in the event of metallization, are no longer an issue for this technology"" explains the specialist. A sore point for the luxury and cosmetic industry, which has to deal with complex materials to answer the need for barrier properties or complex assemblies for functionality. The technology reverts to the basic constituent of plastic with the same qualities, properties, clarity and purity than the virgin material. ""Going to the molecular level allows recreating all of the polyolefin grades and to serve applications in the finest and most optimum way. For the first time, we have a recycling technique, opening the possibility of indefinite plastic recycling without losing its quality and physical properties,"" specifies Frédéric Dreux. ""It is important to support new recycling technologies, and this is what we are doing with REN Clean Skincare, even if it now represents a cost for the brand, a cost, we decided consumers should not have to bear. Our support to this technology can help make it grow to an industrial scale, with an increase in new capacities and structures. This is not going to be achieved by a supplier alone, the good news is that there is a real consensus from the sector to increase resources for this new technology. It’s a virtuous circle. This is a new step in the way to improve the sustainability of plastics, demonstrating that it is possible to develop and use new technologies to further contribute to plastic being recycled in a circular economy"" concludes Frédéric Dreux."
Australia: Beauty brands stand shoulder to shoulder after devastating bushfires tainted the country’s image,"The devastation of Australia’s bushfire crisis in January has tainted the country’s reputation as an environmentally-conscious heaven. For sure, human-made environmental disasters are not new in Australia, but in recent years, the country had widely promoted its natural and organic brands and products - especially cosmetic and personal care goods - offered in environmental friendly packaging. A brand like Aesop, for instance, has built its global success on this concept. ""We’ve been selling Australia on clean air, clear skies, bright shiny beaches, hopping animals. Unfortunately, what people have been seeing (are) singed koalas and kangaroos,"" said University of Technology Sydney lecturer David Beirman. Actually, the fires have highlighted the contribution of the Australian mining industry in global warming as well as the government’s indifference - and even denial - regarding this issue. “I’m tired, sad and disappointed in our government. As a small Blue Mountains based business, I struggle to comprehend the destruction and loss this nation has suffered, whilst at the same time ensuring my business stays intact,” said Bridget Carmady, founder and director of Clémence Organics, a luxury and organic skincare brand from New South Wales. While she hasn’t lost property or lives close to her, Bridget has had to deal with situations such as burnt land and fencing, while moving offices to ensure stock and staff stayed safe. “How can you feel sorry for yourself whilst so many suffer more? I want to give, donate, share but at the same time I need to look after my family and my business. Business-wise, it’s been a quiet month,” she added. To support businesses and towns affected by fire, Instagram page @spendwhithem was created by Turia Pitt, a young woman who suffered burns to 65% of her body after encountering an out of control grassfire while competing in a 100km ultra marathon in the Australian outback in 2011. In such a context, beauty heavyweights such as Estée Lauder, L’Oréal Australia, L’Occitane, Lush Cosmetics and Coty have pledged to donate important cash sums to help the relief. The L’Occitane Group has thus announced the launch of a fund dedicated to punctual responses to disasters affecting ecosystems. “This fund will be financed by an internal donation campaign amongst the group’s shareholders. An initial support fund of EUR 400,000 has been pledged to finance long-term projects, with EUR 200,000 set to be donated immediately to tree-planting and agroforestry schemes in Australia, in a bid to help restore its landscape over the next decade,” said Pierre Emmanuel Joffre, CEO of L’Occitane Australia to Premium Beauty News. “The L’Occitane Foundation will select these projects alongside the company’s agricultural engineers and its operational teams in the country,” he added. “Last year we worked with PUR Project to fund tree plantation schemes in Australia. This year, we will be pre-selecting four potential partners in the coming weeks. Then, we will choose the one who best matches; and, can deliver on the objectives of the newly established L’Occitane Fund. Our goal is to start the project by the end of 2020.” For the French beauty multinational, it is important to stress this action is consistent with a long-term commitment towards sustainability. “L’Occitane consistently works to reduce waste and improve our product lifespans. Our first eco-refills were launched in 2008. Today, L’Occitane offers 16 eco-refills for best-selling products. These eco-refills use up to 90% less plastic than a regular bottle, saving more than 214 tonnes of plastic world-wide each year. L’Occitane intends to offer 25 eco-refills by 2022, while also making the eco-refill packaging itself recyclable by 2025. As a brand, we have never used plastic bags in our stores and it’s been over a year now since we have banned the use of all cellophane paper,” highlighted Pierre Emmanuel Joffre. “Additionally, we are committed to recycling, which we believe is important to working towards a circular economy. In 2009, L’Occitane launched its first 100% recycled bottle and we are determined to transition to 100% sustainable PET plastic to all of our product bottles by 2025.” Many smaller beauty brands have rallied together to support those affected by the bushfires that swept across Australia: Bondi Sands, Cannabella, Evo Hair, Ecoya, Frank Body, Go-To, Hop and Cotton, Jurlique, Kevin Murphy, Kora Organics, Mecca, Nude by Nature, Ozdare, Swisse, Trilogy, The Jojoba Company, Ultraceauticals and WelleCo, to name a few. However, at a moment when the contradictions of the Australian nation - emblematic of those of many developed countries - came to light, the brands’ commitments are as much expected as scrutinized. In this field, any suspicion of greenwashing or insincerity could lead to a catastrophic boomerang effect for their authors."
Albéa and Colgate launch the first recyclable toothpaste tube,"According to a recent Colgate-Palmolive survey, almost two thirds of people in the UK are not aware that toothpaste tubes cannot be recyled [1]. Indeed, most of today’s toothpaste tubes are made from sheets of plastic laminate - usually a combination of different plastics - sandwiched around a thin layer of aluminium. The mix of materials makes it impossible to recycle through conventional methods. Packed in a HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) tube, the Smile for Good toothpaste changes the game. HDPE is a polymer that is widely used for milk containers and other plastic bottles and is massively recycled. Made by Albéa, this tube is the first to be recognized as recyclable by the APR (Association of Plastic Recyclers) and RecyClass (an initiative that works on improving the recyclability of packaging), which sets recyclability standards for North America and Europe respectively. According to Colgate-Palmolive, toothpaste alone accounts for an estimated 20 billion tubes annually around the world.  To limit the impact of the most widely used forms of plastic packaging that up until now could not be recycled., Colgate has decided to share the technology with competitors. ""Colgate wants to make tubes a part of the circular economy by keeping this plastic productive and eliminating waste. If we can standardise recyclable tubes among all companies, we all win. We want all toothpaste tubes - and eventually all kinds of tubes - to meet the same third-party recycling standards that we’ve achieved. We can align on these common standards for tubes and still compete with what’s inside them,"" commented Noel Wallace, Chief Executive Officer and President of Colgate-Palmolive. The Colgate Smile for Good Toothpaste is available to purchase from the following retailers, from January: Sainsbury’s, Boots, Superdrug, Wilko, Waitrose, Ocado and Amazon, and from February in Tesco and Morrisons. In the U.S., the tube will debut under the company’s Tom’s of Maine brand in 2020. Together with the recent launch of the Colgate Bamboo Charcoal Toothbrush and TerraCycle partnership, Smile for Good is a way Colgate is improving the sustainability profile of its products to help achieve its aim of 100% recyclable packaging by 2025. For Albéa, this is a new step towards the development of more responsible packaging solutions in the beauty and personal care industry. Last November, the packaging supplier presented a paper tube project together with L’Oréal. “Today we are accelerating the development of recyclable packaging and contributing to circularity. By partnering with our customers, suppliers and recognized associations such as the APR and RecyClass, we demonstrate our commitment to tomorrow,” said Gilles Swyngedauw, Vice President Sustainability, Marketing and Innovation at Albéa."
L’Occitane is testing in-store refillable shower gels,"The concept of reusable pack is gaining ground in the beauty hygiene sector. Like some other brands in the category, L’Occitane already offers eco-refills in the form of a Doypack for certain references. But to be even more eco-friendly, the brand is considering eliminating the use of this refill pack and replacing it with a fountain solution. ""Eco-design is the essential motivation for this initiative. Refilling one’s bottle is the best solution for reducing the plastic footprint,"" believed Corinne Fugier-Garrel, Packaging concept Development Director at L’Occitane en Provence. Hence, since June 2019, the brand has been experimenting the concept with three in-store refillable shower gels, in three of its L’Occitane POS in Provence, Germany and Spain. ""The idea emerged in November 2018. Because this was urgent matter, we decided to speed up things and developed the project in six months only, by daring to bank on a completely novel technique. We wanted to see how consumers would react,"" explained Corinne Fugier-Garrel. The experiment involves three successful brand references: Verveine Classique, Verveine Karité and Verveine Agrumes. ""We chose popular products, for which we know customers would come back in stores asking for more"". To develop a fountain specifically adapted to the shower gel, L’Occitane called on its partner, Marie Laure PLV, a company specialized in POS furniture. “We had to take into account the fact that the shower gel does not flow naturally when you want to fill a bottle in a short time. This means that the liquid has to be both pushed and sucked to fill a bottle in less than a minute,"" explained the Project Manager, who also added that the work to improve the machines was continuing with the experiment. Reflecting the spirit of the brand, bottles are aluminium standard packs that come in 250- and 500-ml formats at the price of 3 and 5 euros when purchased the first time. The consumer can then choose his bulk shower gel at one of the fountain taps. A pump is also offered free of charge as an option, with the mention ""non-recyclable element."" “We made sure that the price of the bottle with the gel was equal to the price of the classic product. The first time, the operation is therefore neutral for the consumer who then only pays for the refill operation, which is between 25 and 30% cheaper than a full new bottle. There is therefore also a financial incentive behind to motivate the refilling."" The bulk shower gel comes in 5 litre containers with a batch number. Each filled bottle is labelled by a store assistant, with the legal notices, the list of ingredients and the batch number marked on the bottle. The gel is transferred by the machine in a closed circuit, thus eliminating the risk of bacterial contamination. The cleanliness of the empty bottle to refill, remains nevertheless the consumer’s responsibility. It is still too early, according to the project manager, to make a first assessment, but L’Occitane aims to soon extend the experimentation, as part of a second pilot test, involving some 30 to 50 POS internationally."
Stora Enso develops new wood-based sustainable solutions for cosmetic brands,"There is definitely a lot going on in northern Europe! Indeed, Finnish-based Sulapac is preparing a new generation of cosmetic packaging with Chanel, while Sweden’s BillerudKorsnäs is discussing with L’Oréal and other partners the industrialization of the cardboard bottle, and Helsinki-headquartered Metsä Board is preparing the future for cardboard with a new innovation centre in Äänekoski. In the meantime, the Finnish-Swedish company Stora Enso has also begun to transform. At the Luxe Pack Monaco tradeshow, Stora Enso presented a renewable paperboard tube for cosmetics packaging as a climate-friendly alternative to plastic tubes. The body of the tube is made from a barrier-coated, grease-resistant paperboard by Stora Enso, which makes it suitable for the primary packaging of skin creams. According to the company, making the body of the tube from paperboard reduces the use of plastic by 70% compared with a plastic tube. “We are seeing increasing demand in the cosmetics field for new innovative solutions made of renewable materials. This tube is a good example of how, together with our customers and their suppliers, we are driving innovations to create the packaging of the future. The paperboard tube will offer cosmetics brands who want to appeal to eco-conscious consumers a competitive new alternative,” says Henna Paakkonen-Alvim, Vice President, Innovation, Stora Enso Consumer Board division. For manufacturing of the tubes, Stora Enso cooperates with Aisa, a world-leading tube machinery manufacturer. The industrial runnability of the board has been tested on Aisa’s machinery to ensure flawless and efficient converting performance. To go further, Stora Enso is also developing biocomposite materials to replace the plastic cap and shoulder of the tube in the future. Last year, Stora Enso launched DuraSense, a blend of wood fibres (up to 50%) and polymers (usually polypropylene), which can be fossil, bio-based or recycled, depending on the brands’ requirements, in order to offer an alternative to oil-based plastics. Indeed, thanks to the wood fibres they contain, DuraSense biocomposites allow to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of packaging materials. For instance, with a blend of wood fibres and bio-based polymers, it is possible to get up to 98% renewable content. In addition, the wood used for DuraSense comes from sustainably managed Nordic forests. Stora Enso has also developed a process for using microfibrillated cellulose (MFC), which is added to the pulp to lighten and strengthen paperboard, as a texture agent in cosmetic formulations. According to Stora Enso, MFC is a 100% biodegradable natural multifunctional ingredient that can act as a rheology modifier, emulsion stabiliser, moisturiser and sensorial agent while contributing to a more sustainable world. Stora Enso presented this new ingredient at Cosmetic 360 in Paris last month, where it was selected as a finalist for the Cosmetic 360 Awards. ""Our business is no longer limited to paperboard, we are developing new segments based on wood cellulose. We will soon introduce new moulded fibre applications. Much of what used to be done from fossil resources will soon be made from wood fibre,"" explains Hervé Vue, Sales Manager France at StoraEnso."
Samples: Arcade Beauty Europe commits to sustainability and recyclability,"“This issue is no longer a choice. Suppliers and brands should work hand in hand to fulfil their sustainability objectives,” starts Carl Allain, General Manager of Arcade Beauty Europe. Early this year, the Arcade Beauty Group’s subsidiary appointed former Quality Director Claudie Guérin Guilbaud as CSR Director Europe to formalize the actions already launched and take part in defining a new strategy. “All perfume & cosmetics players have changed their vision. Our key accounts have all made significant CSR commitments. It will revolutionize our sector,” adds Carl Allain. This issue is nothing new for the sample and mini-cosmetics manufacturer. But as drastic regulatory changes have been implemented and consumer preferences keep changing, it is time to speed up the process. “Last year, Arcade Beauty Europe initiated a diagnosis for all its sites to make an update on the actions already launched, whether they focused on environmental protection, employee wellness, or our impact on communities,” explains Claudie Guérin Guilbaud. Based on the results, the company set up a strategy focused on four pillars: product compliance and innovation, purchase and business ethics, operational excellence, staff involvement and community integration. The company aims to get the LUCIE label by 2025 for all its industrial sites. This label is related to standard ISO 26000 on Corporate Social Responsibility and is structured around the seven key points of the standard, turned into principles of action: respect for consumers’ and clients’ interests, environmental protection, fair operating practices and responsibility, human capital development, respect for human rights, balance between the company’s and the general interest, transparent decision-making and control system. Currently assessed by Eco Vadis, the six Arcade Beauty Europe sites already count four gold and two silver medals. The company aims for gold for all sites. Likewise, Arcade Beauty Europe is being assessed by the CDP (Carbon Discolure Program) and intends to get an AAA in 2025. Also, Arcade Beauty will define CSR scores for all technologies and products. Based on life cycle assessments, these scores will be made available to the company’s customers, together with alternative proposals to get better scores than with the existing products. Furthermore, the sample manufacturer has committed to improving CSR scores for every single new product: they have launched research on all technologies (bags, thermoformed products, etc.). For example, a recyclable bag is being designed and should be showcased at Luxe Pack Monaco. Similarly, the company has been launching APET PCR-based solutions and already claims being able to use 50% PCR in thermoformed products. Concrete examples will also be unveiled at Luxe Pack. As a result, Arcade Beauty undertakes to manufacture 80% products containing recycled materials and to only offer 100% recyclable products by 2025. “It requires finding solutions based on a single material or easily separable materials,” explains the General Manager. As regards purchases, the second pillar of the CSR policy, Arcade Beauty Europe has already launched many initiatives: FSC-certified cardboard, anti-corruption policy, CO2 emission reduction plan… The company also plans to set up a grid to assess its suppliers, as well as a system to ensure sourcing traceability. Plus, a production relocation process was launched. “We have already brought back to France part of our manufacturing activity from the US, and we will keep making such transfers, so that we no longer have to import products from our North American sites. By relocating our production, we considerably reduce our products’ CO2 impact. In 2018, 196 CO2-equivalent tonnes were saved, and we plan to exceed 250 tonnes in 2019,” explains Carl Allain. Our Asian production should also be concerned. “The idea is that every region (North America, Europe, Asia, and Brazil) should be able to serve local markets by itself.” As for operational excellence, the third pillar, new objectives were defined, in particular in terms of energy consumption reduction (GHG), VOC emissions, and waste quantity. “For every site, we are going to measure the CO2 emission levels compared to the number of units produced in order to reduce them by 10% every year. We will do the same with waste quantities, which should decline by 10% per tonne of product,” details Carl Allain. To this aim, Arcade Beauty has been investing in new technologies. For example, the silica-based filters that will be installed on the Socoplan-Socoprint site will help better treat the VOCs emitted during printing operations. The last pillar, staff involvement and community integration, has already led to a number of initiatives. “We invested a lot to offer all our employees a training course on the Arcade Beauty values. In late 2018, we conducted an anonymous satisfaction and corporate culture survey to be able to maintain our actions for team involvement. On the Thouars site, in collaboration with the French Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, Socoplan helped develop a training course on bag filling machines,” explains Carl Allain. Lastly, the “security week” organized every year will turn into a “CSR week”. Internal training courses and external programmes will be offered to all employees working on the Arcade Beauty Europe sites. All the group’s sites based in Europe will discuss these issues and harmonize their practices. Then, what is done in Europe will be reproduced on the global level. “Obviously, pressure is stronger in Europe, but our customers are international. Our key American or Brazilian accounts have also implemented demanding strategies… Our work will also help other entities within the group save time,” concludes Carl Allain."
"L’Oréal and Beiersdorf among the few companies tackling deforestation, according to CDP","""To encourage its suppliers to manage their forest footprint, L’Oréal has developed its Sustainable Palm Index, to assess suppliers’ commitments and achievements in fighting deforestation,"" the CDP recently reported. However, the report - dubbed ‘The Money Trees’ - also found that several major corporations are avoiding transparency when it comes to deforestation. The CDP and other organizations asked 1,500 companies judged to have a significant impact on forests to provide data via CDP’s reporting platform in 2018, but 70% neglected to do so. More than 350 major companies have not submitted data for the three years from 2016 through 2018, including apparel giants Next and Sports Direct. The corporations were asked to disclose data regarding timber, palm oil, cattle and soy, as well as detailing their actions taken to reduce deforestation in their supply chains. ""For too long corporations have ignored the impacts of their supply chains on the world’s forests and have not taken seriously the risks this poses - both to their business and the world,"" said Morgan Gillespy, Global Director of Forests at CDP, in a statement. ""Environmental concern is at an all-time high, and companies are being demanded to be transparent and take decisive action to protect forests. Consumers increasingly want to know that their shopping basket isn’t driving the destruction of the Amazon, extinction of the orangutans and the climate crisis."" A total of 306 companies reported data to CDP in 2018, with 24% showing no or limited action to reduce deforestation. The report concluded that the corporate transparency rate of 30% on forests remains significantly lower than that for issues such as climate change and water security — both of which have a transparency rate of 43%."
Olay joins the refillable trend in a move to reduce plastic packaging waste,"Beginning in October 2019 and running through the end of the year, Olay will offer its best-selling Olay Regenerist Whip moisturizer with a refill pod that fits right in the jar. From October to December, shoppers will thus have the option of purchasing a recyclable, refillable pod of the moisturizer, as opposed to its usual plastic jar. If this is successful and appealing enough to the consumer, that would save “over 1,000,000 lbs of plastic”, stated the brand in a release. In practical terms, during the trial time period, consumers will be able to purchase the refillable Olay Regenerist Whip package that contains one full jar of Olay Regenerist Whip and one refill pod of moisturizer that can be placed inside the jar once it’s emptied. The package will be sold and shipped in a container made of 100% recycled paper and will not contain an outer carton in order to reduce the use of paperboard. The pods themselves are made of polypropylene and are also recyclable, depending on local recycling guidelines. Plastic waste has become a major area of investment and concern for beauty brands over the past few years, with multiple companies testing out more sustainable packaging options and initiatives. Earlier this year, Procter & Gamble-owned hair care brand Herbal Essences joined forces with waste management giant TerraCycle to launch a series of bottles comprising 25% beach plastic, while Kiehl’s Since 1851 unveiled a limited-edition version of its signature ‘Rare Earth’ mask in April alongside John Legend, presented in new, lower-plastic packaging. REN Clean Skincare has pledged to become completely ""zero waste"" by the year 2021, and personal care conglomerate Unilever recently unveiled a three-part plan to target plastic use in the US, including a pledge for 50% of its plastic packaging to be made from post-consumer recycled (PCR) content by the end of 2019. As demand for environmentally friendly products is increasingly growing, refillable solutions, which have already been tested for a long time by some luxury fragrance brands, 
are gradually conquering the skincare category. Ranges like Absolue by Lancôme and Or Rouge by Yves St Laurent recently opted for such solutions, confirming the alliance between luxury and the concept of product refillability. Suppliers are particularly aware of the trend and are developing different standard or tailor-made packaging options. “A refill is not necessarily viewed as low-end. There are a lot of beautiful things to be done. Consumers should be able to find luxury in this refill, even if it is only seen once,” explains Raul Cervantes, Personal Care Market Manager of Albéa. For Absolue by Lancôme, a refillable product developed in collaboration with Heinz-Glas, for the main jar, the bottom of the cup designed by Albéa is embossed with the Lancôme Rose to relay the brand’s codes in the tiniest details. Most recently, the trend also hit the makeup segment with French colour cosmetics brand La Bouche Rouge Paris pioneering the move with a reusable and refillable luxury lipstick packaging, or with Lush’s brand-new rechargeable and recyclable plastic-free lipstick. “Beauty brands may find it beneficial to act proactively rather than letting consumers taking the initiative - with potential backlash for brands perceived as not going fast and far enough. The beauty industry is one of the most visible (it gathers one third of all interactions on social media), it comprises some of the best known and most powerful brands in the world, who might lead the way towards more virtuous and durable consumption models,” said beauty packaging expert Gerald Martines. “What is at stake is largely proportionate to the magnitude of the challenges: it is no less than inventing tomorrow’s really durable beauty, while generating engagement and new levels of brand loyalty,” he concluded."
Latest trends in sustainable cosmetics,"A symbol that is far from innocent: the tenth North American edition of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit was opened by influential writer and internet blogger Colin Beavan. Dubbed “No Impact Man”, Colin was noted for recording the attempts of his family to live a ""zero impact"" lifestyle in New York City for one year. Colin is probably the epitome of these new generations of consumers who are increasingly aware of the impacts they create in their everyday lives and try not just to reduce, but also create positive impacts. Among the key trends highlighted at the summit are: Packaging innovations. With growing consumer awareness of plastic pollution, the beauty industry is facing pressure to reduce its packaging impacts. Examples of innovative packaging solutions were presented. Seed Phytonutrients gave details of its compostable bottle made from post-consumer paper, whilst the Korean company InnerBottle showed how its new packaging technology creates zero waste. The way forward appears to be innovation rather than incrementalism measures like light-weighting. Scrutiny of supply chains. Raw material supply chains are becoming increasingly scrutinized for environmental and social risks. Verisk Maplecroft Research showed that shea butter, silk, vanilla, and cocoa are cosmetic ingredients with some of the highest social risks; these include human trafficking, child labour, discrimination and land grabs. Using essential oils as an example, Dee-Ann Prather from Down Under Enterprises showed how ingredient suppliers can provide traceability in their supply chains. Since adulteration is a major issue, the Australian supplier is looking at blockchain technology. New sources of green ingredients are emerging. DuPont showed how it has created its Genencare OSMS BA material from food side streams. Genomatica is creating butylene glycol from plant sugars, whilst Aprinnova is making squalane from sugarcane. Details were also given on how plant cell technology is being utilized to produce active ingredients. Green packaging materials. Andrew Dent from Material ConneXion highlighted the issue with existing packaging materials: less than 5% of plastics are recycled in the US. He called for brands to look at green materials so they can prepare for a circular economy. Examples were given of recycled materials, compostable packaging, and recent innovations. Bio-engineered solutions on the horizon involve algae, fungi and bacteria. New business models. TerraCycle showed how brands can move away from single-use packaging via its new Loop shopping platform. Described as a ‘circular shopping platform’, Loop enables packaging to be returned to brands and re-used. Loop made its debut in the US last month; partners include P&G, Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive, Walgreens and Kroger. Natural & organic cosmetics. According to The Benchmarking Company, 68% of American females purchase natural & organic beauty products, up from 49% in 2008. Health reasons are the primary factor, cited by 73% of buyers. The adoption rates are expected to continue to rise as consumer demographics change… Look beyond organic. Diana Martin from the Rodale Institute called for farmers to adopt regenerative agricultural systems. The new Regenerative Organic Certification adds soil health, fair trade, and animal welfare to existing organic farming practices. The new scheme currently has 21 pilots worldwide and is backed by leading operators, such as Dr. Bronner’s Magic Soaps and Patagonia. Create marketing experiences. The Millennials and Gen Z now represent half of American consumers. According to Sourabh Sharma from FIG Or Out, these growing influential consumers expect sustainability to be a core value of companies. He called for brands to create marketing experiences for these consumers. Winners in the digital age are likely to be brands which utilize social media, deliver clear communications, and create a brand / product story. Sustainability discussions will continue in the next edition: Sustainable Cosmetics Summit Europe

Sustainability: Asian consumers increasingly aware of biodiversity,"Asian consumers have a higher awareness of biodiversity than consumers in the UK, US or Germany.  Actually, most Asian consumers have ‘heard of biodiversity,’ according to data published in the 2019 UEBT Biodiversity Barometer [1], an ongoing set of research that has spanned more than a decade and is updated annually. This year’s edition focused on consumer insights from four countries in Asia: China, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam. One major takeaway from the research has been that Asian consumer awareness of biodiversity has increased over the last decade. In Asia, as in other countries, youth is the category with the highest level of awareness of biodiversity: 86% of young (16-24 year) Asian respondents are aware of biodiversity. Asian youth are also seeking concrete actions from companies, with most saying that they would like companies to inform them about “the concrete actions they take to ensure they respect biodiversity and people when they source the natural ingredients use.” More generally speaking, a majority of Asian consumers surveyed also have strong expectations towards companies. In Asia, as in the Western countries, a large majority of respondents believes that companies should have a positive impact on society, people and biodiversity. Consumer confidence that companies are having such impact is high in Vietnam (76%, up 16 points from 2014 on total agree) and China (74%). With 45% confidence rates, respondents in Japan and South Korea are more sceptical, somewhat in line with the findings in Western countries. Actually, UEBT’s research found a gap in consumer confidence related to a company’s actions: in other words, consumers have higher awareness of biodiversity and think it’s important, but they have lower confidence that companies are protecting biodiversity. Almost a quarter of Japanese respondents (24%) said they don’t know if companies pay serious attention to biodiversity. Among different kinds of information available on product packaging, respondents in Asia attach most importance to the origin of product ingredients. Additionally, they would like information on the impact on biodiversity (e.g. no deforestation, support for bees, wild flowers, replanting). As in Western countries, this is given more importance than the social impact (working conditions, health and safety of local workers), or the fair compensation of supply chain actors. In Brazil, respondents mentioned the impact on biodiversity as the most important issue. “We felt the time was right to dive deeper into consumers’ insights from Asia. In 2020, China will host the UN Summit on Biodiversity, which will define the global plan on biodiversity for the next decade. Chinese leadership in this major global event underscores the role that Asia has in protecting the world’s biodiversity. This also means there is an opportunity for business to take concrete action to position their brands in Asian markets as leaders in sourcing with respect for people and biodiversity,” said Rik Kutsch Lojenga, UEBT’s Executive Director."
Chemical recycling: a new solution for plastic packaging,"In light of the challenge of the century, i.e. reducing the world’s plastic consumption and better managing packaging end-of-life, recycling solutions have gained popularity: the EU has actually set out ambitious objectives compelling manufacturers to offer packaging 50% made of recycled plastic by 2025. However, as they depend on more or less mature collecting installations, depending on the countries, and on hardly flexible thermo-mechanical recycling technologies, recycling players are struggling to meet demand for plastic in such quantities. “We are aiming for waste flows that just do not exist. Today, 1 million tonnes of collected plastic per year are missing to reach this goal,” says Martin Stephan, Deputy Managing Director of Carbios, a bioplastics-processing company and a pioneer in chemical recycling based in Clermont-Ferrand, France. “The EU estimates that 4 billion euros need to be invested in Europe to fulfil the 2025 objectives.” The thermo-mechanical technology involves crushing and melting specific types of plastic, usually the most common types, but not coloured. Today, this process has the advantage of increasing the plastic shelf-life, but there is a huge constraint involving the limited quantity of resource available for a qualitative result that is less satisfactory than the virgin material. “Mechanical recycling has its own limits, because you cannot recycle the same pack indefinitely: plastic gradually loses its mechanical properties. In addition, many contaminating products cannot be removed,” explains Martin Stephan. Given the huge challenge rPET (recycled PET) sourcing represents, plastic processing startups and manufacturers have already started working on a new recycling generation based on a PET depolymerisation and repolymerization chemical process. Contrary to the mechanical process, this technology has the tremendous advantage of resulting in a completely virgin resin after the recycling process. “Starting with 100% waste, this technology can generate a much more interesting volume with the same quality as the virgin material,” explains Gilles Swyngedauw, Innovation and CSR Director of Albéa, who have just signed the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, thus committing to the circular economy principle. Brands are now taking action, ordering their own plastic from the future suppliers of this new green gold. Among others, L’Oréal and L’Occitane have signed partnership agreements with Loop Industries, a Canadian pioneer in the chemical recycling technology. In France, Carbios is currently industrializing a promising solution based on an enzymatic transformation process. “Thanks to an enzyme specific to PET, we break down the molecule chain of plastic. Our process destructures the polymer to get the two original monomers back. Then, we just repolymerize them to obtain a material identical to virgin PET,” explains Martin Stephan. This technology will help petrochemicals specialists produce “virgin” PET, not only based on petrol, but based on waste, including clothes made of polyester and coloured plastics, indefinitely. The first productions should be available in 2023/2024. “It is not reuse, it is really recycling,” he adds. For packaging manufacturers, the first to be confronted with sourcing constraints, the prospect of chemical recycling definitely represents the opportunity for an additional, more qualitative resource. Still, some of them have raised questions about this new model. In fact, by providing rPET suppliers in the R&D phase with financial support through volume preorders, brands impose a unique choice of supplier to their packaging manufacturer partners in the future. “This model is quite surprising, because transformers are not part of the process. In the traditional value chain, you have the raw material supplier, who supplies the transformer, who supplies the final customer. Tomorrow, raw materials will be imposed by brands, which is likely to have a strong impact on the whole value chain. Manufacturers will no longer be able to decide what they purchase, and in the event of a manufacturing issue, several players will share responsibility. This type of approach can be dangerous,” says Vincent Joffre, Sales Manager of PRP Création. For now, these partnership announcements offer brands an obvious media representation, while enhancing competition as regards this much-awaited technology."
"“Integrating sustainability enhances trust in brands,” Frédéric Dreux, Unilever Prestige","Premium Beauty News - What are the improvement drivers in cosmetics packaging in 2019? Frédéric Dreux - The main driver that should keep enhancing innovation is related to the functionalities of packaging, i.e. delivering the product in a more luxurious, surprising, and safe way. The objective is also to improve the benefit provided by the formula by means of the delivery system. It is an important aspect, although it is not always salient in the current packs, but it is very well conveyed by the customization trend. Of course, real innovation is about achieving this delivery performance following a sustainable approach. That is the main challenge today – the improvement that is most needed. The cosmetics industry is aware of it, and everyone understands it should be done without changing the main functions of packaging. There has been a significant acceleration in this field in the cosmetics industry, as can be seen with the recent product launches and manufacturers’ offering, increasingly based on recycled or recyclable materials. It is interesting to see how this shared environmental responsibility reinforces relationships between brands and manufacturers. We share this common goal no one can achieve without the others. Premium Beauty News - Can you think of any other challenges related to packaging innovation? Frédéric Dreux - There is a challenge related to customization, not only in terms of delivery, but also in terms of more individualized packs. A step has been made, in particular thanks to digital printing. As for connected packaging, it will become a real trend when there is a real benefit for consumers. I do not think that this point has been reached yet. Premium Beauty News - Let’s go back to sustainable packaging. Is it possible to combine ecodesign with economic performance? Frédéric Dreux - It is a mistake to oppose them. In the short and medium term, a sustainable positioning actually results in stronger economic performance. Brands with an authentic purpose grow much faster. Economic performance is related to sustainability. I am even tempted to say that if a company cannot combine them, it really takes a risk in the short or medium term. At Unilever Prestige, we see this as an opportunity. If you manage to create a premium consumer experience integrating sustainability, you develop a long-lasting model which enhances trust in the brand and removes the guilt consumers may feel when they use a product that cannot be recycled. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, how do you manage this aspect for all the different brands in the group? Frédéric Dreux - There are many different ways to offer consumers sustainable experiences. Every brand in our Prestige segment remains independent and keeps their own identity: the same principles are applied differently, whether in packaging or communication. It is the same common goal, but execution is adapted to each brand. They share common points, like plastics recyclability or the use of recycled materials, but what changes is how we convey this. We also consider offering an alternative to plastic by introducing other materials, like glass, wood, metal, or other new materials emerging on the market. We need to play on all levels: these possibilities represent different sources of inspiration, so we have to use them as an innovation driver. Premium Beauty News - Among the group’s brands, REN Clean Skincare is seen as a spearhead, given their strong zero waste positioning. How is that conveyed in terms of packaging? Frédéric Dreux - In our portfolio, REN Clean Skincare is an  activist brand, from formulas to packaging. This zero waste positioning is a real inspiration, a guidance that provides a framework to all the decisions made by the brand, in practice and on all levels. As regards packaging, it is conveyed by a recyclability and material reuse requirement. When a brand asserts this position, it strengthens its communication arguments and does not hesitate to show it uses an important percentage of recycled materials, in particular with Ocean Plastic, despite the aspect or colour. Rather than see it as a constraint, we integrate it in the packaging design. It is also important to stay connected to trends, in particular in chemical recycling, which is accelerating. In the future, we all hope to be able to use fully transparent recycled materials for example. What we are working on does not just involve what we have, but also what we will have tomorrow. Premium Beauty News - Is the LOOP platform dedicated to zero waste, reasoned purchases one of these promising solutions? REN Clean Skincare has committed to using it. Frédéric Dreux - It is an excellent opportunity to fulfil our objective. The main way to adopt a zero waste strategy is to no longer consider packaging as waste, but as something that can be reused, without getting out of the chain. That is what LOOP offers. It is the first time we have gone that far in packaging reuse. It is an innovative packaging model: the high-end packs are sustainable, delivered, resent and refilled for our consumers. This packaging collection or reconditioning approach is aimed to reoffer the product: it helps enhance the consumer refill experience and keep the premium quality of the packs through e-commerce and home delivery. Not only does it differ from the usual waste management models, but it provides packaging with a real functionality over time. It is no longer a linear, single-use model. Premium Beauty News - Do you consider adopting this solution for the other brands in the group? Frédéric Dreux - Starting from this summer, we are going to participate to the test in real life with REN Clean Skincare. Then, the model will be enhanced based on this first experience to become self-sustainable. The keys will be things such as consumers’ reactions, compliance and logistic fluidity aspects for example. If you want to give a chance to this type of model, you should not give up when the first obstacles arise, and instead push for continuous improvement. It is the sort of initiatives that can fundamentally change things."
L’Oréal partners with Gjosa to unveil eco-friendly shower and shampoo combination,"The beauty giant and the tech company have unveiled a low-flow showerhead and an easy-rinse shampoo combination that means the amount of water needed to wash the hair is significantly reduced from 8 litres to 1.5 litres. The showerhead breaks up the flow of water but counterbalances that by accelerating the speed of the droplets, while the easier-to-rinse shampoo is applied directly through the showerhead, rather than being applied to the scalp. By infusing water and shampoo simultaneously, the showerhead could cut the volume of water and the energy used in places like professional hair salons. Prototypes are currently being tested in salons in South Africa and the US. ""Initial results offer great perspectives for an innovation that visibly reduces the water consumption in our daily hygiene practices,"" said said Laurent Attal, L’Oréal VP Research & Innovation, in a statement. ""This breakthrough technology is perfectly in line with our commitments to sustainable innovation."" The move comes as fashion and beauty brands ramp up their efforts to reduce water consumption, as a potential shortage of the essential resource becomes a growing global concern. Earlier this year, Gap Inc. laid out detailed plans to reduce water wastage along its supply chain, having recently pledged to save 10 billion liters of water by the end of 2020, while fashion and lifestyle conglomerate PVH Corp., which owns Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, has also entered into a partnership with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to conserve water resources in Africa and India."
The consumer goods industry moves to act on plastic pollution,"Over 290 member organizations of the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) signed The New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in collaboration with UN Environment Program, on October 29, 2018. The document aims to reduce plastic waste through a variety of targets, such as eliminating single-use plastic from supply chains and ensuring that 100 percent of plastic packaging can be easily and safely reused, recycled, or composted by 2025. L’Oréal, Johnson & Johnson, Colgate Palm olive and Unilever are three of the beauty giants to have signed the commitment, while big-name signatories from the fashion world include H&M, Burberry and Stella McCartney. Packaging producers such as Albéa, the world’s leading manufacturer of packaging for the beauty industry, are also among the signatories. Others range from Nestlé and Coca-Cola Femsa to Walmart and Target, with the total list of signatories representing 20 percent of all packaging produced globally. ""We know that cleaning up plastics from our beaches and oceans is vital, but this does not stop the tide of plastic entering the oceans each year,"" said Dame Ellen MacArthur, who announced the commitment at the ’Our Ocean Conference’ in Bali on 29 and 30 October 2018. ""We need to move upstream to the source of the flow. The New Plastics Economy Global Commitment draws a line in the sand, with businesses, governments and others around the world uniting behind a clear vision for what we need to create a circular economy for plastic."" Brands that have signed the commitment will report their progress every year, as targets become more ambitious. ""We are embracing the issue of packaging reform as both a challenge to do better and an opportunity to do good,"" said Alison Lewis, Global Chief Marketing Officer at Johnson & Johnson Consumer. ""We believe this initiative can be a powerful catalyst for driving meaningful changes in our behavior as a company-as well as the behavior of consumers themselves."" ""The challenge of plastic waste is real and urgent. We’re committed to doing our part to ensure the plastic we need is safely and economically, reused, recycled or composted,” added Ian Cook, Chairman and CEO of Colgate-Palmolive. The CGF members that have signed the declaration are committed to working together in three areas: packaging design, consumer engagement and recycling systems. Plastic waste is becoming a big issue for the consumer goods industry, including the cosmetics and personal care sector. At the latest Luxe Pack Monaco trade show, several packaging suppliers have showcased alternative solutions using biosourced, recycled or upcycled materials, as well as refillable packaging solutions specially designed for high-end products."
"“We have reconciled environmental performance with economic performance,” Alexandra Palt, L’Oréal","Premium Beauty News - Why did you create SPOT, a unique assessment tool in the cosmetics industry? Alexandra Palt - We wanted to reach our 2020 goal – improving the environmental or social profile of all our products. To this aim, we assessed the change levers, but we needed an operational tool which all our brands could use on a daily basis. SPOT was designed with international experts and submitted to several stakeholders. Every product we develop is now scrutinized by this assessment tool. If it is a renewal, the environmental and social performance of the new product is compared with that of the previous product. If it is an innovation, the reference will be the average of the category of the product under development. We estimate that in seven years, 90% to 100% of all L’Oréal products will be evaluated by SPOT. In any case, we need to increase all the marks obtained. Premium Beauty News - What are your improvement areas? Alexandra Palt -  We study the water footprint of the formula, its biodegradability, the content of plant-derived and sustainably sourced ingredients, but also the size, weight, shape, and materials of the packaging. Premium Beauty News - Are the first results of the “Sharing Beauty With All” programme encouraging? Alexandra Palt - We should achieve most of our objectives by the deadlines set across the whole programme. Some of them have already been exceeded by far. For example, we have reduced our carbon emissions by 73% compared to 2005, while the objective set was 60%, and the production volume rose by 33% over the same period. That is already exceptional. What should be highlighted is that we have completely transformed our business approach. Sustainable development is taken into account in every single strategic decision made and every time we start developing a product. It is fully integrated to how we do our job. I think that is what makes us one of the companies with the most widely recognized sustainable development performance in the world. [NB: L’Oréal is one of only two companies in the world – the only French company – out of the over 3,000 evaluated to have been awarded three “As” in 2017, i.e. the best score, for the rankings established by CDP, an organization aimed to study the impact of companies on climate change]. Premium Beauty News - Are consumers following the same trend as regards environmental convictions? Alexandra Palt - Consumers quickly change. Changes can already be observed, but most studies demonstrate that although people have more and more convictions and expectations in terms of sustainable development, everyone does not express them in their buying behaviours."
Henkel announces ambitious targets for sustainable packaging,"Sustainability is not new to Henkel.  The consumer goods company [1] claims that all of its packaging is “designed to meet consumers’ expectations while using the least possible amount of material - and the most sustainable materials.” However, the group now aims to adopt a more holistic approach through a new strategic framework reflecting the three key phases of a circular value chain. Henkel’s new sustainable packaging strategy translates each of these phases into specific actions: – Materials from sustainable sources. Henkel commits itself to including an increasing share of sustainable materials into its product packaging - this relates both to its use of recycled materials, especially recycled plastic, and renewable materials such as paper and cardboard.
– Smart packaging design. According to Henkel, smart design is key to facilitate the use of recycled or renewable packaging materials. Furthermore, the group will explore innovative solutions along the entire value chain, e.g. in the field of transport packaging and related logistics. In addition, Henkel aims at continuing its efforts to reduce the amount of packaging material it uses.
– Closing the loop. Henkel commits to making sure its product packaging can be recycled after the product has been consumed, e.g. by entering into partnerships to promote appropriate systems for recycling. In addition, the company wants to further explore solutions like refill systems which allow consumers to reuse packaging. Henkel is also actively searching for materials that enable packaging to be returned into nature - such as biodegradable materials that meet international composting standards. “It is more important than ever for companies, consumers, governments and other organizations to drive progress toward a circular economy. Only by reusing and recycling as much material as possible will we be able to live well within the resource limits of our planet. This concept is at the heart of our approach to sustainable packaging,” says Kathrin Menges, Executive Vice President Human Resources at Henkel and Chair of Henkel’s Sustainability Council. “Together with our partners along the entire value chain, we want to include materials from sustainable sources into smart designs to close the loop – for the benefit of people and the planet.” In order to further drive innovation in sustainable packaging development and promote improved recycling infrastructure, Henkel is collaborating with a variety of partners, including the Ellen MacArthur Foundation that brings stakeholders together to rethink and redesign the future of plastics and build momentum toward a circular economy, and the Plastic Bank, a social enterprise aiming to stop ocean plastic and provide opportunities for people in poverty by giving them a chance to earn money or services by removing plastic waste from their local environment."
France will list substances suspected to be harmful to coral reefs,"French Deputy Minister for Environment Brune Poirson, announced Wednesday, 1st of August, the launch of an ""Ocean Mission"" in order to tackle chemical and plastic pollutions. The project will include an inventory of the chemical substances that are particularly toxic for marine ecosystems and coral reefs while being present in consumer products such as cosmetics, sunscreens or detergents. The French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) will take over responsibility for identifying the substances of greatest concern and “proposing appropriate regulatory measures.” Les coraux représentent 1% de la surface des océans mais abritent 25% des espèces marines. Cette richesse de biodiversité, nous devons la protéger.Avec son 2e espace maritime au monde, la 🇫🇷 a une vraie responsabilité.

Biodiversity: measuring actions & raising consumer awareness,"To talk about these projects, Laurent Boillot, CEO of Guerlain, and Sandrine Sommer, CSR & Sustainable Development Director, gathered Stéphane d’Halluin, Project Manager Sustainable Development and External Relations at Botanic, Karine Viel, Sustainable Development/CSR Director of Monoprix, and Cécile Joucan, Environmental Officer at LVMH. All speakers wanted to emphasize the voluntary nature of their commitment, born from a specific need within their own companies. “For Guerlain, it is just obvious we should take care of biodiversity. Without bees, there are no flowers, and without flowers, there are no perfumes,” Sandrine Sommer highlighted. As soon as he took office, Laurent Boillot implemented a business strategy based on four main aspects: climate, eco-design, biodiversity, and social and societal impacts. The brand uses measuring tools to assess the impact of its actions, like packaging reduction, by developing a refillable bottle or delivering products with a 100% electric truck aptly named “Le Bourdon” (“The Bumblebee”). In terms of sustainable development, measuring and traceability tools tend to get more and more widely used at LVMH. As part of eco-design approaches, it helps validate the relevance of the materials chosen, like organic cotton, or check the origin of raw materials. At Botanic, the fourth network of garden centres in France, this commitment is focused on traceability. To better control supplies, the company choses French suppliers whenever possible for their horticulture products. They got involved about ten years ago, following an NGO warning about the hazard of some pesticides in their range. From then on, thanks to the support of the company’s family structure, Botanic turned to naturalness, despite a significant loss of turnover at the beginning. Again, Botanic uses measuring tools to assess the impact of their products. The brand also holds the Plante Bleue certificate (horticulture). Monoprix’s commitment to biodiversity mainly concerns food: organic foodstuffs represent about 9% of sales, thanks to key decisions like choice editing, i.e. stop distributing “dubious” products. Just like eggs from hens kept in battery cages, which Monoprix has no longer referenced since 2016. The suppliers involved in the Cultiv’acteurs programme or holding the Bee Friendly label are also rewarded. As regards communication, Guerlain favours a didactic approach, by raising awareness of their environmental commitment among their consumers in store. “We explain why we choose such or such ingredient for our products and how we cultivate them, like honey from Ouessant, for example,” Sandrine Sommer explains. Botanic adopted the same strategy. “When we reviewed our charter and range, we lost a few customers at first, because they did not like the fact that they could no longer find some of their usual products. So, we focused on our sales teams’ training to better explain our strategy to our consumers,” Stéphane d’Halluin recalls. At Monoprix, we believe this issue is not really relevant, because consumers are increasingly more concerned about what ends up in their dishes. Instead, we aim to raise consumer awareness of the technical aspect of production. Today, it is essential to strengthen bonds between scientific and social expertise, as well as companies’ expertise, so as to preserve our biodiversity – just like it is fundamental to officially communicate on that issue. Bees are a strong symbol, because they are sort of our ecosystem’s umbrella. If we protect them, we also protect ourselves."
Why are luxury brands so discreet about their sustainable commitments?,"Premium Beauty News - Why do the luxury brands that have long implemented a CSR strategy with tangible actions and results put so little emphasis on it for their consumers? Gildas Bonnel - That is what we, at the agency, call ‘green hiding’. It should be understood that in a few sectors, and it is particularly true for luxury, companies would like to avoid the scourge of criticism. For communicators, the most widely shared feeling is that there are more attacks to be feared than benefits to be expected when you put forward this progressive approach. That being said, things are changing. A new offering is arriving, in particular on the beauty market. The new value proposal with simpler ranges and products and the strong commitment to social and environmental issues result in a few Maisons and major brands fearing they might look old hat and miss a powerful societal trend. That is why I give the following advice: when a company is ready, when there is actual evidence of the management, objectives, and roadmap to reduce social and environmental impacts, I am the first to recommend going for it. I have much encouraged Maison Guerlain to communicate on their sustainable development policy, because there is a real expectation among the different publics. In addition, communication puts companies in tension. When you communicate, you get involved. You cannot go back, you can only go forward and meet your own challenges. It is always risky to make changes or reforms. What was done by Guerlain for Orchidée Impériale – with a 40% packaging volume and weight reduction – was really brave. Innovation and communication paid off and customers were convinced by the proposal: they did not turn their backs on the product, quite the contrary. Communication is what helps lead the way and get everyone involved, both employees and customers. Premium Beauty News - How can you speak up on these issues when you are a prestigious historic brand? Gildas Bonnel - For us, these are issues we should discreetly talk about with customers and opinion leaders, rather than creating whole ad campaigns. It is a ‘long term’ strategy based on more influence, encounters, and interventions of the CEO. It corresponds to luxury companies perfectly well. They do not want to be ostentatious and preach doctrines: they prefer to work on these issues in depth with those that make the opinion. Premium Beauty News - Is it not dangerous to play this long-term card when it all goes so fast? Gildas Bonnel - Not if you work on the substance… if, meanwhile, the company is on a war footing and, like Guerlain, if it is building up a strategy and sincere and relevant communication elements. Premium Beauty News - Should these big luxury names not set the example? Gildas Bonnel - There is a great ambivalence on the market, which is why it can be so difficult for brands to work out these transitions. As can be seen in their declarations, consumers are ready for many changes, but at the same time, they do not want to be rushed, even the most involved. So, it is important to take it one step at a time and not get ahead of ourselves. However, these companies should think about more disruptive offerings, as Guerlain did by incubating with ethic brand Cha Ling. The thread is thin, it is all about balance and will."
Refillable perfumes: new luxury & responsible gesture?,"Mugler, and now Louis Vuitton, Guerlain, Viktor&Rolf, By Kilian… several big names of the luxury world have been taking over the concept of “parfum ressourçable” (refillable perfume) to provide the product with an additional value and revive the bottle aura. Loïc Bouet, Customer Service Manager of Techniplast, the French plastic part specialist that created several refill solutions, confirms this trend. “We work a lot with many luxury brands, like those belonging to the LVMH and L’Oréal groups – they are very interested in our systems. All luxury brands can feel the growing demand for reducing the environmental impact on all levels. There is work done upstream on the manufacturing chain, but also downstream, on the level of the final user, by making it possible to no longer throw away their bottles,” he says. Just like the food industry, the perfume and cosmetics market has been studying refill solutions from the eco-design standpoint. In addition, alcohol-based perfumes, which are hardly concerned by bacterial contamination issues, are actually suitable for several consecutive refills. However, ressourçage mainly involves refilling the bottle by unscrewing the pump, and the problem is that most products are packed with a pump fastened on the bottle neck. Once closed, you cannot reopen the bottle and refill it. That is why manufacturers have been working on new solutions. Distribution systems specialist Aptar Beauty+Home has noticed a return to more flexible solutions. “Systematically or almost, major brands ask us to create a version of their range with pumps that can be disassembled. The idea is either to make the bottle refillable, or to be able to separate the pump from the bottle, so that the product can be appropriately recycled. We have been working on new topics,” explains Patrick Bousquel, Director Market Development of Aptar Beauty+Home. Other than their RT Lift, RT Twist, and spout tip systems to refill perfume bottles fitted with screw necks, Techniplast also developed a unique, patented technology called RT Plug to deal with the problem of set pumps and make it possible to fill in all types of bottles, even those with a pump that cannot be unscrewed. The idea is to place the bottle to be refilled upside down on the source, so that the pump is in the open position. A small engine controlled by an electronic card increases the pressure in the refill bottle positioned below 0.5 bar. This pressure helps transfer the perfume through a tube network from the refill to the customer bottle. The concept seduced the Louis Vuitton development team, as they selected it for their fragrance line launched in 2016. “It is part of the Vuitton high-end product philosophy. The product is not thrown away, it is kept because it is a Vuitton product. We have provided a solution to be able to keep this beautiful object, which can be personalized and carved to revive its importance,” adds Loïc Bouet. Although it is still rare, the perfume source concept does have several advantages, including that of restoring the value of the bottle, which reflects the luxury of the product, and which most consumers are reluctant to throw away. “We are definitely in line with the luxury codes. When you throw something away, you pollute, and there is nothing elegant about that, which is all the more true for perfumes. The ressourçable bottle is an opportunity to revive the object’s magnitude. At Pochet, we deeply believe in this, so we have been working on the notion of a ‘different luxury’,” confirms Isabelle Lallemant, International Marketing & Innovation Director of the glassmaking group. Gildas Bonnel, President of the Sidièse agency specialized in responsible communication and consulting for Guerlain, also emphasizes the importance of the customer relationship built up with this strategy. “Luxury codes are much more interesting in the sales rituals than in the overabundance of the material. Guerlain offer their customers to appropriate and personalize this very beautiful Abeille bottle, which is part of the brand’s history, and then refill it at the store perfume fountain. It is all about the customer’s huge interest in living a new experience. There is something much more exclusive and personalized about it, which corresponds to luxury codes,” he explains. Whatever the method, a fountain or a refill fitted with a spout tip, the solution consisting in refilling bottles in perfume stores also significantly impacts the niche perfumery market popular for its alternative market approach. “Brands have an opportunity to invent a different luxury world, refresh its codes and communication, and find new concepts to differentiate themselves,” concludes Patrick Bousquel."
Garnier partners with TerraCycle and DoSomething to promote recycling of beauty plastic wastes,"Mandy Moore and Garnier are on a mission to cut down the amount of beauty packaging that ends up in landfills.  The ""This Is Us"" actress and singer-songwriter and the beauty giant have teamed up with the organizations DoSomething.org and TerraCycle on a campaign to encourage young beauty fans to recycle their bathroom empties.  Dubbed ""Rinse, Recycle, Repeat,"" the campaign provides information about how to separate personal hygiene products so that they can be properly recycled. Garnier is offering participants special bathroom recycling bins that they can decorate in their own style, sharing photos of their efforts for the chance to win a US$5,000 scholarship. Once the bins have been filled, beauty buffs will be able to print off a free shipping label to send off the empties to be responsibly recycled by TerraCycle. According to Garnier, nearly half of Americans do not recycle their beauty and personal care products, which is why they account for a significant amount of waste found in landfills. “Beauty and personal care products with a number #1 or #2 on the packaging can be recycled through curbside recycling programs, but many beauty products cannot. Items such as flexible tubes, caps, pumps for shampoo bottles, lipstick, eyeliner and many others cannot be recycled curbside and must be separated. This year’s national campaign will focus on educating participants on the proper way to recycle by giving them recycling tips on what can and cannot be recycled. The campaign will also showcase best practices to identify recyclable items, such as checking the numbers on packaging before tossing it out,” explains the brand in a release. On April 1st, a college competition will kick off on 50 college campuses nationwide to collect the most beauty empties. The college team that collects the most empties by April 30 will be rewarded with a garden for their community furnished by Garnier and TerraCycle. Last year, Union College won the 2017 Rinse, Recycle, Repeat College Competition. The team was awarded a Garnier Green Garden planted in their local community of Lincoln, Nebraska. Launched in 2011, the Garnier Beauty Recycling Program in partnership with TerraCycle - the world’s leader in the collection and repurposing of hard-to-recycle post-consumer waste - has diverted more than 10 million empties from landfills. These empties have been turned into pelletized plastic lumber for raised garden beds, benches, trash receptacles and other elements for community parks, playgrounds and gardens in Nebraska, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio and New York."
Metsä Board innovates with an ever more sustainable gift box,"Initially unveiled at the last Luxe Pack show in Monaco, the new version of Metsä Board’s Skincare Box was presented in detail in Paris during the PCD 2018 show. Created by Metsä Board’s packaging design team, the new SkinCare 2.0 gift box demonstrates a more environmentally friendly packaging design through the use of lighter weight paperboard materials and the elimination of the plastic wrap. In addition, each box design offers a unique opening and reclosing experience combined with maximum runnability performance on automated packaging lines. “The number of people in this planet is growing – by 2030 we will be 8.5 billion. Simultaneously, the number of products and packaging put on the market is growing too. As a consequence, plastic waste is becoming a major issue.  According to a report published last year by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, by 2050 there will be more plastic in the oceans than fish measured by weight,” explained Cyril Drouet, Metsä Board’s Design & Innovation Director. As a pioneer in lightweight paperboard, Metsä Board intends to help its customer to address these new challenges. The first innovation of the SkinCare 2.0 gift box can be seen with the outer rigid box which is made with a new pulp moulding process - especially designed for Metsä Fibre’s pure fresh fibre pulp. The inner fitment is made of a plastic-like polymer derived from wood and sugar cane fibres for a 100% recyclable packaging. This method offers an alternative to conventional thermoformed plastic providing a sustainable and fully biodegradable solution. The lid, base and inner inserts are extremely rigid, lightweight and smooth on both sides. This new method allows for good printing results; the lid and base are printed with water based ink, providing a natural and soft touch feel. The window cut-out on the lid partially shows the contents. For this new edition Metsä Board decided not to use a removable plastic window ensuring that this solution only uses one material. Beyond the rigid gift box, Mestä Board also investigated innovation avenues for secondary packaging and made three proposals: – The first inner box offers an innovative opening experience, without compromising the assembly on conventional fast packing lines. The pack opens when a small amount of pressure is applied at the front, breaking the perforations and allowing the lid to gently slide out. The inner linerboard base slowly unfolds giving a unique consumer experience typically seen on high-end rigid boxes. According to Metsä Board, these new features combined with light-weighted material result in a 25% packaging reduction compared with a traditional design.
– The second packaging structure is completely sealed on the top and bottom eliminating the need for a security label or plastic wrap whilst it is displayed on a shop shelf. The box opens by a small press on the front that breaks the tamper evident perforations and slowly unfolds. The lid can also be reclosed to its original position.
– The third box structure features a simplified half-cut opening mechanism. According to Metsä Board, these features and raw material light-weighting have resulted in a 30% reduction in packaging content compared with a traditional design. ""For more than 150 years, rigid boxes have been successfully employed in merchandising high-end products, including jewellery, cosmetics and spirits. As luxury brands are increasing their digital presence, more and more rigid boxes are travelling directly to consumer’s doors.  It is therefore more important than ever to offer innovative sustainable solutions,"" concludes Cyril Drouet."
"Guerlain, luxury cosmetics flag-bearer for sustainable development ","Premium Beauty News - In 2007, luxury and sustainable development hardly worked hand in hand. How was this initiative born? Sandrine Sommer - It was born from a strong-willed man, Laurent Boillot, who had just taken over Maison Guerlain. Sustainable commitment was mainly a personal belief. But beyond that, sustainable development definitely had to be an integral part of the company’s strategy to develop, pass on, and preserve Guerlain’s heritage. Premium Beauty News - Protection of bees (they are the Maison’s emblem), biodiversity, climate, eco-design, social responsibility… your commitment is global and you have already made very concrete achievements, like the new Orchidée Impériale pack lightened by 60%. After 10 years, what are your greatest satisfactions? Sandrine Sommer - Internal mobilization and involvement, first. From the very beginning, we implemented an efficient collaborative organization with a “sustainable development” steering committee composed of 18 people from every department in the company. For sustainable development to be a project on the level of the whole company, with a real will to change and the right structure to do it, and for our employees to be the best ambassadors, it was essential for me to have all trades involved and get one referent per department. In addition, I am very proud of having brought up to date the Abeille bottles, making them indefinitely refillable, thanks to our perfume fountains. To me, the perfumer Guerlain concept embodies sustainable luxury. And we have great ambitions to gradually deploy the concept. Premium Beauty News - What are your objectives for 2020? Sandrine Sommer - There are many of them, but they can be grouped into four main challenges: biodiversity preservation. We already work with sustainable sourcing players for Guerlain’s iconic raw materials. Also, we have made a lot of efforts for bee protection, in particular on Brittany’s Île d’Ouessant, and we are now developing our projects on the global level. The second challenge for us is ecodesign. It is probably one of the most complex. The idea is to make things as, or even more beautiful, while preserving the planet’s resources. We aim for 100% of our new products to be ecodesigned by 2020. Then, as far as climate is concerned, we have committed to reduce our CO2 emissions by half compared to 2007, for example by choosing maritime transport. Lastly, as regards social responsibility, definitely one of our own priorities, we support a global association dedicated to self-esteem: Look Good Feel Better. They offer women receiving cancer treatment free beauty workshops in hospitals. By 2020, we would like to be able to support them in all countries where Guerlain has settled. Premium Beauty News - How did the transition go with your suppliers? Sandrine Sommer - We worked together with the LVMH Perfume & Cosmetics branch to develop a responsible purchasing charter and define a number of guidelines that would help us make progress. The charter was co-set up with steering suppliers and is used as a working basis to go forward together, that was most important. Premium Beauty News - How did you make the notions of environmental protection and luxury match? Sandrine Sommer - They are not incompatible, there are actually matching elements between luxury and sustainable development that are almost natural, even consubstantial, in particular the notions of long periods of time, of the selection of rare and precious raw materials that require protection, or of know-how that needs to be passed on… On the contrary, it can be difficult to communicate, because we are aware of the fact that we are not exemplary yet – no one is. It is an issue on which we have been innovating on a daily basis. Many luxury companies have been working for a long time on this, but they do not make it public that much. Guerlain has only just started, but we still want to keep humble and sincere in how we do it. It is a continuous improvement process, a long, step-by-step building process, without compromising on the quality and prestige perceived with luxury houses. The “green” vision of sustainable development is behind us now. It is time to highlight beautiful, sustainable innovations to reconcile both. That is what the challenge involves. Premium Beauty News - Is your public ready to hear these arguments? Sandrine Sommer - The luxury public is getting increasingly sensitive to this. To our customers, it is just obvious, as long as you are a luxury brand, you should do things well. It is up to us to go farther and anticipate their questions and aspirations. For example, we have communicated on our rare, natural materials for long. Today, we are going further, by putting an emphasis on our commitment to protect biodiversity in light of these rare ecosystems. We have a prescribing, training role: it is up to us to raise customer awareness. Premium Beauty News - How are you going to communicate on this issue? Sandrine Sommer - Every year, we organize two events at Guerlain Champs-Élysées to put forward committed men and women. These players work on Sustainable Development on a daily basis. They come to share their experiences with a concerned public, my counterparts from different companies and industries, associations, all our stakeholders… It is a different way to communicate, but we do believe in the pollination of ideas and the strength of committed networks."
Is wood the future of plastic?,"Thanks to their structure, very similar to a polymer, for several years, tree fibres have been the subject of several researches aiming at using them as a substitute to many oiled-sourced plastic polymers. Contrary to other bioplastics, polymers derived from wood fibres have the advantage of not competing - or hardly - with food productions.  These researches are now finding their earliest applications. Neopac’s PICEA Wood Tube, partially made from forest-derived materials was already known.  At Luxe Pack Monaco 2017, the Switzerlan-based flexible tube specialist showcased an enhanced version where the quantity of renewable material content was increased both on the body and shoulders, without altering the packaging radiance.  This new recyclable model is Ecocert-certified. Finland’s Metsä Board showcased a new version of their Skincare Box with a plastic-looking fitment made with a polymer derived from wood and sugar cane fibres for a 100% recyclable packaging. Eventually, Stora Enso displayed on their stand the Sulapac plastic-like jars.  Sulapac is a Finnish start-up they selected as part of their Accelerator Programme. Entirely made of wood and natural binders, wholly derived from Finnish forests’ renewable resources, the packaging can be made using standard injection moulding, extrusion, and blow moulding techniques, with the same design possibilities as what plastic offers. If the barrier properties are different, they can be enhanced with adapted coating.  The material is water and oil-resistant.  Thanks to its small carbon footprint, it is an environmentally-friendly product that also offers reduced costs when compared to bioplastics.

"Sustainability: Three questions to Chris Sayner, Croda","Premium Beauty News - The range of green materials for cosmetic and personal care products is widening.  What are the main challenges regarding sustainability and safety? Chris Sayner -  The consensus from the Climate Change Conference in France (December 2015) was to reduce the Greenhouse Gas emissions (GHG) by 50% by 2050 in order to keep Global warming to less than 2 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels.  The chemical industry has a major part to play in meeting this objective including moving from petroleum based to renewable materials. In Croda we report GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) indicator EN1 measuring the percentage of renewable raw material used.  We are in the 60-70% range whereas many companies are under 10%. The drive for sustainability in Personal Care Ingredients is essentially all things environmental: reducing carbon footprint, water, waste, increased renewable raw materials and use of non-fossil fuel energy, greater efficiency of products in use and sustainable raw material supply.  Sustainable raw material supply really focusses on renewable vs petrochemical and of course the sustainability credentials of the renewable raw materials, palm being a current focus. Premium Beauty News - How can sustainability be assessed and compared?
 Chris Sayner - Most companies issue a sustainable summary report each year. Big cosmetic companies are interested in reduction of energy and waste, an increase of renewable ingredients and social accountability. We focus on the twelve Principles of Green Chemistry to assist in reducing our impact on the environment. We invested a lot in our plant in Delaware sourcing landfill gas from municipal waste to furnish us with 60% -70% renewable energy. Premium Beauty News - In your opinion, what are the main avenues for innovation in the green ingredients field? Chris Sayner - Increased use of Bio based, renewable and sustainable raw materials for ingredient manufacture, as well as bio fermentation, which is incremental to new development."
L’Oréal: Sustainability targets change the way products are designed,"The results published by L’Oréal in the 2016 Sharing Beauty With All Progress Report reveal an in-depth transformation brought about by the group’s sustainability efforts. “The Sharing Beauty With All programme has brought about substantial lasting changes in the way we design, produce, communicate
and distribute our products,” says Jean-Paul Agon, CEO of the L’Oréal Group. Launched in 2013, the Sharing Beauty With All programme summarises L’Oréal’s commitments in terms of sustainable development from the conception of products to their distribution, including the production process or the sourcing of ingredients.  Every year, L’Oréal communicates and provides figures with regard to its progress. By reducing the emissions of its plants and distribution centres by 67%, in absolute terms, from a 2005 baseline, L’Oréal has exceeded its target of a -60% reduction in CO2 emissions, four years ahead of schedule, while increasing its production by 29% during the same period.  Furthermore, by the end of 2016, the Group counts 15 industrial sites that have achieved carbon neutrality. By 2020, L’Oréal is committed to improve the environmental or social profile of 100% of its new or renovated products.  This commitment concerns all L’Oréal brands and 82% of the products launched in 2016 (vs 74% in 2015) already show such an improvement. Some of the new products launched in 2016 demonstrate levels of biodegradability exceeding 98%, such as, for example the shampoos and conditioners of the new Biolage R.A.W. range, or the Garnier Ultra Doux 5 Plants shampoo. “At the halfway mark of our 2020 ambitions, we are going to redouble our efforts to reduce our environmental footprint and reach our targets, particularly in terms of sustainable production and innovation”, says Alexandra Palt, Chief Sustainability Officer."
"After France, the UK announces plans to ban plastic microbeads in cosmetics","UK’s Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) has confirmed plans to ban the sale and manufacture of cosmetics and personal care products containing tiny pieces of plastic, commonly known as ‘microbeads’. “Adding plastic to products like face washes and body scrubs is wholly unnecessary when harmless alternatives can be used. This is the next step in tackling microplastics in our seas (…) and I look forward to working with industry and environmental groups. This government is committed to its promise to be the first generation ever to leave the environment in a better state than it inherited, and together we can bring an end to these harmful plastics clogging up our oceans,” said Environment Secretary Andrea Leadsom. A consultation will launch later this year. This announcement follows the ban of plastic microbeads in rinse-off cosmetics by the French Law on Biodiversity adopted last July.  The ban will enter into force on January 2018. [1] Both initiatives are part of an international movement to ban microplastic beads.  For that reason, some companies started to move away from plastic microbeads in cosmetic products and in October last year the cosmetics industry across Europe took the collective decision to remove, as of 2020, plastic microbeads from products where they may reach the marine environment. In reality, the industry’s removal of plastic microbeads is progressing quickly and is likely to be completed well ahead of the recommended deadline. L’Oréal, for instance, recently announced that 80% of its products have been reformulated and that 100% of their rinsed off products will be reformulated by the end of 2016, ahead of their forecasts. Eventually, it is not impossible that these national bans, will be useless as plastic microbeads will already have been phased out ahead of their entry into force. According to the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA), the UK cosmetics industry alone has already achieved a 70% reduction in the use of plastic microbeads in personal care products and their use will be virtually zero by the end of 2018."
Consumers expect more from companies regarding biodiversity,"More and more people are aware of biodiversity. If credible information and reputable brands are available, consumers are ready to purchase biodiversity-friendly products and contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. These are among the latest insights of the Biodiversity Barometer, an annual survey of the Union for Ethical Biotrade (UEBT) on biodiversity awareness among consumers and leading beauty, food and beverage companies around the world. [1] UEBT research shows that consumers would like to contribute to biodiversity conservation, but most don’t yet know how to go about it. They expect companies to respect people and biodiversity, but are currently far from confident that appropriate measures are being taken. Consumers want to receive more information, and could be convinced by the reputation of a brand as well as authentic, externally verified stories. “We see both a clear responsibility and opportunity for companies. Natural ingredient supply chains can be turned into positive agents of change, promoting actions that restore biodiversity and promote local development. This implies a significant challenge, of course, as it requires a paradigm shift and a true commitment to ethical sourcing, but it can be done. A few companies, including UEBT members, have already taken up the challenge and are leading the way”, says Rik Kutsch Lojenga, UEBT Executive Director. According to the UEBT, the beauty sector offers some inspiring examples of how companies can put their supply chains to work for people and biodiversity, and UEBT research shows consumers begin to recognize this. For instance, Natura Cosmetics, a Brazilian multinational that is widely recognized for their commitment to sustainability, has pioneered sourcing with respect of biodiversity for many years.  Natura makes sustainable use of the Amazon’s biodiversity and actively contributes to local development, something that is verified independently by UEBT. The natural cosmetics company Weleda is another good example. Just recently, Weleda was awarded the Swiss Ethics Award for their engagement with UEBT and their commitment to promoting ethical sourcing practices along all their natural ingredient supply chains. Also beyond UEBT, companies are acting. For instance, The Body Shop, which is also mentioned by consumers in the UEBT survey, recently launched a new global CSR Commitment, Enrich Not Exploit, with a pledge to enrich the planet, its biodiversity and resources."
"“The Amazon’s biodiversity is a strategic area of research,” Eder Leopoldo Ramos, Symrise","Premium Beauty News - Why did you choose the Amazon region to build Symrise’s new plant in Brazil? Eder Leopoldo Ramos -  As you certainly know, the Amazon region possesses one of the world’s largest biodiversity reservoirs and thus offers a rich source of raw materials for companies within the fragrance and cosmetics industry. Symrise considers biodiversity as both a key area of concern for the future and a key factor of success in the cosmetics industry. Ecoparque, the industrial and ecological park where we built our new plant, is an initiative of Brazilian cosmetics giant Natura.  We were their first partners in this project. They inspired us with their compelling vision that sourcing ingredients from the Amazon’s rich biodiversity could allow us to offer great innovations to our customers while, at the same time, bringing economic and social development to the region.  This is why we transferred our entire botanical production in Brazil to this new production unit.  This is also a way to expand our research into new natural ingredients and to diversify our portfolio of fragrance ingredients. Premium Beauty News - How does the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT) support Symrise in this project? Rik Kutsch Lojenga - When sourcing natural ingredients, sustainability, ethics and regulatory compliance are key challenges — in particular when sourcing from environmentally sensitive areas such as the Amazon region.  Companies are interested in the world’s biodiversity, which means carefully addressing issues such as environment preservation and the rights and livelihoods of local communities.  The role of UEBT is to help them in these areas.  In Brazil, we are also working with companies such as Beraca, Natura and Solabia. As far as Symrise is concerned, UEBT certified ingredients sourced from 14 supplier communities based in the Brazilian Amazon.  We used the internationally recognised Ethical BioTrade standard, which addresses the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in the sourcing area and recognizes the role of provider communities through equitable prices and local projects for sustainable development. Eder Leopoldo Ramos - Sourcing natural ingredients is a challenge.  And each ingredient is different.  In this context, UEBT is a good partner for us.  The UEBT helps to independently secure our supply chain and to be sure that we comply with the rules on ABS (Access and Benefit-sharing) and the principles of the United Nation’s Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources. The industry is moving towards sustainability; in particular as natural ingredients are becoming key growth drivers.  A few months ago, for instance, we bought Pinova, a U.S. supplier of fragrance, oral care and food ingredients from natural and renewable sources such as roots and tree stumps, orange oils and paper production by-products.  UEBT helps us to address all the challenges linked to this natural trend. Premium Beauty News - What are the main challenges you face on the way to ethical sourcing of biodiversity? Rik Kutsch Lojenga - It is not easy to change the way business practices. Policies and processes in place are always difficult to modify.  There are technical challenges to overcome in ensuring ethical practices.  More than anything, though, it is really a paradigm shift – or perhaps more clearly stated: a change in mindset. This may seem formidable, but it is an opportunity to build something new, something better. More and more companies are seeing the value and business case for ethical sourcing of biodiversity. And the great thing is, that once the mindset has changed and the notion of ethical sourcing of biodiversity is integrated into the company, it becomes logical to work in a more innovative, inclusive and positive manner."
German glass industry compares the environmental impact of glass and plastic cosmetic jars,"Cosmetic jars made of plastic are increasingly used by cosmetic brands in the low price segment, where they are appreciated for their low cost, but also in the high-end segment, as technology now allows producing heavy jars with thick walls and more luxury external features.  In order to evaluate the respective environmental impacts of both materials, BV Glas, the Federal Association of the German Glass Industry, committed the Wuppertal Institute to analyse four standard cream jars available on the German market with a filling volume of 50 ml.  “There was actually no public studies available on the environmental impact of cosmetic jars,” says Dr. Johann Overath, Director General of BV Glas. The project team thus performed a life cycle analysis (including the following phases: extraction and processing of raw materials, production of jars, transport and secondary packaging, end-of-life, recycling) of both heavy and lightweight jars (and their lids). The content of the jar - face cream - and the filling of the jar were not addressed in the study. The results show that the lightweight glass and plastic jars are similar in terms of the material footprint, while the glass jar has a slightly better carbon footprint.  However, the carbon footprint of the heavy glass jar is almost a third lower than the carbon footprint of the heavy plastic jar. Both systems have a similar material footprint. Results are primarily influenced by the weight of the jar but the weight of the lid also plays a role. The main conclusion of such results is that while lightweight plastic and glass cosmetic jars have similar environmental impacts, it is highly ineffective - in terms of sustainability - to produce heavyweight plastic jars that imitate the aesthetic characteristics of glass. However, the Wuppertal Institute notes that several additional factors may impact the final results.  For instance, decorated glass jars have higher material and carbon footprints than non-decorated glass jars, and the results for plastic jars are influenced by the type of plastic used, polypropylene (PP) has a much lower footprint than styrene acrylonitrile (SAN). In addition, the energy mix of the country of production impacts the results. “The use of a German, European or company-specific energy mix in production makes a significant difference for both plastic and glass jars,” explains Holger Rohn, who was in charge of the survey at the Wuppertal Institute. The institute based its analysis on glass jars produced by German glass-plants and plastic jars formed in Germany from basic materials produced in Europe."
Murumuru seeds: A cosmetic ingredient that helps preserve the Amazonian rain forest,"In the heart of the Amazon jungle, Alexandre Amaral da Silva stoops and picks handfuls of light brown seeds about an inch long from the tropical undergrowth.  The murumuru seeds grow on palm trees up to 15 meters (50 feet) high. The seeds will put precious cash in the pockets of people like Alexandre, while providing a prized ingredient for cosmetics companies that used their byproducts in haircare and makeup products. The seed-gathering outpost of Providencia was founded 20 years ago in one of the remotest parts of Brazil.  A few wooden huts in the middle of the jungle, it lies a three-hour boat ride up the Jurua river from the town of Carauari (25,000 inhabitants), some 700 kilometers (435 miles) from Manaus, the capital of Amazona (North).  Crowds of children flock to the sandy shore to meet arriving boats. Alexandre waits until the seeds ripen and fall to the ground to harvest them.  Then his wife Maria Terezinha gets to work, crushing them one by one with a hammer, removing the shells and keeping the hearts in a sack. The gatherers sell the seeds to a local cooperative. At a factory in the jungle, the cooperative processes them into the palm oil prized by beauty companies because it melts into damaged hair to repair it and make it silky. For fifteen years, the families who live on the banks of the Jurua river have improved their income with the sale of the murumuru seeds. A family like theirs can make the equivalent of up to US $460 a year to boost the income they gain from gathering other products. Official statistics show average per capita income is about BRL 2,200 US (about US $660 at the current exchange rate) a year in Carauari. Brazilian beauty giant Natura, one of the main users of murumuru seeds, currently works with some 400 families in the Medio Jurua reserve, where little more than half the people know how to read and write, according to research by Natura.  The company provides training and investment for processing murumuru and other seed oil products such as andiroba and ucuuba. Without big businesses, ""there are many production chains in the Amazon that would disappear"", says Carlos Koury, director of the Amazon Conservation and Sustainable Development Institute, a non-government organization.  The murumuru gatherers are part of ""a traditional production chain that would struggle to survive without a powerful ally such as Natura."" The region was once a major rubber producer but that industry declined and locals turned mostly to gathering cassava and fishing. The support that cosmetics companies provides to Amazonian communities helps them to get additional income sources from the rainforest products and contributes greatly to encourage forest preservation. A hot issue at present times."
Cosmetics Europe recommends cosmetics makers to cease using plastic micro particles,"“In adopting this Recommendation, Cosmetics Europe and its membership are addressing public concerns, and committing to work with regulators on a science based approach to the issue of plastic micro particles. We are also committed to building, with other international associations, global alignment of the cosmetics industry on this issue,” said Loïc Armand, President of Cosmetics Europe. The occurrence and persistence of plastic debris in the marine environment and waterways is an issue of increasing public debate.  In the US, Illinois, New Jersey and California [1] have already adopted regulations to ban the use of plastic microbeads in personal care products.  Several other states are debating similar legislations and Canada has pledge to regulate the use of plastic micro-particules in cosmetics. In parallel, many companies, from SMEs to multinationals, including individual member companies of Cosmetics Europe such as Unilever or L’Oréal, have publicly stated that they would discontinue those uses in cosmetics that are most likely to end up in the aquatic environment and for which alternatives exist. Thus, Cosmetics Europe’s recommendation to discontinue the use in wash-off cosmetic products placed on the market as of 2020 of synthetic, solid plastic particles used for exfoliating and cleansing that are non-biodegradable in the marine environment, is certainly no surprise for the trade community. With this recommendation, Cosmetics Europe aims to engage its membership and to facilitate sector wide best environmental practice. However, the personal care association considers that “although often highlighted in the context of marine litter debate, the use of solid plastic micro particles in cosmetic and personal care products is considered to be a limited source of pollution compared to others.”  According to the trade association, “the vast majority of small plastic particles in the seas come from the breakdown of bigger plastic materials.” Cosmetics Europe therefore says it is committed to working in partnership with the European authorities to gather scientific data to allow a further assessment of the issue. “This knowledge will facilitate scientific decision making and prioritise measures that will result in a true benefit for the environment by reducing the amount of plastic litter in the marine environment.”"
"“Sustainable development is a long-term strategic challenge”, Cécile Tuil, Albéa","Premium Beauty News - When did the Albéa Group start formalizing its social and environmental commitment? Cécile Tuil - Our first sustainable development programme dates back to a bit more than 10 years, when major cosmetics brands started structuring around this issue. Albéa evolved with its customers. We define the framework, objectives, and priorities approximately every five years to try and make progress. Premium Beauty News - What are the main lines and objectives of this programme? Cécile Tuil - Our new road map comprises four pillars for the 2015-2020 period: our operations, our products, our employees and the communities, our suppliers and partners. We define ambitions and objectives for each pillar. As for the “employee and communities” pillar, our priorities are safety and well-being, commitment and integration, involvement within the communities. For the “product” pillar, it is eco-design, safety and regulatory compliance, and secondary packaging. For the “operations” pillar, it is ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certification for all our sites, reduction of our energy and water consumption, and reduction of our CO2 emissions and volatile organic compounds. Lastly, our priorities for the “suppliers and partners” pillar focus on compliance with social and environmental legislation, green innovation, and solidarity sourcing. As we developed our commitment, we structured it in the form of concrete ambitions with well-identified priorities, and the will for all this to give us increasingly concrete results. However, this programme is not hierarchical in its implementation: we try to make all our employees get involved according to their specific needs on the local level. Each site defines their own priority actions as part of the road map. This is our version of the “think global, act local” vision. Premium Beauty News - What do your customers expect in this field? Cécile Tuil -  Our commitment is not directly related to our customers’ expectations, as their priorities and programmes are extremely different. Albéa’s leaders, starting with François Luscan, our CEO, believe sustainable development is a long-term strategic challenge. A company that endeavours to reduce its environmental footprint and improve its social impact on a daily basis simply tries to support the challenges humanity is facing on its own level and, de facto, works on strengthening its competitiveness. As for our customers in the cosmetics industry, some have developed grids for measuring the performance of their suppliers. But each customer has its own criteria and priorities. For example, L’Oréal has strong expectations in terms of Solidarity Sourcing. Some customers are mainly interested in the eco-design of products and require eco-designed or lighter packaging. Others have started buying PCR tubes [1]. We have also found there are more and more social audits conducted on our sites. By contrast, right now, only a small number of our customers take into account their suppliers’ carbon footprint, but we are getting ready for this, as some of its associated objectives will be included in our 2015-2020 road map."
Biodiversity: Only few companies really succeed in convincing consumers,"In 2015, an average of 69% respondents in nine countries say they have heard of biodiversity, according to IPSOS research conducted for the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT) among 9,000 persons in Brazil, Ecuador, Germany, France, India, Mexico, Netherlands, UK and USA. Growth in awareness on biodiversity is rising in general, with Millennials showing a particularly high degree of awareness. Over 80% of consumers expect companies to respect biodiversity, would like to receive information on such efforts and would be more interested in buying a product if they knew it respected biodiversity. Deeper analysis shows that younger generations are particularly aware of biodiversity, as well as interested in contributing to its conservation. UEBT surveys show that same holds true for consumers in emerging markets such as Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and China. However, only 42% of consumers trust that companies are respecting biodiversity! “As consumers grow more aware, opportunities exist for brands that respect biodiversity to position themselves around this issue. They can respond to demand for information, while offering them a way to contribute to biodiversity conservation when purchasing products,” said Rik Kutsch Lojenga, UEBT Executive Director. For the 3rd year in a row the UEBT Biodiversity Barometer therefore asked respondents to list those brands that they think respect biodiversity most. An average of 60% was able to provide brand names, but often on grounds of general environmental reputation, rather than for respect for biodiversity. Consumers particularly associate beauty companies with respect for biodiversity, although this year more consumers mentioned food and household brands. These finding are in line with the UEBT’s review of corporate reporting on biodiversity, which found limited attention is paid to the issue. Only 36% of the top 100 beauty companies and 60% of food companies mention biodiversity in their annual sustainability reports. In only four countries consumers strongly identified companies with biodiversity: Brazil (Natura Cosmetics), France (Yves Rocher), India (Dabur), and UK (Body Shop).  Yet, few companies have gained international recognition around respect for biodiversity. In Latin America Natura Cosmetics leads the way, as consumers rank it among the top three of companies that respect biodiversity in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. ""To respond to consumer expectations, companies need to step up and improve their biodiversity reporting. In addition, more direct consumer communication on biodiversity is required to increase the trust of consumers,"" concludes Rik Kutsch Lojenga UEBT Executive Director."
Middle East: Towards more sustainable luxury products?,"In its latest white paper called ""Luxury in the Gulf: A Sustainable Future?"", the Chalhoub Group, one of the leading distributor of luxury products in the Middle East, highlights the rise of sustainability issues in the Gulf countries. Speaking about sustainable development may seem paradoxical in a region that built much of its prosperity on the exploitation of huge stocks of fossil fuels and where shoppers have once again taken the top spot in terms of highest international spenders!  However, the notion is gaining ground in Gulf countries as local governments try to address the challenges of the future. In order to decrease their dependence on non-renewable resources, most of the region’s states have launched plans to promote economic diversification and innovation. They are also increasingly adopting standards aiming at reducing the environmental footprint, in particular in the building sector.  Another important effort is education, with the aim of reducing youth unemployment in societies that have experienced high population growth rates. Consumer research conducted by the Chalhoub Group on corporate social responsibility in the United Arab Emirates shows that residents are concerned about their community and environment. Actually, 64% of respondents claim to engage in environmentally friendly activities, ranging from recycling to saving electricity and water. However, the expectations towards corporate sustainability are much higher than towards personal sustainability.  Indeed, 83% of respondents expect the shops they buy from to engage in environmentally friendly activities and 68% feel brands do not care enough about the environment and the community.  However, while 73% expect stores to recycle products, 64% are not interested in the environmental impact of their purchased products. “Overall, consumers expect corporate sustainability engagement in the areas of employee, community and environment,” explains the Chalhoub Group. Business initiatives addressing these new concerns are emerging.  FutureFashion.me, for instance, is a marketplace for sustainable clothes and accessories. Regional home and décor retail chain The One is another example.  The company is strongly committed to corporate social responsibility and has been recognised in this area with many awards, notably winning 4 years in a row the ‘Most Admired Responsible Retailer of the Year - Retail Middle East Award’. As part of its ‘Do Good’ initiative, The One is promoting ethical sourcing. Luxury in the region is still largely characterised by abundant consumption. Emirati teens are spending six times more on average than global teens, according to research by AMRB and TRU. Within the luxury sector, the Chalhoub Group research shows that the affluent GCC consumer spends on average US$ 2,400 per month on beauty, fashion and gifts. However, according to the Chalhoub Group, “a new archetype is starting to emerge with a greater sense of pragmatism in their relations with luxury brands.” Still very much in its infancy, this new consumer is somewhat distancing itself from the materialistic world and is beginning to appreciate luxury for the experiences and the enjoyment it can bring. These persons typically have a passion they like to share and bond is their key driver. In the relationship they seek in–store, knowledge of the brand’s history and heritage as well as deep understanding of how the product is made are paramount. The sales staff needs to become story–tellers, helping them immerse themselves in the very essence of the brand. In terms of products, they will be attracted to bespoke and ‘made to measure’ items. Ancient traditions have shaped the region’s societies for centuries (solidarity, frugality, sustainable architectural traditions, generosity towards the community, hospitality, gifting, family), are supporting the drive and the mindset for sustainability. “Luxury in the Gulf shows a promising future as it echoes these deeply rooted traditions and culture,” concludes the Chalhoub Group."
UN Report recommends ban of microplastics in cosmetics,"The study, entitled Plastic in Cosmetics: Are We Polluting the Environment Through our Personal Care: Plastic ingredients (available here) that contribute to marine microplastic litter is a compilation of currently available knowledge on the linkages between cosmetics and plastic pollution in the oceans. According to the UNEP’s report, more than 299 million tonnes of plastic was produced worldwide in 2013 some of which made its way to the oceans. For the last 50 years, microparticles of plastic, called microplastics, have been used in a large number of cosmetic and personal care formulations, ranging from toothpaste and shower gel to eye shadows and nail polish. A total amount of 4,360 tonnes of microplastic beads was used in 2012 across all European Union countries plus Norway and Switzerland according to a survey by Cosmetics Europe, focusing on the use of microplastic beads, with polyethylene beads representing 93% of the total amount equaling 4,037 tonnes. Washed down the drain, those particles cannot be collected for recycling, nor do they decompose in wastewater treatment facilities, inevitably ending up in the global ocean.  Once in the ocean, plastic does not go away: it fragments, eventually breaking down into smaller pieces known as secondary microplastics. “Knowledge is emerging about the effect such particles have on marine organisms, including mammals, but also on their potential for secondary health impacts via the food chain, including to humans who consume seafood,” explains UNEP.  The organisation evaluates the cost in environmental damage to marine ecosystems to approximately US$ 13 billion per year. Given the associated potential risks of microplastics, the report makes several recommendations for producers and consumers, as well as for researchers and policymakers.  In particular, it calls for a voluntary phase-out of microplastics by the industry and their eventual ban in personal care and cosmetic products. Introduction of legislation banning or phasing-out microplastics in personal care and cosmetic products has already started and is expected to continue in the future. The state of Illinois is leading the way in the U.S. by banning all microplastics in personal care and cosmetic products by 2019. California and New York are among other U.S. states that are pursuing similar measures and the European Commission has highlighted marine microplastics pollution as a priority area of concern. Furthermore, The Netherlands, Austria, Luxembourg, Belgium and Sweden have issued a joint call to ban the microplastics used in personal care products."
Brazil adopts new rules on biodiversity based R&D for cosmetics,"“Brazil holds one of the richest biodiversities in the world. It has long been a source of innovation and inspiration for natural ingredients used in food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. Yet much remains to be explored: many companies have R&D centres in Brazil that are actively looking to discover new ingredients and applications for its flora,” says the Union for Ethical Bio Trade (UEBT), a non-profit association that promotes the ethical sourcing of ingredients that come from biodiversity.  Moreover, Brazil is also quickly becoming a key market for natural products, with a population of over 200 million and a soaring awareness of biodiversity. The new law [1] establishes the procedures that companies and other organizations will need to follow to work with Brazilian biodiversity. The new law repeals a measure adopted in 2001 on access and benefit sharing, widely criticized as too complex and bureaucratic. For example, authorization to access biodiversity for research and development, until now granted by a national council [2], will not longer be required. Companies now only have to register on an online database. Benefit sharing, previously negotiated for each individual case, will now fall on the final product manufacturer, and take place primarily through a national trust fund. President Rousseff described the new law as balancing legal certainty with fair and equitable benefit sharing. It will guarantee, she said, that companies can “without conflict, troubles or disputes” use the genetic heritage and associated traditional knowledge in Brazil. “Nevertheless,” explains the UEBT, “the law has also been criticized by indigenous peoples and local communities for not sufficiently protecting their rights and interests.” The new legal framework in Brazil will have significant implications for suppliers, laboratories, manufacturers and brands working with Brazilian biodiversity. These implications will be one of the topics addressed during the “Beauty of Sourcing with Respect” conference, which brings together companies, experts and government representatives to discuss biodiversity. The conference, organized by the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT), will take place in Paris on 25 June 2015."
SGD launches a new version of its Infinite Glass,"“Brighter and more transparent, but providing environmental benefits at each stage of the manufacturing process.”  For SGD, the key issue related to the new version of the Infinite Glass was clearly to be able to meet the aesthetic requirements of perfume and cosmetic brands, while significantly reducing the environmental impact of the glass making process. While the first version of Infinite Glass, launched in 2008, was composed of 100% recycled household glass, the 2015 version is composed of 65% of factory cullet (crushed glass rejected form a previous manufacturing batch and reused by SGD), 25% recycled post consumer glass and 10% virgin mineral raw material (sand, sodium, limestone). The Infinite Glass Neo thus contains 90% recycled materials and no longer has the slight green tint of the initial version. “We only use white post-consumer recycled glass that we buy from a recycling scheme sorting the different types of glass,” explains Gaëlle Verjus, International Marketing Manager Perfumery & Cosmetics at SGD. The result is an extra-white glass that meets the demanding transparency and brilliance aesthetic requirements of beauty products makers. Furthermore, this high-end glass has a much better environmental profile than classical extra-white glass.  For instance, for 1 million 200g glass bottles made from Infinite Glass, SGD estimates that carbon dioxide emissions are reduced by 13% approximately, power consumption is reduced by 13% approximately, a reduction of 34 tonnes of sand consumption and a reduction of 1.7 tonne of limestone consumption. The Infinite Glass Neo can be decorated in the same way as a conventional glass; it can therefore be adapted to the values and codes of each brand by using all finishing options offered by SGD. Furthermore, SGD also offers a range of eco-friendly finishing: – Water-based lacquers, using water as diluent and limiting the emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC).
– Glass etching with zero effluent discharge, based on a process available in the Verreries de l’Orne factory and allowing for a close-loop treatment of etching effluents.
– Organic or UV silkscreen inks, requiring few energy during the polymerization process.
– Organic inks for thermal drying (150°C).
– UV curable inks (ultraviolet radiation). The French glassmaker also offers a new generation of inks with fewer solvents and only based on biodegradable solvents composed of 50% renewable non-oil based raw materials. The Infinite Glass Neo has already convinced a major beauty brand for a future product launch."
"Belgium, The Netherlands, Austria and Sweden call for a ban on micro-plastics in cosmetics","In an information note transmitted to other EU Member States, Belgium, The Netherlands, Austria and Sweden said micro-plastics (plastic particles with a diameter below 5 mm) pollution was an issue of increasing concern. They deemed the elimination of micro-plastics in products - in particular in cosmetics and detergents - was of utmost priority.  “Although it is evident that alternatives to micro-plastics in cosmetics and detergents are available, hundreds of tons of micro-plastics are still being released onto the EU market each year.” The four countries urged the Commission and member states to address the scientific gaps and to match them with the information available from different sources. In this respect the role and contribution of the European Environment Agency and the European Chemicals Agency should be assessed and defined.  They called for a ban on micro-plastics in cosmetics and detergents in order to strengthen the EU’s role as a frontrunner for innovative products and green growth whilst providing a level playing field for industry. In the United States, the state of Illinois has already adopted a legislation to ban micro plastic beads in personal care products.  Other states are considering the adoption of similar legislations.  However, the Governor of New Jersey recently vetoed a proposed ban. Several cosmetics manufacturers, such as Unilever and L’Oréal, have already committed to voluntarily withdraw these substances from their products.  More recently, Accord, Australia’s industry association for the hygiene, cosmetic and specialty products industry, also announced that the local operators are committed to working towards a phase-out of polyethylene microbeads by the end of 2017."
Summit points key areas of progress towards a greener cosmetics industry,"In his opening keynote, Dominique Conseil, President of Aveda, said the cosmetics industry needs “to have a different relationship with the Earth” if it is to face up to its harsh realities. Chris Kilham, Medicine Hunter and Sustainability Ambassador of Naturex, gave a similar message: “We are entering a new era of conscious business where traditional models no longer exist.” Kilham proposes a “Business To Heart (B2H)” approach whereby cosmetic brands appeal to people’s hearts; he encouraged brands to take a more personalised approach and consider their customers as people rather then consumers. Despite several divergences, participants pointed several key areas of progress. Lack of transparency in supply chains was cited as a major impediment to sustainable development. Thus, ingredient traceability has become a major concern for the cosmetics industry, with some participants giving examples of palm oil and sandalwood.  The summit also highlighted the varying interpretations of sustainability in the cosmetics industry.  Although some correlate green cosmetics and ethical sourcing with sustainability, other had differing views.  “Sustainability means good agricultural practices by its farmers,” stated Mike Martinez, CEO of Natural Plant Products, while Naturex said sustainability means using less synthetics in cosmetic formulations and thus lower environmental pollution. Another ingredient firm Kemin believed cultivation of certified sustainable crops was the way forward. The role of metrics  to reduce environmental impacts was also discussed. SGS showed how metrics can be used by cosmetic firms to reduce their packaging footprints. Croda stated it was addressing its environmental impact by using renewable energy, reducing water usage and sending less waste to landfill. It stated about a quarter of the company’s energy was now from non-fossil sources. Eventually, Kurt Nuebling, CEO of the European natural cosmetics firm Primavera, encouraged brands to consider green buildings. By using eco-design, its manufacturing facility in southern Germany had gone beyond carbon neutral to become carbon positive. It is capturing up to five times as much carbon as it is emitting. The next editions of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit will be held in São Paulo (10-12 September, 2014), Hong Kong (10-11 November, 2014) and Paris (24-26 November, 2014)."
"Consumers expect companies to respect biodiversity, report says","As the European Union is about to regulate the access to genetic resources, the latest edition of the UEBT annual barometer shows that while consumer expectations are high on this issue, many cosmetic brands are still struggling to provide accurate answers. Conducted in February 2014, some 7,000 consumers in Brazil, China, Colombia, Germany, France, UK, USA and Vietnam participated in the survey. In 2014, 87% of consumers surveyed say they buy cosmetic products that use natural ingredients. In Brazil this number is 96%, in the UK 72%. Consumers are increasingly looking for transparency: 77% say they pay attention to where ingredients in cosmetics products come from. In Brazil, Colombia and Vietnam almost 90% of consumers say they pay attention to the origin. A large majority (87%) of the surveyed consumers expects companies to have sourcing policies in place that respect biodiversity. In Colombia and Brazil the large majority even think this is essential, in comparison to an average 34% in France, Germany and the UK. Further, the report suggests that more than 85% of surveyed consumers want companies to provide more information on the concrete actions they are taking to respect biodiversity in their sourcing policies. The 2014 Biodiversity Barometer also confirmed that biodiversity awareness is particularly high in emerging markets. More than 90% of respondents in Brazil, Colombia, Vietnam and China have heard about biodiversity, with 49% of respondents able to correctly define biodiversity, twice the number of that in developed countries. “Consumers in emerging markets show a good understanding of biodiversity and a high interest in ethical sourcing. With market growth increasingly realized in these countries, these findings are of strategic importance for companies investing in emerging markets,” says UEBT Executive Director Rik Kutsch Lojenga. However, while the 2014 UEBT Biodiversity Barometer finds that biodiversity awareness has increased since 2009, it also reveals growth in understanding of biodiversity has slowed down since 2012. “84% of respondents say it is important to personally contribute to conserving biodiversity. This highlights the importance placed on biodiversity and provides us with a tremendous opportunity to work together to conserve and use biodiversity sustainably and in a fair and equitable way and address the biodiversity loss and its benefits to society,” says Braulio Ferreira de Souza Dias, CBD Executive Secretary."
L’Oréal supports its suppliers as part of its sustainable development programme,"Premium Beauty News - What are the foundations of this unprecedented CSR policy? Laurent Gilbert - The program is called “Sharing beauty with all”, the objective is clearly to place the consumer at the heart of our commitment to sustainable development and enable him to make responsible choices. We intend to make this subject very tangible and easily accessible for him. We are committed to make available, information on the social and environmental characteristics of our products, and we are working with our brands to enable them to take up this subject and engage in a dialogue with their customers. The aim is also to work on the entire value chain, starting with our innovations, from production to distribution. The last, extremely important point, is that everything is done as part of an objective of the group, namely to conquer a billion consumers by 2020. It is essential that this development benefits to all our employees, our suppliers, but also to the most disadvantaged communities. Premium Beauty News - You anticipate that by 2020, 100% of your strategic suppliers will be taking part to the sustainable development program, what does that involve in terms of procurement? Laurent Gilbert - We work with several hundreds of suppliers worldwide, with whom we have privileged relationships. We selected them on their ability to innovate, to deliver service and a host of other criteria, including the criticality of ingredients they supply us. These commitments are the result of a work conducted internally with them for several years. Concerning for example the sourcing of renewably-sourced raw materials, L’Oréal is engaged since 2005 in developing its raw materials according to the principles from the Convention on Biological Diversity and to no longer reference products with an unfavourable environmental profile. Consequently, a number of actions were implemented to make sure that our partners fulfilled all these principles. We provided them with the type of information we wanted to have on the environmental profile of the purchased raw materials. The approach is the same with perfume or packaging suppliers with requirements also on the composition. Premium Beauty News - How will this be implemented? Laurent Gilbert - It is difficult to tackle everything at the same time, so we proceed along two main priorities. On the one hand volume, we started with the largest suppliers in terms of volume or turnover. And raw materials and issues on their sourcing, on the other. Premium Beauty News - Does this mean you will stop doing business with some suppliers? Laurent Gilbert - It is not our policy. We much prefer working with them to make them understand what we want and then have them adopt these practices. Of course, if after a great deal of efforts this turns out impossible, we might find ourselves in a position to make decisions but it really isn’t the goal. Premium Beauty News - It really is more a matter of support? Laurent Gilbert - Yes, we really intend to share all our tools when the size of our suppliers does not allow them to develop their own tools. Particularly educational tools to really share the same notions. For example, semantics are very important, to ensure that behind words we put the same definitions. When we speak of renewably-sourced raw materials or of sustainable development issues, to make sure that we understand the same thing, and this, at the global level. And also regarding the working tools, the way we conduct audits or evaluate a channel. We are really in this kind of support. Premium Beauty News - The group has set itself a ‘zero deforestation’ goal, thus guaranteeing that none of its products would be associated with deforestation by 2020. End of 2012, the overall supply of L’Oréal in palm oil was already complying with the standards and procedures of the RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil), what remains to be done? Laurent Gilbert - This roundtable for the sustainable sourcing palm is based on different standards that will be used depending on the complexity of the supply chain. We are following the SG (Segregated) standard, one of the most demanding, which requires a full traceability, from the mill that produces the palm oil to our factories. This guarantees a supply which is managed according to the sustainable development principles of the RSPO. For derivatives, the supply chains are very complex, which makes complete traceability difficult. We want to ensure full traceability even for derivatives, to be consistent with our commitment, and we are going to work with the most innovative suppliers on these issues. This is the reason for the 2020 deadline, it demands time because there is still a lot to do with all the stakeholders in the chain. Premium Beauty News - Do you think consumers are aware of these issues and that they will appreciate your commitment? Laurent Gilbert - Our consumers feel quite concerned, there is a real expectation. Each year, we sponsor the Biodiversity Barometer delivered by the UEBT (Union for Ethical Bio Trade), which measures consumer expectations and their level of understanding on these issues. We can see, in China in particular, that about 94% of people are aware of biodiversity, 69% have a knowledge of biodiversity, and therefore Chinese people are very much aware of these issues. This is also true for Brazil. Our consumers are fully aware of these issues, what they lack in fact are the tools to make responsible choices. Our challenge is to make this information accessible. As the program rolls out, we will develop the means to communicate with them. Brands need to take up the subject and put it in tune with their products and their DNA to generate awareness among their customers. It is important to not scramble the message, everyone is involved and we are working on the implementation of future actions. By 2020, there will be things clearly visible to the consumer. Premium Beauty News - Will you be able to meet the 2020 deadline for the entire program? Laurent Gilbert - We set up a panel of Critical Friends whose will follow our progress with an outside view and with whom we will regularly take stock. We will also communicate through our sustainability reports and during other events enabling us to give an update on our progress. Will we meet the 2020 deadline? All the teams are mobilized for that and we have a very comprehensive agenda for the years to come."
"Plastic microbeads: L’Oréal to stop, New York and California to prohibit","New York State Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman and state Assemblyman Robert K. Sweeney have unveiled a proposed law to prohibit the sale in the state of New York of cosmetic products that contain tiny plastic particles. Recent studies have found high levels of these plastic beads in the New York waters of Lake Erie, and revealed that most of the state’s waters were polluted.  When products containing microbeads are used in the home, the beads are rinsed down the drain and into sewer systems. Because of their small size and buoyancy, microbeads escape treatment by sewage plants and are discharged into rivers, lakes and oceans.  “From the Great Lakes to the Hudson River to Long Island Sound, our commitment to protecting and restoring New York’s waters is among our most important responsibilities,” Attorney General Schneiderman said. The Microbead-Free Waters Act would prohibit the production, manufacture, distribution and sale in New York of any beauty product, cosmetic or other personal care product containing plastic particles less than 5 millimetres in size. In California, Assemblymember Richard Bloom has introduced a bill on February 13, to ban the sale of personal care products that contain micro-plastic particles.  According to the bill, cleaning or personal care products containing microplastics would be prohibited for sell on or after January 1, 2016. “We have no choice but to eliminate this pollution at the source. Waiting will only compound the problem and the price of cleaning up,” said Bloom. In this context, L’Oréal has announced on February 12 its decision to no longer use microbeads of polyethylene in its scrubs by 2017.  The phasing out will be first achieved for Biotherm (2014) and The Body Shop (2015) before being extended to all the Group’s portfolio in 2017. “Since L’Oréal has been aware of possible concerns about the environmental impact of microbeads of polyetylene in its scrubs, the Group’s Research examined the issue and decided to gradually phase them out,” explains the French cosmetics manufacturer, which has a research laboratory dedicated to assessing the impact of its formulae on the marine environment since 1995. However, L’Oréal adds that the phasing out of an ingredient is always a complex process. “It requires the analysis and identification of viable alternative(s) that can meet many criteria (including human and environmental safety, efficacy, sustainable sourcing of the raw material and overall costs).”  In that case, the group says to be looking for natural alternatives, such as mineral particles or fruit seeds, that could provide for the same efficacy and safety as before. Other cosmetic companies such as Unilever and Johnson & Johnson have already announced their intention to remove plastic microbeads from their products. Several non-government organizations are fighting against the microplastic beads through the “Beat the Microbead” campaign.  Two Dutch environmental groups have launched an app in 2012 to help consumers identify products using the material. The United Nations Environment Program joined in last year to expand the app for international use beyond the Netherlands."
Positive outlooks for bioplastic products in Europe,"Among the highlights of the 8th European Bioplastics Conference, which was held on the 10 and 11 December in Berlin, was the annual market data update by European Bioplastics and the Institute for Bioplastics and Biocomposites (IfBB - University of Applied Arts Hannover, Germany). The data emphasised the success of bioplastics industry with production capacities multiplying from around 1.4 million tonnes in 2012 to more than 6 million tonnes in 2017. “Our market data update once more affirms above average growth in the bioplastics industry around the world"", said François de Bie, Chairman of the Board of European Bioplastics. “Continuous growth can be expected with regard to all bioplastic material types and in a range of very diverse market segments - from packaging to fibres to consumer electronics.” All material types are gaining ground with biobased, non-biodegradable solutions, such as biobased PE and biobased PET, leading the field.  Biodegradable plastics, including e.g. PLA, biodegradable polyesters and starch-blends, are also demonstrating impressive growth rates. Production capacity will gain around 60 percent by 2017.  European Bioplastics also highlighted that the packaging market will remain the leading segment for bioplastics applications. European Bioplastics’ current data shows that Europe and North America remain interesting as locations for research and development and also important as sales markets. However, the association highlights that the establishment of new production capacities is favoured in South America and Asia. The environmental benefits of bioplastics were also underlined during the conference. “Bioplastics made from bio-feedstock, and reintegrated into the biosphere as a nutrient, or recycled together with conventional plastic, clearly have a potential for being a truly sustainable material. And it could reduce fossil fuel consumption,” stated EU Environment Commissioner Janez Potočnik in his opening speech. In a video message, he pointed to the crucial role bioplastics can play in Europe‘s transition towards a circular biobased economy. Even if considering the forecasted growth rates, the actual land used for sourcing renewable feedstock for bioplastics will amount only to approximately 0.02 percent of the global agricultural area, says European Bioplastics. Panel discussions and presentations during the conference highlighted that Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) remain the best available tool to assess the environmental performance of bioplastics as fact-based as possible.  However, panellists also stressed the need to use state of the art and valid methodologies and to provide easy to use tools to consumers to understand these assessments."
L’Oreal defines its sustainable development goals for 2020,"How to achieve the group’s ambition in terms of growth, namely to win 1 billion new consumers worldwide, while reducing its environmental impact?  This is the aim of ""Sharing Beauty With All"", the roadmap that details the commitments and targets of L’Oréal’s sustainable development policy. In order to produce more but with less impact, L’Oréal intends to offer products that are both sustainable and desirable. In order to achieve this, the group commits to improving every part of its value chain, from research to operations, while sharing its growth with the communities it touches through “By accelerating sustainable innovation within our business, and harnessing the power of our brands to inform consumers, we will raise awareness about sustainability and encourage consumers to make more sustainable choices,” Jean-Paul Agon, said. These commitments are the result of two years of exchange with various stakeholders throughout the world. Concretely speaking, the « Sharing Beauty With All » roadmap covers four types of commitments. First of all, L’Oréal aims at innovating sustainably.  By 2020, 100% of the products developed by L’Oréal will have an environmental or social benefit.  “Every time we invent or update a product, we will improve its environmental or social,” the group says. This means that the new product must meet at least one of the following criteria: – The new formula reduces the environmental footprint.
– The new formula uses renewable raw materials that are sustainably sourced or raw materials derived from green chemistry.
– The new packaging has an improved environmental profile.
– The new product has a positive social impact. The group’s second key goal is to produce sustainably.  “By 2020, we will reduce our environmental footprint by 60 % whilst bringing beauty to one billion new consumers,” L’Oréal claims. In order to reach its goals, the group has set up ambitious targets for the reduction of CO2 emissions, water consumption and waste production.  However, as demonstrated by some of its competitors, such targets may also lead to improved economic performance. L’Oréal also wants to participate in the change of consumption habits.  In order to promote sustainable livings, L’Oréal will provide consumers with detailed information on the environmental impacts of its products.  A product assessment tool will evaluate the environmental and social profile of 100% of new products. Eventually, L’Oréal commits to develop sustainably.  Thus, by 2020, all the group’s employees will have access to health care, social protection and training, wherever they are in the world. L’Oréal will also enrol its strategic suppliers in its sustainability program. All of them will be evaluated and selected on social and environmental performance.  L’Oréal will help them to complete a self-assessment of their sustainability policy and will give them access to its training tools. Furthermore, by 2020, L’Oréal wants to enable more than 100,000 people from underprivileged communities, to access work.  The group will achieve this goal through programmes dedicated to support disabled people and under-represented socio-ethnic groups. L’Oréal, which previously only presented segmented programs and targets, now proposes a comprehensive and ambitious scheme, as its main global competitors, Procter & Gamble and Unilever."
An application to detect plastics in cosmetics,"Do mobile applications become the most effective weapon of consumer-activists? When one’s considers that most consumers are shopping with their mobile phone and that an increasing proportion of them uses it when it feels the need to be guided, these little devices could soon exert an increasing pressure on brands. The ‘Beat the Microbead’ App offers consumers information about the presence of plastic microbeads in personal care products. The aim is to make the eco-friendly minded consumer more aware of their purchasing behaviour. As usual, the principle is quite simple.  The App can scan the barcode of a personal care product and tell the consumer whether or not the product contains plastic microbeads. Products are divided into the categories Red, Orange and Green.  Red: the product contains microbeads; Orange: the product contains microbeads but the manufacturer has pledged to stop using them in the near future; Green, the product does not contain microbeads. The international and multiplatform version of the application - which was initially only available in Dutch for iOS - was developed with the financial support of the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) and UK based NGO Fauna & Flora International (FFI). The application is available for free and in five languages (English, Spanish, German, French, Dutch). However, the application can only be available to use where the lists of personal care products containing plastic microbeads were supplied and updated.  NGOs from The United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Hong Kong and Canada are already doing this work.  Recently, NGOs from Brazil, Sweden and New Zealand have joined up as well. The presence of micro plastic beads in consumer products, including cosmetics, is accused of impacting the marine environment but also indirectly the human health as they enter the food chain. “Plastic only breaks down partially and leaves little pieces of plastic called microbeads. The worst part, water treatment plants are unable to filter these microbeads completely and thus directly influence the plastic soup that threatens the oceans,” said Jeroen Dagevos of the North Sea Foundation. Obviously, the ultimate goal of NGOs is to push companies to stop using plastic microsbeads and to replace them by other materials more environmentally friendly, so as Unilever and Lush have done by announcing to stop using these products at the beginning of the year, or, more recently, The Body Shop."
The formulation of green cosmetics remains an obstacle course,"Formulation, preservation, and even the mere measurement of ingredients’ sustainability, are among the main technical challenges that green cosmetic formulators and brands have to face according to Organic Monitor. “ Preservation remains the number one technical hurdle for formulators of natural and organic personal care products,” explains the market research firm.  “Although many green materials have become available for preservation, no single material is popular because of variations in product composition. Stability is a major issue, with some green preservative systems leading to discolouration and / or odour changes.” Organic Monitor also points out the lack of agreement among certification agencies regarding green surfactants and the production processes that may be permissible. On the contrary, huge progress has been made in the area of green emulsifiers and rheology modifiers. Organic Monitor finds that many ingredients are now available to produce elegant skin care emulsions. Major developments have also been made in the field of sustainable extraction, with a wide variety of techniques and processes now in use and a number of ingredient companies investing in new sustainable technologies.  For instance, the Zeta Fraction technology of AkzoNobel enables natural actives to be harvested from plant materials with a lower environment impact than traditional methods. Mibelle Biochemistry is using plant stem cell technology to extract actives from plants. Its PhytoCellTec technique allows active ingredients to be extracted from rare and exotic plant species in a sustainable manner. Another difficulty is that the environmental impact of green materials is not always easy to measure.  “Formulators may wish to replace synthetics with green materials, however the move can have unintended consequences on ecosystems.  Palm oil, the most widely used vegetable oil in cosmetic applications, has been responsible for the destruction of tropical rainforests in South-East Asia.  Questions also hang over the sustainable sourcing of many natural fragrances, as well as the growing use of food ingredients in cosmetic applications.” Organic Monitor believes the sustainability issues are likely to persist for many years yet. In conjunction with the next Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, which will take place in Paris on 21-23rd October 2013, Organic Monitor will also organize the first Sustainable Beauty Awards ceremony. Three finalists (listed in alphabetical order) have been selected per award category: Sustainability Pioneer Finalists:

"“Tree-sourced polymers could replace many oiled-sourced polymers,” Ohto Nuottamo, Stora Enso","Premium Beauty News - The paper industry in Europe has made tremendous progress on the way to sustainability, and is now viewed as one of the leading sectors in this field. Ohto Nuottamo -  The main reason is that during the 1970s and 1980s, the paper industry in general, and the biggest companies in particular, have been attacked by NGOs for their impact on the environment.  This coincided with the emergence of new analytical equipment that allowed measuring small amounts of dioxin in the products.  As a consequence of these pressures, the paper industry evolved its practices and became very good in fields such as traceability and effluent control.  We invested a lot of money to control or emissions in water or in the atmosphere. Furthermore, the reduction of CO2 emissions is now a key indicator of performance. As far as Stora Enso is concerned, 80% of the energy we currently use in our manufacturing process is bio-sourced and our aim is to reach 100%. Compared to other industries, such as the cement industry for instance, we have made tremendous progress in the way to sustainability.  Nevertheless, the situation in the paper industry is not all perfect and bad land use practices remain in some countries such as Indonesia or Brazil.  It is the common responsibility of the whole industry to promote environmentally friendly practices at a global scale, in particular regarding the impacts on the forest and on water and air quality.  In Europe, the paper industry now has a positive impact on forests, we grow more trees than we use.  Regarding the effluents in water and in the air, we have considerably decreased them. Our impact is not inexistent but very limited and local. Premium Beauty News - But today, NGOs have shifted their pressure on the plastic industry. Ohto Nuottamo - All the industries that have difficulties to properly manage the origin (the cradle) and the end of life (the grave) of their goods have and will have increasing difficulties with NGOs.  Beyond NGOs, brand owners are increasingly sensitive to environmental issues because they know that everything is visible now and that in case of problem they will be in the front line of public pressure. Premium Beauty News - Packaging in general suffers from a bad perception. Ohto Nuottamo - Unfortunately, packaging waste is on top of the consumers’ mind.  The average impact of a product’s packaging in carbon emissions is less than 10%, but the most visible problem with packaging is waste. Nobody feels good about the tremendous quantity of garbage that developed societies produce every year.  Simultaneously, people are increasingly willing to cooperate in waste management schemes. They consider that waste has some value and that this value should not be discarded.  This belief participates in the feeling that we need to create a circular economy instead of the linear economy  we have been used to. The European packaging waste law that sets recycling and reuse targets for each material correspond to this new circular economy.  In these fields, carton and paper can boast very high scores compared to fossil polymers. Premium Beauty News - Each industrial sector claims its materials to be more sustainable than the others. PET for instance is a plastic polymer with good recyclability scores. How to make sense out of all these claims? Ohto Nuottamo - I would add that plastics in general are very competitive in terms of weight reduction. Actually, conducting full life cycling analyses is the only way to have a clear view of the environmental impact of a product and to compare it with another. However, we can broadly review the benefits and costs of different materials used for packaging: – glass has a positive image, it is recyclable but it is a heavy product and it requires lot of energy to be recycled,
– metals can be quite easily sorted, reused and recycled, 
– plastics have a bad image, not all of them can be recycled and they correspond to the typical linear economy,
– bio-plastics on the contrary correspond to a circular economy, but only a small proportion of plastics are plant-based, experts say that 1.5% could be a reasonable target by 2020. And there is also the problem of the competition in land use with food production.
– paper is both renewable and recyclable. Furthermore, trees can grow - and usually grow - in areas that are of low agricultural interest, and forests provide a large variety of environmental services. For instance growing the surface of forests has a big impact on CO2 levels in the atmosphere. The extra growth of all the trees we are no longer cutting in Europe can absorb a large part of our new CO2 emissions. I’m truly convinced that the use of carton and paper as packaging materials should and could be increased in many industries.  The paper industry in Europe has achieved such tremendous environmental results that it is now intrinsically sustainable. Unfortunately, it does not always succeed in communicating on this aspect. Premium Beauty News - Everything in packaging cannot come from trees! Ohto Nuottamo -  Not everything of course, but much more than currently does.  Actually, tree fibres have a structure that is close from a polymer structure. Our vision is that, in the future, thanks to this structure, tree-sourced polymers could replace many oiled-sourced polymers.  For instance, we think that in the future, 100% of food packaging can be tree-based. In order to stimulate research and development regarding a wider use of carton-based packaging we are launching a new edition of our Recreate Packaging competition this year.  We are expecting more than 70 universities to participate.  Our aim is to show what it is possible to do with carton and paper and to help converters in their way to innovation. We know that innovation requires cooperation between suppliers and customers, for instance to develop new methods and new machines.  However, our core business is not to develop new packaging, our core business is to manage forests and to produce paper and carton. Premium Beauty News - According to you, what are the main prospects for carton-based packaging? Ohto Nuottamo - There are many possible avenues. One of them could be to produce packaging materials directly from cellulose, by skipping the paper step.  What we are doing now is to cut trees into pieces, to add 99% water to these pieces and then to use huge machines to remove the water.  The whole process requires tremendous amounts of water and a lot of energy.  I’m convinced that partnerships between us and the chemical industry will be a key factor of success in the development of innovative sustainable processes and materials. Pulping will become a key industry in the future."
Sustainability of cosmetics packaging progresses slowly,"As far as packaging sustainability is concerned, most developments are occurring in ecodesign, reveals a recent research by Organic Monitor.  Actually, many brands are focusing on the reduction of packaging materials by changing design structures. Sustainable design is epitomized by SOU, a mass-market brand recently launched by Natura Brasil.  SOU toiletries and skin care products are housed in flexible packaging that have 70% less plastic than rigid plastic containers of the same volume. As a consequence, most changes in packaging design are only leading to an incremental decrease in packaging materials.  This is not so bad since, according to the OECD, packaging comprises over half of all household waste in developed countries. In some cases, the reduction in packaging material may be impressive.  Unilever, for instance, introduced a new ‘compressed’ can for a number of its deodorant brands earlier this year. The deodorant cans are about a third smaller, reducing packaging material costs as well as transportation costs. However, there are many cases where the ecological benefits from less packaging material are offset by higher unit sales.  “More radical solutions involving materials are necessary to make significant changes to the packaging impact of cosmetic products,” underlines the market research firm. According to Organic Monitor, relatively few developments are occurring in packaging materials. Although some cosmetic brands are experimenting with sustainable materials like bamboo and wood, plastic packaging still prevails. Plant-based plastics, once hailed because of their biodegradable nature, have yet to make headway in cosmetic applications. Some companies like Procter & Gamble are using hybrid polymers to overcome the limitations of bioplastics. Its Pantene Pro-V Nature Fusion packaging is mainly made from biopolymers sourced from sugar cane. However, Organic Monitor considers that few companies have managed to innovate with green packaging.  “A closed loop system whereby waste is used as raw materials is considered the way forward for many cosmetic brands taking the green road.” To further explore this issue, Organic Monitor has placed sustainable packaging at the core of the upcoming Latin American (18-20 September 2013, São Paulo) and European (21-23rd October 2013, Paris) editions of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit. Discussion topics include environmental impact of packaging, ecodesign innovations, novel packaging materials, bioplastics in cosmetics, and green packaging success stories; papers will be given by Natura Brasil, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Arkema, Selerant, Aptar, ABIHPEC, etc."
"Biodiversity offers branding opportunities, says UEBT","Seventy per cent of consumers surveyed worldwide are aware of biodiversity, while 48 per cent can give a correct definition of the term biodiversity, shows the 2013 Biodiversity Barometer report launched last week in Paris by the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT).  The survey also unveil that consumers in Brazil, China and France, show a particular awareness about biodiversity. “The Biodiversity Barometer is an important source of information on global trends in biodiversity awareness. The results not only demonstrate a growing consciousness, they also show that respecting biodiversity provides tremendous opportunities for business around the world,” says Braulio Ferreira de Souza Dias, Executive Secretary for the Convention on Biological Diversity. This year’s special focus on China reveals that apart from a very high biodiversity awareness (94 per cent), Chinese consumers surveyed also show high knowledge of biodiversity: 64% could define correctly what biodiversity means. UEBT also asked persons involved in the survey to mention “the three brands that are making the most efforts to respect biodiversity.”  At this level, answers were manifold and often country-specific. For instance, in Brazil, there is a clear leader with Natura (49%). In the USA, most mentioned food brands, including Kraft, Starbucks and Ben & Jerry’s. UK has two leading companies: Bodyshop and CO-OP (23% and 20%). In France Yves Rocher, Nestle and Danone top the list, while in China the perceived leaders are Yili, Mengliu and Amway. “There are clear opportunities for brands to position themselves around the issue of biodiversity, and anticipate increasing consumer interest on this issue” concludes Rémy Oudghiri, Director of Trends and Insights at IPSOS. However, there is hardly any mention of biodiversity in corporate communication. “Today 32 of the top 100 beauty companies in the world refer to biodiversity in their corporate communications such as sustainability reporting and websites. This is considerably higher than in 2009, but much lower than what we found in the top 100 food companies,” says Rik Kutsch Lojenga, Executive Director of UEBT. Nevertheless, it is worth too note that, according to the 2013 UEBT Barometer, 87 per cent of consumers say they want to be better informed about how companies source their natural ingredients, and a large majority of consumers say they would to boycott brands that do not take good care of environmental or ethical trade practices in its sourcing and production processes."
Unilever’s sustainability efforts help to drive growth,"Working for sustainable development would have a positive effect on sales.  In any case, it is what Unilever claims, highlighting the group’s brands that have made sustainability central to their proposition or product innovation have accelerated sales during 2012. For instance, says the company, Lifebuoy soap, which has increased its handwashing education programmes, has seen double digit growth in each of the last three years.  Similarly, dry shampoos such as TRESemmé and Dove, which result in 90% less greenhouse gas emissions compared to washing hair in heated water, grew by nearly 20% in 2012. Unilever is also accelerating the integration of sustainability into the heart of many of its biggest brands. For example Dove, the group’s largest personal care brand with sales of over 3 billion euros, redesigned its self esteem programme for young people in 2012 to further strengthen its engagement with consumers by helping them look and feel their best. At the same time, eco-efficiencies in Unilever factories from reducing energy, water and materials consumption, as well as waste production, would have enabled the group to take over 300 million euros out of the system since 2008. The company has also reduced risk at a time of volatility in food commodity prices by increasing its purchases of agricultural raw materials from sustainable sources from 14% in 2010 to 36% in 2012. “Sustainability is contributing to our virtuous circle of growth. The more our products meet social needs and help people live sustainably, the more popular our brands become and the more we grow. And the more efficient we are at managing resources such as energy and raw materials, the more we lower our costs and reduce the risks to our business and the more we are able to invest in sustainable innovation and brands,” says Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever. In 2010 Unilever has chosen to put sustainable and equitable growth at the heart of its operations and growth strategy, setting three big goals, all to be achieved by 2020: 1) Help more than a billion people take action to improve their health and well-being; 
2) Source 100% of agricultural raw materials sustainably;
3) Halve the environmental footprint of its products across the value chain. Since the launch of the plan, the group has made significant progress on several of these issues.  For instance, Unilever announced to have achieved a CO2 reduction of more than one million tonnes from its manufacturing and logistics operations compared to the 2008 levels. This is equivalent to taking 250,000 cars off the road. Although, to reach its goals Unilever will also have to face numerous challenges. To that end, helping consumers change their behaviour to live more sustainably is a key factor of success. In the absence of major framework changes by governments, the company is tackling this in a number of ways, from driving habit change through packaging solutions, such as single dose laundry detergent capsules which make it easier for consumers to dose accurately, to working with others such as retailers and civil society organisations to encourage shoppers to make sustainable choices at the supermarket and in the home. In addition, Unilever is leveraging its scale and reach to work with its many suppliers across the value chain to instil sustainable practices."
P&G achieves zero manufacturing waste at 45 sites worldwide,"Procter & Gamble (P&G) is about to achieve one of its four first environmental steps: having zero consumer and manufacturing waste go to landfills. P&G announced its first zero manufacturing waste to landfill site in Budapest in 2007.  Since then, the company has shared a long-term environmental vision, pledging to work toward zero consumer and manufacturing waste worldwide.  According to the consumer goods giant - well known for its global beauty and personal care brands such as Crest, Head & Shoulders, Gillette, Oral-B, Olay, Pantene, SK-II and Wella - less than 1% of all materials entering its sites globally leaves as waste.  Through quality assurance, packaging reduction, compaction and recycling efforts, the company now ensures that 99% of all materials entering P&G plants leaves as finished product or is recycled, reused or converted to energy. To drive all sites toward zero, P&G has searched for innovative ways to find value in what was once seen as waste. For instance, in Mexico, paper sludge from a Charmin toilet tissue plant is turned into low-cost roof tiles used to build homes in the local community. At a U.S. Pampers site, scrap from the wipe manufacturing process is converted to upholstery filling. And, in the U.K., waste created in the production of Gillette shaving foam is composted then used to grow turf for commercial uses. “There are well-defined systems for recycling materials like paper, plastic and glass, but our product portfolio is incredibly broad, resulting in a diverse set of waste streams to find sustainable solutions for,” shared Dr. Forbes McDougall, who leads P&G’s global zero manufacturing waste program. “We focused on finding solutions for our toughest waste streams at our largest sites, and while initially we saw progress in our overall corporate recycling, the increase in zero landfill sites was slow. Today, we have found ways to divert most of our major waste streams away from landfill, so we’re now seeing new sites achieve zero manufacturing waste to landfill nearly every month.” The three other steps within P&G’s long-term environmental sustainability vision include: powering all P&G plants with 100% renewable energy, using 100% renewable or recycled materials for all products and packaging produced by the company, and designing products while maximizing the conservation of resources. “We have a vision for the future, where plants are powered by renewable energy, products are made from recycled and renewable materials and resources are conserved, with no waste going to landfill. Changing the way we see waste as a company has brought us one step closer to this goal at 45 sites worldwide, where all of our manufacturing waste is recycled, repurposed or converted into energy,” said Bob McDonald, P&G President, CEO and Chairman of the Board. According to P&G, the work to find worth in waste has created over 1 billion US dollars in value for the company over the past 5 years."
Microplastics: Lush hot on Unilever’s heels,"On Wednesday 30th January 2013, Lush Cosmetics pledged to remove all glitter and microplastics from its product range. According to Hilary Jones, Ethics Director at Lush Cosmetics, it is the outcome of a long process.  ""Here at Lush we are known for our fizzing baths of fun and decoration. But some of the shine and sparkle in our bath products used to be from micro plastic glitters. For some years now, because of our concerns about the accumulation of plastics in the environment, we have been gradually replacing these plastic glitters with new alternatives as innovations have become available,” she said. Eventually, over 50% of the plastic glitters still used by Lush were concentrated into three long-term best selling products.  The challenge was therefore to find suitable replacements that would not upset loyal customers and make them disappointed with products they had long loved.  The solution came from new agar based glitters and other biodegradable options recently launched onto the market. In order to keep fun and excitement in its baths, Lush has replaced glitter with edible lustres, rice paper confetti, popping candy, sugar decorations and even developed its own confetti made in house by dehydrating honeydew melons and mixing with its custom, palm free soap base. The decision of the British brand has been celebrated by several marine conservation organizations. “Microplastics are a growing problem in our seas and oceans. This is a really forward thinking decision by Lush to phase out plastic glitter in their products,” commented Dr Sue Kinsey Senior Pollution Policy Officer with the Marine Conservation Society. For its part, Andy Cummins, Campaigns Director with Surfers Against Sewage said he was “stoked to see Lush once more promoting the sustainable achievable solutions.” Both organizations are urging other companies to do the same. In response to the controversy regarding the use of micro-plastics in cosmetic and personal care products, several suppliers have launched biodegradable alternatives or have seized this opportunity to put already existing ranges under the spotlights. For instance, Koster Keunen has recently stressed that the plant based waxes in bead form the company has been making for several years can be a good alternative to plastic beads.  These waxes are derived from sunflower wax and rice bran wax and non-hydrogenated with melt points at 75-80°C.  They are suitable for a wide range of exfoliation applications including cleansers, masks and scrubs and are available in custom sizes and colours. [1] “Our company has pioneered natural waxes since 1852 and the expansion from beeswax to sunflower wax is only the most recent extension of our varied sustainable product offerings,” said Koster Keunen President John Koster. For its part, Impact Colors offers two entirely natural and biodegradable solutions derived from rice and bamboo: Rice Exfoliator Vision Beads [2] and Bamboo Exfoliator Vision Beads [3].  “They work at the cellular level to naturally restore skin’s beauty through gently sloughing off skin’s surface cells. These Vision Beads exfoliation spheres gently exfoliate and deeply clean the skin while protecting and moisturizing, unlike other facial scrubs which are abrasive and can cause skin damage,” claims the company. “Impact Colors is constantly looking for the best and most pure natural ingredients,” said Doug Thornley, president."
Unilever to phase out the use of plastic micro beads in personal care products,"“The issue of plastics particles in the ocean is an important issue and we have reviewed the use of micro beads in our portfolio (both current products and those in the pipeline),” explained Unilever in a statement.  The group took its decision in the wake of a web campaign and a call to ban all cosmetics containing plastic micro beads launched by a group of NGOs headed by the Dutch Plastic Soup Foundation and Stichting De Noordzee (the North Sea Foundation). According to the Plastic Soup Foundation, many cosmetic products - such as body scrubs, toothpastes, face or hair cleaners - contain plastic micro beads that are washed down the drain after use thus contributing to the “plastic soup”, the increased concentration of suspended plastic particulates in oceanic waters.  “This debris are about the same size range as plankton organisms and marine species are not able to distinguish food from this micro plastic.  On top of that micro beads also concentrate persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and are thus a transport medium for toxic chemicals in the marine environment. The fish you eat may be poisoned because of this,” details the organisation. Actually, plastic particles are an increasing cause of water pollution.  They originate from microbeads contained in cosmetic products as well as from the breakdown products of plastic litter.  However, it is difficult to determine precisely the origin of these micro particles but it is unlikely that cosmetics be the main source of pollution, in particular compared to plastic packaging litter. In any case, marine life is severely threatened by these small pieces of plastic that have frequently been found in the digestive tracts of various marine creatures, where they can cause direct physiological damage or leach chemical pollutants such as dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) or polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB). Plastic microspheres have numerous uses in cosmetics, skin care and personal care industries. According to Cospheric, one of the main producer of coloured microspheres, they can be used as exfoliating agents but also as carriers of beneficial ingredients and they effectively scatter light minimizing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. “They also create a ball-bearing effect in creams and lotions resulting in luxury feel and smooth silky texture.” The Plastic Soup Foundation and Stichting De Noordzee found micro beads in at least 23 Unilever products and published the list on Facebook and the internet. It is unclear whether microbeads contained in cosmetics can be filtered out by state of the art water purification processes. Few water treatment plants are well equipped and this is usually not the case in emerging countries such as China, Indonesia and Brazil where cosmetics companies are making a growing part of their revenue. ""Products containing micro beads would then almost certainly join the plastic soup,"" said Maria Westerbos of the Plastic Soup Foundation. The Unilever group said it will eliminate all micro beads in its personal care products sold in the Netherlands by mid 2013 and will do the same for the rest of the world by 2015. ""We congratulate Unilever for taking this important decision. The group, which is proud of its record on sustainability, has indeed matched its actions to its words. We understand very well that Unilever cannot stop using micro beads in its products from one day to the next,” said Maria Westerbos."
The use of squalane in cosmetics criticized by an NGO,"Because of its stability, its hydrating properties and its non-oily texture squalane is known to be one of the most effective emollients of the market. However, it has been progressively neglected by formulators because of supply difficulties concerning both animal-derived squalane, sourced from shark livers and impacted by criticism against this supply-chain, and plant-derived squalane, mostly sourced from olive oil, and suffering from the price variability due to its interdependence with food oil. In order to solve these difficulties, U.S. company Amyris has launched in 2011 a renewable squalane derived from sugarcane. However, according to the Bloom’s report, on a global scale, the squalane used in cosmetics would still largely come from sharks.  “Only in Europe does the market seem to have moved predominantly towards plant-based squalane,” states the NGO.  “In Japan, the world’s leading market for squalane (40% of global demand), plant squalane is almost non-existent.” According to the study, around 90% of the world shark liver oil production feeds the needs	 of the cosmetics  industry, which  corresponds to 2.7  million deep-sea sharks caught every year.  Furthermore, these sharks would not be by catch animals simply “being put to good use”, but the product of targeted fisheries. “Although Western corporations have taken a sharp turn in favour of plant-based squalane, the cosmetics industry worldwide is still largely supplied by animal squalane,” comments Romain Chabrol, author of the study.  He emphasizes that blind tests run on the products of major cosmetics brands have shown that businesses were sometimes misled by their suppliers into being sold to them was plant‐based. Regulations restricting fisheries of deep‐sea sharks in the Northern Atlantic where 95% of some shark species have disappeared have prompted fleets to displace their fishing effort to the tropical and semi‐tropical waters. “The move away from waters subject to EU regulations is ideal for unscrupulous fleets.  The only way of putting an end to such destructive fishing practices is to tackle the root of the problem,” warns Claire Nouvian, founder of Bloom. The organisation requests that consumers be informed about the animal or vegetable origin of the squalane contained in the products they buy."
Environmental impact of packaging: compare what is comparable,"From an ecological point of view, is it better to choose a glass or a plastic container? Is recycled glass better for the environment than recycled plastic? Are plant-based polymers really greener? Actually, the answers that the average consumer can get to these questions are sometimes far-fetched.  ""Comparisons on packaging alone are too often based on a limited number of criteria (one or two),” regrets the French Packaging Council. Under such conditions, claiming that some packaging types would be more virtuous than others does not make sense. For the French Packaging Council, only comparisons that take into account all environmental impacts are likely to provide true information. According to the Council only environmental impacts assessments conducted with complete life-cycle assessment (LCA) are likely to provide “accurate, objective and thorough environmental information,” as required by French law n°2009-967 of August 3rd 2009, called Grenelle I. These assessments are based on standardized tools (ISO 14040 and 14044) and must be: multi-step (i.e. concerning the entire lifecycle of the product, from extracting raw materials and generating resources to final elimination, without leaving out production stages and utilization) and multi-criteria  (i.e. taking into consideration a sufficient number of environmental impacts). As far as packaging is concerned, the most generally investigated environmental impacts are are: climate change (greenhouse gases emissions, including CO2), water eutrophication, aquatic eco-toxicity, the exhaustion of non-renewable natural resources, non-renewable energy consumption, water consumption, air acidification, loss of biodiversity, production of non-recovered waste (ultimate waste). “The most common tools for carrying out thorough LCAs use six criteria on average (with a minimum of four),” the Council adds. However, the French Packaging Council reminds that, despite their interest, LCA calculations very often give results with 10-15% margins of error. “That means that any differences that are smaller than this margin are by definition relatively insignificant.” Furthermore, packaging often account for a small fraction of the problem and their environmental impact cannot be assessed independently from its use by the final consumer.  According to the Council, the relative share of packaging in the various environmental impacts is usually low (approximately 10% for food). “So general conclusions on the packed product should be avoided when packaging has much less of an impact than its contents.” Thus, according to the French Packaging Council, the comparison between packs made from different materials, is fair, objective and complete information only where: – the two packaging deliver the same value in use to the consumer/user (same features and usage characteristics) for the packed product. – a full multi-criteria LCA was conducted, – all examined impacts vary significantly in the same way (beyond error margins). A clarification that was definitely needed in a context where consumers express high concerns towards environmental issues but low confidence towards industry claims."
Responsible sourcing and cosmetics: innovation is the key to cope with pressure,"Premium Beauty News - If we judge by the number of steps taken by the industrial sector, it seems that the issue on ethical sourcing has become particularly acute for cosmetic products. How do you explain this phenomenon? Valérie Robillard - Like many other sectors, but with probably a higher intensity , due to the fact that products are in intimate contact with the body and applied to the skin, the permeability of which is now recognized, cosmetic brands must respond to a number of requests from consumers: On the absence of controversial ingredients in formulas, for ""greener"" products and more traceability. It must always be kept in mind that a company, specially when its products benefit from an excellent reputation, is under close scrutiny from the part of the public and of grass-root organizations: There is a real risk of being caught red handed because of one’s own behaviour or the one of a suppliers environmentally or socially speaking (child labour, human rights, etc.). And then there is market pressure, with a mushrooming of alternative offers. The French cosmetics market is currently worth about 350 million euros. And with the entry of private labels and of historical brands, it should continue to grow, albeit at a less sustained pace, to reach 500 million euros in 2015. Premium Beauty News - In fact, pressures are increasing? Valérie Robillard - Yes, specially when regulatory pressure must be also taken into account. I am refering in particular to REACH, or to the European directive on the ban of animal testing, but also to the Nagoya Protocol adopted in October 2011 on the access and sharing of benefit arising from the use of genetic resources. I also believe that the movement towards the labelling/certification of ingredients and finished products also contributes to increase the pressure by imposing a certain level of performance. Premium Beauty News - What are the solutions available to the industry in terms of responsible sourcing? Valérie Robillard - They involve the implementation of consistent, comprehensive and well controlled supply chains. The whole challenge stands in finding credible and satisfactory alternatives. Credible concerning the precautionary principle, and from this point of view there is always a risk of replacing a controversial product by one or several products that are equally problematic, this can be seen with parabens or the replacement of palm oil by soybean oil, which although it contributes to reducing deforestation, has transferred the problem from Indonesia to Latin America. We cannot be satisfied with simply displacing the problem. In addition to being credible, alternatives should also be satisfactory in terms of cost, availability and efficiency. This is indeed the problem with natural and organic products, which are often considered to be more expensive and less efficient by consumers who become used to textures, fragrances, a sensoriality and to galenics that natural products do not always manage to come to par with. Implement more responsible supply chains must also be an opportunity to sustain and secure supplies. In particular, for raw materials that enter in competition with foodstuff (vanilla, cocoa, avocado, quinoa), by offering more attractive volumes to suppliers, or by protecting oneself against bad harvests, reduced productivity, disease affecting plants. Secured and durable chains, based on sustainable approaches (for example by using part of the plant which cannot be used by the food industry) and partnerships also facilitates the implementation of procedures and controls to ensure a sufficient level of quality. We accompany and we help companies at this level. This implies a better understanding of the impacts of a purchasing strategy in particular on biodiversity, on resource availability, on local populations on the areas of production - it is possible to do a mapping of the company’s exposure to social or environmental risk, according to its purchasing strategy (nature of raw materials purchased, geographic origin, direct purchasing or through intermediaries, etc.); then through an analysis of deviations from objectives set up by labels and external standards (Ecocert, Nature et Progrès, BSCI, etc...), the identification of product or process alternatives and their integration in the strategy. More positively, beyond risk minimizing, a purchasing strategy can also be an opportunity to develop positive impacts by proactively integrating to one’s supply chain some social purpose enterprises - this is what L’Oréal does with its Solidarity Sourcing approach or BPCE with its PHARE approach on disabilities. Ready-made recipes do not exist, each case is different and this generally leads us – it is actually the goal – to co-create innovative solutions with stakeholders, this can take the form of dialogues or of partnerships with NGOs in the field, for example. However, we can rely on well structured existing tools, even if they are fairly generic, like the ISO 26000 standard on responsible purchasing."
"""Environmental issues must be natural reflexes in the development of projects,"" Frédéric Bonté, LVMH Recherche","Premium Beauty News - This is the first time that the LVMH annual symposium is dedicated to sustainable development! Frédéric Bonté - Previous symposia had addressed more fundamental research issues and this year’s theme, as surprising as it may seem, is just as essential to the future of our profession. Indeed, the cosmetic industry is aware of the profound changes affecting main raw materials used and who will have an impact on all our products. This reality is a full part of our long term strategy and of a collective commitment that also involves researchers from R & D in their everyday thinking. Premium Beauty News - The program places particular emphasis on the supply of cosmetic raw materials. Do you believe this is the main issue? Frédéric Bonté - Our industrial approach is a responsible one and raw materials represent both a industrial and societal challenge. Take oil for example, due to its extreme abundance, ease of extraction, its fields of applications, is in fact an important resource for the development of our ""modern"" lifestyle. But this resource, like many others, is not inexhaustible and estimations are that 30% of the oil production will have disappeared within 10 years. Therefore, we must reflect right now on general issues concerning the main solutions offered to us in terms of new resources, different from those directly coming from petrochemicals, for example. Today a lot of research work has been done on diversifications and ways to approach various resources and it seemed essential to us to take stock. From new sources, especially plant based, tomorrow’s materials will have different functionalities and qualities. We need to have natural raw materials the resource of which is controlled and a full traceability in respect of biodiversity. Premium Beauty News - A special emphasis will also be placed on the relationship between chemistry and responsible development. It is another way of addressing sustainability, less focused on natural products. Frédéric Bonté -  Chemistry is behind the transformation of a resource in other resources with new functionalities. Chemistry has made considerable progress in its environmental approach. The concepts of molecular economy, recyclable catalysts, of ""solvent free"" have become the daily concern of a number of engineers and it also impacts the processing of natural resources. This should enable a significant reduction in the impacts of raw materials production and processing by integrating the concept of eco-design. That being said, natural products, today, take their full place in the production of materials. For example, oleochemistry can now use natural fats from plants (soy, sunflower, rapeseed...) to transform them with short, targeted reactions into detergents, emulsifiers, gelling agents, polymers, a number of product categories that we use and which are therefore more easily biodegradable. Premium Beauty News - This year the LVMH group held, internally, its own Green Week, echoing the European Conference held in Brussels in May. The shift towards sustainable development seems more complicated to organize for the luxury industry? Frédéric Bonté - Our commitment to progress and innovation is unwavering in the respect of  the integration of the concept of sustainable development into all our activities. This includes the R & D activity upstream the development of our cosmetic products. The concept of sustainable development include the selection of raw materials, production chains and a more global notion of responsibility in the management of projects. Our will is also expressed through a research program on resource access and benefit sharing. During this symposium, the sharing of experience with other industries will help us collectively to enrich our thinking. Premium Beauty News - What is the role of a structure like LVMH Recherche in the implementation of responses to environmental issues within the group? Frédéric Bonté - Research and development work in line with the commitments of the group and brands which are part of the Perfumes and Cosmetics branch. Environmental issues must become natural reflexes in the development of projects, be it in skincare or make-up for example. Choosing a material over another, raising the awareness of our partners and suppliers and asking them for a complete traceability of the different steps or by-products of the materials that they propose us are part of our strategy of environmental preservation. We actively participate to grounds policies through the preservation and re-colonization of orchids or of ingredients in the Dior gardens. We also tackle our research and development issues by taking into account requirements in terms of consumption and biodegradability, solvents limitation, or risk management... It is through our every day pro-activity, that we can build trust and a sustainable future, in line with the commitments of our group."
Responsible sourcing: Expanscience’s proactive approach ,"Premium Beauty News - When a group like yours initiates this kind of approach, you face to two types of issues. Environmental issues, of course, but also issues which are specific to the industry in which your group is operating? Karen Lemasson - Absolutely! We must protect the environment and its biodiversity. We can say that today we are facing a real endangerment of services offered by Nature to the economy. Without being over-pessimistic, we must still bear in mind that, according to the IUCN [1], a quarter of mammals and every eighth bird are threatened with extinction and that 80% of the global primary forest has disappeared since 1998. Furthermore companies in our industry obviously need to secure their supplies by integrating in their ""inner workings"" a ""high level of acceptability on what they do vis-a-vis their stakeholders"" (Actors in chains, consumers, suppliers, authorities...). In a nutshell..., ""Companies will be evaluated according to the care they provide to others"" (ISO 26000). In the continuity of this last message, we must recall the main principles expressed in the ""Nagoya Protocol"", i.e. a control of the access to genetic resources (GR) and of the benefit sharing (ABS). Premium Beauty News - Your group has made very strong commitments for 2015. And this seems to be just around the corner! Karen Lemasson - Indeed, it’s looming on the horizon but it needs to be prepared now! Our Group operates in both pharmacy, dermo-cosmetics (with the Mustela and Noviderm brands), and in the field of cosmetic actives. As part of our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy we have made commitments for 2015 and in particular the one of having 100% of our new products in dermo-cosmetics eco-designed by 2015. In concrete terms, this means that for our packaging either we work under the ""3R"" approach (Reduce, Replace, Recycle) or we chose the right ingredients. This means we work on all the life stages of our dermo-cosmetic products (from sourcing to the product’s end-of-life) to identify and reduce the most important environmental impacts. In line with these guidelines, we are also working on a more ""responsible"" and transparent communication (for example we are working on more ""responsible"" promotional items, on more eco friendly communication media, on our messages etc..). This commitment includes of course our purchases and requires both to secure our supply channels for raw materials but also to secure our purchases and all this, by reducing the legacy of our suppliers and providers societal impacts. In 2015, we will have deployed a CSR-oriented action plan on 100% of our vegetables sectors. To achieve this, we will need of course to have a legal and contractual access to vegetable sources, respect traditional skills, respect biodiversity and be aware of operating a fair return towards local populations, but not only: we must also cover the social aspects (health) of economic development, etc.  What is at hand is a global reading of all these issues. In short, we must establish a true responsible purchasing policy. Premium Beauty News - How do you operate and according to which benchmark criteria?  Karen Lemasson - Our CSR strategy on our vegetable supply chains is based on ISO 26000 (see figure below based on the seven central issues in terms of social responsibility). We are subject to an independent analysis concerning our ""fair return"" practices (ABS or APA in particular) and of biodiversity preservation (UEBT). Indeed, since December 2011, the Laboratoires Expanscience are members of the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT), thus reinforcing their commitment in their efforts to preserve biodiversity and of compliance with the rules of ethical trade all along their vegetables supply chains. To note that we are the first French pharmaceutical lab to have joined the UEBT. Premium Beauty News - Can you give us a concrete and recent example of the approach of Laboratories Expanscience? Lemasson Karen - Yes, the one on avocado for example. We had to find committed partners, establish identity cards and take actions to reduce the negative impacts and stimulate the positive ones. We went through open and constructive negotiations to validate a fair price, with the desire to have a policy of close support and direct exchanges with local partners. We chose to encourage the local manufacture of oils and cakes. For example, one of our partners very involved in terms of social responsibility undertook an extensive rebalancing work centred on the local access to the fruit by valorising old non-exploitable trees through the development of adapted grafting techniques enabling their near rejuvenation. Premium Beauty News - A responsible purchasing policy which goes, of course, far beyond ingredients?  Karen Lemasson - We take everything into account (promotional items, materials etc..) At each of our products life stage and of course within an ongoing improvement process!"
"“Sustainability starts with the sourcing of our ingredients,” Bas Schneiders , Weleda","Premium Beauty News - Weleda is well known for its natural medications and beauty products.  How naturalness combines with sustainability? Bas Schneiders - Actually, the two of them are closely linked.  Sustainability is in our DNA, it is the starting point of our corporate identity and it goes hand in hand with our strategy and values.  Which means that the way we operate our business must be consistent with the message brought through our products and it must meet with our customer’s expectations.  Nevertheless, it is true that being natural does not automatically means being sustainable.  We have therefore set-up a package of sustainability goals to guide our business: ecological sourcing & biodiversity, fair trade, climate neutrality, sustainable packaging, water management, and, communication. Premium Beauty News - It is also why you became a member of the Union for Ethical Bio Trade? Bas Schneiders - Since ecological sourcing & biodiversity is a major  keystone of our sustainability strategy, becoming a UEBT member was merely logical.  UEBT plays a key role in developing both the public’s and business’s awareness on issues such as sustainable and ethical sourcing.  As we only use natural ingredients, biodiversity is the source of our business and we cannot afford to have a negative impact on it.  This is why I say that preserving biodiversity is part of our business model. Premium Beauty News - And what about fair trade? Bas Schneiders -  Fair trade is a way to share our values with our suppliers.  The difficulty with fair trade is that there are a lot of different standards, a lot of different certifiers and labels.  As a consequence, it is somewhat complex to provide clear information to consumers.  In particular for a cosmetics company that uses hundreds of ingredients!  From this point of view, the UEBT standard is very interesting and practical.  It is a very good management tool for the verification of all our supply chains of natural ingredients. We currently run over 50 partnerships and projects with suppliers around the world.  Working on a long-term basis and avoiding one-shot actions is beneficial to all parties.  It is a guarantee for our suppliers and a way to secure our supply chain for us.  In the context of rising prices for raw materials and speculating markets, these partnerships are also interesting from an economical point of view. Premium Beauty News - Why is the supply chain so important in your sustainability strategy? Bas Schneiders - Because everything starts with the quality of the ingredients and because it is a key factor in the transparency consumers expect from us. All the ingredients we use must be organic or comply with stringent ecological and social standards.  We control and assess all our suppliers from the origin.  For instance, when we buy sesame oil, we assess our suppliers but also the initial producers. Premium Beauty News - But your strategy is not limited to sourcing organic and fair trade ingredients? Bas Schneiders - As I mentioned, some of the other key areas are climate neutrality, sustainable packaging, and, water management. As far as climate change is concerned, we carefully look at the environmental impact of our supply chain and have a programme to reduce our carbon footprint.  Our final goal is to become carbon neutral, for instance by using only green energy  in our production plants and offices.  Where becoming carbon neutral is not possible, we’ll compensate what is left. Packaging is another important area with a heavy environmental impact.  We are working in three different directions in order to reduce this impact:  reduction of the volume and weight of packaging materials, increase the use of recyclable materials, and finally a redesign of our packaging (cradle to cradle). Eventually, we have identified the use of water and water management as another key issue regarding sustainability.  While this topic does hardly emerge in current discussions about corporate sustainability, we believe it will top the agenda in the future.  Water supplies are a real problem at a global scale.  Our main goal is to reduce the water footprint of our supply chain, for example by implementing better water management schemes in our own premises and by helping our suppliers to improve their performance in this field. Premium Beauty News - Is a high sustainability performance a real competitive advantage? Bas Schneiders - For a company like Weleda there is no doubt about that.  Our consumers have very high expectations in this field.  In a context where many cosmetic companies intend to improve their environmental credentials by greening some parts of their activity, our consumers expect us to remain leaders in sustainability. Actually, there are in fact very few companies with ambitions similar to ours."
Sincoplas: reduce CO2 emissions to reduce costs,"Reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and achieve cost savings at the same time. This is the challenge taken up by Sincoplas, this French converter specialized in plastic injected parts intended for perfume and cosmetic packagings which employs 100 people on its production site. ""The carbon footprint evaluation was undertaken for several reasons"", explains Patrice Lhomme, Sales Director, ""it was implemented first of course to offer our modest climate-friendly contribution, to act responsibly against global warming, but also to meet customer demand and, why not achieve savings."" Unlike companies with more than 500 employees [1], French SMEs do not have specific obligations regarding their carbon footprint. But for Sincoplas it was a strategic choice. ""Beyond environmental issues, we thought it could be a good opportunity to reduce costs, while anticipating financial risks in connection with rising energy prices and the implementation of a carbon tax."" To succeed in bringing together these different objectives,Sincoplas turned to the Discover company, a service provider specialized in cost reductions and value for money for which, in a competitive market, responsible commitment must be reconciled with the companies necessary development. ""Our approach was that, based on the carbon balance, we could identify sources of overconsumption and thus more easily achieve our goals of cost reduction. This fitted perfectly with the approach of Discover who earns a return through its energy saving recommendations,"" added Patrice Lhomme. Using the Carbon Balance method developed by the ADEME (French Environment and Energy Management Agency), Sincoplas was able to evaluate its GHG emissions to about 2,107 tons of CO2 equivalent with, as main processes responsible for GHG emissions, inputs (38% of total), followed by future packagings (26%) and energy consumption(15%). To reduce these emissions, four priority work areas were defined: – 	energy consumption (equipment upgrading, a better insulation of the production site, etc.),
– 	packagings (finding alternatives to thermo-shrink films, a reduction in the use of thermoformed material),
– 	travels (setting up of a training on eco-driving),
– 	raw materials (a study on alternative materials leading to a lower emissions of GHG emissions while preserving the same mechanical and physical properties). Once implemented, all of these actions should generate a diminution in GHG emissions by 19% in the short and medium term. ""For several processes we will also save some resources by reducing some wastage. Even though we didn’t find a considerable pool of cost reduction at the end of this carbon balance."" Sincoplas will be performing a new carbon balance in two years, in order to evaluate the impact of actions taken. But this experiment is already positive, according to Lhomme. ""In terms of motivation first. All the services were involved, results were presented to the whole staff and the action plan was prepared with all team leaders.""  Above all, Sincoplas considers this type of action as an investment for the future. ""Our customers increasingly tend to integrate their supplier’s environmental impact in their selection grid. The reduction in GHG emissions, along with eco-design, will become the norm. One or both of these requirements is now included systematically in the briefs that we receive."" So why not jump the gun straight away to not have to rush and bear the brunt afterwards. Especially since it is not always easy to bring together sometimes opposing demands. ""In our industry, the environmental variable adds up to strong price pressure, combined with a requirement to remain uncompromising on luxury codes. The only solution is to act methodically by giving oneself the time to find the best technical solutions,"" Patrice Lhomme."
Ethical sourcing and biodiversity: rising values within the cosmetics industry,"Premium Beauty News - The UEBT has repeatedly drawn the attention of cosmetic manufacturers on the notion of ethical sourcing. In 2010 you were stressing particularly on the lack of credibility of the cosmetic industry on this issue. How have things changed since? Rik Kutsch Lojenga -  In 2010 we did indeed highlight that consumers have a very low trust in the cosmetics sector (30%) practicing ethical sourcing. Over the last years these figures have not really improved. However, we do see an important prise de conscience in the cosmetics sector.  Various brands have intensified efforts on ethical sourcing. Biodiversity is also becoming more important in their corporate and other communication. From 2009 to 2011 the percentage of companies of the top 100 beauty companies that mentioned biodiversity in their corporate communications went up from 13 to 27%. Premium Beauty News – Involving the private sector in the protection of biodiversity, is also an important part of your partnership with the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity. What are your plans? Rik Kutsch Lojenga - For 2020 the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has set an ambitious target to raise public and private sector awareness on biodiversity. Through its Biodiversity Barometer UEBT supports the CBD Secretariat in measuring this target. Another important goal for 2020 is putting in practice principles on access to biodiversity for research and development, as well as equitable sharing of resulting benefits. Through its hands-on work with companies on this issue, UEBT also makes a contribution to realising this target. Premium Beauty News – Your barometer on the awareness of biodiversity now covers nine countries, including India, Peru and Brazil.   What are the main trends? Rik Kutsch Lojenga - The results of the 2012 edition of the Biodiversity Barometer will be presented on 12 April during our annual conference. We are currently analysing the results, but overall we see an increasing awareness on biodiversity at the level of the consumers and private sector in the surveyed countries. With this awareness, consumer expectations regarding companies’ sourcing practices are shown to be growing as well. Premium Beauty News - In Europe, do economic uncertainties weigh on these issues? Rik Kutsch Lojenga - Yes, this is certainly having an impact. Companies are focusing on economic variables, and are cautious to engage in new initiatives. Yet, there are also opportunities. In these challenging times a commitment to ethical sourcing may further bind the consumers giving them something to feel good about. We also see that companies are looking for growth outside Europe in emerging markets. In these markets, like is the case in Brazil, biodiversity is an important aspect of ethical sourcing. Premium Beauty News – You are organizing in April in Paris a new conference intended for the beauty sector. What will be the main themes? Rik Kutsch Lojenga -  Our 2012 Beauty of Sourcing with Respect conference will explore sustainability trends in emerging markets. There will be an opportunity to learn about concrete initiatives of companies such as Symrise Brazil and Laboratoires Expanscience to mainstream ethical sourcing of biodiversity in their operations. Examples of the strong links between biodiversity and innovation will also be presented in the conference, including initiatives in the Amazon, led by Natura Cosmetics, and in Southern Africa, promoted by Phytotech."
"Sustainable development, a strategic focus for the entire beauty industry","This is the first time that the BeautyFull Club called upon students of a business school to carry out such a survey. The idea of such a survey was announced the club’s general assembly which was held at MakeUp in Paris in June 2011. A challenge, which was took up just six months later. Champions of product innovation, selective brands from the perfume and cosmetic industry should also communicate on their good practices in terms of sustainable development. A key challenge in a large number of countries where consumers are extremely sensitive the preservation of ecosystems. The study commissioned by the BeautyFull Club stresses on the need for exemplarity at all levels of the value-added chain. Starting with the ingredients which are essential to the formulas. Packaging manufacturers also have an important responsibility. With of course the key role played by the brands’ industrial process and the supply chain to the point of sale where consumers want to find a clear and reliable information on the practices of brands in terms of sustainable development. Because that is the heart of the matter: consumers need benchmarks to identify the selective brands who are virtuous in terms of sustainable development. It is up to the industry players to organize themselves to collect the necessary data for a transparent information from one end of the chain, to the other and maintain consumer confidence. Thus, the BeautyFull Club projects to establish a summary chart of key commitments in terms of sustainable development for the high end beauty sector, and to promote good practices in the selective perfume and cosmetic industry. The BeautyFull Club will also shortly begin the creation of a working group gathering representatives from the selective perfume and cosmetic industry to define the specific challenges of the industry and of sustainable development. The aim also being to reflect on the communication tools to use with consumers to provide them with clear and reliable information in the point of sale. Among other ideas that were presented on January 19, 2012, during the meeting of the BeautyFull Club: interactive applications for consumers and regular publications to support the perception of progress achieved in terms of sustainable development. For your immediate participation to the forum on Sustainable Development hosted by the club’s new site, please click on the following link: www.beautyfullclub.com Through these series of studies carried out by students from high schools - the next presentation will be conducted by four students from the Centrale Paris engineering school, Department of Industrial Engineering - the BeautyFull Club is true to its mission of contributing to the emergence of innovative ideas for the Beauty industry."
"""Environmental concerns are transforming hotel cosmetics,"" Marie-Cécile Pineau, GM Group","Premium Beauty News - You launched at the end of 2011 the Cosmébio-Ecocert certified Damana Organic Bath Line. What is the demand like from hotels on this type of product? Marie-Cécile Pineau -  We all know that the trend for natural and organic products remains strong among consumers of cosmetics. This is a global and durable underlying consumer trend. With this new range, which complements the N-KI Organic Bath Line launched in 2009, we offer a new solution to help hotel managers meet this customer demand. These certified lines offer them real guarantees concerning the ingredients and manufacturing processes involved. Premium Beauty News - Your group is specialized in guest amenities for hotels. You are one of the market leaders, but you are little known? Marie-Cécile Pineau - The GM Group is a family business founded in 1988 by Georges Marchand, which is now managed by his children. With a network of 24 exclusive distributors, the GM Group is present in hotels the world over, in 60 countries on five continents. It is true that we prefer promoting our distributors, however I can assure you that decision makers in large international groups know us well. From its inception, the group reinvented the concept of guest amenities in the hospitality industry by signing licensing agreements with major cosmetic brands like L’Oréal, Ô de Lancôme, Nina Ricci, Yves Rocher. Today we manage a portfolio of thirty brands that we are always striving to develop. We also have a service for creating made to measure exclusive lines. But we have no intent of putting ourselves forward. Our products must bring added value to our hotel partners and the brands we are working with, although from a legal point of view, we are the ones responsible for placing on the market. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, how do you manage the regulatory constraints of this market very international by nature? Marie-Cécile Pineau - Given our position as a global player, it is a requirement that our products comply with all regulations. As a result, we sometimes have to put up to ten different languages on our product packagings, which are by definition, very small in size. To this must added compulsory indications such as the list of ingredients, the name of the person in charge of placing on the market and the period after opening (PAO). But this is very well managed by a highly specialized and professional cosmetic team who stays aware of any regulatory changes and ensures that ingredients used are in full compliance with the regulations of the markets on which we operate. This enables us to guarantee the safety and compliance of our products to hotel owners, they are aware of that and trust us. We have been operating on this marketplace for over 30 years and the fact we work with big names in cosmetics has enabled us to acquire a highly specialized expertise in this area. The placing on the market of hotel cosmetics meets the same regulatory requirements as the marketing of any other cosmetic products, we are faced with the same constraints. The evolution of the European legislation, with the entry into force of the Cosmetic Regulations also represents for us a real challenge, that will result in additional costs. But despite the difficulties they may cause, regulatory constraints are quite manageable for well organized companies. Especially since these new constraints will also result in substantial advantages for consumers. And I also believe that they will help remove from the market some non-compliant products that are still sometimes found in some hotels. Premium Beauty News - What are the other particularities of the market of guest supplies? Marie-Cécile Pineau - It is a very diversified market where the price pressure is considerable. Diversified because we must meet the needs of all size customers. In practice, this goes from the small 10 room hotel to mammoth hotel structures of more than 5,000 rooms in Las Vegas. Not to mention hotel chains agreements, which imply that we must be able to deliver in all countries where the hotel groups are present. The type of demands also varies a lot. A line of guest amenities usually includes individual body and shampoo doses, ranging from 20 to 40 ml, soap, and additional products such as bath salts, hand creams, sewing and manicure kits, etc. Without forgetting the stand for the products. We have a global offer, that also takes account of the specific local conditions in the different countries and cultures, as sizes and usages may vary widely from country to country. The Nordic countries for example, have a strong preference for rechargeable dispensers rather than individual products. In the U.S. products will be larger in size than in Europe. Also in the U.S., shampoos and conditioners must be presented in separate containers. In Europe, on the contrary, people appreciate the convenience of a 2-in-1 hair and body product. Not to mention preferences in terms of scents, that can vary considerably from one area to another. As hoteliers offer these products to their customers, they are often tempted to limit costs on this line item. We must be able to meet all requests staying in a price range below 30 cents per product! But image is an important factor, don’t forget that guest amenities are among the first things a customer will notice when he enters his room: product design, presentation and brand name also have a lot of importance for the room enhancement and the perception a customer will have of it. For a cosmetic brand, it is an extraordinary showcase to help reach a targeted customer category. To meet demand from the hotel industry, we have two factories in Europe, one in France and one in Portugal. We also rely on a network of subcontractors around the world including in China to serve the Asian and North American markets. Premium Beauty News - In such a context, how does your offer for natural and organic products find its place? Marie-Cécile Pineau - Quit naturally! This is another constraint of the equation, hotel managers are aware of the difficulty of the exercise and of its impact on prices but they have a strong customer demand for these products. It is a challenge for us and for them. Volumes are still low, mainly because of price constraints. But the trend for natural and environmentally products is strong. Increasingly, in the specifications of their invitations to tender, our customers add sustainable development criteria. A concern for the environment is becoming the norm. Although they are not the only solution nor a panacea environmentally speaking, it is obviously within such a context that natural and organic products find their place. Always with these environmental concerns in mind, the GM Group offers Ecosource, an exclusive solution - with an European Ecolabel certification - consisting in a refillable dispenser that can contain thanks to its airless pouch, preservative-free sensitive formulas. Over 70,000 dispensers of this type have been installed in hotels of our customers around the world. In the coming years, sustainable development will certainly be in our area, the source of many technological innovations but also of changes in consumption patterns."
Industry invited to join the fight against biodiversity loss,"The trend towards an increased use of natural ingredients for the formulation of cosmetic products is raising many questions regarding the sustainability of sourcing practices.  The shift from oil-based plastics to plant-derived polymers for the manufacture of packaging is raising similar concerns, since the extension of dedicated sugarcane or corn crops may be detrimental to sensitive natural areas. According to the Union for Ethical BioTRade (UEBT), a Geneva-headquartered non-profit association that promotes the “sourcing with respect” of ingredients coming from the world’s biodiversity, cosmetics companies source extensively from the natural world, relying on biodiversity to create innovative ingredients for their products. Through the Memorandum of Understanding signed on August 18 with the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the UEBT intend to participate in the fight to halt biodiversity loss by increasing public awareness and promoting the engagement of the business community in biodiversity protection. The CBD Secretariat and the UEBT will work together to communicate on the value of biodiversity, in particular by communicating the results of UEBT’s Biodiversity Barometer, which provides an annual overview of biodiversity awareness in the world. According to the UEBT, biodiversity awareness has risen worldwide among consumers and business. When asked if they had heard about biodiversity, an average of 65% of the people interviewed in the USA, France, Germany and the UK said yes in February 2011, up from 56% in February 2009. In the same period, 27% of the world’s top 100 beauty companies mentioned biodiversity in their reporting, up from 13% in 2009. Engaging the private sector in biodiversity protection is the other important element in the collaboration between the CBD Secretariat and UEBT, said both organisations. “The business community can help advance the CBD objectives, which are biodiversity conservation, its sustainable use and the equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources. Implementing ethical sourcing practices is one way that companies can contribute to these objectives,” added Rik Kutsch Lojenga, UEBT’s Executive Director. In this regard, the UEBT’s barometer shows that only 40% of the consumers are confident that cosmetics companies source biodiversity in an ethical manner (i.e. in an environmentally and socially responsible way) and 80% of those interviewed would have more faith in a company that is being verified externally."
Carbon footprint: Swedish cardboard maker Iggesund prides itself on exemplarity,"Premium Beauty News - From cradle to grave! An image that you are claiming? Guy Mallinson - Yes, absolutely! The Holmen group which includes Iggesund is one of the few groups in the world in the paper industry to have its own forests. They are superior in size to the entire forest of the Landes Region in France. Forests consisting of more than 70% of pine trees and birch trees and ranging in age from 0 to 90 years depending of planting times and exploitation times. The Holmen Group is not only one of the largest Swedish forest owners but produces more than 30 million seedlings annually from managed forests which are, of course, FSC and PEFC certified. And when I say ""managed"", I should add ""carefully managed"" with a yield that hasn’t stopped increasing in sixty years from 50 m3 to 115 m3 per hectare. Premium Beauty News - Reducing the carbon footprint has become a major issue both vital and global. A recent survey has shown that there was virtually no articles on this subject in the world press in 2005 and that more than 35,000 of them were identified last year! Guy Mallinson - And in the paper industry, I think we are now clearly among the best placed to talk about it. I would like to recall the definition of this concept of carbon footprint: ""It is the measurement of the impact of human activities on the increase of the production of greenhouse gases, that is to say of carbon dioxide, these emissions being primarily due to the use of fossil fuels."" At Iggesund, I can tell you that this awareness did not start just yesterday, but that on the contrary, it is almost part of the company’s genes and that we have long since integrated and constantly adjusted the main constraints of our business which are namely the production of greenhouse gases, originating mainly from our industrial tool implemented to process wood and its bi-products, because of the use of fuels and of other raw materials, not to mention the impact represented by the production of steam, of heat or cold, as well as transportation. Premium Beauty News - Can you give us a figure that illustrates the progress your made in this area? Guy Mallinson - Yes of course! If I take, for example, as a reference, Invercote, our range of cardboard, its carbon footprint measured five years ago was of 485 kg/t. This year, we are at 258 kg/t, i.e. half what it was in 2006. The major gains were achieved upstream at the level of our forests exploitation and, downstream, at the end of life level of our products. Premium Beauty News - In this area, is this pro-active and consistent policy going to gain momentum? Guy Mallinson - To further reduce our CO2 emissions, we are currently investing 240 million and 120 million euros respectively in our plants in Sweden and in the UK, which is the equivalent of two thirds of our turnover. I recall that our industrial flexibility is always the same on these topics: Produce without using fossil fuels, be self-sufficient in terms of energy production, zero discharge of waste in the environment, use products that can be recycled or re-used for bio-energy, only discharge water that won’t affect in any possible way the fragile ecosystems of the Baltic. Premium Beauty News - Efforts that also involve a continuous improvement of your industrial tool in terms of productivity! Guy Mallinson - That’s right! The productivity of our factories is steadily increasing and we are reducing as much as possible the impact of our activities on the environment."
Shiseido wants to become greener,"Shiseido considers the reduction of its CO2 emissions worldwide as part of its “basic environmental activities”.  Concerning its production sites in Japan, the cosmetics maker claims to have reached its initial goal for 2010, that is to say a 15% reduction compared to 1990.  In the USA, thanks to the use of solar panels at its production unit, the company’s original target to reduce emissions by 10% versus the 2007 level has been dramatically surpassed as the reduction reached more than 20%. [1] Starting from the current fiscal year, new targets have been established for both production and non-production sites in Japan and abroad. In addition to the reduction of CO2 emissions, Shiseido wants to improve the sustainability of its products throughout their entire life cycle, from research and development and the supply of raw materials to their use and final disposal by consumers. To that end, the company will promote the use of plant-based containers and bagasse paper [2], and will encourage recycling activities. Thus, efforts to develop and expand the use of eco-friendly containers within the group will start with the shift to sugarcane-based polyethylene containers for shampoo, body care and other products. In 2008, Shiseido concluded a joint development agreement with Braskem S.A., a Brazilian chemical manufacturer, and Japan’s Toyota Tsusho Corporation, with the aim to secure its supply in sugarcane-based polyethylene cosmetic containers. In order to inform consumers about the company’s commitment, products using plant-based plastic containers will be labelled with the “Shiseido Earth Care Project” logo.  Similarly, products whose containers comprise more than 20% (ratio by weight) of plant-based plastics will be labelled with the Shiseido’s “Plant-Based Plastic Container” mark. The switch to bagasse paper is planned to start in 2012, on the Japanese market for new cosmetic product developments and product renewal requiring paper. Eventually, the use of refills should concern all the company’s foundations [3], face powders and jumbo size shampoos and conditioners, as well as more than 70% of skincare products by 2020."
Green Academy: the future of hairdressing salons by L’Oréal,"According to L’Oréal, the future of hairdressing salons will be a mix of technology and ecology.  In order to illustrate this conviction, the world leader in the cosmetics market, just opened its first Green Academy in Madrid. The main purpose highlighted by the group is to improve awareness and to increase familiarity with: “with environmental values and sustainability among professionals in this sector.”  The project stems from the Professional Products Division of the company marketing the L’Oréal Professionnel, Kérastase, Kéraskin, Redken, Matrix and Pureology brands for hairdressers. This eco-sustainable Academy is located at the company’s headquarters in Madrid.  The location will devoted to the training of Spanish professionals about the use of L’Oréal products.  According to the cosmetics giant, which claims a 30% share of the market in the country, more than a half of the 35,000 Spanish hairdressing salons, distribute and use its products In addition to this training purpose, the L’Oréal’s Green Academy is also seeking to instil future generations of professionals in this sector with respect for the environment – according to L’Oréal estimates, more than 8,000 hairdressers will be trained here each year. L’Oréal’s Green Academy pays special importance to recycling products. It features the so-called recycling wall, a glass panel on which to deposit all containers used in the centre’s day-to-day activities: plastic, paper, card, aerosols, glass and aluminium. The harnessing and re-use of water take on a leading role in this project, through a display of recycled water exhibited in a public area for contemplation as well as the raising of awareness about the use of water. In order to decrease water consumption, the flow rate of the hair-washing nozzles has been reduced notably. Concerning energy consumption, 80% of which is due to the site heating and to hair drying, L’Oréal’s Professional Products Division is working with the industry to offer hairdressers solutions with a lower energy impact. Specifically, L’Oréal is studying with a manufacturer the design of a hairdryer that will last 5 times as long, and with more power but the same consumption as a conventional dryer and able to finish the work more quickly, with the subsequent savings in energy. Similarly, the academy’s air temperature is controlled through the application of “solar cooling”, a technology allowing the integration of heating, cooling and hot water into a single system. A very specific attention was also paid to the materials used for fitting the facility: FSC certified wood, 100%-recyclable steel, recycled aluminium, panels made from 65% fir fibres and 35% mineral agglomerates, as well as photocatalytic ceramics and paint that are anti-pollutant, self-cleaning and antibacterial. Furthermore, environmentally-friendly materials have been used in all joinery work. The furniture and part of the flooring have been made from ecomat, a material obtained from recycled plastic combined with olive pits. The panels used in the walls are made from gypsum and cellulose fibre obtained from recycled paper. The opening of the Green Academy is part of L’Oréal’s sustainability strategy that features three fundamental long-term targets for the group’s factories and distribution centres between 2005 and 2015: a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, in water for each finished product and in waste generated by each finished product. Some of the company’s prime examples in the field of sustainability and respect for the environment can be found in its Burgos factory, which has set itself the goal of being CO2 emissions-neutral by 2015, and it is also encouraging the inhouse generation of energy: the factory at Libramont (Belgium) inaugurated its new biogas centre last year to ensure the plant uses 100% green energy and is carbon- neutral."
Luxury paper bags and the environment: responses from PAK 2000,"200 million bags, 65 million euros in turnover, PAK 2000 remains one of the world’s leading designer - manufacturer of high end paper bags and cardboard set boxes for famous luxury houses, and more specifically leading perfume and cosmetic brands. ""Clearly the environmental trend has become more and more present on the market in recent months. We can estimate that currently 20% to 30% of the market is concerned and this trend can only but accelerate. A movement that finds its origin mainly in France, Italy and Germany,"" Éric Blanche explained. ""And the solutions that we are providing today are fully in line with our clients expectations."" Main decision taken by the managers from the company, to offer a range of bags made from paper the traceability of which being a proof environmental respect (FSC and PEFC certified papers and factories) and with suppliers and converter also being certified. ""Which is the case with the ten partner factories with whom we are working!"" said Éric Blanche. A development that does not just concern bags but also accessories such as cords which are more and more made with natural cotton. Not to mention printing inks which are made from vegetable materials and glues which are water based. Finally, an evolution, which does not, on the contrary, keep the company from progressing each day a little more technically. These last months have been particularly rich on this point with the development of very special techniques allowing a deep embossing or with the use of paper combining a soft touch with very sophisticated hot stamping.

Plant-based plastic bottles for Pantene shampoos,"Procter & Gamble (P&G) has made another step forward onits way to sustainability.  It is no longer about evaluating its suppliers’ performance, but to operate a dramatic transformation to one of its best-selling products. Indeed, the giant US maker of consumer goods just announced it has started producing new bottles made primarily from plant-based plastic for shampoos and conditioners of the Pantene Pro-V Nature Fusion line. The new bottles will be initially launching in Western Europe with expansion plans to the rest of the world over the next two years. This innovative material is made from sugarcane, a natural and renewable resource, as opposed to traditional plastic which is made from petroleum.  According to P&G, sugarcane-derived plastic has significant environmental benefits: compared to traditional petroleum-based plastic it allows reducing fossil fuels consumption by more than 70% and releases over 170% less greenhouse gases. P&G’s goal is to replace 25% of petroleum-based materials with sustainably sourced renewable materials by 2020. The group’s long-term vision is to use 100% renewable or recycled materials on all of its products. The new Pantene Pro-V Nature Fusion sugarcane-based packaging will become available across several Western European markets over the summer and autumn. According tout P&G it should be a seamless transition for consumers as the formulas will remain unchanged and the new bottle has virtually identical characteristics to its predecessor and it is as recyclable as before. ""The use of sugarcane-based plastic in our Nature Fusion packaging allows us to offer the same performance consumers expect from Pantene but in a more sustainable way,"" says Hanneke Faber, P&G’s Vice President & Brand Franchise Leader for Global Pantene."
"Agricultural sourcing in the beauty industry: beware of boomerang effects, says Organic Monitor","Environmental benefits are often cited as a reason for switching to plant-based raw materials.  Indeed, apart from being renewable, these substances often have a lower environmental footprint than petroleum-based counterparts.  “However, the diverting of agricultural land from food crops to make cosmetic ingredients raises many ethical and ecological questions,” says Organic Monitor. According to the market research firm, there is a risk that the increasing use of plant crops in the cosmetics industry sparks a similar debate than for agrofuel crops, with cosmetics makers being blamed for jeopardizing human food resources.  “Food security is becoming a major global concern because of rising food prices and scarcity of agricultural land. The global population is expected to rise by 50% to over 9 billion in 2050, however agricultural land is projected to decrease over this period,” explain researchers at Organic Monitor. Such a concern is nothing new.  It was raised a few years ago when the prices raw materials, energy and feedstock started to rise.  According to Michel Griffon, agronomist and economist, it is unlikely that in the near future agriculture be able to produce enough biofuels, and plant-derived chemicals, and to feed all of humanity and preserve biodiversity at the same time.  In any case, he wrote in Feeding the planet [1], none of these goals will be accessible without a breakthrough ecological transformation of farming technics, a “doubly green revolution”. Actually, the beauty industry needs to ensure that the agro-ingredients used for making or packaging its products are sustainable sourced. Organic Monitor sees some early indicators that sustainable sourcing tends to become mandatory in the beauty industry, rather than a preferred option.  In Europe, L’Oreal and Unilever, for instance, have already made commitments to sustainable sourcing.  In the US, Wal-Mart is putting pressure on its suppliers to adopt sustainability practices. In addition, the media and NGOs are also putting pressure on companies worldwide. In the near future, more ingredients could go the way as palm oil, for which leading beauty firms have pledged to only source from Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)-approved companies. “Similar sustainable roundtables exist for soya and cocoa, and others are in the pipeline. A number of other sustainability schemes, labels and standards are emerging,” says Organic Monitor. Natural and organic cosmetic standards already include some sustainability requirements, but brands may want to extend the scope of their claims through additional certifications.  Fair trade is an example, in particular in the UK with Boots, Bulldog and Bubble & Balm.  Other companies, such as the Brazilian ingredients supplier Beraca have integrated biodiversity into their sourcing programmes. Climate change is yet another issue diverting attention to sustainable sourcing practices, which are likely to become a key factor of success for cosmetics and personal care brands in the very next future."
P&G to launch next step of its suppliers sustainability assessment program,"Created in cooperation with 20 leading supplier representatives globally, and deployed about a year ago to nearly 400 strategic suppliers, P&G’s Suppliers Scorecard was designed to track and encourage improvement on key environmental sustainability measures in the company’s supply chain. The first year was focused on assessing whether the company would receive clear data on the environmental footprint from its suppliers, including energy use, water use, waste disposal, and greenhouse gas emissions.  Other goals were to evaluate the possibility to measure future improvements, and to share ideas to jump-start innovation related to sustainability. According to Procter & Gamble this initial phase was a success since most suppliers demonstrated their ability to track the requested key sustainability measures and that the process of innovation sharing had begun.  Indeed, one great satisfaction for P&G is that the scorecard encourages its partners to share innovation ideas to improve the sustainability footprint of the business.  According to the company, about 40% of the scorecards received during the year offered at least one innovation idea with some of these having moved forward to become actual projects. ""It was the scorecard that jumpstarted those projects,"" said Larry Loftus, Director of purchases capability and strategy. ""I believe that many of the opportunities we identified through this process will result not only in environmental sustainability improvements but also in improvements to our bottom line as well as growth for our business partners."" Indeed, collecting data was not the only purpose of this initiative, which was led by P&G’s purchases department.  ""The scorecard is the right tool to give us that snapshot across our supply chain so we can identify where to focus our collective supply network sustainability efforts, develop ideas to work on together, and reward those who excel,"" said Rick Hughes, P&G’s Chief purchasing officer. Beginning this year, the results of the scorecard will affect supplier performance ratings, and will therefore impact a supplier’s opportunity for future business. Suppliers will be evaluated and given a score from 1-5.  Those showing exceptional sustainability performance will be publicly rewarded, while those that do not score well will have to implement sustainability improvement plans based on the scorecard results before being reassessed to measure progress over time. For 2011, P&G will expand the list of suppliers participating in the program to about 600.  Furthermore, the company has made a few changes based on partner input. These modifications include in particular a clearer process to allow partners to exclude measures that don’t apply; a more transparent and consistent rating methodology. The updated scorecard is available at www.pgsupplier.com"
"Laboratoires Jérodia, riding on the green breaker","Nothing seems to stop Thierry Logre! The Laboratoires Jérodia (comprising the brands Phyt’s, Laboratoires Dérmatologiques Gamarde and BioNatural) never stop innovating, to the point that their CEO is almost considered a pioneer and a visionary, a kind of Steve Jobs in natural and organic cosmetics. When he took over the reins of Jérodia in April 2004, this former manager from the Laboratoires Pierre Fabre intends to pursue but also develop the spirit of a company - founded in 1972 - based on the principles of Biocosmetics, textures and original formulations and 100% Natural. And that strategy paid off since Phyt’s is currently the leading brand in beauty parlours in France and, building on its capabilities in R&D, Jérodia successfully launched in 2009 Phyt’s Organic Make Up, the first bio cosmetic brand certified Cosmébio on  all its references. To date, Phyt’s is still considered a pioneer in the segment of organic make-up, with an almost complete range since only nail polishes are not available. ""We just had to overcome a few difficulties with bright reds for the lips"", explains Logre, modestly. And it was an immediate success, the line being acclaimed for its quality. ""More and more professional make-up artists are looking for this type of product."" As a result: this start-up makes-up Marion Cotillard for her role in Les Petits Mouchoirs, Guillaume Canet’s film which was released late 2010. A success which is probably due to a concern for quality and know-how developed for over 37 years. At Jérodia there is no compromising on principles. The Laboratoires Phyt’s never use any preservatives, not even the ones authorized by Cosmébio. ""They never used the exemption authorizing the use of ingredients containing low doses of preservatives"", explains Nathalie Mathan, in charge of the group’s communications. Skincare products from Phyt’s are made from 100% natural ingredients with no synthetic substance. This originality, which makes of Phyt’s a exception in the world of cosmetics as much as one within Cosmébio is only possible thanks to a remarkable know-how in terms of stability and protection of formulas and the systematic use of packaging featuring a barrier effect. Of course, environmental requirements extend beyond formulas, to also encompass packaging. Cosmébio specifications prohibits the use of packaging that would not be biodegradable or recyclable. A plastic such as SAN, which widely used in make-up and which is not 100% recyclable is automatically excluded. ""It’s almost as complicated to manage as the formula itself"", emphasises Logre. Another characteristic: Phyt’s is a local and independent producer. With 200 employees in France and over 20 million euros in turnover, the group develops in its research centre and formulates in its own laboratories, the entire range of Phyt’s cosmetic products. When Jérodia started in make-up, it installed its own production lines, including the purchase of loose and compact powder blenders. ""Everything we sell, is made by us, there is not one single product which doesn’t come from our R&D centre."" It is a way of being sure to stay in line with the quality and environmental specifications of the company. ""Our manufacturing process is very stringent. For example, we never use chlorine to wash our machines. We also have a settling and filtration tank, thus we are sure that the water discharged into the environment is clean"". This production capacity, Thierry Logre, obviously wanted to make it profitable by making it available for the many brands seeking to enter the market of natural and organic cosmetics in both skincare and make-up. Thus the Jérodia group created the Bio lines of Marionnaud and of Biguine, and that of the American brand L’Uvalla and also has clients in South Korea and Japan. Furthermore globalisation is today, the main objective of the group wishing to quickly achieve in Asia the same turnover it does in France."
Did you say Eco-design?,"Premium Beauty News - What does your offer consist of today? Jean-Baptiste Puyou - We help our customers innovate by integrating sustainable development in their product and service offer with:
– Know-how: eco-design, eco-design and creativity, training, monitoring of R&D projects...
– Methodologies: LCA, carbon footprint, products environmental labelling...
– LCA and eco-design-dedicated softwares such as SimaPro, e-DEA and WINTED. Premium Beauty News - Communication is an essential parameter! Jean-Baptiste Puyou - First of all and it is an obvious fact, credible and responsible communication can only truly concern products carrying with them values and environmental performance. We can then work on the formatting: eco-design the communication media, check the claims and the visuals using a systematic method like ""Preuv’"" that we have developed. The environmental issue reminds us of the basic rules: the coherence between substance and form secures the communication, and it requires teamwork. Design, Purchasing, Marketing, Sales force, etc., must integrate and anticipate market expectations and let customers be aware of the approaches and achievements. Premium Beauty News - Can you give us some examples of this approach in the perfumery and cosmetic segment? Jean-Baptiste Puyou - Yes, I can give you several. Thus, we have helped L’Occitane conduct the Life Cycle Analysis of washing bases. This study has helped put forward eco-design recommendations and the creation of a dedicated position. This approach was supported by Ademe [1]. Another example, Kenzo. Now, the perfume Flower by Kenzo is re-fillable: once emptied it can be refilled at a fountain in an outlet or withthe purchase of a refill. This approach was subject to a communication that we tested before its launch with our ""Preuv’"" methodology... Finally there is Albéa, who is using e-DEA, our eco-design tool and with whom we have specific developments underway."
Gerresheimer: a recycled but beautiful glass for Garnier,"Garnier, L’Oreal’s cosmetics and toiletries mass-market brand, has just moved on to the next stage in its search to minimize the environmental impact of its packaging. Garnier is now using a 40% recycled glass in the glass pots of its face care products produced by German glassmaker Gerresheimer: a first for a brand in the mass market channe. For obtaining a material that is as beautiful and transparent as virgin glass, Gerresheimer has developed a specific technical process. The glass comes from a controlled source. After having been collected, sorted, cleaned and ground up according to “a leading-edge process,” a high-class cullet is obtained. This cullet is then re-introduced into the glass manufacturing cycle in order to make new glass. The process helps reduce the environmental impact of the glass packaging used by Garnier, through energy savings, the reduction of CO2 emissions, and the preservation of natural resources. Indeed, according to Gerresheimer, the energy needed to melt the recycled glass (cullet) is less than that used to melt virgin glass. So, incorporating 40% recycled glass in the Garnier face care pots means a 9% reduction in the amount of energy used during manufacturing. The decrease in the energy consumed by the furnace then reduces CO2 emissions and thus also the impact on global warming.  Gerresheimer estimates CO2 saving during the manufacturing process reaches 29 tons (the estimation for the full year is 58 tons). Eventually, using recycled glass reduces the need to use non-renewable natural resources that are used to make glass (in particular silica, soda, lime). In parallel, Garnier informs consumers on the importance of selective collection and will stick environmental messages on its skin care packaging in order to draw their attention on the advantages of recycled glass."
Eco-design: Chanel proposes a new software to the entire industry,"Premium Beauty News - What is the starting point of your approach? Michel Dupuis - In 2007, the group’s Quality Management decided to undertake a carbon footprint of its activities. The main conclusion after a few months was: ""our products packaging represent half of our emissions."" They are followed by such items as logistics/shipping/freight and just after by the transport of people. We obviously gave thought to what we could do to reduce our environmental impact. It was first necessary to refine the existing database on carbon emissions related to the materials and processes used in the trade, which led us to contact all our suppliers in order to obtain additional technical information. But There is more to this. We wanted to go further and integrate other environmental indicators such as the depletion of non renewable resources, air acidification, depletion of the ozone layer, water eutrophication [1] and photochemical oxidation [2]. Premium Beauty News - Work that could only lead to the finding of an appropriate tool! Michel Dupuis - Yes, of course! And it’s the approach proposed by the Evea company that seemed the most relevant to help us design a common tool, leading to ""Winted"". All this takes place in 2009! Winted offers both a technical approach on design and an overall view of results obtained through innovations and packaging enhancements. It helps better understand the origin of environmental impacts and presents areas of improvements and check-lists to go further.This software is intended for all corporate stakeholders involved in developing new packaging with several possible levels of use. It allows to address eco-design issues throughout the whole development process. Premium Beauty News - An approach that goes beyond Chanel’s framework! Michel Dupuis - Yes, and this obviously surprised a few, when we decided to make this software freely available for the whole industry, packaging manufacturers but also our colleagues in the trade. We had questioned ourselves: ""Do we need to keep all this for ourselves?"" Very quickly, the answer was no! It appeared normal to us to make this tool available for everyone, knowing that it was an immediate and practical contribution that our group could bring to this great global cause which is the preservation of our environment. Moreover, we must be irreproachable vis-à-vis our customers on the quality of our products and their origin. When they purchase a Chanel product, they have totally integrated the fact that we are doing everything in our power to offer them high quality products. It therefore seemed normal to pioneer such a global approach and thus help things move forward!"
L’Occitane: eco-design as a global process,"L’Occitane is currently preparing the implementation of a system to help measure and reduce the environmental impact of its products, and participates inthe French experimentation of the environmental information for consumer goods.  Explanations from Philippe de Brugière, CSR Director, Packaging Forecasting and International Production Development. Premium Beauty News - Environment is not strictly speaking a novelty for L’Occitane! Philippe de Brugière - Of course not! It’s part of its ""genetic heritage"". Because, right from the outset when the company was created in 1976, at the instigation of its founder, Olivier Baussan, who was very concerned about the future of the planet, he decided to use only recyclable materials. In 2007, a new impetus was given to this approach with the will to organise a real eco-design approach, led by the Packaging Development but not limited to this question as it deals also with ingredients and formulas. And concerning printed packaging, we favour plain eco-designed packs, sourced from FSC paper (Forest Stewardship Council). We prefer using water-based inks and chose suppliers responding to the ""Imprim’ Vert"" label. We have decided to use as little as possible such finishing techniques as vacuum metallization or hot stamping and to design separable packaging (pumps and screw caps) to make our products end of life sorting easier. All this resulted in a ""Guideline manual on eco-design"" which very methodically presents different materials and components. Actually, there are three decision levels: a first level of concrete and systematically implementable decisions, a second level of approved decisions but which are not applicable to all processes and all materials (e.g., water-soluble lacquering), and finally a third-level concerning options which have not yet been industrially validated and the process of which has not been fully quantified, but that we are nonetheless committed to develop. Logically, this led internally to the creation and implementation of a qualitative eco-design grid for each product with about fourteen criteria representing all the questions that must be considered for a packaging product in the prospect of a new eco-designed development. We have also launched, a process to measure the environmental impact of all our current products using the Life Cycle Analysis method (LCA), which is entirely supervised by an engineer specialized in this field and who took office in 2009. This will be in fact the method on which we will build the product’s environmental information intended for consumers, a multi criteria information but not only focusing on C02 emissions. Eco-design must also be considered as a continuous improvement principle. Premium Beauty News - Concretely, what did it lead to? Philippe de Brugière - This year again we have undertaken actions for improving our sustainable development process through the development of eco-refills, reusable bottles, recycled bottles, by changing snapped-on caps with screwable caps to simplify the sorting. Our approach to measure the environmental impact gives us the opportunity to question ourselves on all the relevant questions concerning eco-design (recyclability, choice of the raw material, environmental impact...) during project launches: by reducing the weight of our sample sachets, by integrating the code of ethics to specifications for suppliers which was signed by 100% of our sub-contractors and more than 96% of our suppliers, by providing consumers with the appropriate information on how to sort out our packaging. We have decided to use new materials such as recycled PET (100% recycled plastic) for some of our upcoming launches. In the new Verdon range launched in 2010, plastic and glass bottles are 100% post-consumer recycled, that is to say they come from the recycling of consumer products for the further effective realisation of the ""cradle to cradle"" concept. We have developed more eco-refills. And we seek to provide the guarantee of an ethically irreproachable sourcing in Asia (on some of our components or accessories, for example). Premium Beauty News - You are also using a LCA software for checking the packaging! Philippe de Brugière - That’s right. And believe me, it is a path strewn with surprises. Let me give you an example: to make 1 kg of glass, 0.84 kg of CO2 are released. To make 1 kg of PET, 2 kg of CO² are released.   On the face of it, glass is the winner. Well, in the case of a 250 ml glass bottle compared to an identical PET bottle, it’s the other way around. PET is the winner! Because a 250 ml glass bottle weighs approximately 200 gr. And the same bottle in PET, only 30 gr.   Do the math on it and you will see that glass is almost 3 times more impacting in C02. But be careful and don’t forget that glass is infinitely recyclable, while PET is not... Premium Beauty News - What goals have you set yourselves with? Philippe de Brugière - They are ambitious! Zero landfill waste, the least possible consumption in energy, water, non-renewable materials and maximization of the sorting and recycling.  We also want to facilitate the reuse of packaging by consumers. Our approach integrates the end consumer. We must help him improve his sorting so that he throws as little as possible. It is useless to buy so called ""virtuous"" materials and to not feel concerned afterwards about how the final consumer will deal with the product we sold him. Premium Beauty News - Your in-house training program on eco-design was a big success! Philippe de Brugière - If we actually had no doubts about that, it’s true that it exceeded our expectations! All the people were volunteers. Following the training, we had to face internally, an explosion in requests to conduct impact measurements. Because today, in the development and validation process of new products, the appraisal intends to be irreproachable and honest. And sometimes it may occur that a whole range of products be rejected by the General Management if they do not successfully pass environmental criteria."
France to test environmental information as of July,"Nearly 170 companies, were selected among 230 volunteers, to participate to the experimentation phase on the environmental information on consumer products, starting in France as of 1 July 2011. Companies were selected on the base of the immediately operational nature of their project for a kick off on due time, and in order to set up a varied panel of products originating from all industry sectors and focused on current household consumption. Overall, about 1,000 products are concerned, mainly food and drinks, equipments (electrical, electronics, furniture), stationery and printing products, clothing, hygiene and cosmetic products. In the cosmetic sector, several companies were selected for this test phase, namely the Laboratoire Vendôme (Johnson & Johnson) with its shampoo and shower gel brand Le Petit Marseillais, L’Occitane en Provence, the L’Oréal group (Laboratoires Garnier), Natura Europe SAS, the French subsidiary of the Brazilian group, the Pierre Fabre Dermo Cosmétique group, with its brand Ducray, Sephora (LVMH) and Weleda. Contrary to what was already experimented in other countries in particular the UK, or by some distributors in France, the Ministry of Ecology has adopted a multi-criteria approach, which is not only limited to greenhouse gas emissions but also takes into account other product impacts, such as water pollution. The aim being to prevent pollution transfers. But the experimentation will be conducted in dispersed order. The ways in which the information is made available might therefore change from one product to another, in their form and in their content. For the time being, a number of companies have only made plans to communicate through paperless media such as the Internet and mobile phones, while others have undertaken to display information in stores or directly on their products, on the packaging or in their catalogues. As for the provided information, it will either be given in absolute value for some, in the form a note within a scale of 1 to 10 or even of graphics for others. On the side of the environmental federation, France Nature Environnement its members are more in favour of a single note, synthesizing several criteria, and easily visible on the product or its packaging. As regards calculation methods, again, they vary from one category to another and even from one product to another. The ADEME [1], the AFNOR [2] and industrialists have been working for several years on the elaboration of repositories for each product groups and databases. The majority of companies involved in the experimentation phase are also part of a collective. This is how, producers of detergent (Colgate-Palmolive SAS, Henkel France Mc Bride SAS, Novamex, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser France, Unilever) joined together for the purposes of an operation led by the AFISE (French association of detergents, and maintenance products industry). On the contrary, as regards cosmetics, the FEBEA (French trade association representing manufacturers specialised in beauty products), who conducted the working group in charge of developing a guide for the environmental information concerning shampoos, allowed its members to appear in a dispersed order. Main reason to this: serious differences of opinion among stakeholders, regarding the methodology to apply. Officials at the Ministry of Ecology tend to minimize these difficulties by stating that the objective of this experimentation is precisely to evaluate its technical and economic feasibility, to test various options so to only keep the most interesting ones. The ""consumers degree of visibility"" as well as the ""readability and comprehensibility of the different formats"" should as such represent key factors in the evaluation. In the immediate future, participating companies, most of them not being totally ready, must undertake or complete environmental analysis of the products they selected. The actual circulation of information to consumers will begin on 1 July 2011, when officially begins the experimentation phase, for a minimum period of one year. The evaluation of operations initiated by each company and the overall national experimentation will start in the second half of 2012. After the experimental phase, a report will be forwarded to the Parliament who will decide whether or not to generalize the system and make it compulsory."
POS equipment waste: What are the green answers?,"It is within this context that emerged the project of the Bergonzo company specialized in the organization of points of sale: through the systematic recovery of end of life POS equipment, the sorting of materials and the optimization of waste. More details from Thibault Romemont, Commercial Director of the French firm.  Premium Beauty News - What is the weight of the POS equipment sector in France? Thibault de Romemont - POS equipment in France represented a market of 1,021 billion euros at the end 2008. As they were confronted to crisis, advertisers changed their strategy by choosing to highlight the value of their products directly in points of sale, to be as close as possible to the end consumer, as a result in 2008, expenditures for POS advertising progressed by 1.8%. The health and beauty sector is by far the largest consumer of POS equipment, far ahead of the food and beverage industries. Premium Beauty News - Is the environment really a concern for brands? Thibault de Romemont - Today, the ecological approach becomes every day more and more an integral part of the design specification for components of POS equipments and actively participates to a corporate responsibility process. Advertisers insist on the choice of mono-material to favour and facilitate recycling and also recommend the use of cardboard-made POS equipments because of its biodegradability. The issue is important because POS equipment represents large investments for displays of a very short lifespan (two weeks on average), which generates a lot of waste. Premium Beauty News - What do regulations provide regarding the recovery and treatment of such waste? Thibault de Romemont - In France the Environmental Code regulates the obligations of companies in terms of waste treatment and laid down the responsibility of any person who produces or possesses waste (article L.541-2) in case of damages or nuisance or pollution caused by these wastes or inadequate treatment processes. Premium Beauty News - Sorting out one’s waste has become something natural! Thibault de Romemont - Indeed, when collection facilities are made available for them, nearly 7 in 10 households sort their waste. They also see to reduce their energy and water consumption.  These ""green"" habits are now in fact - increasingly more - part of the French lifestyle. Beyond daily actions, surveys show that French are increasingly concerned by environment issues. Premium Beauty News - What is your project? Thibault de Romemont - Actually, it is nothing more and nothing less than to propose to distributors the management of their whole POS material from the warehouses to the outlets, with the aim to minimize the environmental impact, in particular the global warming potential (GWP) of the activity.  That is to say:
– Managing the receipt of POS equipments in our warehouses (all brands considered).
– Picking and dispatch per outlet.
– Delivery per outlet / and recovery of end of life POS equipment, every 15 days.
– Installation (real-time reporting included) and dismounting /end of campaign report.
– Storage and maintenance for reuse or recycling (environment). Premium Beauty News - It is the whole organization and logistics that need to be reviewed? Thibault de Romemont - Yes indeed, the delivery of the POS equipment in our warehouses needs to be performed between 5 or 2 working days before the date of installation according to a distribution per outlet communicated at the beginning of operation. We have several warehouses located throughout France, to total a storage area of more than 9,000m sqm (Evry, Lille, Nancy, Strasbourg, Lyon, Marseille, Ajaccio, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Tours, Rouen, Rennes). The equipment is checked by sampling and photo taking upon delivery (conformity of equipment, allocated quantities,...). Upon arrival in our warehouses the equipment is identified. A delivery record is sent to the customer. This receipt material procedure is subject to a detailed charter in use in all our agencies to ensure the reliability of the information transmitted. Regarding the supervision of installations, we guarantee the effective implementation of the entire POS equipment, on due date, and in compliance with display requirements. Each installation is subject to an immediate report posted on the extranet with pictures and an alert in the event of problems. The customer distributor or brand contact can follow live the smooth running of the installation. A tour report is issued at the end of each campaign. For each material recovery (cardboard packaging, end of life POS material, ...) the installer will have a specific document validated by the store manager or any other authorized person, indicating the number of m3 collected. A periodic report is sent to the client indicating the average volume of waste picked up per outlet during a given period. Our warehouses follow a charter committing them on the means implemented for waste management: sorting of materials, compacting of cardboard elements, dumping into the bin appropriate for each type of material, collection of the bins by an accredited company for destruction or recycling.  Upon request, the record of destruction is given periodically to the customer distributor or to the brands. Premium Beauty News - What are the benefits for the distributor? Thibault de Romemont - Time saving and simplification of processes (see table here below). To note also among other additional benefits, the ability to enable beauty advisors to refocus on the main purpose of their occupation which is advising and selling, but also the outsourcing of these tasks who are time consuming. There is also a gain on additional sales area with the possibility of using the space previously dedicated to storage. The implementation of this process gives the possibility to go forward on environmental issues and to organize an appropriate management in the installation of POS equipments. Premium Beauty News - What are the benefits for brands? Thibault de Romemont - They obviously benefit from this Implementation of an environmental approach upon the destruction and recycling of their end of life POS equipments. They may also consider in a process of sustainable development, the optimization of POS material reusable after recovery. There is a possibility of considering a depreciation rate on reusable equipment according to the unit cost. And some other benefits can be considered:
– Sharing of costs (logistics).
– Optimization of current installation costs.
– Sales force that focuses on its core business: selling and training.
– The ability to supervise the smooth running of the installation of the POS in strict compliance with implementation dates and requirements for display.
– Anticipating the possible late delivery and non-compliance of equipment."
Carbon balance: what to do next?,"The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the transition to more sustainable modes of production remain important strategic issues. Certainly, the recent crisis has slowed down in this area as in others, the size of investments. But the basic trends of the market appear clearly in green. As for the regulatory framework, all the actors are anticipating a strengthening of the ""environmental constraint"". In France, the Article 75 of the Act of July 10, 2010 [1], requires all companies employing over 500 people to make an assessment of their greenhouse gas emissions before December 31, 2012. The French Agency for Environment and Energy Management (ADEME) has developed a method of accounting emissions, known as Bilan Carbone® (carbon balance), which can be used by companies or consultants. A result, giant companies in consumer goods (Procter & Gamble, Unilever) and in cosmetics (L’Oréal) are communicating on ambitious development programs. ""For a company, it’s also a development opportunity, another growth path,"" emphasized Yvette James, Director of Responsible Development for the Clarins Group. In this context, the carbon balance of Greenhouse Gas Emissions appears merely as a first step. But to review one’s emissions is only the prelude to the implementation of a reduction policy. ""This is often where things go wrong,"" explained Thomas Moreau, Associate Director of the consulting firm Austral, specialized in logistics. Before forty professionals invited on January 20 in Paris by the BeautyFULL Club, he detailed the various pitfalls to avoid, including the managerial control of corrective measures. ""To undertake a carbon balance is not very complicated, as such. But companies often underestimate the scope and magnitude of its impact on their organization and their processes,"" stressed Moreau. A small project with a modest budget, can therefore have important consequences on the company’s business. ""It would be a big mistake for the senior management of the company to ignore the carbon balance. Indeed, once it has been undertaken, it’s only a very small part of the road that has been gone through. Decisions on measures to be adopted to reduce emissions will be the responsibility of the top management,"" he added. An opinion shared by Yvette James: ""To be successful in a company’s sustainable development process, you must know the company perfectly well, including departments and positions that feel less concerned, such as marketing."" The first challenge is to define the scope that will be used to calculate emissions. ""Very often companies are surprised by some emission sources (the use of products or services, consumers trips, ...) and only want to consider the emissions that are directly under their control (energy, travels,…). This is the first remark we hear during the carbon balance. However, it is necessary to retain the broadest scope possible, including all sources on which the company has an influence, albeit limited,"" explained Moreau. But in practice, the selected indicators seem to vary in significant proportions from one company to another, making comparisons difficult. ""In our case, depending on whether or not delivery to outlets is included, not to mention transporting the product to the consumer, results will be very different, and items such as logistics or transport will be more or less important,"" confirmed Philippe Brugière, Vice President in charge of the Packaging Development for L’Occitane. This debate, however, should not conceal the main function of the carbon balance, which is to allow the taking of corrective measures in order to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the company and its partners. It is more than a comparison tool, it is an instrument of internal improvement for the company. ""Within the scope retained by Clarins, the most important emission line item concerns packaging,"" pointed out James. ""This is the point on which we have focused our efforts by committing ourselves resolutely in the path of eco-design."" At this level, the launch last year, of the perfume Womanity by Thierry Mugler is an important milestone in the history of the Clarins Group, which considers it as being ""the first eco-responsible fragrance."" The case is made from recycled and recyclable cardboard, with no box insert nor flying leaflets, to reduce the secondary packaging. The bottle is indefinitely refillable. Another important step, the launch by Kibio, the organic skincare brand from the Clarins Group, of the first application with SGD’s Infinite Glass featuring a glass jar in a 50ml optimized size, resulting in a reduction in packaging volume. And another surprise: distributors, more than consumers, had to be convinced of the relevance of these changes !"
Korsnäs sees a greener future for luxury products,"According to Korsnäs there is no doubt that consumers tend to become increasingly aware of environmental issues and more demanding with brands. “Packaging has become an increasingly important part of the overall brand experience. A factor that determines selection or rejection. In an age of climate consciousness, consumers dislike over-packaging and wastefulness while preferring smart and economical solutions. Brands that have learned this lesson add to their credibility, their brand image - and to their competitiveness,” explains the Swedish supplier of cardboard packaging solutions. In such a context, Korsnäs deems that to be distinctive and strong, a luxury brand has to address current environmental issues in a clear way and to deal with this matter in their communications. The choice of a responsible packaging solution is obviously a good start. As a cardboard maker, Korsnäs is convinced to benefit from a natural competitive advantage.  Based on a report published by the Swedish Environmental Research Institute last year, Korsnäs explains that packaging based on wood fibre is the most environmentally friendly alternative. “It is better than plastic, which is derived from oil. Better than glass, which is heavy and energy intensive from a life-cycle perspective. And better than aluminium, which is expensive to recycle and whose supply is questionable.” Wood fibre comes from a renewable source, has a limited environmental impact and can be recycled up to seven times.  Products made from fibre-based material, such as carton packaging, thus appear as a highly valuable sustainable option. However, Korsnäs does not intend to limit itself to this natural asset.  Actually, the carton maker is working at improving the sustainability of its entire manufacturing process.  Sustainability is considered at all stages – including sourcing, forestry, production, energy utilisation and transport systems. The company’s first goal is to reduce the use of fossil fuels, the main cause of climate warming.  This goes for transport modes as well: Korsnäs’ recent shift from sea to rail transport alone has led to a 20-30% reduction of fossil carbon emissions. Another area of progress includes waste heat projects. For instance, waste heat from the Korsnäs plant in Frövi replaces heating with fossil fuels in the local district heating system, delivering an annual 100 GWh to 4,500 flats, schools, industrial buildings and public buildings.  Similarly, the Korsnäs plant in Gävle supplies waste heat for district heating 20,000 households in that municipality. Another example of good thinking in energy utilisation is the use of dry wood bark in the production process. Moist or wet bark consumes more energy in the bark boiler. Since 2002 the bark used in Korsnäs boilers is dried by the sun’s rays. It is a simple but effective technology that has reduced the boiler’s oil consumption by 90%. Other recent achievements include a 570-million SEK investment in a brand new evaporation plant at Korsnäs mills in Gävle.  This investment will mean a 50% reduction in oil consumption for that part of the production process. As many Nordic carton makers, Korsnäs has a leg up on the others with regard to sustainable development.  There are several explanations to explain this situation: the sensitivity to environmental issues in Scandinavian countries, the characteristics of the paper and cardboard industry itself, which has been stigmatized for a long time because of its pollutant processes and which uses raw material that must be carefully managed to remain renewable. “It takes a tree 70 years to grow to full height, which means that forestry – like any environmental work – is a long-term undertaking.” Consistently, Korsnäs’ forests are certified according to FSC and PEFC standards. The company wants its efforts to positively impact its results, both by reducing production costs and by the positive image of the company and its products.
“Any brand that works with Korsnäs joins this positive environmental loop,” concludes Christer Simrén, CEO."
"Environment: Stora Enso, wants to be at the forefront","Premium Beauty News - Preservation of environment must be an old story for you? Paivi Harju-Eloranta - Yes indeed, we obviously did not wait for all these summits, meetings and congresses centered on this great challenge of the future to make concrete progress, since several years, like most of our colleagues in the field. And the timing couldn’t have been any better, since currently end users of our materials are now specially sensitive to these issues. Just have a look, and you have already relayed the information, the approach claimed by Procter & Gamble which was expressed on your website or the one from L’Oreal who has just launched a website specifically dedicated to this topic. But the answers, we already have them! Premium Beauty News - What answers exactly? Paivi Harju-Eloranta - Firstly, you must know that Stora Enso has the huge advantage of being integrated all along the exploitation and production chain: from the tree in the forest to the delivery of papers and boards in every corner of the world. To comply with new environmental standards, we must give the lead all along this chain and we have set ourselves ambitious targets. Thus we will have reduced our emissions of SO2 (Sulfur dioxide) by 30% between 2007 and 2013 and our CO2 emissions by 20% between 2006 and 2020. All the wood we use to produce paper-board come from forests which are managed under the principles of sustainable development, with 100% traceability. Nearly 70% of our needs come from forests which are PEFC or FSC certified. Premium Beauty News - You have mentioned the reduction of your CO2 emissions. How do you manage reducing your energy consumption? Paivi Harju-Eloranta - Actually, We achieve this through different means who, I believe, deserve to be detailed: – CO2 reduction target. This target covers both emissions generated directly by our own facilities and indirect emissions produced in the generation of the electricity and heat we purchase. It target will be achieved by reducing energy consumption through improved productivity, the use of more efficient equipment and streamlined processes, reduced use of fossil fuels, and improved efficiency in power and heat generation. In 2009 we reduced our CO2 emissions by 18% from our target baseline year 2006. Another significant reason to the CO2 reductions achieved during 2009 was increased purchases of electricity generated from low carbon supply mixes. – Direct and indirect CO2 emissions. We continued to reduce our direct fossil CO2 emissions during 2009. Since 2006 we have reduced our direct CO2 emissions from stationary combustion sources by 12%. Our indirect CO2 emissions are significantly influenced by the energy mix in the countries where we operate. During 2009 our fossil CO2 emissions from energy purchased for electricity and heat decreased to a level 23% below their level in 2006. – Regarding the energy use.  We purchase fuel, electricity and heat from external suppliers, and generate steam and electricity internally for use at our production facilities. We generated 33% of our electricity needs from our own power plants. – Energy self-sufficiency.Stora Enso is increasingly focusing on enhancing our energy self-sufficiency and access to cleaner energy by investing in renewable energy production at mill sites, and through partnerships with external energy suppliers. Through the use of wind turbines for instance or the supply of low carbon electricity production. – High share of biomass in internal energy production. Pulp and paper production creates by-products that we use to produce large amounts of bioenergy. [1]  In 2009 we maintained our use of biomass for internal energy production on a high level, 71% compared to 72% in 2008. – Multifuel solutions. Stora Enso is also increasingly looking into multifuel solutions that can replace purchased energy generated using fossil fuels, in particular through the use of mixtures of different types of fuels in the same boiler, including biomass such as forest residues, bark and recovered wood, as well as various sorted wastes, coal and gas.  In 2010 two new power plants will start to utilise multifuels, in Belgium and in Germany. This will result in CO2 emission reductions of about 105 000 tonnes per year. A new power plant in Poland, scheduled for completion in 2010, will also reduce our carbon footprint by an estimated 100 000 tonnes of CO2 annually."
"Emoi Infini, another step in eco-design innovation","The manufacturers gathered into Mouvement Infini share the same goal: crossing a new frontier in the world of eco-designed cosmetics and perfumes. After the launch of Naya, last year, a fully ecodesigned skincare product, Mouvement Infini will showcase Emoi Infini, during the next Luxe Pack congress, which will be held in Monaco October 20-22, 2010.  This new project takes the form of a box of three fully eco-designed perfumes (Elle, Lui, Moi for the French Her, Him, Me), which by developing manufactured, optimized and integrated solutions, offer an innovative positioning in the luxury market. For the eight partners within Mouvement Infini (who were five only for the launch of Naya), SGD, Strand Cosmetics Europe, Mane, Extreme Paris, VPI, Wauters, M-Real and Rexam, the segment of high-end perfumery perfectly matches with the spirit of their high-quality eco-friendly developments. The range of three complementary men’s, women’s and children’s perfumes therefore appears as: “A possibility to create links between materials, trades, but also individuals and generations. It adds a unique emotional touch to the purely functional.” “EMOI advocates a genuine state of mind: others and ME, exchanging, borrowing, swapping, depending on our moods and desires. Sharing of emotions – that’s what sustainable development is all about.” Meant both for manufacturers, who produce it, and consumers, who wear it, Emoi Infini is the fruit of a comprehensive eco-friendly approach.  Integrated to the product and its promise, eco-design should no longer appear as a constraint.  On the contrary, it anticipates operational solutions, and remains very real. All steps in the process - raw materials, fragrance, production, bottle, box, consumption - have been well eco-planned and eco-designed: a chemical-free colouring process, a box without husks or adhesives, 100% recycled glass and PET, organic jus, and a pump dispenser with a removable cap. All materials can be endlessly sorted and recycled. “In launching Emoi Infini, underline its creators, we are bringing a whole new perspective, moving from integral eco-design to integrated eco-design.”"
Procter & Gamble wants to lead the way to sustainability,"Procter & Gamble (P&G) has just unveiled its new long-term environmental sustainability vision.  The US consumer products giant aims at building tools to guide all sustainability decisions and goalsetting within the company. The new vision includes four ambitious steps: – Powering all P&G plants with 100% renewable energy,
– Using 100% renewable or recycled materials for all products and packaging produced by the company,
– Having zero consumer and manufacturing waste go to landfills,
– Designing products that delight consumers while maximizing the conservation of resources “Accelerating P&G’s commitment to environmental sustainability is a critical component of the Company’s ongoing growth strategy,” said Bob McDonald, P&G Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. In a first step, P&G is setting a series of 10-year sustainability goals.  These shorter-term goals will help the company to “focus its efforts and incrementally improve its environmental performance,” so as to be progressively able to achieve the long-term sustainability vision. This first set of sustainability goals will be delivered by 2020. They are in addition to the company’s existing 2012 goals. As with its current practice, P&G will report progress against these goals on an annual basis. The company has already launched the implementation of important measures, including, the assessment of the environmental footprint of its main suppliers, which will eventually allow integrate this criteria in the selection process, or the replacement of oil-based plastic packaging by plant-based packaging sourced from entirely renewable materials. P&G also announced it has signed an international partnership agreement with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).  The environmentalist organisation participated in the elaboration of the group’s new sustainability vision.  P&G hopes this partnership will help to solve the difficulties linked to sustainability efforts, the company may have to face in the future."
Cosmetic packaging slow to go green,"According to Organic Monitor, when developing sustainability plans cosmetic firms are focusing on green formulations, resource efficiency and life-cycle assessments of their products. Although companies are aware of the environmental impact of packaging, they have been slow to embrace sustainable packaging solutions. The research and consulting firm says that even organic cosmetic brands are lagging in adopting sustainable packaging. “Such companies have been pioneers in adopting natural and organic cosmetic standards, implementing fair trade and ethical sourcing programmes, and broader CSR initiatives but few are focusing on reducing their packaging footprints.” In certain cases, this reluctance to move to green packaging is linked to the specificity of cosmetic formulas.  The use of bioplastic packaging, for instance, is mainly limited to colour cosmetic cases.  In many cases, high heat sensitivity and water permeability prevent such packaging to be used for products such as creams, lotions and shampoos. However, there is a growing research in biopolymers packaging and technical progress in this area may help beauty companies to overcome these difficulties within short delays.  For instance, cosmetics giant, Procter & Gamble, recently announced a major shift to plant-derived packaging for some of its leading global cosmetic brands.  P&G intends to use sugarcane-derived plastic supplied from the Brazilian company Braskem SA, who manufactures the material using ethanol made from sustainably-grown Brazilian sugarcane. But bioplastics are not the only sustainable packaging option.  Actually, many beauty companies are looking at recycled packaging materials. Some natural cosmetic firms, such as Neal’s Yard Remedies are using Post Consumer Regrind (PCR) poly ethylene terephthalate bottles. Others, like Burt’s Bees are going further and making commitments to use only recycled materials.  Brazilian cosmetics maker Natura recently launched a fragrance packed in a folding box containing 30% of PCR paperboard. Aveda, that Organic Monitor found to be one of the few cosmetic companies to give priority to packaging on its sustainability agenda, is the largest user of PCR plastic in the beauty industry, saving over 1 million pounds (1,20 million euros) of virgin plastic each year. Its products now contain 80% or more recycled materials. It has also recycled 37 million polypropylene caps through its ‘Recycle Caps with Aveda’ campaign. Eco-packaging design is another method of reducing the packaging footprint. Some beauty brands such as Nude Skincare have developed sleek packaging that is both stylish and environmentally-friendly. Reducing packaging in design has enabled the Greek brand Korres to save 11 tons of plastic materials a year. According to Organic Monitor, a few pioneers are taking a holistic approach to sustainable packaging. Apart from Aveda, Method Products has adopted the Cradle-to-Cradle (C2C) design approach, which ensures packaging is environmentally responsible and packaging materials are recovered after the product is used. Several presentations and workshops will explore these various options on the occasion of the upcoming Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, taking place in Paris on October 18-20th, 2010."
P&G to use sugarcane-based packaging on leading cosmetic brands,"Procter & Gamble (P&G) is preparing a major shift to plant-derived packaging for some of its leading global cosmetic brands.  The company intends to use sugarcane-derived plastic supplied from the Brazilian company Braskem SA, who manufactures the material using ethanol made from sustainably-grown Brazilian sugarcane. P&G expects the pilot to be rolled out globally over the next 2 years, with the first products expected to be on shelf in 2011. Unlike traditional plastic, which is made from petroleum, plan-derived polymers are based on a renewable resource. Braskem SA uses an innovative process to transform sugarcane into high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic, a type commonly used for product packaging. “It remains 100% recyclable in existing facilities,” P&G claims. Obviously, by launching this renewable packaging on some of its global beauty and grooming brands, P&G intends to improve the environmental profile of its product. Consumer-driven decision “This innovation is truly consumer-driven.  As we talk with women around the world, they tell us that they want to make themselves more beautiful without making their environment less beautiful,” explains Gina Drosos, Group President, Global P&G Beauty.  “With this new packaging innovation, women can have confidence that their favourite brands are helping to make a difference,” she adds."
Environment: one more step forward for Neopac,"In the frame of its ongoing “Green Commitment” program, Neopac, a Switzerland-based supplier of tubes for the biotech, pharmaceutical, personal care and cosmetic industries, has appointed Daniel Müller as Environmental Manager, in preparation for the company’s ISO 14001 certification. Neopac is striving to achieve ISO 14001 certifcation in May 2011.  The standard sets out requirements for an Environmental Management System (EMS), which will help Neopac to measure and document its environmental impact.  The company also considers that being ISO 14001 certified would satisfy the growing needs of customers. “More and more customers are asking for green tubes,” points out Daniel Müller. “They are seeking to offer products with a good eco-balance that are safer for the environment as well as the consumer. In this way, they are not only meeting the needs of the consumer, but also creating an image of an environmentally conscious supplier.” According to Neopac, more and more consumers are sensitive to the contents not only of the product itself, but also of the packaging, and are looking for packaging that are free from environmentally harmful ingredients and processes. In addition, Neopac has provided data regarding materials, transportation, the disposal of hazardous substances, etc. to the myclimate Foundation, a Swiss non-profit foundation that is the leading quality provider of climate education and Carbon Management Services as well as a renowned partner for carbon offsetting solutions via effective carbon offset projects. After receiving data from Neopac, myclimate calculates the offset returns required, which, in turn, are used to promote certified environmental projects. Customers can then decide whether they would like to purchase CO2-neutral tubes and are prepared to pay an extra amount to support these projects. Neopac has already adopted a strategy to arrange climate-neutral business trips. Neopac has already taken numerous measures to improve its environmental performance. Nowadays, 95% of its colours and varnishes are UV-cured, which means they contain less volatile solvents. More than one-third of the electrical energy required by the company is provided by hydropower. 85% of the company’s wastes are sorted, separated and recycled whilst the remainder is recycled for energy. Short journeys, hazardous substance standard Euro 5 for heavy goods vehicles and the purchase of raw materials solely from Europe are other measures implemented by Neopac in an attempt to take care of the environment and the world’s resources."
"Promens ""Green Cube"" program is put to the test","PremiumBeauty News - How far have you got with the Green Cube program? Isabelle Orhan - Before I answer your question concerning the first concrete results of this ambitious program, let me first explain the origins of the project. Today, protecting the environment is a priority to preserve the planet’s natural resources and ensure its future. Kyoto has set the objectives: by 2050, our emissions must be reduced by four. We are of course aware of our responsibilities at Promens and we strive continually to reduce the environmental impact of our activity and products. If you recall, a few years ago, packaging had two main purposes: preserve the content and attract the consumer. Packaging had to be easy to use and to carry, provide information to the user (instructions of use, legal requirements ...) and facilitate product differentiation in a increasingly challenged market. Nowadays, environmental awareness has become one of the main things to take into consideration when developing a packaging. Raw materials must be as much as possible, easily sortable, recycled and recyclable.  We systematically optimize the thickness and weight of packaging to reduce the consumption of raw materials and preserve fossil resources. We have chosen to develop our environmental expertise internally. We are accredited by the ADEME [1] to carry out our carbon footprint calculations and our innovation engineers are trained to use the TEAM software to calculate lifecycles. Nowadays, like innovation, environment has become an essential pillar! Premium Beauty News - The production stage is obviously essential! Isabelle Orhan - This stage requires a lot of energy but a well conceived design is a guarantee for optimized productivity. Each parameter of the process is taken into consideration and studied accordingly. For example, our engineers prefer using hot runner molds to get rid of sprue waste. Temperature and pressure parameters are optimized, always keeping in mind that reducing a parameter may increase another one, causing higher energy consumption. Incidentally, our plants clearly show their environmental commitment with: 
– ISO 14001 Certification: the three French factories (Bellignat, Géovreisset and Eagle) have been certified by the AFAQ AFNOR.
– An accreditation by the ADEME to audit and assess the carbon footprint. Furthermore, we have developed the PBS (Promens Business System) which is a strategic initiative meant to enhance our operational performance. It involves all staff, from operators to management, in a combined effort to build a culture of continuous measurable improvement to identify and reduce losses. This program, based on the methodology of Continuous Improvement and Total Productive Management, is a global improvement of the system with defined standards, focused on sharing experiences and best practices from the Group. As regards concrete results, today all our factories are analyzed in terms of Carbon footprint whether they are located in France or Poland ... They all follow action plans to improve the Group’s footprint. Premium Beauty News - What about the consumer? Isabelle Orhan - Of course, we also imagine how the consumer is going to use the product. The aim being to develop efficient products to avoid waste, facilitate evacuation and deliver accurate dosage. Consumer’s awareness is increasing everyday and projects on environmental labelling will further strengthen this trend. Currently, Promens is capable of providing brands with the carbon footprint of all its bottles or jars. Our approach is to offer brands a real expertise in terms of packaging and environment. We opted for an educational approach rather than the use of marketing bluffs which we find many examples of in our industry! For example we advise against the use of organic materials with a CO2 footprint sometimes much worse than raw materials. We prefer to adopt in this area a realistic and long term approach. Premium Beauty News - And finally there is the recycling stage... Isabelle Orhan - Our priority is to find supply chains of recycled materials (PCR).  We are focusing on three raw materials: PE-HD, PP and PET. Our challenge is to find raw materials in line with the use of cosmetic products. We can also offer the use of recycled materials coming from our own production waste, the quality of which we guarantee through careful selection. Our strict management of waste is based on an optimization of upstream channels:
– Select the origin of waste,
– Not discard waste that can be recycled and reused,
– Separate hazardous waste from others (neon, aerosol, oil ...),
– Send sorted out and separated waste to their respective industry. Premium Beauty News - Can you give us some examples of this approach? Isabelle Orhan - There are obviously many. For instance, Green Airfree which is available on the English market. This Airless bottle with a pouch has been awarded with the Ecocert label and granted a favorable opinion from the COTREP. We are currently working with several brand owners on calculating the carbon footprint of our packaging and analyzing their life cycle. We are demonstrating for instance how to improve carbon footprint by skipping some finishing stages and integrating additives in the material. This is concrete work. We are clearly getting ahead of our competition in this domain and for example Johnson & Johnson has asked us to participate to the CDP program (Carbon Disclosure Project)."
The beauty industry invests in CSR and sustainability,"In its new Strategic Insights report, Organic Monitor assesses corporate and social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability initiatives in the beauty industry. The research finds that most investment is going into reducing the environmental footprint of cosmetic products by using greener formulations and sustainable packaging. According to Organic Monitor, packaging is receiving high interest because of its high ecological impact. Companies are looking at biodegradable plastics, recycled materials and innovative ways to reduce packaging such as upcycling and lightweighting, as well as the use of new packaging materials such as biopolymers and bamboo. A major finding is that natural and organic cosmetic companies are leading the way in terms of CSR & sustainability initiatives. “Many of them have sustainability built into their corporate DNA,” says Organic Monitor. The report highlights the achievements of the Brazilian company Natura, which has been championing environmental causes since its foundation in 1969. “It was the first major cosmetics company to become carbon neutral, offsetting its carbon emissions by reforestation of native tree species,” Organic Monitor notes. Beraca, another Brazilian company, is also commended for its social and biodiversity investment projects in the Amazon. By the use of case studies, Organic Monitor highlights the various methods of reducing the environmental and social impacts of cosmetics products and ingredients. The importance of ethical sourcing is making fair trade prominent, with a growing number of natural cosmetic and ingredient firms investing in grower projects in developing countries. Certification is a major barrier however, with many companies preferring to take the non-certified route because of bureaucracy and the limitations of fair trade standards. Corporate philanthropy is another area becoming important for some beauty companies wishing to ‘invest back’ into society. The report gives details of the various standards, certifications, labels and indexes for CSR and sustainability in the beauty industry. Natural and organic cosmetic standards have received most attention, however new schemes are emerging that look at the various dimensions of sustainability. Cradle to Cradle certification is becoming popular for companies such as Aveda and Kiehl’s as it gives a life-cycle analysis of cosmetic products. CSR and sustainability initiatives in the beauty industry will be extensively featured in the upcoming Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, taking place in Paris, 18-20 October 2010. The summit will look at how beauty companies can lower their environmental and social impacts by investing in green formulations, sustainable packaging, certification programmes, biodiversity & ethical supply chains."
