Five key ingredient launches spotted at in-cosmetics Global in Paris,"With Sensory Apple Pomace, Codif Technologie Naturelle introduced its very first functional ingredient. This upcycled alternative to PMMA (small particle size, oil absorption capacity, good spreading surface) is fully biodegradable. It is a micronized sensory powder with mattifying, smoothing and covering properties sourced from apple pomace. It can be used for powder, fluid and compact products. To create its new moisturizing active ingredient, Mibelle Biochemistry was inspired by the concept of pine cone scales, which open and close depending on weather conditions! Derived from the recycling of pine cones that are hand-collected in selected French forests PinoPlex [1] penetrates the hair, retaining water and flattening the hair cuticle, leaving hair smoother, shinier and more resistant to breakage. It improves the hair fiber integrity and prevents split ends. PinoPlex is derived from pine cones that are hand-collected in exceptional and carefully selected French forests. The new eco-friendly active developed by Laboratoires Expanscience is based on the regenerative cultivation of lin. Obtained using a green process, it is designed to protect, regenerate, and strengthen the skin and hair against daily aggressions. With a protected and reinforced barrier, skin can ensure its regeneration. But that is not all: the way it is grown is also good for the soil and biodiversity. Gaïaline is made from lin grown according to the principles of certified and regenerative conservation agriculture. Obtained by molecular distillation, the liposoluble active is a linseed oil concentrate enriched with unsaponifiables. On the occasion of in-cosmetics global, Roquette Beauté has introduced its latest ingredient, Beauté by Roquette ST 730 [2], a water-resistant film former with a clinically proven lifting effect. Derived from pea starch, Beauté by Roquette ST 730 at 5% showed higher water resistance compared to industry benchmark film formers, such as pullulan and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), at the same concentration. In an in vivo study on 40 volunteers to analyze its tightening power, Beauté by Roquette ST 730 at 4% significantly decreases fine lines and wrinkles. 82% of the study participants said that fine lines and wrinkles were diminished. For sensitive skin prone to atopy, Solabia debuts Serenibiome, a 100% natural, COSMOS-approved and twice patented active ingredient. The active design was bioinspired by an epiphytic fungus that protects its host by releasing a powerful glycolipid. Serenibiome bio-selectively inhibits Staphylococcus aureus colonization of the skin to tackle the itch-scratch vicious cycle."
Perfumery: Producers of natural ingredients join forces at the WPC show,"Premium Beauty News - What unites these companies that are offering a strongly diversified palette of fragrance ingredients? Virginie Gervason - For the very first time, seven major natural ingredients’ producers, coming from the four corners of the planet, will join forces to share their values and commitment. Evolving in different contexts, they are small or medium sized, responsible entrepreneurs, committed on the long term to their customers around the globe and all actors of their value chain, taking risks and investing every day to improve their practices every day and managing demanding third parties certifications. They know perfectly the communities they work directly with, they act for nature and biodiversity preservation in their regions, they invest in state of the art industrial facilities and produce the highest quality of natural ingredients that make the most sustainable perfumers’ creative palette. They share the same passion, same willingness to embark actors to preserve these resources, raise the same challenges regarding the future and elaborate multiple solutions to share. This unique “momentum”, imagined and organized by Resperfuma, in close collaboration with each of the producers and with the support and expertise of Dominique Roques, will bring together: Agroforex Company, a producer of benzoin and aquilaria from Laos; Enio Bonchev (damascena rose from Bulgaria); Jacarandas (ylang ylang and pink berry from Madagascar); Jasmine CE.Pvt.Ltd (vetiver and Indian flowers); Nelixia (guaiac wood from Paraguay, cardamom from Guatemala, etc.); SCA3P (lavenders and aromatic plants from France); Verger Naturals (cinnamon, black pepper and Sri Lankan spices). Premium Beauty News - Natural resources used in perfumery are highly diversified, some of them come from crops, others from wild plants, but all are very sensitive to climate change and environmental shifts. Are the consequences already visible? Do small producers have the means to adapt? Dominique Roques - Climate and environmental shifts obviously impact aromatic perfumery products. Climate change mainly impacts water resources, which are disrupted by changing rain patterns. Thus, significant, long and costly investments are required, the profitability of which can be questioned. For examples, Lavandin producers in France, rose producers in Bulgaria and, in India, small jasmine farmers must also entirely rethink water management on their farms in order to adapt to new rainfall regimes. As far as the environment is concerned, one of the major recurring problems is deforestation. It threatens several important perfume trees such as Styrax or Balsam Peru in Central America and especially guaiac wood in Paraguay. However, even in the Chaco forest, that has been heavily deforested to expand livestock areas, initiatives are beginning to emerge to demonstrate that the value of a perfume ingredient like guaiac can be instrumental to slow down the spiral of damages, in particular through sustainable management plans and by providing owners with a financially attractive alternative. Small producers are the key players behind these initiatives and the future of many of these products is in their hands, as long as they are supported by the industry."" Premium Beauty News - A panel discussion on the sustainability of the natural ingredient supply chain is also at the educational agenda of the WPC. Can you unveil its main outlines? Dominique Roques - I will moderate a debate with three panellists, Elisa Aragon (Nelixia), Filip Lissicharov (Enio Bonchev) and Raja Palaniswamy (Jasmine CE PVT) on the following question: ""Naturals: what does it take to source sustainably?"" Indeed, the sourcing of natural perfumery ingredients has been going through major changes for the past ten years. The growing awareness and expectations of a significant part of perfume consumers have driven our industry (F&F companies and brands) to question former producers’ practices and drive improvements at source. This has led to significant demands and move towards third party certifications. A few years down the road, our panel will discuss the situation of leading producers from America, Europe and Asia. What is their vision and experience of this new trends? Are certifications well suited to the social and environmental realities of their countries, and is the market ready to bear the extra cost resulting of such requirements?

Eurofragance adds a new captive to its palette of fragrance ingredients,"Developed within Eurofragance Innovation Center in Barcelona, this third captive ingredient (only for the use of in-house perfumers) is a synthetic molecule designed to for us convey a sensation of natural freshness in Fine Fragrance, Home Care and Personal Care compositions. Named after its ability to exude fresh, invigorating and energizing notes, Euphorion evokes a euphoric breath of fresh air. According to Eurofragance, Euphorion’s most remarkable attribute is a compelling green scent that confers a deep identity to fragrance formulas, even at minimal doses. Perfumers on the project team noticed that as well as imparting a feeling of natural freshness to compositions, Euphorion amplifies the freshness of other key ingredients and can: intensify the freshness of aromatic notes like rosemary and sage; accentuate the greenness of fruity notes like tropical fruit, blackcurrant and grapefruit; blend gracefully with woody and spicy notes like pepper and nutmeg. Furthermore, Euphorion brings out a greener tone in fougère notes and adds aromatic intensity to leathery notes. Beyond freshness, certain perfumers noted another olfactive attribute, more reminiscent of salty foods and umami, that blends perfectly with spicy, fruity, toasted hazelnut, green and lemony notes and conjures the aroma of oil-rich seeds and cured ham. The profile has sparked the interest of creative perfumers, who see an original alternative to sweet gourmand notes. “In Western societies, the idea of freshness is expressed through a wide range of olfactive associations, including the outdoors, natural landscapes, citruses and other fruits, roots, spices and aromatic plants, all of which provide inspiration for perfume designers. The occasional difficulty of sourcing and replicating such natural ingredients have prompted many perfume houses in recent decades to develop synthetic raw materials that evoke similar feelings of freshness,” said Eurofragance in a statement. According to Eurofragance, in addition to its olfactive features, Euphorion offers several advantages in terms of sustainability: it is produced using little energy; it generates little waste; and it offers maximum impact at minimal doses. The new captive will be presented at the in-cosmetics Global trade fair held in Paris on April 16–18, 2024."
Cosmetic ingredients in the cyber beauty era,"As far as technology is concerned, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the product development process is certainly today’s most important challenge for cosmetics and perfume professionals.

"Parfex, Croda’s spearhead in perfumery, accelerates investments","Founded in Grasse, the historic cradle of French perfumery, Parfex takes advantage of this privileged location to offer its customers a complete range of tailor-made compositions based on a large offering of perfumery ingredients, including a highly diversified palette of natural substances. The company’s production site is 90% automated, thanks to three weighing robots that can process both small and large batches. To better serve its customers around the world, Parfex also benefits from synergies with the international networks of Croda, its mother company since 2021, and Iberchem, the other composition house in the group’s Fragrances & Flavors division. Parfex achieved a turnover of 32.6 million euros in 2023 and employs 110 staffs, including 6 perfumers. “One of our strengths is to combine the responsiveness and agility of a medium-sized company with the presence global presence and the synergies of a large international group. We especially boast our very rapid response time to customer briefs, and an ordering and delivery process within reduced deadlines,” Juana Birkenkamp, communications manager of the company told Premium Beauty News. Thanks to a team of sensory analysts and marketing specialists, the company regularly introduces new collections inspired from proactive surveys of lifestyles and consumer preferences. At the next in-cosmetics Global, from April 16 to 18 in Paris, Parfex will highlight a collection of perfumes dedicated to personal care. Dubbed “e-motions”, the range features eight different formulations, incorporating Croda active ingredients and based on Iberchem’s Wavemotion® technology, an innovative scientific approach which makes it possible to identify and evaluate the emotional benefits linked to scents. “The e-motions collection will offer a unique sensory experience, combining high-quality fragrances with personalized care formulations,” highlighted the manager. Investment in new infrastructure, Parfex plans to triple the surface area of its creation centre, which will increase from 1050 to 2700 square metres. “The new centre for personal care excellence will also be a hub open to our colleagues at Croda Beauty, and will allow us to welcome our customers for presentations on trends and innovations,” continued Juana Birkenkamp. Scheduled for September 2024, the opening of the new R&D centre will free up space to increase the surface area of the company’s manufacturing unit. Indeed, long-term investments are planned to expand production capacities. The surface area of the unit is scheduled to increase from 1,180 m2 today to nearly 5,000 m2 in 2027, with the aim to provide an effective response to market growth. Through its affiliation with the Croda Group, Parfex benefits from a strengthened global presence, with an office in Dubai and access to Iberchem’s production centres across the globe. In April, the company also set up a permanent commercial presence in the Paris region. Certified ISO 9001, 14001 and 45001, Parfex is continuing its projects to reduce its environmental footprint, in particular through the installation of photovoltaic panels that will allow the new innovation centre to reach an energy autonomy rate of 80%. The company also supports the Fleurs d’Exception du Pays de Grasse association and has established sourcing partnerships with local farmers in France. By accelerating its investments and its commitment to innovation and the environment, Parfex intends to embody excellence in the art of perfume composition. “We are resolutely committed to a future-oriented perfumery while remaining faithful to the traditions that have made us famous,” concluded Juana Birkenkamp."
"Focusing on upcycling coffee grounds, Cabeco launches two cosmetic ingredients","Cabeco (standing for “Cascading of Benefits of Coffee”) was born from the inquisitiveness of a coffee producer and a scientist and their concern about the “economic, ecological, and human waste” of coffee farming and its industrial processing. Thus, the company focused its researches on coffee grounds derived from the production of freeze-dried coffee. Alone, European producers of instant coffee alone 2 million tons of industrial coffee grounds, which are currently burnt or methanized. A characterization study of the components of coffee grounds recovered from the instant coffee production process unveiled a series of interesting molecules, from caffeine to less expected substances, such as a series of oligomer, oligoglucan and oligopeptide managers of skin health and the microbiome. In order to create high value active ingredients from this resource, which used to be seen as waste, Cabeco has developed and patented a sustainable extraction process. “This green process uses no solvents, emits no CO2, and creates no waste,” highlights the company. This process allows for the upcycling of 100% of the coffee grounds that Cabeco transforms into two 100% natural cosmetic raw materials: Cofoil, a semi-liquid lipid, highly regenerative/reparative active ingredient with several benefits for cutaneous tissues; and Cofex, an ultra-soft exfoliant powder. Cofoil is a new 100% upcycled lipid. This semi-liquid active ingredient, golden yellow to dark orange in colour, offers a slightly perceptible hint of coffee aroma that can be masked easily, if required. Tested on distressed skin explants, Cofoil demonstrated its capacity to enhance the healing process and unveiled key cell behaviour during the restoration of youth. According to Cabeco, Cofoil acts on the main factors of skin youth (support fibres, immune-protectors, defensins, aquaporins, oligomers and precursors) to boost skin regeneration and reparation. It increases layering of the stratum corneum and densifies the epidermal neocollagen. When at ambient temperature, Cofoil does not become rancid over prolonged storage and no preservatives are needed. Antibacterial activity has been proven versus a wide range of germs including multi-resistant Staph. Usage rate is typically 2 à 5%. The Cofex range of exfoliants is produced simultaneously with Cofoil. Cofex designates a natural insoluble coffee powder, that is soft and supple in feel and completely devoid of unpleasant abrasiveness. The structure is that of thin leaflets of supple woven fibres, which gently roll over the skin and are non-abrasive. Ice brown chocolate in colour, leaving no stain, it is virtually odourless, with a barely perceptible hint of coffee. Several ranges are available: – Cofex Extra offers particul sizes from150-300µm. It is a gentle, active and stimulating exfoliant;
– Cofex Ultra Active Powder is a refined version (less than 50 µm);
– Cofex, for all other fine grades available on request. Cofex powders can be used in all formulae, water and oil based, emulsions and dry preparations. They are never ionized. Cabeco recommends using Cofex Extra at a concentration of 5 to 15%, as an exfoliant, and 1 to 5% for soaps. With these two new cosmetic actives, Cabeco aims to be part of a transformative process for the coffee sector. Indeed, coffee is the most consumed beverage on earth after water. Two third of humanity drink coffee every day, a total of 2.5 billion cups a day! However, smallholder growers (100 million families- Brazil, Vietnam, Mexico, Ethiopia, Columbia…) are hardly benefiting from global coffee trade. Undergoing financial pressure, extreme weather and climate conditions, and reduced yields of a demanding crop, many growers have begun to uproot plants in favour of other cash crops. Actually, for many of them, coffee growing is no longer viable nor profitable. This is why Cabeco has chosen to join a Regenerative Agriculture program and to create new revenue streams throughout the coffee sector by returning part of its profits where most needed, as part of an approach framed and validated by Gold Rainforest Alliance membership."
"in-cosmetics Global returns to Paris from 16-18 April, 2024","The event, which gathered 909 exhibitors and welcomed 10,799 unique visitors from across 118 countries, last year in Barcelona, is returning to Paris with the aim to break new records.

Silab combines hygiene and skin care in deodorants with a meadowsweet extract,"For their new development, Silab sought to combine the effectiveness expected by consumers of deodorants against malodors, with the growing quest for products of natural origin that are respectful of the skin. In order to better address the mechanism leading to the generation of odors, Silab developed an original modeling study that demonstrated quantitative (increased abundance) and qualitative modifications (increased enzymatic activity) of Staphylococcus hominis strains sampled from the axillary microbiota of malodorous volunteers subjected to physical activity, compared to a non-odorous panel. In response to this problem, Silab has shown that their new ingredient limits the excessive abundance of S. hominis in the axillary cutaneous microbiota and targets the enzymatic activity of this bacterial species. Deolya thus targets the source of perspiration odors while leaving the microbial diversity of this skin zone unaffected. The effectiveness of Deolya against odors was tested on a Caucasian panel of both sexes participating in a physical activity. The study showed a reduction of perspiration odors by 58% as of the first application of the product containing the active ingredient. This deodorant efficacy, assessed by an olfactory evaluation from a qualified expert panel, is confirmed at the molecular level by a significant 76.3% reduction of the malodorous 3M3SH thiol. According to Silab, these effects are also observed after seven days of daily use and without having applied the deodorant Deolya in the morning before the physical activity session, underlining the immediate and long-term effect of the deodorant. In addition, according to Silab, Deolya reduces inflammation, thus significantly decreasing the frequency of unpleasant underarm sensations appearance, daily but also after shaving or epilation (after 28 days of use). In particular, the active ingredient strengthens the barrier function, resulting in vivo in an improvement of Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) of underarm skin. Thanks to this multifunctional benefits, Deolya is a natural deodorant solution providing comfort and soothing to the axillary zone. For this development, Silab research beneficially used the tellimagrandin-type ellagitannins and proanthocyanidols found in meadowsweet, giving Deolya its unique polyphenolic profile. Obtained from French suppliers certified for organic agriculture and traced back to the harvest site, this raw material complies with Silab’s criteria for traceability and sustainability. Deolya is a patented active ingredient recommended in all deodorant care products at a dose of 0.1 to 1.0%. Available in aqueous solution, it complies with biodiversity regulations and has a natural origin content of 99.2% (ISO 16128). It complies with international cosmetics regulations (Europe, USA, China, Japan, etc.)."
"Givaudan debuts Nympheal, a fragrance ingredient with a white floral profile","Givaudan’s latest fragrance ingredient builds on the company’s expertise in muguet aldehydes. According to Givaudan, Nympheal combines the best olfactive and technical qualities of other molecules in this category. It provides a fresh and opulent muguet fragrance with a hint of linden blossom, adding volume, floral creaminess, and excellent diffusion to fragrance compositions. “Nympheal is an outstanding fresh and opulent muguet ingredient, with a linden blossom accent bringing tremendous volume and creaminess,” said Dominique Lelièvre, Ingredients Research Perfumer at Givaudan. The new molecule [1] is a colourless liquid that can be used by perfumers in water applications. Its versatility will enable to bring a robust white floral note in various cross-category applications including shampoos and antiperspirants. Givaudan also identified an interesting synergy of Nympheal and patchouli oil that creates a particular effect, since they do not overlay, but interact to bring a unique signature. In alignment with the Givaudan’s sustainability goals, Nympheal is a biodegradable molecule that follows the guidelines set by the OECD. It was developed according to the principles of green chemistry, and in line with the company’s Safe by Design approach with the aim to match the sustainability expectations of consumers’ today. “It is a delight to share this molecule with customers, as it opens up new possibilities for creating memorable and long- lasting fragrances. Nympheal is the result of collaboration between Givaudan’s researchers, perfumers, and regulatory experts, showcasing their dedication and expertise in developing ingredients that make a difference to fragrance compounds,” said Paul-Erwan Camenen, Head of Fragrance Ingredients Business at Givaudan."
"“Perfume innovation comes from new ingredients”, Isaac Sinclair, Symrise","Premium Beauty News - You worked for 12 years in Brazil, as part of the Symrise team of perfumers-creators in São Paulo. What do you think are the specificities of perfume in this country? Isaac Sinclair - Brazil is the largest global market in terms of volume and is very well ranked in value, although the latter fluctuates according to exchange rates. Brazilians are clearly big fans of fragrances. Compared to other countries, studies show that they spend a very large proportion of their income on perfumes. Brazilians buy several perfumes and decide which one to wear depending on their mood or on the circumstances. In Brazil, people perfume themselves a lot, several times a day, because due to the climate, they generally shower between three and five times a day. This provides an opportunity to change fragrances, for example, in anticipation of a romantic moment. In Brazil alone, 4,000 stores have opened under the name of O Boticário, and one of their blockbusters can sell millions of units. It is quite exciting for a perfumer to recognize “their” perfume on their way to a restaurant! In Brazil, the perfumes that sell well share one feature: their “lasting power”. It determines the quality/price ratio in the eyes of consumers. In concrete terms, whether you are creating a fresh or oriental fragrance, it has to be a “bomb” and last on the skin, otherwise consumers feel cheated. Perfumers need to master this skill, and we sometimes use patchouli for this purpose. Therefore, we are not confined to a few appealing styles or specific olfactory families to meet this demand. Another peculiarity of this vast market is that women ignore marketing categories and can choose so-called men’s fragrances simply because they like them. And this was well before the gender-fluid trend. Many women wear very fresh, but also long-lasting “fougere” fragrances, such as Kaiak Aero by Natura. Premium Beauty News - Which of the locally-produced raw materials did you particularly enjoy working with? Isaac Sinclair - Brazil boasts one of the richest biodiversities in the world. Many ingredients originate from this continent, even if we are not aware of it. For example, the classic tonka bean and rosewood come from the Amazon rainforest, as do cocoa and cashew nut. This country’s riches are endless. Symrise has been developing a special programme to help communities grow aromatic plants which no longer renewed themselves, such as priprioca. Its tubers produce an amazing scent reminiscent of cypriol and vetiver. There is also palo santo: its wood is not cut, but the fruit is harvested to obtain essential oil. At first, it evokes blackcurrant, before returning to the wood smell itself. It is a very stimulating environment for perfumers. In addition to perfume plants, Head Space can be used to capture new scent profiles from fruit. Cashew is generally known as a nut, but it is actually part of a whole, sublime fruit that can be used for perfumes. Its flesh reminds of a slightly acid tropical guava. Usually, we just use the cashew nut, but in Brazil, perfumers also use the fruit. In fact, it is featured in a delicious recipe of the national cocktail, the cashew fruit caipirinha. Thanks to the Head Space technology, we were able to recreate the smell of this delicate fruit in a laboratory. Therefore, Symrise has a Vitessence associated with it. There is also cupuaçu, a white-fleshed fruit whose taste is similar to cocoa, and which can be used as an alternative to chocolate in milkshakes. Brazil’s biodiversity is fabulous. Plants like patchouli, vetiver, and oranges managed to adapt to the climate, although oranges remain green in the absence of cool nights, as can be seen in Spain. Premium Beauty News – Is this botanical diversity inspiring for a perfumer-creator? Have any of your creative ideas stemmed from one of these ingredients? Isaac Sinclair - Being exposed to new smells in Brazil opened my mind. Anything new stimulates the creative process. Without Brazil, I would not have got that far with certain fruit smells. When you go to Brazil, you realize there is a whole world of different tropical fruits, because at the end of the day, guava does not smell like cocoa, which does not smell like cashew apples... There are real nuances that we are not aware of in Europe or New Zealand. Over there, a whole universe opens up. Personally, in my perfume creation process, I did not really start with an ingredient specific to Brazil, but I was able to use these materials for structures I had in mind. In my case, I would rather say I added Brazilian ingredients to my palette. Generally speaking, there are not many perfumes built around one ingredient. For example, even if a perfume is created around vetiver, it has to be dressed up with citrus fruits or other ingredients. Premium Beauty News – How do you feel about Garden Labs, the 100% natural vegetable extracts offered by Symrise since late 2020? Isaac Sinclair – It is exciting because, just like with Brazilian ingredients, we did not use to have access to all this potential. Ten years ago, we did not have the technology to capture these plant extracts. Before Garden Labs, if you wanted to create an artichoke, you had to create a chord which gave the impression of an artichoke. But we did not have a real artichoke or cauliflower. With theGarden Lab technology, the playing field has become bigger. In my opinion, a large part of perfume innovation comes from new ingredients. For example, when Calone arrived, this molecule opened up a new path. Fragrances like L’Eau d’Issey (Issey Miyake) and Escape (Calvin Klein) were only possible because of it. Now we are seeing the same phenomenon with natural ingredients. At first, new ingredients are used very little. Then, over time, they gain more importance. In the future, we might see more “savoury” or even “salty” scents. The Garden Lab range extends beyond vegetables. Symrise already has passion fruit. We did not have natural passion fruit before, so we had to use a combination of molecules. It is a great step forward, especially as it involves upcycling. Thanks to this technology, it is possible to recycle artichoke waste from the food industry to extract its smell. Or onion or cauliflower waste. In the case of passion fruit, we work with juice residues. We could consider developing a tomato Garden Lab by stepping in the juice or gazpacho production cycles... Unlike with the Head Space technology, these are entirely natural products. Premium Beauty News – You recently joined the Symrise team in Paris. Could your experience and the use of ingredients from Brazil be transposed here and appeal to the French and global markets? Isaac Sinclair - Why not? Innovation is always welcome. Everyone wants innovation. So, I think any of the ingredients that grow in Brazil could be very well accepted. We know that blackcurrant or passion fruit can play a decisive role in an olfactory structure. So, why not cashew apples, if certain techniques are used? I am also thinking about cupuaçu, with its chocolate flavour. The diversity of Brazilian fruits is not limited to coconut. Generally speaking, I think that when you create successful perfumes, whether for Europe or Brazil, you have to show your skills and know how to combine the creative and technical aspects. If you are satisfied with the technical aspect and do not take into account the creative factor, you are really just a technician. You do not do anything new. But in our industry, new products also have to pass the tests of potential consumers. I think lots of proposals created in Brazil would also work here in terms of structure, if we refer to the tests that have been carried out. Premium Beauty News – In your opinion, how will perfume creation evolve and innovate over the next few years? Isaac Sinclair –  The world is constantly changing and consumers change too. They are much more educated about perfumes than they were 20 years ago. They are increasingly aware of what they are buying. In the perfume industry, we are now seeing greater transparency, as a result of new technologies capable of revealing the ingredients found in a formula, when they used to remain secret. I am thinking of GCMS (Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry), for example. Niche brands help raise the cultural level of perfume consumers, who show increasingly sophisticated needs. It is a real challenge for perfumers. This article was published in our special issue Fragrance Innovation, to read here."
Evonik launches skin-identical biotech-based vegan collagen ingredient,"Vecollage Fortify L [1] leverages Evonik’s competencies in biotechnology, collagen, and skin care to meet the demand for vegan collagen for applications such as anti-aging and hydrating creams. Evonik said the launch of Vecollage Fortify L brings a step closer to generating a platform of non-animal and sustainable collagen. This platform will consist of several types of vegan collagen developed by Evonik and together with partners. Vecollage Fortify L was developed in partnership with the company Modern Meadow Inc., which specializes in fermentation-based protein development. Made using fermentation technology, the new ingredient thus meets increasing market demand for vegan collagen. “For decades, collagen has been a sought-after ingredient in cosmetics and dermatology for its ability to improve firmness, elasticity and hydration in the skin. Traditionally, collagen comes from animal and marine sources, but consumers are increasingly looking for ethical and sustainable alternatives, while brands are concerned about supply security issues,” explains Evonik in a statement. Collagen is challenged by both intrinsic factors, like aging, and extrinsic factors, like sun exposure. Through in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies, Vecollage Fortify L is demonstrated to sustaining and reinforcing the skin’s collagen. According to Evonik, it provides dual benefits to fortify collagen in the skin by preventing age-related degradation and stimulating the skin’s own collagen production. “The future of skincare is all about biotech-based collagen! Brand owners can now offer consumers sustainably sourced, skin-identical collagen,” said Yann d’Hervé, head of Evonik’s Care Solutions business line."
Perfume ingredients: towards more sustainable extraction techniques,"Naturalness is no longer an option for consumers, whose ecological awareness and need for transparency are growing by the day. 68% of consumers say they would like to see more responsible perfumes, according to the Firmenich Hub Global Study conducted in 2021. Now, all perfume brands – and not just specialist niche brands – want to highlight their “green” ingredients. For example, in December 2023, the advertising campaign for Guerlain’s Aqua Allegoria Forte clearly featured the statement “More than 90% natural origin.” And yet, natural ingredient extraction does not always rhyme with sustainability. On the one hand, conventional distillation processes for natural ingredients require water and high energy consumption in order to reach the temperature of 100°C required for condensation (the vapour takes the odorous components out of the plants). On the other hand, extraction with volatile solvents can be polluting. Therefore, perfume companies seek to give up on these two processes. At the end of 2023, the L’Oréal group announced an exclusive partnership with Cosmo International Fragrances to deploy a new approach to natural ingredient extraction based on green sciences. “Cosmo International Fragrance worked for five years to develop this new extraction process. It is a green innovation in that it is petrochemical- and heat-free. This slow technique involves capturing the volatile fragrant molecules using the air flow,” explains Alexandrine Demachy, Managing Director France of Cosmo International Fragrances. Initially, this new technology was applied to tuberose, a legendary perfume flower. “The idea is to let the flower express itself. When you close your eyes, you are on the flower,” adds Alexandrine Demachy. “The partnership with L’Oréal’s Green Sciences department opens up new possibilities for us, in particular that of processing silent flowers, the grail of perfumers. It is also very rewarding for our research and development team.” This process differs from Head Space, which requires laboratory recreation after analyzing the olfactory spectrum of flowers in their natural environment. Here, picking is a necessary operation. “The advantage of our system is that it is very agile and mobile. We can process the flowers directly in the field to capture their volatile molecules. The flowers remain intact throughout the process, they can have a second life and be processed differently, offering a second olfactory profile. This way, no waste is generated,” points out Alexandrine Demachy. “Traditional processes still exist. We are not replacing these ingredients (essential oils, extracts, essences, etc.), because we do not capture the flower in its entirety, just its fragrance. On the other hand, we add a new product to the perfumer’s palette: the smell of the fresh plant characterized by its volatile molecules.” Symrise, for its part, has been communicating since 2018 on the SymTrap process, which reduces the extraction carbon footprint, while recovering residues from the agri-food industry. These residues are mainly in the form of aqueous solutions (e.g. residual juice from fruit extraction). This upcycling model has a very low impact, because it is a cold process free from chemical solvents. SymTrap ingredients substitute natural fruity notes, which perfumers previously lacked, for synthetic molecules such as C14 aldehyde (for the scent of peach) or Laire Prunol base (for plum). Since 2019, SymTrap vegetables (artichoke, asparagus, leek, cauliflower and onion) have been added, bringing new sharpness to the perfumer’s palette and opening up other creative perspectives. “Before the arrival of Symrise’s Garden Labs, we had to use our olfactory memory to recreate a scent close to the vegetable. So, this new collection of natural ingredients is very disruptive and rewarding,” says Alexandra Carlin, Perfumer at Symrise. At dsm-firmenich, naturalness is also a key issue. The company promotes its Firgood technology, which works with electromagnetic vibrations, mainly using the water already contained in the biomass as the extraction vector. The benefits are diverse: lower water and energy consumption and reduced heat exposure time for the raw materials, which preserves the integrity of heat-sensitive olfactory molecules. “Firgood opens up new olfactory territories for perfumers, with different facets and premium profiles,” says Mélanie Verhille, Sustainable Perfumery Marketing & Communication Director / Sustainability Strategy at dsm-firmenich. Firgood also makes it possible to process new plants or silent flowers that have not yet been exploited in fine perfumery. These advances in impact reduction also have a concomitant effect: that of broadening the creative palette of perfumers. In this quest for naturalness, virtuous methods combine to improve the environmental performance of the final fragrance. At dsm-firmenich, the Protopia base for fine perfumes combines an extract of Firgood Pear, several over-cycled materials (Geraniol 60 RC, Romandolide, a cedar of Virginia), and captive molecules obtained with biotechnology (Ambrox Super and Pulpanat). At the Fragrance Innovation Summit 2023, Robertet, an expert in natural ingredients, took stock of its CleanRScent programme launched ten years ago. This continuous improvement programme is aimed to develop green technologies and solvents with a high degree of biodegradability and recyclability. This innovation is based on the use of Dimethyl Carbonate, an alternative solvent whose extraction performance is comparable to that of hexane, only without any impact on health, and with a low environmental footprint. “This process, which led to two patents, is now cost-effective on an industrial scale”, says Céline Louis Ughetto, Head of Product Management – F&F ingredients at Robertet Group. Today, the CleanRScent collection includes absolutes (Maté, Toasted Tonka Bean, Bourbon Vanilla) and a bleached cypress wood. These high-quality ingredients provide olfactory profiles that are very close to nature. Mane’s E-Pure Jungle Essences offer a responsible alternative to absolutes and are considered natural according to standard ISO 9235. They are based on perfume plants and flowers, using a process combining enfleurage in a first phase (with a neutral vegetable oil as a solvent) and supercritical CO2 extraction in a second phase. Mane’s E-Pure Jungle Essences are extremely faithful to what nature offers and are intended for the fine perfume industry. Used in a second stage, supercritical CO2 extraction requires the temperature to be reduced to as low as 30°C in order to bring the carbon dioxide to a liquid state. What’s more, once depressurized, this alternative medium leaves no residual elements. It should be noted that CO2 can be obtained by recovering organic waste, in particular during methanization processes, which themselves generate green energy. For its part, Maison Lautier 1795 – which brings together Symrise’s collections of perfume ingredients – provided insights on the enfleurage processes it has been testing since 2020 at various production sites, using locally-produced fats such as cocoa butter and jojoba oil. The results are also very convincing in terms of the aromatic spectrum and quality of the extracts. Beyond responsible sourcing, which is aimed to preserving both the lives of farming communities and biodiversity, environmental concerns also relate to the increasing scarcity of natural resources. At the end of 2023, Grasse-based Robertet became the first perfume group to install a BioPod designed by the start-up Interstellar Lab. The aim of this AI-managed greenhouse is to grow crops with a high added-value using the least resources possible, while generating a reduced carbon footprint. The Interstellar Lab start-up has since joined the L’Oréal Green Sciences Incubator programme as part of the L’Oréal for the Future programme. Biotechnology is also one of the avenues being explored by perfume companies to reduce the use of fossil fuels. Fermentation using enzymes, natural proteins or other micro-organisms can be an effective replacement for chemical reagents. In 2019, Givaudan announced a new technique based on the fermentation of organic cane sugar to produce Ambrofix, a fully biodegradable alternative to ambergris. This product, in which all carbon atoms in the base material are recombined in the final product molecules, generates no carbon waste or pollutants. It is in line with the company’s FiveCarbon Path vision. For its part, Takasago is doing white biotechnology research based on the living world. Biocyclamol is produced from fully renewable resources and is biodegradable. This new ingredient has a tenacious floral note similar to that of lily of the valley, both pure and abstract. “At the end of the day, we are all trying to be more sustainable in our approaches, products and raw materials"", says Alexandrine Demachy. “As manufacturers, we all need to advance our research on natural products and synthesis. We need to challenge ourselves. We all have the same brief (less solvents, less energy, etc.). Everyone, whether in industry or research, interprets this brief in their own way, with their own ideas and discoveries, and all solutions are complementary. The products released are all different, and that is to the benefit of perfumers, who have an ever-larger choice for their compositions.” This article was published in our special issue Fragrance Innovation, to read here."
How to make sustainable perfume alcohol?,"Manufacturers wishing to achieve a high ecodesign index have been paying particular attention to ethyl alcohol, or ethanol, which can account for up to 95% of a fragrance composition. ‘Green’ alcohol can help reduce their products’ carbon footprint and demonstrate a strong commitment. Various solutions and technologies are emerging to meet these expectations. Developed by LanzaTech, the technology for recycling the carbon emitted by factories to make ethanol caused a stir when, in 2021, Coty announced they had chosen this alcohol for their fragrances. In spring 2023, this decision led to the launch of the first Gucci fragrance to contain 100% of ethanol derived from recycled carbon. This technology offers two advantages. It captures the carbon emitted by industrial steel mills, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, and then converts it into sustainable raw materials or fuels using biotechnology. A natural bacterium ferments the carbon contained in the gas released by the factories to produce a predetermined raw material. “We have a whole portfolio of biocatalysts selected for their potential to ferment the carbon contained in the emissions into about a hundred different raw materials”, explains Babette Pettersen, Vice President Europe at LanzaTech. These include ethanol, which, once purified, is used for perfumes. The production is based on the CO2 emitted by four plants located in China: to date, it represents 200,000 tonnes of ethanol, most of which goes to the sustainable fuel market. “For each plant, we manage to reduce CO2 emissions into the atmosphere by 150,000 tonnes a year”, notes the vice-president. The ethanol purification phase for the perfume industry takes place in Europe. It involves demanding requirements specific to each brand. And in response to growing customer demand for 100% European sourcing, LanzaTech has just inaugurated its first biocatalysis unit in Belgium. “This European project launched in 2015 is now up and running. We are going to capture the carbon emitted by the ArcelorMittal plant in Ghent and ferment it to produce ethanol for various European everyday product markets, including perfumes and cleaning products”, explains Babette Pettersen. The ethanol production capacity of 64,000 tonnes opens up new supply possibilities for the perfume industry. “We expect to have access to around 600,000 tonnes of ’Carbon Smart’ ethanol over the next 5 years,” she adds. CristalCo, a subsidiary of the Cristal Union group and one of France’s leading sugar beet cooperatives, now offers the first range of agro-ecological, low-carbon sugars and alcohols, thanks to the Amplify™ programme. The project is based on regenerative agriculture practices applied by some of the cooperative’s farmer members. Regenerative agriculture involves preserving soils from erosion in the long term by various means, including covering them with plant varieties that have not been collected, so they are protected from climatic hazards, or limiting their work in order to protect biodiversity. Out of the cooperative’s 4,630 growers assessed to date, 1,116 meet the criteria for regenerative agriculture quantified by the RI regeneration index. “The beetroot produced with regenerative agriculture are pooled with the others, and we then establish a mass balance. This principle is fully accepted by our customers and by the brands”, explains Audrey Taffin, CristalCo’s Marketing Manager BtoB. Three major brands of the LVMH group – Parfums Christian Dior, Givenchy Parfums and Kenzo – are also interested in this approach. These three companies have financed a project to support the agro-ecological transition of 380 hectares of beetroot in north-eastern France, in order to produce the equivalent of 45% of their alcohol needs using the mass balance approach. “Brands usually do not claim they adopted this approach specifically for their fragrances, but rather for their overall commitments,” notes Audrey Taffin. The second part of Amplify™ is focused on carbon emission reduction. Cristal Union committed to a large energy transition towards renewable resources, which helped reduce its CO₂ emissions by 18% between 2019 and 2022. With this plan, the group now offers decarbonated sugars and alcohols. “We can make products derived from regenerative, low-carbon agriculture,” she concludes. Currently in the production phase, Intact Regenerative has been working on a different strategy based on the regenerative cultivation and processing of leguminous plants. This approach promotes sustainable perfume alcohol by reducing its impact on the carbon footprint, water footprint, and preservation of biodiversity. “Through our technologies, we will reduce production-related emissions by more than 80%, consume 75% less water, and act on biodiversity through plants”, says Alexis Duval, co-founder and Managing Director of Intact Regenerative. The patented technology is based on the choice of leguminous plants, peas, or horse beans. “Legumes have a positive impact on soil life, unlike conventional crops. They are regenerative. Also, their pollen is gathered by bees, and they help reduce the use of pesticides, because they have a preventive effect on parasitism”, he explains. The main advantage of these plants is that they fix nitrogen in the soil, reducing the need for fertilisers, and therefore reducing the emissions associated with their production. Finally, unlike the crops usually used to produce perfume alcohol (beetroot, maize, sugar cane), legumes make it possible to carry out dry extraction with less water, as well as low-energy fermentation and distillation. “Taking into account all phases, the sum of several innovations helps us achieve significant results in terms of sustainability. We can also reuse the pea shells in biomass boilers to provide almost all the energy we need”, adds Alexis Duval. The alcohol offered by Intact Regenerative won this year’s Special Cleantech Prize at the Cosmetic 360 show. The company made its first investments in a production line based near Orléans, south of Paris. It should be operational in early 2025. A pre-booking system will make it possible for interested brands to position themselves and identify needs. Specialized in helping cosmetic and perfume ingredient suppliers recycle agricultural waste, La Fabrique Végétale has developed sustainable plant-derived alcohol which is 100% upcycled from a French agricultural source. “We cannot reveal the nature of the co-product now, as it will shortly be launched in collaboration with a major French perfumer, but its performance is much similar to that of beet and maize alcohol, with fruity notes,” explains Antoine Piccirilli, Technical and Scientific Director. Just like for all upcycled products, this solution avoids competing with agricultural food production and is part of a circular approach. The current supply capacity approaches 400,000 litres, with a large organic volume and a potential of at least 5 million litres in the long term.

Lubrizol launches sensory-enhancer natural film former and thickener,"Lubrizol Life Science Beauty (LLS Beauty) has officially launched its new Sensomer Tara polymer [1], a multifunctional, biodegradable natural film former and thickener, which was previewed at in-cosmetics 2023 in Barcelona. According to the manufacturer, at a concentration of 2%, the new ingredient can reach viscosity of 40,000 mPa∙s, enabling creation for a thicker, creamier and silkier feel in beauty formulations, including moisturizers, sunscreens, hair conditioners, styling products and color treatments. When used in skin care applications, said Lubrizol, Sensomer Tara has a silky feel with no drag or stickiness, while its creamy texture provides good pickup with no stringiness. A blind test [2] revealed a perception of the polymer being softer and less sticky during application, with reduced pilling in afterfeel. According to Lubrizol, Sensomer Tara also has a synergy with Kelco-Care diutan gum that increases the yield value, leading to robust emulsion stabilization and an even higher viscosity. When added to conditioners and hair treatments, Sensomer Tara polymer brings conditioning benefits to the fiber, while providing a smooth and easy to spread texture. In styling applications, it shows better curl retention and better smoothness feel than guar gum. In addition, it has anti-pollution properties, protecting the fiber against particle adhesion. Finally, in coloration it enables no-drip rheology for a better consumer experience. Obtained by a 100% mechanical process undertaken on the Tara (Caesalpinia Spinosa or Tara Spinosa) seed endosperm, Sensomer Tara polymer is COSMOS approved, vegan suitable and microbiome friendly. It is also readily biodegradable (according to OECD 301F), with a natural origin index of 100% (according to ISO16128)."
Silab relaunches Nutripeptides as a repairing concentrate for hair beauty,"At a time when hair care is becoming more sophisticated by adopting skin care strategies, Silab has decided to capitalize on the nourishing and protective benefits that its active ingredient Nutripeptides offers to the skin to care for the scalp and hair. Initially launched, 10 years ago, as a comprehensive anti-aging active ingredient for the skin, Nutripeptides is now finding a new position at the heart of the Skinification of the hair care offering. “The scalp is exposed daily to multiple factors (mechanical, thermal, chemical, even environmental) causing redness and irritations. These aggressions are not without consequence for the hair: it becomes dull and loses volume. The hair is thin, dry, and brittle. With awareness of this situation, hair care routines are changing in order to simultaneously consider the state of the scalp and quality of the hair,” explains Silab in a statement. Tests shave shown that Nutripeptides provides a hydrating and soothing action to the scalp after two months of treatment. Redness is significantly reduced, and the active ingredient has an anti-inflammatory effect, demonstrated in vitro by reduced IL-8 secretion. In addition, Nutripeptides improves hair quality thanks to its repairing action on the hair fiber, as demonstrated by Silab through digital imaging. The hair’s shine, density, and volume are restored. These effects are significantly perceived by volunteers from the first month of application and intensify over the months of use. Nutripeptides is a patented active ingredient recommended in all hair repair products at the amount of 0.5 to 2.5%. Available in aqueous solution, it displays a natural content of 99.4% (according to ISO 16128). It meets with international cosmetic regulations (Europe, United States, China, Japan, etc.)."
Roquette Beauté unveils a high sensorial performance plant-based thickener,"Introduced on the occasion of the Cosmet’Agora trade show, which took place in Paris on January 16 and 17, 2024, Beauté by Roquette ST 320 [1] is a plant-based versatile thickener and stabilizer designed for gels and emulsions. Sourced from non-GMO maize [2], the new ingredient is vegan suitable and biodegradable. According to Roquette Beauté, it is an easy-to-use thickener, allowing high flexibility in formulating stable cosmetics in a variety of applications and viscosity ranges. Different tests were performed to demonstrate the benefits of the new ingredient. Easy to disperse in cold or warm water, Beauté by Roquette ST 320 strongly enhances viscosity after cooking and is very stable over time in both emulsions and gels. A stabilizer of W/O emulsions (reduction of size droplets), it also has a synergistic thickening effect with emulsifiers and cationic agents, and allows an easy viscosity adjustment by modulating the concentration. Beauté by Roquette ST 320 also acts as a sensory enhancer bringing comforting and cocooning textures to cosmetic formulations. Roquette Beauté explains that as consumers become more mindful of the impact of their beauty routines on their overall well-being, the trend towards holistic beauty continues to gain momentum in the beauty and personal care market. With Beauté by Roquette ST 320, cosmetic formulators can tap into this trend by creating cosy and soft textures. “This addition to our product range is a great demonstration of our pledge to bring plant-based solutions to the cosmetics industry that meet consumers’ expectations for safer products with the right balance of nature and technology, no more no less! At Roquette we focus on high-quality, versatile, and sustainable plant-based ingredients and develop multifunctional solutions providing high performance and amazing sensorial experiences,” says Bénédicte Courel, Roquette Beauté General Manager."
PAT debuts its Exudactive line with an ingredient to repair the skin barrier,"The French company specialized in the discovery and production of rare – usually inaccessible – active plant compounds for cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and fine chemicals markets is launching HydraQueen Exudactive, a new moisturizing active ingredient dedicated to the restoration of the skin’s barrier function and the protection of sensitive skin. It has also demonstrated antioxidant and anti-radical activities, as well as antipollution and energizing benefits. Extracted from meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) roots, a traditional European medicinal plant known for its many biological properties, HydraQueen Exudactive was developed using PAT’s aeroponic growing and plant optimization techniques. According to the company, this multiplied by 82 the active ingredient’s content in secondary metabolites. In vivo and in vitro efficacy tests have demonstrated the numerous benefits of this natural active ingredient for the skin. According to PAT, HydraQueen Exudactive helps to: restore the fragile balance of the skin’s barrier function (+52% on D14); to defend the skin against pollution (TEER +17% on stressed mature skin), dehydration and environmental stress; to maintain internal hydration (+60% on day 14) and to protect against external irritants; and to repair and strengthen sensitive skin. HydraQueen Exudactive is manufactured in France, with a fully controlled production chain traced from seed to active ingredient on the PAT site. All of the company’s operations are ISO9001-2015 certified, and their horticultural activities and aeroponic cultivation in France have been awarded a High Environmental Value (HVE) level 3 seal. The aeroponics production method saves cultivated areas helps to save natural resources through a reduction of cultivated areas (and 4 annual harvests and a life expectancy of at least 3 years for plants), the reduction of water consumption by recycling 100% of the culture water (closed cycle), a zero pesticide cultivation process in a natural greenhouse, and by multiplying by 96 times the quantity of molecules collected compared to in open fields cultivation. HydraQueen Exudactive is COSMOS compatible and 100% of natural origin (as defined by ISO 16128). With the launch of HydraQueen Exudactive, PAT also debuts its new Exudactive range, the new name of the “Plant Milking” process developed by PAT. A series of other pre-launch ingredients is scheduled to add to the new range. Extracted from plants such as Rhus chinensis and Equisetum hyemale, they are also concentrated in highly active root molecules and offer different cosmetic benefits, such as anti-aging, radiance, and protection. “At PAT, our commitment to sustainable innovation is at the heart of what we do. We are committed to offering superior quality ingredients for the cosmetic industry while preserving the environment,” highlights Jean-Paul Fèvre, President of PAT. The launch of this new range is part of PAT’s new commercial strategy which is striving to resolve a significant liquidity crisis with the aim of returning to a cash-generating activity from 2025."
Berg+Schmidt launches natural thickener for transparent oils in cold-process,"At the Cosmet’Agora trade show, taking place in Paris from January 16-18, 2024, Berg+Schmidt will premiere BergaCare FG Gel – a new solution designed to thicken transparent oil formulations.  The new rheology modifier can be used for both leave-on and rinse-off products. The main advantage of the new ingredient is that it is cold processible. Berg+Schmidt says its natural thixotropic properties enable BergaCare FG Gel to optimally convert liquid oil in Jello-like textures. “While formulators can already choose between different oil thickeners on the market, none of them is cold-processible,” explains Sabrina Paltian, Manager Application Technologies at Berg+Schmidt Care Ingredients. In a context of high energy prices, “this is clearly a huge advantage,” she adds. BergaCare FG Gel can be used to create transformational textures and a variety of viscosities such as gel-to-oil products. However, to ensure that BergaCare FG Gel together with the selected oil creates a homogeneous mixture, a certain amount of shear force is required for the manufacturing process. “It is up to the formulator to decide which tool is used to generate this force. BergaCare FG Gel is highly compatible with numerous stirring devices,” says Berg+Schmidt. BergaCare FG Gel is compatible with commonly used vegetable oils and emollients. It has the ability to create different viscosities depending on the use level. This opens up a broad range of formulating options. In particular, visual appearance of the finished product can be adjusted from a transparent oil gel to dense, yet light, cream, or from fluid oil to solidified gel. “Only a few natural oil thickeners can actually create transparent systems,” highlights Sabrina Paltian. Compatibility with different plant-based emollients also helps ensure a well-received sensory experience that supports luxury skin care. “En vogue concepts like luxurious gel-to-oil textures in anhydrous, nourishing body care applications promise smooth and silky skin both during and after application. Unlike other oil products, thickened oil gels can be applied where they are needed without evaporating or becoming runny,” concludes Berg+Schmidt."
"Silab launches Myoline, an anti-stress ingredient for sublimated skin","The effect of our emotions on health, and in particular on the condition of the skin, is now well known. “As a mirror of our emotions, the face is particularly stressed and reveals stressful situations. The tension of facial muscles and the secretion of stress mediators in the skin are responsible for the premature appearance of expression wrinkles and a dull complexion,” explains Silab. In order to meet the needs of stressed skin, Silab has chosen to investigate the properties watercress, a plant highly concentrated in minerals. The result of these researches is Myoline [1], a new natural active ingredient that targets the behavioural and biological consequences of stress. Myoline has a myorelaxing action in vitro by acting on the neuromuscular junction. This efficacy is reflected in vivo by a “botox-like” effect. According to Silab, as of five days of treatment, the first expression lines of young skin are smoothed, and the wrinkles of mature skin are blurred with an effect comparable to that obtained with a retouched photo (""soft focus"" effect). Myoline also influences the secretion of well-being mediators: the oxytocin and endocannabinoid pathways of the skin are stimulated to improve skin homeostasis. The volunteers’ perception of stress is reduced, and the quality of their skin is improved: the barrier function is thus restored, hydration increased, and the radiance of the complexion enhanced. For this new launch, Silab has favoured local, traced, secure and environmentally friendly sourcing. The sourcing is part of an upcycling approach by processing watercress of a quality not used for the food sector. Furthermore, Silab is committed to supporting the watercress farm supplying the raw material in the construction of an industrial dryer, thus making it possible to control the quality of the raw materials and to diversify the farmer’s activities. The authentication of the raw material was carried out using the molecular barcoding technique, thus securing the supply. Myoline is a patented active ingredient recommended at the amount of 0.5 to 2.0%. Available in aqueous solution, it is easy to formulate. It complies with regulations on biodiversity, displays a natural content of 99.2% (ISO 16128) and meets with international cosmetic regulations (Europe, United States, China, Japan, etc.)."
Evonik to boost natural cosmetic formulations with sustainable baobab oil,"Evonik is launching a sustainable baobab oil sourced from the near Sahel region of Ghana. Named Ecohance Soft Baobab [1] the oil is refined from the non-edible seeds of the baobab fruit and can be used as a botanical emollient in a wide range of natural cosmetic formulations such as hand creams, hair conditioners and body butters. According to Evonik, Ecohance Soft Baobab has a “well-balanced composition” with an optimized low amount of triglycerides with cyclopropeonic fatty acids beside a high ratio of tocopherol. For this launch, Evonik has built a brand new supply chain, with the help of local and international partners. The seeds used for the production of the oil come from the collection of wild fruits. To guarantee the sustainability of the entire supply chain, Evonik cooperates with the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and supports the Great Green Wall Initiative. In addition, Ecohance Soft Baobab was recently certified by the FairWild Foundation to ensure that the sourcing of the baobab oil protects the local ecosystem and supports social and economic projects in the region and that the wild harvest baobab fruits are traceable down to the collector [2]. Baobab trees grow on poor soil, and tolerate heat and drought, making them essential vegetation for the Sahel and helping to prevent desertification. “Sustainability drives us and collaboration defines us! Ecohance Soft Baobab is a perfect example of how we uphold our core values of environmental and social responsibility. We’ve partnered with strong allies to build a brand-new supply chain, which allows our cosmetic customers to meet the growing demand for sustainable, high-performing natural products,” highlighted Yann d’Hervé, head of Evonik’s Care Solutions business line. Ecohance Soft Baobab is the latest addition to Evonik’s Ecohance program, which offers circular feedstocks to help the cosmetics industry move its operations and solutions into a more sustainable space through the reduction of the carbon footprint and an improved ecological and social impact along the entire value chain. Evonik’s Ecohance program was started in 2019. The launch of Ecohance Soft Baobab follows the launch of Ecohance Care PS3, an emulsifier based entirely on olive oil residues, and Ecohance Remo XP, an eco-friendly multifunctional thickener."

"Eurofragance launches Verdenix, an upcycled ingredient to fight malodour","When used with other perfumery ingredients, Verdenix acts as a booster in hand and body wash applications, as well as in dishwashing liquid products to quickly chemically eliminate foul smells. This new raw material, which was launched at the in-cosmetics Asia trade show in Bangkok earlier this month, comes hot on the heels of L’Âme du Bois, Eurofragance’s first captive ingredient dedicated to perfume creation. Actually, the two substances are closely related! “To understand Verdenix one must go back two years to the launch of L’Âme du Bois,” explains Eurofragance in a press release. L’Âme du Bois was made by upcycling the discarded sawdust of western red cedar wood (Thuja plicata), which grows in western Canada. In the process of upcycling the cedar wood oil into L’Âme du Bois, 60% of material was set aside. The R&D scientists at Eurofragance decided to take a look at this unused fraction of material. Through an eco-friendly process, they were able to transform the leftover liquid into a new ingredient. This is how Verdenix was born: an ingredient upcycled from the manufacturing process of another upcycled ingredient! Tests have shown that in just over two minutes, Verdenix renders half of the malodour molecules (of certain compounds) undetectable by GCMS analytical equipment, and that in under six minutes the malodour is virtually gone. These findings were corroborated in sensorial panel tests conducted in the company’s labs. According to Eurofragance, Verdenix controls foul smells in two complimentary ways: elimination and harmonization. In contact with certain compounds known to smell bad, Verdenix boosts their chemical elimination. In other cases, Verdenix harmonizes olfactively with the source of the malodor to reduce its perception. “Verdenix works on two fronts, rendering it effective across a broad spectrum of malodors, and it produces its desired effect at extremely low dosages. A low dosage and a naturally agreeable olfactive profile, makes it easy for Perfumers to incorporate it in their fragrance compositions,” highlights Marina Melendo, R&D Scientist and leader of the Verdenix project at Eurofragance. “The most promising attribute of Verdenix is its ability — in conjunction with other ingredients — to quickly eliminate precise types of malodors. This is what consumers want; they want to restore a sense of purity to a situation that is unpleasant to them and potentially embarrassing.” The upcycled ingredient is designed to be used in any type of product application that is positioned to combat disagreeable smells; this includes personal care products, including deos, soaps, and shower gels, as well as home care products such as cleaners, laundry detergents, or dishwashing liquids... Eurofragance plans to create scents for its customers’ with Verdenix already embedded in the fragrance formula. “This means that there are no extra steps for the manufacturer—Verdenix offers a turnkey solution,” the company concludes."
Expanscience to lead cosmetics industry towards positive impact,"As people at large have grown aware of the current environmental issues, cosmetics players – retailers, brands, ingredient suppliers and packaging manufacturers – have also been working to respond to the climate emergency. Driven by consumer demand, research and development projects are now massively focused on designing more resource-efficient, easily recycled, and readily biodegradable solutions, CSR programmes have become more elaborate, and the number of companies committed to a certification process has grown exponentially. It does not mean this will be enough, though! There really is a lot to be done. “Some companies with very interesting projects are struggling to deploy them on a large scale”, explains Armelle Le Peniec, Director of Cosmetic Actives and Ingredients at Laboratoires Expanscience. During a conference at the clean-beauty-oriented I Feel Good show held on September 19-20, 2023, in Paris, she put forward the need for collaboration towards a cosmetics industry with a positive impact. To her, the CSR approach remains extremely competitive, as can be seen with the label EcoVadis Sustainability Rating: the level obtained by companies is based on their relative environmental performance. Those that reach the top 1% with the best practices get the Platinum level, while those among the top 5% with the highest performance get the Gold level, and so on. There is no doubt this approach is efficient: making progress and keeping your level requires constant effort! “But we believe that today, CSR policies should no longer only be a differentiating element. If we want to speed up the industry’s transformation pace, we definitely need more cooperation!” emphasizes Armelle Le Peniec. “We think it will help do even better.” A few concrete inter-industry examples show the collaborative turn can be taken. The “Ferments of the Future Grand Challenge” is a programme which gathers most varied stakeholders as part of a public and private partnership, like brands in the food industry, research bodies, ingredient manufacturers, professional unions, and laboratories. Some of them work in different industries, like the Carbios consortium involved in the development of PET enzymatic recycling, which got together giants like Nestlé, Pepsico, Suntory Beverage, and L’Oréal. As for raw materials, cooperation efforts to structure responsible chains that can respond to sensitive issues are far from rare. The Sustainable Coconut Partnership and the Responsible Mica Initiative can be mentioned, among others. Some projects can also help set up good practices shared by cosmetic ingredient manufacturers, like the Traceability Alliance for Sustainable Cosmetics (TRASCE), designed to pool a platform for traceability, or the ERI label (Eco-Responsible Ingredient). Brands also cooperate! As part of the Pharma-Recharge consortium, Laboratoires Expanscience (with their brand Mustela), Garancia, La Rosée Cosmétiques, Bioderma (NAOS) and dermocosmetics specialist Pierre Fabre have decided to unite their strengths to reduce the impact of packaging with a refilling solution in pharmacies. The consortium’s brands had long got involved in the ecological transition, and some of them had even already tested their own refill solutions. Developing a sustainable, large-scale solution required going beyond a competitive approach and cooperating to agree on a refill system, a shared bottle... Projects like Pulp in Action, which is aimed to replace plastics in packaging with cellulose fibres, or the EcoBeautyScore Consortium designed to develop an evaluation and scoring system for the environmental impact of cosmetic products, are also based on the brand collaboration approach. As for the B Corp Beauty Coalition, it gathers 40 B-Corp-certified companies, including Laboratoires Expanscience, looking to implement deep changes to improve the social and environmental footprint of the cosmetics industry. “These projects involve rather different targets, structures, and governances. Some of them make progress faster than others, but they do show we are more efficient united than on our own”, adds Armelle Le Peniec. “Large-scale initiatives can even be considered on the global scale.” These collective dynamics are all the more essential since consumer demand is very strong: 86% of consumers expect brands to make commitments beyond their own products and businesses, in particular by supporting local communities, driving positives changes in society, or giving money to good causes. New generations are not content with words, they want evidence! [1] To Armelle Le Peniec, brands, distributors, and suppliers have everything to gain by developing such cooperation systems and working hand in hand for a cosmetics industry with a positive impact. And there are quite a lot of issues to work on! “It is all about final packaging, but industrial packaging will also fall into the scope of strengthened recycling regulations. Reuse could also be a solution. In the field of cosmetic actives, order volumes are usually small. Storage and transport could be pooled, and we could think about greener logistics and alternatives to air transport. Most companies have developed their own purchase charters: maybe they could be harmonized to take up best practices. Even in fields like communication or Human Resources, measures could be pooled or practices harmonized, in everyone’s interest, without jeopardizing competition, because we do need it”, she explains. With their CSR strategy and ImpACT commitment programme, Laboratoires Expanscience decided to become a regenerative company with a positive impact. As a B-Corp-certified company with a mission, Expanscience has adopted an approach based on constant progress for its different businesses, and on setting up collective dynamics within the industry. “In the field of cosmetic actives and ingredients, we have been a small, highly committed supplier for over 20 years, in particular thanks to the company’s and its brands’ impetus. Under our ImpACT programme, which we co-set up in-house with inter-branch teams, every activity has its own roadmap to 2030, which is shared and followed up by the management. We would like to obtain the Organic or Fair For Life certificates for our cosmetic actives: we aim for 50% of our ingredients, and 80% of upcycled or biomimetic ingredients. This programme goes beyond product development: it involves objectives on biodiversity preservation and on the impact of our plants, as well as HR commitments. And of course, we have a key target as regards our stakeholders, which is cooperation. It is definitely a way to lead the whole industry towards a positive impact”, she concludes."
L’Oréal and Cosmo team on low environmental footprint extraction process,"In search of more sustainable solutions for the manufacture of natural fine perfumery ingredients, Cosmo International Fragrances has developed a new method for extracting fragrance molecules from botanicals. This patent-pending technology is a waterless, low-energy, slow extraction process that “reveals the exact smell of an ingredient while preserving its integrity,” claims the company. Using only air, the new extraction technology harnesses the volatile fragrance molecules of flowers, fruits and other natural ingredients without the need for heating, cooling or chemical solvents used in conventional scent extraction. Flowers thus retain their integrity and at the end of the process, can be recycled and re-used in a second extraction, helping reduce waste. L’Oréal Groupe has secured exclusive access to this Green Sciences-based extraction process that, according to the two companies, promises to open the door to new fragrance frontiers and enlarge the fragrance-maker’s scent library to include “100% natural and pure scent extracts.” “Through this Green Sciences extraction process, we can experience the olfactive power of flowers in an authentic way, as if walking in a garden, field or forest,” said Barbara Lavernos, Deputy Chief Executive Officer in charge of Research, Innovation and Technology, L’Oréal. To kick off the collaboration, L’Oréal Groupe and Cosmo International will focus on a new tuberose floral extract for a fine fragrance to be released in 2024. “Our brands will take fine fragrance crafting to new heights by offering unprecedented olfactive authenticity, allowing natural ingredients to express their full olfactive identity like never before,” said Cyril Chapuy, President of L’Oréal Luxe. The partnership between the two companies is in line with a major trend of the fragrance market: the quest for new and unique accords obtained from methods low environmental footprint. “As the world leader in fine fragrances, embracing sustainability throughout the whole fragrance value chain is not just a choice: it’s our conviction. From ingredient sourcing to refill adoption, we are innovating at every step to reduce our impact and shift towards a more responsible fragrance model,” added Cyril Chapuy. The development of environmentally friendly extraction methods capable of providing access to new odorous molecules is one of the main fields of current research and innovation in perfumery. For instance, dsm-firmenich recently debuted new extracts from its Firgood electromagnetic extraction technology, launched in 2021, while in 2019 Symrise unveiled SymTrap, a process for capturing odorous molecules in aqueous solutions. Agenda: The main trends in the global fragrance market will be among the topics discussed at the next edition of the Fragrance Innovation Summit.

Skincare ingredient innovations celebrated at the in-cosmetics Asia Awards,"At in-cosmetics Asia, which was held on 07-09 November 2023 at the Bangkok International Trade & Exhibition Centre (BITEC), in Thailand, the expert judging panel [1] have awarded accolades for the Innovation Zone Best Active Ingredient and the Innovation Zone Best Functional Ingredient awards, plus the Spotlight On Awards. Immunight by Lucas Meyer Cosmetics has been honoured with the Gold Active Ingredient Award for its green-processed oil-soluble lavandin extract, specifically designed to reduce the effects of poor-quality sleep on skin by boosting night time skin recovery and targeting the improvement of sleep quality by inhalation of olfactory compounds. The Silver Award was awarded to Codif which impressed the judges with its Regetaste – an anti-ageing epidermal ingredient that improves skin texture and brightness. Rahn AG has received the Bronze Award for its water-based extraction of Helichrysum italicum syn angustifolium, chlorogenic acid, and di-O-caffeoylquinic acids, Perfeline, to strengthen the micro-vessels in human skin. In the Functional Ingredient Award category, Emulium Dermolea MB earned Gattefossé the Gold Award. As a plant-based O/W emulsifier, this functional ingredient offers a unique lipidic composition rich in sterols and triterpenes to reduce skin stress and bring long-term soothing. Softisan MagicPowder S by IOI Oleo scooped up the Silver Award for its cold-processable transforming ingredient allowing simple powder-to-emulsion on-the-go formulas with soft after-feel. Also highly commended for its achievements, Bentone Plus Glow won Elementis the Bronze Award, combining natural ingredients designed to impart rheological control and suspension to the oil phase of cosmetics and skin care products and promote the skin’s barrier function. in-cosmetics Asia also provided a platform for attendees to celebrate outstanding achievements through the Spotlight On Formulation Award in the Sustainable, Conscious Beauty and Love is in the Hair (Haircare) categories. The awards saw 39 entries reviewed by judges live on the show floor, marking an exciting journey to discover this year’s winners: The Bronze Award for Sustainable, Conscious Beauty went to BioSyn-Bisabolol by China-based Soho Aneco Chemicals, whilst Silver was awarded to Lotion with Neosolue-Aqulio by Japanese company, Nippon Fine Chemical.

Competition was fierce in the “Love is in the Hair” (haircare) category with two Gold Award winners announced: Burgeon-Up(HS) by Ichimaru Pharcos from Japan took the first accolade for a product that, according to one of the judges was, “a great topical cosmos option for hair greying, with a dual function for anti-hair loss and anti-grey hair”. Azelis was awarded Gold for its Detox Scalp Butter Mask, referred to by the judges as a “really trendy, easy to use multifunctional with a lovely end formula and texture.”"
Prickly pear seed oil: a high potential ingredient?,"Grown on a large scale in North Africa - mainly in the Maghreb (Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria...), southern Europe (Portugal, Spain, Italy...) and certain South American countries (Mexico, Chile, Brazil...) the prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica), also known as nopal, has become, in just a few years, a star ingredient in natural cosmetic formulations! In this era of global warming, this low-water consumption plant, which grows on soils that are not always suitable for other crops, offers many advantages. ""Except for its spines, from which nothing can be obtained for the moment, the entire plant can be used and valorised: fruit, seeds, flowers, etc,"" explains Lémia Chekir Thabet, National Coordinator of the Pampat Project, implemented by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). ""More than half of our producers export, and 95% of these exports involve prickly pear seed oil: 95% in bulk and 5% in the form of packaged products. 70% of this production is sent to Europe, mainly France, to the cosmetics industry. The ever-growing success of prickly pear seed oil lies in its many anti-ageing properties, which we have demonstrated in a clinical study [1]. Prickly pear oil has long been used by North African women on their skin, hair and nails,"" she points out. For Émilie Jolibois, Head of Cosmetic Ingredients & Plant Extracts at Aroma-Zone, prickly pear seed oil is ""one of the best vegetable oils for combating skin ageing."" In fact, this ingredient has been available for years in the brand’s boutiques and has significantly contributed to its popularity in France. ""Prickly pear seed oil has been hailed as an excellent moisturiser and anti-ageing ingredient because of its beneficial nutrient content for the skin. It is rich in linoleic acid (omega-6), tocopherols (vitamin E) and, in particular, phytosterols and polyphenols,"" explains Elisa Louveau, R&D Project Manager at Typology. ""That’s why at Typology we offer an organic vegetable oil that we receive from a Moroccan producer. On its own, it already gives very good results. We combine it with other actives in two other anti-ageing formulas,"" she adds. But the elixir comes at a price - an average of EUR 350 per litre when it leaves the Tunisian factories - because the production process is ""long and complex,"" explains Sandy Boget, founder of the Sand Rarity brand, which uses it - in its organic version - as the flagship ingredient in its four products. ""It takes an average of thirty kilos of prickly pear seeds, or almost a tonne of fruit, to extract a litre of oil. What’s more, to retain all the goodness contained in the seeds, it’s essential to extract them cold and not to add any solvents,"" she points out. Fruit, seeds, flowers, cladodes (also known as pads), young leaves, the skin of the fruit... everything can be used from the prickly pear, with the exception of the spines and the inedible part of the pad. Weleda uses the young shoots in its 24-hour Hydrating Cream for their polyphenol, sugar and mineral content. Aroma-Zone is also interested in the cladodes. ""Our dietary supplement Organic Fat Catcher is made from cladodes powder, known for its high fibre content and its action on the absorption of fats and sugars,"" emphasises Émilie Jolibois. ""Producers use the fruit and flowers to make different liquids with varying virtues. It’s important not to mistake prickly pear seed oil for oily macerate. The latter is obtained by macerating the flowers and/or fruit of the tree in a neutral oil, usually refined sunflower oil, while the seed oil is obtained by pressing the seeds. The essential oil, on the other hand, is obtained by chemical extraction, when the powdered prickly pear seeds are pulverised and then added to a solvent such as hexane,"" details Lémia Chekir Thabet. The field of possible applications therefore still seems very wide! Particularly as Opuntia ficus-indica, which thrives on poor soil and is highly resistant to heat and drought, is also of interest to the agri-food and pharmaceutical industries."

"Inclusium, Silab’s new multifunctional active ingredient for all skin types","The French manufacturer of natural cosmetic active ingredients has strived to meet consumers’ common expectations in terms of skin beauty. To sketch the outline of this universal beauty, Silab identified the main skin characteristics of consumers around the world based on their ethnicity, gender and age. This study made it possible to identify three main expectations: – a beautiful skin quality, characterized by skin hydration and fine skin texture for a smoothed microrelief;
– an even and radiant complexion, free from spots related to post-inflammatory scars and skin aging;
– reduced signs of aging thanks to firmer skin and faded wrinkles. And Silab claims to have found in alfalfa what it takes to satisfy these demands. To develop the new multifunctional patented active ingredient, the company has used the seeds of alfalfa, sourced from selected certified organic farms in France, to extract their galactomannans and create Inclusium [1], an active ingredient offering hydra-smoothing and complexion perfecting benefits. Silab leveraged its expertise in tissue engineering and in transcriptomics to explore the transversal activity spectrum of Inclusium on the biological pathways essential for epidermal and dermal functions. A large-scale exploratory study established that Inclusium stimulates epidermal functionalities by modulating the biological pathways related to the physical and water barrier, the immune barrier, and the anchoring of the epidermis to the dermis. Furthermore, according to Sliab, it reinforces the dermal matrix quality by boosting the synthesis of collagen I and reducing the synthesis of MMP-1. The efficacy of Inclusium has been demonstrated on various panels, including mixed gender groups with young and mature, Caucasian, Asian, Latin-American, and Afro-American panels. Five clinical studies were therefore conducted, showing a hydra-smoothing, complexion-perfecting and anti-wrinkle effect as of 7 days of application. Available in aqueous solution, Inclusium is recommended at a dose of 0.5 to 2.5%. The patented ingredient complies with biodiversity regulations and has a natural origin content of 99.2% (ISO 16128). It complies with international cosmetics regulations (Europe, USA, China, Japan, etc.)."
Perfumes: dsm-firmenich expands its palette with new Firgood extracts,"Firmenich, which merged with the Dutch company DSM in May 2023, is continuing to explore more environmentally friendly processes. After pioneering SFE extraction in 1995, a technique that uses CO2 compressed to a supercritical fluid state, the company has been developing a different approach since 2021, using the water contained in biomass as a medium to extract its odorous components. Firgood was born out of a simple idea. The technique consists of two phases. In the first stage, the biomass from the collection of flowers or other types of plants (vegetables, fruit or even spices) is moistened beforehand. It is then heated briefly by electromagnetic vibrations. ""Under the action of electromagnetic waves, water molecules come into friction and explode, releasing their aromatic notes,"" explains Fabrice Pellegrin, Senior Perfumer and Director of Innovation and Development, Natural Products at dsm-firmenich. ""The time of exposure to the waves is reduced, avoiding prolonged thermal shock, which preserves the plants’ fragile components while respecting their naturalness,"" he adds. In a second stage, this extract undergoes another technological process to separate the water from the aromatic molecules. ""Today, dsm-firmenich can offer more than twenty fully developed Firgood extracts,"" says Fabrice Pellegrin. ""These new products open up a whole new world of possibilities. This technique can be applied to fragile ingredients such as flowers, which until now were considered ""silent"", but also to fruits and vegetables, such as green peppers. It can also provide perfumers with new olfactory profiles coming from classic raw materials but with new facets."" So, compared to the traditional absolute, jasmine grandiflorum pays Firgood is given a new airy lightness free of animalic notes, as if it had just been placed in the basket at harvest time. Lavandin pays Firgood is reminiscent of the freshly-picked flower rubbed in the palm of your hands, and loses its camphorated note, while ginger Firgood reveals its fresh, lively facets. Fame by Paco Rabanne is the first fragrance to include jasmine grandiflorum pays Firgood in its composition. The brand describes it as ""a jasmine of exceptional purity."" The extracts prepared at the plant are submitted to the perfumers for approval at ""Masters’ meetings."" Honorine Blanc, Olivier Cresp, Nathalie Lorson and Alberto Morillas then meet at the Villa Botanica in Grasse, recently inaugurated by dsm-firmenich. By expressing their expectations as they work to create a fragrance, the master perfumers are directly involved in the research and development process. ""For instance, we decided to develop a green pepper Firgood. This extract is very interesting because it complements the palette of ingredients by developing a green, attractive and modern olfactory profile, which is not the case with all natural green ingredients, which can often be harsh,"" details Fabrice Pellegrin, who is at the origin of these regular meetings. The Firgood innovation was born out of a desire to avoid the use of volatile solvents, which are used in conventional extraction techniques. ""Electromagnetic extraction uses no petrochemical solvents, simply water. The residues from the extracted biomass are easier to reuse because they contain no solvents. They can be recycled or extracted again to produce extracts with a complementary olfactory profile, reinforcing the sustainability of this revolutionary technology,"" emphasises Fabrice Pellegrin. What’s more, the use of electromagnetic waves reduces the amount of time perfume plants are exposed to heating, which saves energy. In the case of lavandin, its extraction takes just 15 minutes, instead of the 55 minutes needed for a traditional distillation process. A Firgood presentation is scheduled at the Fragrance Innovation Summit on 30 November 2023. Details and registration: www.fragranceinnovation.com."
"Calybiota Bio, Expanscience’s prebiotic active ingredient fights body odor","Previously known for rebalancing intimate flora, Calybiota® Bio reinforces its ""well-being"" focus with new results for the axillary flora. The deodorant market is booming. It is forecasted to reach USD 119.24 billion by 2030, growing by 5.58 % over the period 2023 to 2030 [1]. The “skinification” trend in deodorant is real, with differentiation based on ingredient quality, naturalness and, above all, efficacy. Globally, natural claims in deodorants have been rising year on year. With the emphasis on natural ingredients, another point to consider is sustainable sourcing and the impact on biodiversity when cultivating and processing such ingredients. That is why Calybiota Bio meets market demand: a 100% natural and COSMOS-certified active ingredient, with sustainable sourcing and, above all, proven efficacy in vitro & ex vivo. Calybiota Bio is the perfect opportunity ingredient to develop natural deodorant formulations that respect and support a healthy equilibrium of the axillary microbiome. The skin is colonized by billions of bacteria that participate in the regulation of immunity and barrier functions, preserving the microbiota homeostasis are essential to maintain a healthy skin. The number of bacteria and their diversity guarantee this balance and proper functioning of the skin’s microbiota. When these parameters change, dysbiosis (imbalance) occurs and undesirable bacteria can colonize the skin, reducing its barrier function against aggression. This imbalance is at the root of a number of well-known dermatological problems and pathologies, such as perspiration odours, acne, atopic dermatitis… Concerning the human axillary region, the two predominant bacterial species presents are Staphylococci (such as S. epidermidis), known as mostly skin-friendly species and Corynebacteria (in particular C. xerosis and C. striatum), which are responsible for unpleasant odors [2]. In-vitro studies showed that Calybiota Bio reduces the unpleased axillary odors, with a significant inhibition of the C. xerosis adhesion to a skin explant surface, and the reduction of the sweat odors produced by C. striatum. This beneficial effect has been confirmed by a clinical study with 1.5% of Calybiota Bio (vs placebo) conducted on 27 men with a perspiration odor (intensity 4 or more on a 0-10 scale). A microbiome analysis on the axillary flora allows to demonstrate the beneficial prebiotic effect of Calybiota Bio by increasing the ratio of Staphylococcus over Corynebacterium after 27 days. Moreover, the presence of Calybiota Bio in the deodorant did not impact the bacteria diversity and/or quantity over the study, preserving the integrity of the microbiome. According a national “What Makes America Sweat” survey [3] in 2023, that uncovered the nationwide impact of sweating on people’s well-being: of the 68% Americans who experience heavy sweat, 75% say it affects their self-confidence, and 80% would live their lives differently if they didn’t have to worry about sweat. But, contrary to popular belief, sweat is naturally almost entirely odorless. Axillary odors development is linked to the transformation of odorless secretions into volatile odoriferous molecules by the flora microorganisms. Different factors can influence the secretion’s quality & quantity and the bacteria present: age, sex, genetic factors, environment, hygiene, cosmetics... Analysis of a T-shirt worn 24 hours by the men revealed that Calybiota Bio reduces the total quantity of VOCs by -56.8% [4] compared to the placebo. By taking a closer look at the results, Calybiota Bio decreases acetic acid (odor of vinegar) by -50.9% [5], butyric acid (odor of vomit/rancid) by -58.2% [6] and valeric acid (odor of smelly socks or feet) by -65.2% [7]. As a microbiome-friendly and prebiotic active ingredient, Calybiota Bio is able to rebalance the axillary flora for an anti-bad odor effect. Calybiota Bio is a unique opportunity ingredient to develop natural efficient deodorant. By protecting microbiota flora, Calybiota Bio helps women & men feel good and comfortable in their intimacy.

Eco-designed hybrid polymers combining sensoriality and naturality,"Today’s consumers want their lifestyles and the products they use to reflect their values: 30% of them are ready to pay more for an environmentally-friendly cosmetic product (Mintel). The clean beauty trend was born to meet this growing need. However, 46% of consumers do not understand the difference between a natural and a ""clean"" product (Mintel), pointing to the subjectivity and lack of standardization of the definition of ""clean beauty"". This is how ""conscious beauty"" gradually came into being. Based on criteria similar to those of clean beauty, it also integrates the dimension of minimalism, multi-functionality of ingredients, renewable, natural and biodegradable resources. 47% of consumers claim to use fewer cosmetic products to achieve a more sustainable effect, and 29% are even prepared to buy multifunctional products to consume less but better (Mintel). To meet this growing demand, the cosmetics market has therefore worked on its offer with more natural ingredients, while guaranteeing respect for the skin and the environment, as well as a pleasant sensorial experience. To meet the expectations of conscious beauty, Seppic offers a range of eco-designed hybrid polymers: SEPILIFE™ G305 (INCI: Acrylamide/Sodium - Acryloyldimethyl - Taurate Copolymer - C15-19 Alkane - Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate - Polyglycerin-10) et SEPILIFE™ NUDE (INCI: Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer - C15-19 Alkane - Polyglyceryl-6 Laurate - Polyglycerin-6) The SEPILIFE™ range offers alternatives to synthetic polymers, possessing a high percentage of naturality (according to ISO 16 128) and guaranteeing thickening properties similar to those of synthetic polymers. They are also inherently biodegradable (OECD 301B). They belong to a new generation of rheology modifiers based on inverse emulsion polymerization. To guarantee high technical performance, the petrochemical polymer backbone has been retained. At the same time, the other components have been selected for their natural origin, with the aim of meeting the need for a more eco-conscious formulation, while maintaining the desired efficacy and sensoriality. In addition to naturalness and biodegradability, the range of hybrid polymers also enables energy savings. Thanks to their ability to be cold processable, the heating step is no longer necessary during formula preparation. Energy savings of up to 93%, as well as time savings of 73% compared with a formulation requiring a heating step, have been measured with the use of SEPILIFE™ G305. Finally, Seppic’s range of hybrid polymers offers multiple properties, facilitating the formulation of ""multifunctional"" products and thus meeting consumer expectations in the conscious beauty market. In addition to their thickening properties, which make it possible to obtain sprayable, fluid to thick formulas, they possess emulsifying-stabilizing properties, helping to formulate and stabilize vegetable oils in emulsions. In fact, vegetable oils are often used as emollients in formulas with a high naturality index. These properties make them highly valued ingredients in formulations for all kinds of applications: hair care, skin care, sun care and make-up. A multitude of possible applications and textures, to meet every need. Seppic’s hybrid polymers offer differentiating sensorial properties to meet the varied needs of consumers. SEPILIFE™ G305 offers easy spreadability, excellent pick-up as well as a soft finish after application. In the EU07737 formula, SEPILIFE™ G305 adds texture and stabilises the cream gel without emulsifiers and provides a soft touch to the skin. As for SEPILIFE™ NUDE, it offers a nude sensation, with a natural finish. The presence of SEPILIFE™ NUDE in the formula also activates positive emotions, for sensory benefits after the formula is applied. It enables the formulation of a wide variety of textures, such as a thick cream, with the AS40154 formula. It offers a quick-break effect during the application, and a natural, fresh, non-sticky finish on the skin."
Algaktiv: Upcycled microalgae for collagen boost and skin transformation,"Presented this week at the in-cosmetics Latin America trade show, in São Paulo, Algaktiv Collage was crafted from Vegan Collagen Peptides and Spermidine derived from resilient extremophile microalgae named Hematococcus pluvialis. This microalgae, which thrives in the harshest environments of Iceland, has the remarkable ability to change its own biochemistry when subjected to strong environmental stress, producing Astaxanthin, a red nutraceutical antioxidant. In Iceland, the purest and most sustainable Astaxanthin is obtained through the cultivation of Hematococcus pluvialis in enclosed photobioreactors powered by 100% renewable geothermal energy. The oil-soluble nutraceutical Astaxanthin is extracted from the stressed microalgae, leaving a water-soluble fraction behind that was previously considered waste. Algaktiv has developed in Barcelona an innovative process to upcycle the Astaxanthin-depleted Hematococcus pluvialis “waste”, giving it new life. Algaktiv Collage harnesses the power of vegan, upcycled peptides, standardized in glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline. These peptides serve as the building blocks for native collagen production, promoting skin firmness and elasticity. Additionally, Algaktiv Collage features Spermidine, a natural booster of collagen synthesis in the skin, further enhancing its rejuvenating effects. ""At Algaktiv, we are driven by a passion for developing high-performance skincare solutions that deliver remarkable results while prioritizing sustainability,"" states Jordi Ayats, Product Development Director. ""Algaktiv Collage represents the culmination of our deep understanding of skin biology and the evolving needs of consumers worldwide."" In vitro tests demonstrate that Algaktiv Collage boosts native collagen production in the dermis, resulting in a remarkable increase of up to 27.96% with Collage 0.5% and 40.37% with Collage 1%. Algaktiv Collage delivers hydration benefits comparable to hyaluronic acid, with a significant boost of 34% at 0.5%. According to Algaktiv, the combination of 0.5% Hyaluronic acid +0.5% Algaktiv Collage increases hydration by almost 60%. The clinical evaluations also showcase the transformative effects of the new active ingredient on the skin. A study conducted with 1% Algaktiv Collage revealed its ability in restructuring the skin from within and shaping the 3D matrix. After 7 days, firmness and plumping improved by 2.2 and 3.4 times, respectively, while moisturization showed a remarkable threefold improvement after 28 days. The reduction in wrinkles was visually significant. A study conducted at 2% demonstrated Algaktiv Collage’s ability to provide full-day hydration. Within just 1 hour of application, hydration levels increased by nearly 30% compared to a placebo’s 7%. This superior performance was maintained for 24 hours. The third clinical evaluation, conducted at 3% Algaktiv Collage, showcased unprecedented results, with a remarkable hydration increase of 35% after only 10 minutes, a significant improvement compared to the placebo. Inner skin images depicted intense and long-lasting hydration lasting up to 24 hours.

BASF enhances sunscreens’ sensorial performance with Tinomax CC,"Designed to meet the growing demand for more natural skin and sun care solutions BASF’s new Tinomax CC [1] is a functionalized natural-based particle derived from calcium carbonate and hydroxyapatite. It is of 100% natural origin content according to ISO 16128 criteria and does not contain preservatives. According to the cosmetic ingredients manufacturer, Tinomax CC enhances UV protection with SPF and UVA via light birefringence. Beyond the functional performance, tests have shown that formulations containing Tinomax CC tend to be significantly less sticky and greasy during application than formulations without this ingredient. Thanks to its homogeneous particle shape, the new ingredient significantly improves the sensory performance of sun care formulations, especially at higher SPFs. Furthermore, Tinomax CC does create any unpleasant whitish effect when applied to the skin. The multifunctional ingredient is in the form of an off-white powder. BASF recommends Tinomax CC for formulations containing soluble organic UV filters as well as those containing particles dispersed in the oil phase. “With Tinomax CC, we’re giving our customers the opportunity to meet the growing demands of the sun care market,” said Ulrich Issberner, Director Market Development Sun Care / HBO Europe at BASF. “Alongside our high-performance UV filters and natural-based emollients, emulsifiers and polymers, the new product, which is derived from natural sources, is another step toward the advanced formulations of tomorrow. I’m delighted that we can take this path together with our customers.”"

"Uplevity e-Lift, Lubrizol’s peptide that mimics microcurrent device effects","The new Uplevity e-Lift peptide is described as a high-performing and sustainable tetrapeptide inspired by microcurrent devices. According to Lubrizol Life Science Beauty (LLS Beauty), the new active ingredient mimics the benefits of electrical stimulation on the skin for an upper face lifted appearance and reduced visibility of wrinkles. A way to blur the lines between traditional topical applications and electronic skincare devices. “Today’s consumers want to achieve a new beauty aesthetic that blends the physical and digital worlds. This new ‘phygital’ aesthetic emphasizes facial sculpting and is achieved by reshaping the face, raising the cheekbones and bringing increased attention to the eyes. Uplevity e-Lift peptide helps achieve this phygital aesthetic by mimicking the effect of microcurrent devices on the skin,” said Lubrizol Beauty in a statement. In vitro, the result is increased collagen contraction and improved mitochondrial function, resulting in firmer skin and better muscle tone, similar to microcurrent stimulation. In clinical tests, Lubrizol Beauty shown that after one month of treatment with the active ingredient, “volunteers achieved a microcurrent-like upper face lifted appearance” via a “triorbital” skin lift (supraorbital eyebrow and eyelid lift, orbital crow’s feet lift, and infraorbital upper cheek lift). Volunteers also presented a minimized appearance of wrinkles and a 13.1% reduction in wrinkle length in seven days, comparable to a commercial microcurrent device. Available for skincare applications, formulations or rejuvenating solutions, Uplevity e-Lift peptide is an extension of the Uplevity peptide range, with the original material helping to reshape the lower face contour."
"Silab launches Revilience, a new active ingredient for skin radiance","For this new patented natural active ingredient, dedicated to the vitality of deficient skin, Silab took advantage of the adaptation capabilities of a bacteria living in symbiosis with ginseng. Indeed, Ginseng is known to cause numerous changes and deficiencies in its environment, impacting the availability of nutrients, especially nitrogen. To survive in this hostile environment, the Sphingomonas panaciterrae bacterium, present in the ginseng rhizosphere, deploys protective mechanisms via the production of sphingane-type Exopolysaccharides (EPS). It exhibits for itself and its host bio-protective and bio-stimulant properties, granting it an incredible ""vitality capital."" These are the characteristics that Silab has chosen to enhance in its new active ingredient, Revilience. The French company has developed a biotechnological process of controlled nitrogen deficiency applied to Sphingomonas panaciterrae, which doubled its EPS production compared with a non-deficient process. “Coupled with a specific enzymatic hydrolysis, this unique bio-inspired approach resulted in an active ingredient composed of oligosphinganes of interest, capable of improving the metabolism of skin lacking vitality,” said Silab in a statement. To highlight the pathways of action, Silab relied on transcriptomics and, thanks to an unprecedented modelling study, the manufacturer has established the gene mapping of skins subjected to nutritional deficiency (growth factor depletion) or physiological deficiency (aging). These two deficiency conditions revealed a common degradation of epidermal cell metabolism and protection mechanisms. According to Silab, by reactivating these biological pathways in deficient skin, Revilience restores the skin’s ""vitality signature"". Cellular metabolism is thus stimulated, and the quality of the cutaneous barrier reinforced. Tested at 2.5% on young and mature Caucasian volunteers, the active ingredient enhances complexion radiance and improves hydration as early as seven days after treatment. Silab recommends Revilience in all skincare products for skin lacking vitality at a dose of 0.5 to 2.5%. Available in an aqueous solution, it has a natural origin content of 98.8% (ISO 16128)."
Givaudan debuts ScalpSure to combat hair and scalp malodours,"According to Givaudan, 61% of people across the globe are concerned by sweat or scalp malodour [1]. To answer this prevalent demand, the company has developed ScalpSure, a new technology that has been added to its Zap portfolio (their cross categories solutions platform addressing malodour). Givaudan explains that the development of ScalpSure included consumers from the earliest stage of the research. Indeed, Givaudan’s malodour research teams, which are based in the group’s Health & Well-being Centre of Excellence in Ashford, UK, have collected samples from consumers’ hair to perform a headspace analysis and develop a realistic scalp malodour model. With this odour reconstitution serving as an accurate framework from which Givaudan’s perfumers screened the behaviour of perfumery ingredients and fragrance formulas, to ascertain the best solutions to efficiently counteract the build-up of malodours on the scalp. “The highly consumer-centric approach of ScalpSure ensures an enhanced understanding of the malodour challenges on the scalp and improved awareness of how best to design solutions,” said Jessica Jiang, Personal Care Senior Creative Fragrance Manager at Givaudan. The efficiency of ScalpSure in counteracting malodour has been assessed through a “holistic validation methodology” that involved olfactive experts, sensory panellists, and consumers themselves, through home-use tests led on a cross-regional level. “The challenge in designing an effective hair care fragrance is to create a beautiful scent that both delights consumers while simultaneously addressing their concerns. The fragrance should provide an impactful and enjoyable fragrant experience while effectively suppressing scalp malodour. The ScalpSure design aid supports perfumers in shaping tailor-made fragrances capable of successfully banishing unwanted smells on the scalp. By combining hedonic and performance criteria, ScalpSure fragrance guidelines offer perfumers an innovative tool to ensure consumer satisfaction,” concluded Sophie Rhodes, Personal Care Senior Perfumer at Givaudan."
Plant-powered performance in deodorant application,"Roquette Beauté is emphasizing its leading position in the sustainable beauty sphere and focusing on its range of high-quality, versatile, 100% plant-based ingredients in the deodorant category combining high performance and amazing sensorial experiences to match consumers’ expectations! Body odors make us all uncomfortable, and let’s be honest, we all face it! They are caused by natural bacteria that are present all over the body, including the armpits. Some people naturally sweat more or less than others, but it is not the secretion of sweat that causes the smell; it is when the odorless sweat mixes with bacteria. Once the bacteria on your skin mixes with the sweat, the creation of volatile malodorous compounds causes an odor. Body odor also can vary from person to person with specific organoleptic properties; one person can sweat excessively but not smell, whereas another because of the type of bacteria on his skin can generate bad odors (sweet, sour, tangy, or like onions). Deodorants are designed to effectively absorb sweat and mask odor while providing a pleasant sensory experience. Roquette Beauté Solutions in Deodorant Answer Consumers’ Demand for Safe and Plant-Based Ingredients. Absorption of Sweat It is important to absorb sweat to limit the sweat to mix with bacteria. For this, our ingredient Beauté by Roquette® ST 005 zea mays starch can absorb sweat and is as efficient as talc while being COSMOS approved with a natural index of 1 (ISO 16128) offering consumers a safe and natural alternative.

Scent of luxury in India: Madurai’s jasmine infuses global perfumes,"Heady scents fill the air as skilled pickers in India pluck white jasmine before the still fresh buds are rushed for processing into a valuable ingredient for global perfumes. Jasmine only issues its powerful scent when it blooms at night, and pickers must select only the ones yet to open. ""We know which one to pick,"" said Malarkodi, who gave only one name, as she snapped her fingers carefully to pluck the buds, tucking into her hair a few flowers that had already bloomed. ""There is no use of these... but I like the smell,"" she said. Jasmine’s fragrant flowers have been used for millennia in India to honour the gods, but now the scent is an also key part of world-famous perfumes. In the ancient city of Madurai in southern India, jasmine is omnipresent — attracting buyers from some of the world’s most recognisable perfumes, including J’adore by Dior and Mon Guerlain by Guerlain. ""It is one of the most expensive oils in the world,"" said Raja Palaniswamy, a director of Jasmine Concrete, which squeezes vast quantities of jasmine to create a few precious drops of delicious-smelling essence. The women picking the buds earn around USD1.50 a day per day for about four to five kilograms — with each kilogram made up of around 4,000 buds. Once picked, the jasmine is rushed to market, selling for anything between 200 and 2,000 rupees (USD 2.40- USD24) a kilogram on special days. The jasmine of Madurai, an Asian variety with the scientific name Jasminum Sambac, was given a ""geographical indication"" tag from the World Intellectual Property Organization in 2013, which noted its “deep fragrance"". ""It is lush, it is rich, it is vibrant,"" said Thierry Wasser, perfumer at French beauty house Guerlain, speaking to AFP while visiting the jasmine operators. The jasmine in Madurai has a ""smoothness... and something floral which is immutable,"" Wasser added. Wasser sources the jasmine oil he uses from Palaniswamy’s company. As well as Guerlain, Palaniswamy said his company sells jasmine oil to companies including Bulgari, Dior and Lush. In Madurai, the bright, white flower can be found in the homes of the city’s residents, as strings fastened by women to their hair — and in the sprawling 14th-century complex of the Hindu goddess Meenakshi, considered the guardian of the city. Meenakshi is depicted holding a parrot, a bird associated with love. Every night, people surround a shrine of the goddess with fragrant jasmine flowers as she retires with her husband Shiva in a grand, symbolic ceremony. ""When you understand that the purpose of this flower is the celebration of love and brotherhood and family and friendship; when you smell it, it takes another dimension,"" Wasser said. ""And to me this flower is the expression of love."" The women who pluck the jasmine — be it for their deity, weddings, funerals or expensive perfumes -– have no time to romance its appeal. In a jasmine field on the outskirts of the ancient city, women tenderly move the branches of the bush, looking for the perfect bud. Once jasmine has been harvested, the process to extract the oil requires long hours of labour. The processing factory runs around the clock in harvest season, with workers raking out fresh-picked flowers and waiting for the oblong-shaped buds to bloom. ""The minute it starts blooming, it starts emitting its fragrance,"" Palaniswamy said. Late in the night, as the jasmine’s sweet scent fills the air, workers collect the blooms and load them into extractors. The freshly picked jasmine is immersed in a solvent to absorb the fragrance molecules to give a waxy extract called concrete. The concrete is further processed with alcohol to remove the waxes carefully, which then results in a potent absolute. This absolute becomes the ingredient in perfumes. Around 700 kilograms of fresh jasmine is reduced to just one kilogram of oil, selling for around USD4,200, Palaniswamy said. But Amsavalli Karuppuswamy, who runs a stall outside the flower market where she threads flowers into garlands, said the fresh jasmine will always outweigh any oil. ""I will continue to do this job till I die... women like jasmine, so that is why we are doing this,"" she said. ""The scents are not worth as much as the original jasmine flowers — nothing can match the real fragrance of the jasmine."""
Lubrizol launches new rheology modifier Carbopol SC-800,"Carbopol SC-800 polymer [1] is a polyacrylic acid designed to make thickening and stabilizing cleansers. It has been balanced with crosslinker levels, hydrophobic content and surface modification to increase its efficiency and ease of processing for challenging surfactant systems. According to Lubrizol Life Science Beauty (LLS Beauty), Carbopol SC-800 polymer has the best thickening efficiency, clarity and suspension properties in studies comparing it to other hydrophobically-modified polymers. “This allows formulators the versatility to create unique aesthetics in their skin cleansing formulations, including suspending natural beads, scrubs and other cleansing elements with ease and confidence,” said the company in a statement. Foam generation studies also showed that the new polymer doesn’t negatively impact foam quality, both in the foam volume generated and its foam morphology. As a result, formulations have the lather quality consumers look for in rinse-off beauty solutions. Lubrizol’s new rheology modifier solution is therefore ideal for shower gels, shampoos and facial cleansers."
BASF upgrades its pore-tightening cosmetic active ingredient Laricyl,"Laricyl [1], an extract from the Fomes officinalis mushroom, has been a staple in BASF’s portfolio of cosmetic active ingredients for pore refinement for 20 years. In an effort to align its actions towards more sustainable practices, the company has developed a new production method for this tried-and-tested substance. Thus, BASF now produces the mycelium, the vegetative part of the fungus, by solid-state fermentation. This more sustainable method replaces the harvesting of the mushroom from the wild. The production of the mycelium, that is now organic certified, is carried out in Europe on solid medium within a controlled incubation room. The new version of Laricyl is 99.7% from natural origin according to ISO 16128. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, split-face and randomized study with 25 female subjects, the revised version of Laricyl showed its ability to improve the appearance of pores in size and number at a concentration of 3%. Image analysis showed that it minimized the appearance of visible pores immediately after application 2.8 times better than the previous version of the ingredient, with an astringent effect. According to BASF, the active ingredient also helped to remove excess oil from the skin, making it less shiny without drying it out. “We continuously revise our portfolio to produce even more sustainably. Of course, this should not be at the expense of performance,” said Lucilene Veira Nunes, Head of Business Management for Bioactive Ingredients, EMEA. “With Laricyl, we have now succeeded in making cultivation of the raw material more sustainable, while at the same time improving the results of the ingredient on immediate pore tightening, skin mattifying and moisturization.” This new development is part of BASF’s Responsibly Active program for its bioactives portfolio. Among other things, the program seeks to have 100% of botanical supply chains traceable to the source and sustainably sourced as well as 50% organic certified by 2030. The programme also includes measures to reduce climate impact."
100% plant-based rheological modifier for highly-sensorial formulations,"Anticipating the future of beauty more than 10 years ago, Seppic has designed the SOLAGUM™ range to allow formulators to create natural and sustainable beauty concepts to answer the demand for a better living and a conscious beauty. Among the range, SOLAGUM™ TARA (INCI: Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum) is a natural and sustainable solution to thicken and boost the  sensory experience of more  natural formulation SOLAGUM™ TARA is a high-purity polysaccharide derived from renewable and secured Tara seeds, non chemically modified that is 100% natural and readily biodegradable according respectively to ISO 16128 and OECD 301F. It is obtained with a mechanical process by grinding the seed tissue, that guarantees an unaltered food grade quality ingredient and enables COSMOS and NATRUE certifications. The Seppic’s Tara gum is in essence a non-microplastic polymer that widens the field of possibilities in cosmetics at a time of strong regulations and high-challenging formulation. SOLAGUM™ TARA is a polymer of choice for medium to thick consistencies in natural formulas, for boosting viscosity effect and very nice sensory. On one hand, it is a suitable solution to design natural, unctuous creamy consistent textures with elegant and comfortable skin-feel. In addition, it delivers a more satisfying sensory with no sticky nor stringy effect compared to the Xanthan gum, a reference ingredient among gum-based thickeners. On the other hand, from a performance point of view, it is more than a simple alternative to common natural thickeners as SOLAGUM™ TARA offers a high viscosity in emulsion and aqueous gel compared to other gum-based thickeners. SOLAGUM™ TARA also displays very stable viscosity over pH variations, allowing to formulate in very acidic media, as well as in basic media. In addition, Seppic’s Tara gum provides a decisive advantage to formulators: a high resistance to electrolytes, making it particularly suitable for chassis formulas. Even when enriched with active ingredients, the formulas maintain a constant viscosity (tested with up to 2% NaCl). Finally, thanks to its non-ionic profile, SOLAGUM™ TARA is widely compatible with the majority of cosmetic ingredients enabling the design of versatile cosmetic applications. SOLAGUM™ TARA is a polymer of choice as texture enhancer for many kinds of cosmetic application. For example, taking advantage of the well-known agrofood interaction between Xanthan and Tara gums, Seppic offers advanced synergy when combining SOLAGUM™ TARA with SOLAGUM™ AX (INCI: Acacia Senegal Gum and Xanthan Gum) to lower the total dose of polymer whilst enhancing the texture and stability, regardless of the type of formula : aqueous gels, cream-gels or emulsions. This combination is also easier to disperse than a mix of xanthan gum and Seppic’s Tara gum, making the formulation easier. Moreover, SOLAGUM™ TARA is a great ally for hair care products.  With high thickening power, it demonstrates equivalent performance to Hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) - inherently biodegradable polymer commonly used in hair with a low naturality degree - while offering a better profile in terms of naturalness and sensoriality. In a more minimalist formulation approach, SOLAGUM™ TARA is also an ally of choice for hair formulas because, in addition to thickening, it plays a role in controlling volume and frizz in curly hair care. In this way, at Seppic, offering solutions to design conscious formulation and sensory experience is key. Seppic continually expands its portfolio of ingredients meeting the expectations of tomorrow’s beauty through conscious innovation."
Seppic: A biomimetic and eco-designed active ingredient for skin firmness,"Seppic completes its anti-aging offer for mature skin with a new biomimetic anti-sagging ingredient: Sagacious [1]. To create this innovation, the French manufacturer took its inspiration from nature; more precisely from the behaviour of plants in the international space station. Indeed, to maintain their integrity in zero gravity, plants growing in the station synthesize specific molecules from the glycolipids family, SQDGs (sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerols). Seppic has successfully extracted this family of molecules from Himanthalia elongata seaweed [2] using an eco-designed and patented process dubbed “Coeur d’algue” (French for “heart of algae”). According to Seppic, Sagacious acts on all skin layers. “The skin becomes significantly firmer and the signs of facial sagging are less visible,” said the company in a statement. Clinical tests have shown that Sagacious improves skin firmness, eight times more than the placebo and decreases the visibility of nasogenian folds (efficacy clinically proven after 28 days of application). Its mode of action has been evaluated in vitro  also, demonstrating a restoration of mechanical properties of fibroblasts close to the value of a fibroblast 28 years younger, thanks to a stimulation of key molecules at the level of the different layers of the skin: – At the dermo-epidermal junction for a better cohesion between epidermis and dermis;
– In the dermis for a better biomechanical and tensile properties of fibroblasts;
– At the dermo-hypodermal junction for a better cohesion between dermis and hypodermis. With Sagacious, Seppic thus propose to adopt a new approach for a global anti-aging strategy. ""Sagacious is an innovative active ingredient, thanks to its biomimetic sourcing and its eco-designed process patented by Seppic which allows for the first time to extract glycolipids from Himanthalia elongata seaweed. All this for proven and visible effectiveness from one month on the signs of facial sagging,” concluded Audrey Bonnard, Active Product Manager at Seppic. Sagacious complies with Chinese regulations. It is also Cosmos and Natrue approved with a 100% naturalness rate according to ISO 16128."
Holistic beauty: Clariant launches mood-boosting skincare innovations,"As consumers focus on mental health and solutions that can help inspire them to relax and feel happy, Clariant addresses this quest for holistic wellness with two formulations using its latest ingredient launches under the concept ‘The Joyologist’. Thus, the ‘Feel-Good Magic Stick’ and the ‘Forget It All Relaxing Mask’ promote inner wellness and can be used complementary in a daily routine ""to bring joy to the skin and the mood."" Clariant’s new skincare concept was named after the findings of a Beautystreams report titled Joyology 2021-2026. ""Self-care is hugely important, especially in a world full of troubling news that affect our mental well-being,"" says Amandine Werle, a marketing specialist for Clariant Actives & Natural Origins and one of the minds behind The Joyologist. ""Consumers look for ways to take better care of themselves, and beauty rituals are big part of that. Treating your skin with products that provide sensations of comfort can help improve the mood by stimulating the release of feel-good molecules such as serotonin and melatonin. This, in turn, positively impacts the skin and starts a virtuous cycle."" The two formulations created by Clariant to promote inner wellness include: – The Feel-Good Magic Stick, an aqueous gel stick to use at any moment of the day for a well-being push. It provides a cooling sensation to the skin thanks to its water-based formula and has a lightweight, non-greasy texture that absorbs quickly into the skin. The formula is based on Clariant’s new active ingredient Rootness Mood+ that reproduces the natural benefits of light to revitalize the skin and enhance the mood. Sourced from Sanguisorba officinalis, a plant used in traditional Chinese medicine, it is derived from environmentally friendly plant-milking technology. The stick contains additional actives such as B-Circadin, which helps re-synchronize the skin cell’s biological clock, and HerbEx Curcuma Extract, which increases the skin’s stress resilience. – The Forget It All Relaxing Mask, a face mask to apply on the skin at the end of the day, to take a moment just for oneself, to get rid of negative thoughts and enjoy the present time. Clariant has chosen to offer it in a multi-sensorial relaxation set, which includes a scented candle and relaxing playlist. Its key active ingredient is Beracare CBA, a complex blend of Amazonian oils that can be used as an alternative to Cannabidiol (CBD). Rootness Mood+ and Beracare CBA were both awarded the BSB Innovation Award 2023. Plus, Rootness Mood+ won an award in the technology category at this year’s Cosmetic Ingredients & Technology Exhibition Japan (CITE)."
Yifixia develops natural excipients based on plant-derived co-products,"Based in Montpellier, in the south of France, young company Yifixia was founded in 2022 by two researchers, Nicolas Gaboriaud-Kolar, PhD in Chemistry specialized in natural molecules, and Rémi Przybylski, PhD in Process Engineering, to recover agricultural co-products in the French southern region of Occitanie and turn them into molecules of interest. “Thanks to our specialisms, we can combine eco-extraction technologies and white chemistry, so we manage to use enzymes or micro-organisms to keep creating molecules until the source co-product is completely drained, and obtain the best added value,” explains Nicolas Gaboriaud-Kolar. Yifixia’s approach involves the cascading recovery of waste considered as a potential source for developing several ingredients. “If we carefully choose the technologies we use, we will be able to generate two or three ingredients with the same single raw material,” says the founder and CEO of the company. The developments are mainly formulation ingredients: the first excipient will be marketed in late 2023. “The choice of natural excipients is limited right now on the market, and yet there is a rising demand from consumers for natural and healthy products. So, we aim to offer manufacturers natural ingredients derived from renewable raw materials, so that they can formulate cosmetic products with alternative solutions,” adds Nicolas Gaboriaud-Kolar. The company aims to develop five to eight extracts by 2026. Yifixia works directly with its suppliers, who are transformers in the Occitanie region’s food industry. “This way, we get to know our suppliers, understand how they work, and give them advice, so that the co-product is not too damaged and we can retrieve it in the best conditions,” explains the Director. In addition, this company aims to make a difference: they do not only aim to make a profit, but also to have a positive impact on the environment or society. In fact, they made their commitments with their suppliers official in their statutes and purchase raw materials at the highest price possible. “It is a way to value their work, highlight a regional product, and create an incentive. It is costly for transformers to remove a co-product. So, we aim to transform costs into revenues,” he says. To support its partners with this strategy, Yifixia offers a service to companies willing to recover their waste. “We have also been considering providing this service the other way round, by developing an offer based on cosmetics manufacturers’ needs in terms of actives or ingredients derived from co-products. The idea is to use our diverse expertise to build a bridge between the farming and cosmetics industries,” concludes Nicolas Gaboriaud-Kolar."
Fragrances: A Lebanese village at the heart of the Damask rose tradition,"On a gentle slope looking out over Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, villagers work their way across pink-dotted terraces, gathering perfumed Damask roses that are used for essential oils, sweets and cosmetics. The rose harvest ""gives you a bit of hope, it makes things beautiful, it calms you down — it gives you strength to carry on"", said Leila al-Dirani, picking the flowers from her family’s land in the village of. A soft bag tied around her waist and her hands scratched from the thorns, the 64-year-old plucks the small, pink buds from their bushes as their rich and heady scent wafts across the hill. The oil derived from the famed Damask rose --- named after the ancient city of Damascus located just across the mountain range separating Lebanon and Syria — is a staple of perfumers. Rose water derived from the flower is also used across the Middle East both as a refreshing drink, in sweets such as Turkish delight, to scent mosques and even to bestow luck at weddings. After a morning collecting roses, the workers in Qsarnaba drop their fragrant bundles at a warehouse in the village. At the facility carpeted with pink petals, Zahraa Sayed Ahmed — whose first name means ""flower"" — buys the raw materials to produce her rose water, syrup, tea and jam. Around four years ago, she set up a small workshop at her house, using a traditional metal still that ""belonged to my grandfather"", said Sayed Ahmed, 37. With a kilogramme (2.2 pounds) of rose petals, she said she can make up to half a litre of rose water. She then also bottles and labels her modest production by hand, putting it on limited sale locally. ""The production of rose water is a part of our heritage,"" said Sayed Ahmed. ""In every home in Qsarnaba there is a still, even if it’s just a small one."" The rose season only lasts a few weeks, but it is a busy time for Qsarnaba’s residents. ""This year is the first year that we didn’t bring workers to help us because the production is low and we couldn’t afford it,"" said Hassan al-Dirani, 25, who has been picking the flowers alongside his mother, Leila. Since late 2019, Lebanon has been grappling with a devastating economic crisis that has seen the local currency collapse and pushed most of the population into poverty. ""The rose harvest and all other harvests have lost about 80 percent of their value... because of the economic crisis,"" said local official Daher al-Dirani, who hails from the extended family that is the biggest in Qsarnaba. ""But the roses help people put food on the table,"" he added. Exported from Syria to Europe for centuries since the time of the Crusades, the ancient Damask rose is also cultivated in countries including France, Morocco, Iran and Turkey. ""Our village produces the most roses out of any village in Lebanon"" and more than half of the country’s rose water, Sayed Ahmed claimed proudly, as the captivating scent lingered in the air. ""Qsarnaba is the village of roses."""
"SpruceSugar, an antioxidant ingredient upcycled from the wood industry","Dubbed Metsä (the Finnish word for “forest”), Ole Hyvä’s new line features three products: a shower gel, a shampoo and a liquid hand soap. Developed in partnership with Montinutra, a start-up developing forest based ingredients and a Metsä Spring’s portfolio company, the new line utilises Montinutra’s Boreal Bioproducts SpruceSugar as a key ingredient. This is the first time that SpruceSugar has been used in an application for consumers. SpruceSugar is a 100% natural hemicellulose extract, obtained from sustainable spruce sawmilling side streams. It substitutes analogue chemicals and polysaccharides, with the potential to increase the antioxidant capacity of personal care products. All products in Ole Hyvä’s new range are vegan, biodegradable, and contain SpruceSugar. ""Our goal is to develop and offer consumers high-quality and environmentally friendly cleaning products based on nature’s biocapacity. We are particularly happy that we can support a domestic innovation that promotes the responsible use of natural resources and respects the well-being of nature. We believe that the cooperation helps us to offer our customers even better and more environmentally friendly products in the future as well,” commented Elli Unger, Managing Director of Ole Hyvä Luonnontuote Oy. Thanks to this partnership with Ole Hyvä Luonnontuote, Montinutra was able to place its Boreal Bioproducts SpruceSugar on the market at a record speed – it went from testing phase into consumer product in just 14 months. “With the successful launch of the first product range, Montinutra is ready to sell the product to other natural cosmetic players in Europe,” says the start-up in a statement. Montinutra bets on a rising global demand from consumers for natural and sustainable cosmetic products, as well as on the consumers interest for upcycled ingredients. “SpruceSugar is a prime example of how underutilised side streams can be upcycled into a novel product that has a large variety of usage cases,” says Katariina Kemppainen, SVP, Group R&D at Metsä Spring, Metsä Group’s innovation company, which mission is to seek and support sustainable innovations and technologies that find new purposes and higher value for Nordic wood. In addition to SpruceSugar, Montinutra’s Boreal Bioproducts range features two other products: SpruceLigno, a sulfur free, natural anti-oxidant and UV-absorbing lignin extract; and SpruceFiber, a thermally treated dry lignocellulose."
"Epionine Bio, a holistic active ingredient for skin and mind well-being","Extracted from Camellia oleifera, a small tree native to China, known for the oil extracted from its seeds, Epionine Bio [1] is an active ingredient rich in sterols. Responsibly sourced in the province of Hunan in China and obtained by molecular distillation, Epionine Bio protects the skin from internal and external stress by acting on the skin-brain axis. In vitro and in vivo tests have demonstrated its anti-inflammatory, moisturizing, pain modulation and self-esteem benefits. “Skin health and well-being are inextricably linked. The symptoms of dry or sensitive skin can affect a person’s well-being, causing stress and having a negative impact on their emotional state. This can create a vicious circle, as stress can in itself be a source of skin problems. Indeed, around 40% [2] of persons with skin problems also have mental health issues, which are often linked to their skin condition,” explains Armelle Le Peniec, Director of the Cosmetic Active Ingredients division of Laboratoires Expanscience. Two clinical studies – the first concerning the improvement of the skin condition between D0 and D28, the second comparing the benefits of Epionine versus placebo after 28 days of use – were performed alongside specialists in psychology and neuroscience. According to Expanscience, several benefits have been highlighted: physical benefits, by strengthening the skin barrier and moisturizing the skin; and mental benefits, since this active ingredient is able to improve an individual’s emotional state (+18%), quality of life (+21%) and self-esteem (+35%), as well as reduce their psychological stress (-11%).

"The shea butter sector, a real instrument of economic development in Africa","According to the Global Shea Alliance (GSA), 16 million African women living in the region from Senegal to South Sudan live or survive on its harvest — mainly in rural areas. Mali is one of the world’s leading producers along with Nigeria and Burkina Faso. Strong growth in demand Demand for the product – used in the production of food (85%) and cosmetic products – has exploded in recent years, driven by consumers in developed countries who increasingly want to buy products presented as organic and natural. According to Transparency Market Research, the global shea butter market could reach USD 3.5 billion in 2028. The United States, The Netherlands, Denmark and France are among the top shea butter importers. While the cosmetics industry only represents a small fraction of the global shea butter market, it is a key ingredient for the sector, which plays a major role in increasing the global demand. The fatty acids present in shea butter are used as opacifying agents and surfactants . Shea butter is also used as emollient in various cosmetic products, due to its smoothening properties for dry skin. Beyond skin, body and hair care products, shea butter is increasingly used in colour cosmetics. Mainly harvested by women, shea nuts play an important role in the economic development of African rural communities. However, the sector needs to structure itself to take better advantage of the windfall constituted by the resource. In the cooperative of women producers of shea butter at the rural community of Siby (COOPROKASI), near Bamako, Mali, the organization of work has become more professional since its set up in 2003. There are nearly 1,000 women working there. Permanent salaries earn them the equivalent of minimum wage each month, or around 45,000 CFA francs (70 euros). There are also temporary workers who are paid by the task. ""One of the advantages of the cooperative is that it has allowed women to have jobs"" over all seasons, when their activity was previously limited to the rainy season, said Filfing Koumare, the cooperative’s sales manager. Once the nuts have been harvested, women at the cooperative peel them to extract the kernel. This is then crushed, washed and dried several times before being cooked in a pot to produce a dark liquid, which is filtered and cleared of impurities, resulting in the final oil, shea butter, which is used for making soaps and creams and sold in the village, the capital Bamako and to clients around the world, according to Kamissoko Kinimba Niara, accountant for the cooperative. ""When women make their sales, they get an income that allows them a bit of financial autonomy,"" said Assitan Kone Camara, president of the cooperative. ""But one of the difficulties is the lack of support and the lack of means,"" she added. For Daouda Keita, mayor of the town, ""It is crucial to support this structure in order to modernise it."" Managers are demanding training and financial support, particularly for sales and marketing."
"BASF debuts Kerasylium, a plant-based alternative to animal keratin","BASF’s new hair care ingredient is a micro-complex, rich in peptides and nutrients. Dubbed Kerasylium, the plant extract is the result of upcycling from milk thistle (Silybum marianum) seed cakes, a by-product of Silybum marianum oil production. Kerasylium’s peptides exhibit an amino acid composition similar to that of keratin, a protein naturally present in the hair, which ensures its resistance and elasticity. “Many cosmetic manufacturers rely on keratin for their hair care products because it helps to repair the hair from the inside out. However, the keratin-based ingredients that are usually used in hair treatments are of animal origin. We wanted to change that, so we developed Kerasylium, a plant-based alternative,” said Cécile Kalem, Launch Manager Europe, BASF Beauty Care Solutions France S.A.S. Kerasylium expands BASF’s growing portfolio of active ingredients produced via circular models to conserve resources. The milk thistle used is grown in France for oil production and is based on a traceable and sustainable supply chain. Thanks to its high peptide content (50-70% of the active matter), Kerasylium helps to prevent breakage, especially of weakened hair, through the stabilization and repair of hair keratin, making hair stronger, shinier, and softer. Moreover, comprehensive studies have shown that Kerasylium decreases keratin denaturation by protecting the structural proteins of the hair against oxidative stress, while helping to maintain its color for longer.

"Vertical farming, innovative sourcing for cosmetics and fragrances","When Lindsay Azpitarte launched Ulé, a brand of natural products, with the Shiseido Group in 2022, she chose a novel concept in cosmetics: ultra-local plant sourcing from vertical farming. The three flagship ingredients of the Ulé range, chosen for their ability to improve the skin’s resilience, are extracted from exotic plants grown at Tower Farm, a vertical farm located a few kilometres from Paris. ""I wanted to launch a brand centred on the values of conscious beauty. I combined my passion for urbanism and the way cities adapt, with what I wanted to do with the botanist Patrice André, which was to create a slightly different kind of naturalness where nature is closer to people,"" explained Lindsay Azpitarte. Indeed, this principle of indoor cultivation, based on the precise control of all the parameters of the plant’s development is meeting in France, the expectations of brands and ingredient suppliers. ""The cosmetics industry is increasingly interested in this trend because it provides both an environmental and an innovative benefit. This technology allows us to create the perfect environment for plants, and to study them in real-time to optimize them for cosmetic purposes,"" added the creator of Ulé. The first advantage is that the biomass required for plant extraction is readily available. ""We can produce any plant all year round with no seasonal constraints. A dozen cycles are possible, whereas, in the natural environment, there is only one season. Then, the fact that the plant is fresh and can be processed within hours of being harvested also allows to obtain a cocktail of molecules that is all the more interesting,"" observed Alexandra Crème, Tower Farm’s R&D Director. Vertical farming, therefore, allows controlled sourcing, the optimization of plant resources, a reduced land area and more arable land available. Another environmental benefit is that closed-circuit watering reduces water consumption by 95% compared to traditional crop watering, which is increasingly impacted by recurrent periods of drought. Due to its proximity, vertical farming also secures sourcing. ""The sourcing of naturals comes mainly from emerging countries where there can be supply issues related to climate change, the use of pesticides and herbicides at odds with clean beauty, not to mention complicated logistics routes..."" detailed Gilles Dreyfus, the founder of Jungle, the first vertical farm in France. The company, which has been in operation since 2019, generates half of its turnover from the cosmetics and perfume sector and has set up an exclusive partnership for perfume plants, with ingredient supplier Firmenich. ""Together we have launched a research programme on about twenty plant species to see whether it would be interesting for Firmenich to grow them on our farms,"" explained Gilles Dreyfus, the founder of Jungle. ""There are two types of plants of interest, those from which we can obtain a higher yield of fragrance or active principle, and those from which we can extract equivalent quantities but at a lower cost,"" he added. From this ""cultivation/extraction"" partnership emerged, among other things, a new ingredient in perfumery, the very first natural extract of lily of the valley. Considered a silent flower, the lily of the valley does not generate an essence. ""This flower had never been used in its natural state before in perfumery because its flowering cycle is too short in nature to carry out an extraction campaign. The first fragrance based on this natural lily of the valley extract will be released in June by a major French luxury brand,"" revealed Gilles Dreyfus. In total, eight varieties were selected by Firmenich to be cultivated in the Jungle vertical farm, including violets, another silent flower of the perfume industry. ""These are either plants that are difficult to source, or plants that express themselves better olfactively thanks to the advantages of the controlled environment. Our mastery of the three main parameters, which are nutrition, photosynthesis and climate, allows the plant to express itself in the best possible way,"" added the founder. Optimising the plant’s growth conditions by controlling its cultivation parameters opens up new fields of research. ""Rather than producing biomass in quantity, Tower Farm’s objective is to harness the potential of this technology, which allows carrying out so-called precision agriculture, to improve the ability of plants to produce certain molecules,"" also asserted Alexandra Crème. At its new sustainable cosmetics production facility in Austin, Texas, Capsum, a contract manufacturer serving the European and US markets, has relied on the integrated installation of its precision vertical farm in collaboration with specialist startup Orius. ""We have equipped ourselves with technology and equipment to optimise the production of active plant ingredients. By controlling climate parameters - water, light, CO2 - we can recreate the conditions in which the plant will produce certain molecules. The idea is to be able to offer our customers a ’seed to bottle’ concept,"" explained Laurie Dewandel, Capsum’s Communications Director. The tests carried out by Capsum show a threefold increase in the content of total polyphenols produced by the plant, compared to standard growing conditions, the company said. ""The plants are grown to order for cosmetic products. We know the cultivation time needed to provide the highest level of active ingredients, which will then be extracted from fresh plants,"" added the manager. Capsum has already developed an active from sunflower micro-pods and is working on other plant sources. ""Our aim is not to develop a specific active for a client but rather a range of actives from which our clients can choose,"" specified Laurie Dewandel, who sees this as an opportunity to provide differentiating solutions. While the technological model of vertical farms is attractive to the industry, the energy consumed is often criticised. ""This solution contributes to reducing the carbon impact and water consumption while promoting local cultivation..., but we must consider the energy cost of intensive lighting,"" explained Pascale Brousse, Director of Trendsourcing. This is a central issue in the minds of the main stakeholders. ""Energy consumption will be optimised and therefore reduced. In future farms, 80% of the energy will be renewable and will come from solar energy. We also have to compare this with the energy costs of traditional farming, and anything that helps hamper imports is beneficial for the environment,"" noted Gilles Dreyfus. ""Our CSR approach is paramount, Tower Far is B Corp certified. We have set up a co-generator with other startups for greener electricity. We are also working hard on the quality of our LEDs and our air conditioning systems. In just two generations of LEDs we have already halved our electricity consumption,"" added Alexandra Crème. Still little known to consumers, vertical farming is nonetheless making sense in today’s cosmetics industry and is part of an intelligent product development approach. ""This must be well explained to the consumer, who needs a lot of information, but also transparency. Also, is it not certifiable as organic in Europe because it is an off-farm crop, which can pose a problem. But it is a model that will be developed because it fits with the strategies of brands reflecting on futuristic scenarios and climate change. Rooftop cultivation is another solution to consider,"" concluded Pascale Brousse.

Global Bioenergies launches a first natural and renewable Isohexadecane,"Isohexadecane is a branched alkane with a medium volatility property which confers a dry and silky finish on the skin. Historically, this molecule comes from the oil industry. The biosourced isohexadecane launched by Global Bioenergies is a 100% natural (according to ISO 16128), which is 100% made and sourced in France. For the first time, the ingredient was synthesized from French sugars. Global Bioenergies will launch this first natural and renewable isohexadecane at in-cosmetics Global, which will be held from March 28 to 30 in Barcelona. “Our ingredients are made from sugars. We source our raw material in France thanks to sugars manufacturers located closely to our production unit. We are an actor for maintenance of industrial and agricultural jobs in weakened areas in France. In the long run, Global Bioenergies is aiming at cutting CO2 emissions thanks to its innovative process. Indeed, our process will help to significantly decrease the CO2 emissions in comparison with the oil-based ingredient,” said the company in a statement. The launch of Isonaturane® 16 comes on the heels of the introduction last year of Isonaturane® 12, the first bio-based isododecane. In partnership with Clariant, Global Bioenergies also launched a bio-based rheology modifier in 2018. “Our technology consists of feeding reprogrammed bacteria with sugars so that they produce isobutene, a hydrocarbon which is at the heart of petrochemicals and makes it possible to manufacture fuels (for sustainable air transportation), but also cosmetic ingredients, and aromas. This is the first time this gas has been produced by fermentation, but it was necessary to build suitable industrial equipment, it is a major industrial investment,” Marc Delcourt, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of the company, told Premium Beauty News. Global Bioenergies recently received state support from the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME) as part of the “Biobased products and industrial biotechnologies” call for projects. A funding of €4.4 million was allocated to Global Bioenergies in the form of 60% subsidy (non-repayable) and 40% repayable advances, subject to the achievement of technical and commercial milestones, to be paid in several instalments over the duration of the project, including an initial 15% instalment.

"Feel good beauty: Me, My skin, and My statement beauty","The quest for “in-and-out” beauty is gradually gaining ground in Europe, North America, and Brazil. This form of holistic beauty is meant to be global and more sustainable. It is a learning that can be acquired over time: harmony with yourself takes time. Beyond perfection, it is a search for peace of mind through a new lifestyle. And cosmetic products only make up one part of the allies in this quest for positive, more inclusive beauty. Our skin mirrors our own emotions, but also our health. Contrary to young women looking for instantaneous perfection – the ones that advocate Filtered Beauty and do not hesitate to use cosmetic surgery as soon as they spot a fine line or the tiniest flaw – others choose a completely different approach: that of plural beauty and self-acceptance. The 2023 edition of in-cosmetics Global, which will be held in Barcelona from March 28 to 30, 2023, will reflect these trends.

Solvay introduces a new bio-based thermoprotection in hair care,"Solvay introduces Polycare Heat Therapy, a new functional active ingredient that protects hair from thermal damage due to repeated use of hair styling appliances operating at very high temperatures. Indeed, heat is a powerful hair styling tool, but it can also cause severe damage, such as dehydration and delipidation, brittleness, porosity, reduced surface and loss of softness. When hair is damaged by heat, restoring its healthy physical integrity and sensory qualities is difficult. Thus, it is advisable to protect it when using high-heat styling appliances by providing a thermal shield and minimizing its thermal stress to avoid further damage. According to Solvay, the double-derivatized cationic guar active ingredient advances the global trend of bio-based, non-ecotoxic and silicone-free solutions in hair care and delivers excellent thermal protection in transparent formulations. “Our new Polycare Heat Therapy addresses the challenge of protecting hair against thermal damage caused by high-heat devices such as flat or curling irons and hair dryers,” explains Stephanie Neplaz, Global Innovation Marketing Director, Hair care, at Solvay. “As the market’s best naturally-derived performer in this segment, it helps brand owners in the industry replace incumbent silicone and other synthetic polymers, and complements our broad portfolio of bio-based beauty care ingredients.” In hair care formulations, Polycare Heat Therapy forms an invisible and imperceptible barrier on the hair surface. According to Solvay, this multi-functional ingredient adds discipline, straightens effect and softness, and also improves detangling and wet combability without build-up in multiple applications. Comprehensive testing at Solvay has demonstrated that this silicone-free solution can reduce thermally induced hair damage by up to 30%. As a result, the hair is less exposed, less damaged and more protected. Polycare Heat Therapy extends the range of Solvay’s active ingredients promoting hair health, which also include Polycare Split Therapy to repair and care and Polycare Frizz Therapy to style and protect. Polycare Heat Therapy is ethically sourced from renewable sources through the company’s Sustainable Guar Initiative program in India and serves as a role model of sustainable development in line with the Solvay One Planet roadmap. Solvay will present Polycare Heat Therapy during in-cosmetics in Barcelona from March 28 to 30, 2023, at booth V10."
Clean beauty and sustainability set to lead the fore at in-cosmetics Global,"Taking place at the Fira Barcelona Gran Via, in-cosmetics Global will host more than 800 personal care ingredient suppliers, including companies such as Arxada (formerly Lonza Specialty Ingredients), BASF, Clariant, Codif, Croda, DSM, Evonik, Expanscience, Exsymol, Greentech, Lubrizol, Mibelle, Momentive, Nouryon, Roquette, Silab, Solvay, Shin-Etsu, Symrise, Stepan Europe, and Wacker. Meanwhile, almost 60 new comers will exhibit for the first time, including AntalGenics, Cellugy ApS, Escruder, Gravel AI, Innomost and Sequential Bio. In line with the current transformation of the cosmetics industry, ingredients that respond to the clean beauty trend will take centre stage at this year’s edition. Anticipated to grow at a robust CAGR of 40.1%, the global clean beauty market is expected to reach USD 37.65 billion by 2028, according to Research & Markets [1]. Despite a lack of definition, clean beauty has rapidly gained momentum as conscious consumers look for products made from ingredients that are safe, non-toxic and have the lowest possible impact on the environment. According to Soil Association Certification, 2022 was its 11th consecutive year of growth based on the progression of certified organic beauty and wellbeing products. The Association’s Organic Beauty and Wellbeing Market Report revealed that nearly half (48%) of consumers are now more concerned about the environment than prior to the pandemic, and 55% are more likely to purchase environmentally friendly products. Also, part of the clean beauty trend, sustainability  is now top of mind for personal care and cosmetic ingredient suppliers. The organizers have therefore decided to create a Sustainability Zone, hosting exhibitors who can support suppliers and manufacturers in becoming more sustainable. Sponsored by FarmForce and in partnership with Ecovia Intelligence, the zone will cover every step of the supply chain from product planning, formulation and ingredient sourcing to packaging, manufacturing, and transportation. “With a growing emphasis on sustainability and the continued efforts of consumers to make more conscious choices of the products they consume and dispose of, it is unsurprising that clean beauty continues to dominate,” said Roziani Zulkifli, Event Director, in-cosmetics Global. “As the conversation continues to expand, we’re delighted to announce the launch of our new Sustainability Zone at this year’s event. It will further expand the opportunities for attendees to discover solutions to every challenge facing their business.” Other key trends at the show include personalisation and CBD, and exhibitors will unveil series of innovations to match with brands and consumers expectations. Active Concepts S.r.L, for instance, will respond to two of this year’s biggest trends – clean beauty and CBD. Its 20829-ProCutiGen Bond is a lipopeptide derived from chia seeds. It can be utilised for hair strength and protection thanks to its rich source of protein, helping to prime hair cuticles and prevent damage. The supplier will also highlight its AC Hemp Oil Liposome PF, which capitalises on the potent anti-inflammatory benefits associated with hemp oil and CBD. It uses encapsulation technology to enhance activity and stability, while the inhibition of Interleukin-6 activity is thought to alleviate the chronic inflammatory process, which is linked to skin ageing. Fellow exhibitor, Laboratoires Expanscience will demonstrate its skin and hair sebum regulator, made from upcycled avocados. 5α-Avocuta T is an oil-based natural active ingredient that helps regulate sebum secretion by inhibiting 5 α-reductase activity. According to Expanscience, in a haircare application, it is proven to reduce dandruff by 67%, and greasy hair appearance by 78% in just three weeks. When used in skincare, it can reduce the greasy appearance of the T-zone by 78%. For its part, Microcaps  will introduce attendees to its novel microencapsulation technique, which enables the fabrication of highly uniform and microplastic-free beads to enhance the sensory and visual qualities of cosmetic products and to deliver water and oil-based actives. And Selco Wirkstoffe Vertriebs GmbH will profile its 18-ß-Glycyrrhetic acid, which is obtained by hydrolysis of Glycyrrhicinate from the roots of Liquorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra). It will also welcome attendees to see and try Bromelain  (100), a natural plant protease that is derived from pineapple strains."
Lubrizol’s Actizyme helps darker skin types to maintain glowing appearance,"Actizyme advanced botanical ingredient [1] is a natural [2] exfoliating and moisturizing agent. It is a botanical extract rich in an acid protease that mimics the effect of endogenous cathepsin D (the skin’s own desquamating enzymes) to produce a controlled and effective peeling, without side effects. According to Lubrizol, this funghi-derived extract improves the overall appearance of the skin by increasing clarity without compromising barrier function. “For skin to maintain its glowing appearance, it goes through a natural process of renewal called desquamation. In desquamation, the skin cells go through a complete life cycle – from the base layer of the epidermis to the skin cells maturing and eventually flaking off at the surface. When this process doesn’t happen fully, dead skin cells can remain on the skin, making the skin look rough and dull,” explains Lubrizol Life Science Beauty in a statement. When it was launched in 2015, Actizyme advanced botanical ingredient was thus presented as a gentle alternative to alpha hydroxyl acids (AHAs) or lactic acid in face and body care formulations. Most recently, Lubrizol investigated the benefits of Actizyme advanced botanical ingredient for darker skin types through new in vivo tests. Indeed, according to Lubrizol, skin dullness and lack of radiance linked to the accumulation of dead cells is increasing concern for consumers, especially those with darker complexions. In vivo efficacy testing with Actizyme advanced botanical ingredient was conducted on volunteers with darker complexions. Participants reported visible lightening effects and that their skin appeared more luminous. Actizyme advanced botanical ingredient can be used in a large array of exfoliating products, from rinse-off masks to leave-on daily creams. Its activity can be modulated by dosage and time to achieve the required exfoliating effect."
"Givaudan unveils Gravityl, a new marine ingredient to lift the face contour","With the launch of Gravityl, Givaudan Active Beauty aims to fight the effects of gravity on ageing skin. A 100% natural ingredient crafted by marine biotechnology from a red macro alga, this new active ingredient offers a powerful lifting benefit against visible signs of ageing by reducing skin sagging on face contour and double-chin volume. “With the skin ageing process, loss of firmness and elasticity is inevitable,” says Givaudan. When the skin gets older, gravity plays its role and significantly contributes to many signs of ageing, especially on the lower part of the face. According to consumer insights study conducted by Givaudan on 4,100 consumers in 10 countries, 54% [1] of female and male consumers globally develop sagging skin, double chin or loss of face contour. Most of them also consider their jawline structure important but have never had nor would have surgery to deal with it. To respond to this relevant cosmetic need, the Givaudan Active Beauty team looked for the best solution to relaunch the production of key structural constituents of the skin, while fighting against the effects of gravity. “Thanks to an exclusive multistep and eco-friendly process, we have crafted an enriched extract of Gigartina stellate [2], able to relaunch key processes linked to the extracellular matrix and elastic fibre protection, and reorganising fibres in the dermis. Its specific mode of action and spectacular performance make Gravityl the ideal ally to fight against visible signs of ageing, skin sagging and double-chin, bringing back suppleness to the face, with a demonstrated 30-year rejuvenation of the skin’s biomechanical properties,” says Mathias Fleury, Head of Category Actives for Givaudan Active Beauty. Two clinical tests versus placebo, on a total of 84 female volunteers from 35 to 75 years old, established that Gravityl is able to relaunch the production of collagen fibres in mature skin and to increase collagen content by 3.4 times [3] while improving firmness and elasticity by up to 7 times [4] versus placebo. This new active ingredient also offers a significant lifting effect as it drastically reduces double-chin volume in just one month (by more than 27 mm3), visibly reshaping and reinforcing the structure of facial skin. In order to illustrate the efficacy of Gravityl in a face care, Givaudan has formulated a 4-in-1 firming cream that was named S3D Jawline Reshape. The effect of Gravityl is strengthened by two additional cosmetic ingredients known for their well-ageing efficacy, Agefinity and Acerola LG to boost skin elasticity, regenerate cells, reorganise collagen and provide antioxidant benefits. Gravityl and S3D Jawline Reshape were introduced at the PCHI trade show in Guangzhou, China, from 15-17 February 2023."
"Senevisium, Silab’s new anti-aging active ingredient derived from Ginkgo biloba","Senescence [1] is usually controlled by the immune system, that effectively locates and eradicates cells that are harmful to the cutaneous environment. Over time, however, some senescent fibroblasts implement immunoevasion strategies to avoid being eliminated. That precisely the immunoevasion mechanism that is targeted by Silab’s new anti-ageing active ingredient. Thanks to in vitro and in vivo modelling studies, Silab says they have shown the accentuation of the immunoevasion mechanism at the level of the skin after the age of 60, inducing profound changes (wrinkles, dull complexion, loss of elasticity and senescence spots). “Through its targeted action, Senevisium is able to restore the natural elimination of immunoevasive senescent fibroblasts by the immune system by circumventing their two immunoevasion pathways,” claims the company. According to Silab, by allowing deleterious immunoevasive senescent fibroblasts to be recognized again and eliminated, Senevisium protects the skin from their harmful effects on matrix synthesis and epidermal renewal. “Tested at 2% in Caucasian volunteers, Senevisium enables the skin to restore its density and elasticity. The stage of wrinkles is reduced, and complexion radiance is enhanced,” details the company. After 28 days of treatment, 100% of the female volunteers said they found their skin firmer, and their complexion lighter and more uniform. Silab extracted Senevisum’s active molecules from leaves of Ginkgo Biloba, a tree known for its powerful immune system. Two French farms, certified for their organic and biodiversity-friendly processes, were selected for the supply of the green leaves. The company recommends to use Senevisium in skin care products dedicated to mature skins at a concentration of 0.5 to 2.0%. Available in aqueous solution, it complies with biodiversity regulations and has a natural origin content of 98.8% (ISO 16128). It meets international cosmetic regulations requirements (Europe, United States, China, Japan, etc.)."
"Givaudan unveils RetiLife, a biotech alternative to synthetic retinol","RetiLife, Givaudan Active Beauty’s new active ingredient, is a molecule designed to fight skin ageing. It is, according to the company, the first 100% naturally sourced retinol. This sustainable alternative to synthetic retinol was produced through the use of micro-organisms. First, pure retinol is produced in a natural carrier during a fermentation process from plant sugars. It is then combined with natural antioxidants to ensure its protection, even at a very high concentration. “RetiLife is the first of its kind to offer a sustainable alternative to synthetic retinol with similar anti-wrinkle efficacy”, claimed Givaudan in a statement. With 100% natural-origin content, including sunflower oil as a carrier, the composition of RetiLife avoids synthetic ingredients such as BHT/BHA or polysorbate. Its molecule is identical to its chemical counterpart. “Retinol is widely used in skincare applications for its well-known efficient anti-wrinkles properties. After years of research and development, we are thrilled to offer the most innovative and sustainable retinol on the cosmetic market and therefore open the door to new cosmetic applications. RetiLife is a game- changer in the beauty industry that responds to consumer demand for cleaner beauty products,” highlighted Romain Reynaud, R&D Director of Givaudan Active Beauty. RetiLife will be introduced during in-cosmetics Global taking place in Barcelona, Spain, from 28-30 March, 2023. “Throughout the years, Active Beauty has broken cosmetic boundaries by launching active ingredients that outperform competitors. With the launch of RetiLife, a unique hero cosmetic biotech innovation, we focus on creating consumer-preferred products that leverage our capabilities in line with our purpose,” highlighted Maurizio Volpi, President of Givaudan Fragrance & Beauty. Retinol – one of the forms of vitamin A – is widely used by the cosmetics industry, due to its stimulating action on the skin’s natural defences. Indeed, Vitamin A maintains homeostasis of epithelial tissues and mucosa through its metabolite, retinoic acid. Retinol has demonstrated its benefits on wrinkles, stretch marks, skin blemishes and scars and is one of the most popular cosmetic ingredients, alongside aloe vera and vitamin C. As such, it is the subject of much research. In November last year, Givaudan Active Beauty announced the launch of Siliphos, a natural alternative to retinoids with a very high tolerability profile. For its part, Serderma has launched ReVitAlide — a lipid submicron particle carrying 3% active retinol. According to the Croda Personal Care subsidiary, this high-tech capsule provides enhanced stability, protecting retinol from degradation and making it easy to store and formulate. Note also the launch of NovoRetin by Mibelle Biochemistery, a plant-based active ingredient that can increase naturally occurring retinoic acid in the skin and thereby induce retinol-like effects without the need to apply retinoids topically on the skin. All these different approaches contribute to place retinol as a cornerstone of the fight against skin ageing."
Algafiller: Agrimer’s marine origin wrinkle filler,"Algafiller [1] is extracted from Codium tomentosum, a chlorophycean macroalgae with a coenocytic structure consisting in a single giant cell with a strong capacity healing and regeneration. Algafiller contains sulfated mannan and arabinogalactan, two polysaccharides that are recognized for their moisturizing properties. This 100% natural ingredient, free from preservative and compatible with a vegan claim, is obtained by “auto -hydrolysis” of the polysaccharides contained in the seaweed. This process patented by Agrimer enhances the solubilization and bioavailability of polysaccharides by reducing their size. This new generation filler addresses lipoatrophy, a loss of adipose tissue that occurs with age. The decrease in the number and size of adipocytes linked to aging leads to a loss of volume in the face: dark circles and cheeks become hollow, the facial oval sags, and wrinkles looks bigger and skin folds. The benefits of Algafiller (filler effect, lipofilling, improved firmness, increased in dermal density, reduction of wrinkles and fine lines of crow’s feet) have been objectified by a series of in vitro and in vivo tests. Tested in vivo on human adipocytes Algafiller has shown its ability to increase the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes: – Lipogenic effect: +130% at 0.3% Algafiller (compared to the control);
– Increase in adiponectin synthesis: +212% at 0.1% Algafiller (compared to the control). An ex vivo test on human skin explants has shown that Algafiller (at 0.1%) boosts the synthesis of the extracellular matrix (neosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans - GAGs) by +29% in the skin’s tissues (compared to the control). Several in vivo tests [2] have made it possible to objectify different claims: – Crow’s feet smoothing (LifeViz Micro image analysis), -12.3% of wrinkle volume;
– Smoothing of the nasolabial fold (LifeViz Micro image analysis): -22.2% of the nasolabial fold;
– Plumps up the cheek volume (LifeViz Micro image analysis), +6% plumping effect;
– Increase in skin tonicity (measured by cutometry), +15.2% skin firmness;
– Redensification of the dermis (ultrasound measurement), +17.3% dermal density. Agrimer recommends using Algafiller for anti-aging and post-menopausal care applications in concentrations of 1% to 3%."
"Will bamboo, apple, chebula be the natural beauty ingredients to star in 2023?","The cosmetics industry’s enthusiasm for natural ingredients does not seem to be weakening! After prickly pear and rice — two of the essential beauty allies of 2022 — here are three new ingredients poised to become next year’s essentials. Bamboo is not unknown in the cosmetics sector, but interest in this plant is growing as we head into 2023, and for many reasons. Bamboo — and, more precisely, the natural silica it contains — has multiple benefits for the skin. It can be found in beauty as a hydrolat or hydrosol to deeply nourish dry and dehydrated skin, and is also favoured for its regenerative power. This property makes it a must in anti-aging treatments, whether to help preserve skin firmness or fight against wrinkles and fine lines. Bamboo is a major beauty partner thanks to is its ability to meet the needs of almost all skin types, since it is also beneficial for combination to oily skin thanks to its mattifying power. It’s even good for damaged hair and nails, and in powder form, it can help fight excessive perspiration. The many health benefits of the crunchy fruit are well known. Recently, the apple has made a foray into fashion, emerging as a potential alternative to animal leathers. And it’s now finding its way into cosmetics, ready to land in 2023, thanks to its anti-aging virtues and other skin benefits. Rich in polyphenols and quercetin, apples promise to act on the various signs of skin aging, starting with loosening, reduced firmness, and wrinkles. But that’s not all. Apple could also act on skin renewal, and protect it against future aggression from external factors, such as pollution, for example, while nourishing dry skin. As in many cosmetics, the fruit, used in association with other natural ingredients, could even be an ally for combination skin suffering from excess sebum. Known in Ayurvedic medicine, chebula can have many names, such as chebulic myrobalan or haritaki, and is considered a miracle ingredient in some countries and regions, including India and Tibet, because of its countless benefits. According to Ayurveda, it has anti-inflammatory virtues that are beneficial for the skin as well as for the body, not to mention anti-aging properties that make it effective in smoothing and firming skin, and making it more elastic. This is due to its high antioxidant content. In addition, this all-purpose ingredient could contribute to strengthening and rebuilding the skin barrier, helping it to protect it against certain external factors, while moisturizing the skin in depth. These virtues are already winning over people around the world, according to the latest report from the online cosmetics specialist, Beauty Pie. It reports that chebula is one of the strongest trends in skincare in 2023, with an unprecedented jump of 922% in Google search volume over one year. Watch out for this essential beauty ally in the coming months."
Tick tock: Seppic regulates skin clock genes with Centella asiatica,"Sleep disorders constitute a global problem that threatens health, but also skin quality. Seppic addresses consumers’ sleep-related issues with TALADVANCE™: an extract of Malagasy leaves of Centella asiatica that regulates skin chronobiology and has significant effects on skin radiance and suppleness, thanks to an action during both day and night. Healthy skin has its own rhythm, with defense and repair mechanisms renewing skin like clockwork. This rhythm is circadian and follows a 24-hour cycle, during day and night times. Skin circadian rhythm results in specific molecules that interact with cells throughout the body and whose synthesis is controlled by biological clock genes. Sleep deprivation can greatly influence skin health and disrupt our circadian rhythms, resulting in increased signs of skin aging (fine lines, uneven pigmentation, reduced elasticity, signs of fatigue), with much slower recovery rates after skin barrier disruption and lower satisfaction with appearance. An in vitro model in chronobiology developed by Seppic highlights that TALADVANCE™ regulates skin clock genes and resynchronizes fibroblasts. 
In this way, TALADVANCE™ participates in the restoration and maintenance of the skin homeostasis, and so restores the skin circadian rhythm when deregulated. Clinically, TALADVANCE™ showed a significant effect to reach a healthy skin, thanks to an action during both day and night. Indeed at 2%, after 28 days, it improves skin suppleness tested at night and skin luminosity and radiance tested during the day. Additionally, in only 30 minutes, TALADVANCE™ at 5% visibly improves skin radiance, uniformity and tone. Easy to formulate, TALADVANCE™ can help to formulate trendy cosmetic products and in particular to target pre-bed occasions with skin care products."
Tunisia: Prickly pear producers predict cacti cosmetics cash-in,"""This is the capital of the Barbary fig,"" said Mohamed Rochdi Bannani, one of the North African country’s first producers of cosmetic oil from the seeds of the fruit — better known as the prickly pear. He is hoping the oil, with its rich antioxidant properties and a price tag of some 350 euros (around USD 360) a litre, can bring wealth to the marginalised province of Kasserine, Tunisia. ""This fruit has changed my life and the life of the region. It’s created wealth in the district, even though the fruit used to be a symbol of poverty,"" the 52-year-old said. He was standing on his 420-hectare (about 1,000-acre) organic-certified farm in the parched Zelfen district. Every year, Bannani produces 2,000 litres of oil from the plant, which is native to Mexico but has been cultivated in North Africa, South of Spain and Sicily for generations. Used in moisturising and anti-ageing products, it is a much-needed cash cow in a region where one third of people live in poverty and unemployment runs at 20 percent. The cactus plant’s ability to weather extreme drought is another advantage. Some 30,000 hectares of land are dedicated to the crop in Zelfen, close to the border with Algeria. Around a tenth of that is organic-certified. The industry employs some 5,000 people, says Boubaker Raddaoui of the United Nations-backed Market Access Project for Agrifood and Local Products (PAMPAT). ""This oil has become a catalyst for an inclusive local economy,"" he said, praising the cactus for its ""ability to adapt and produce in difficult conditions, as well as its industrial potential"". ""It’s really a miracle plant,"" added Mr. Raddaoui. Tunisia ranks fifth in the world in terms of land devoted to prickly pear production, behind Brazil, Mexico, Ethiopia and Morocco. While some of the 550,000 tonnes of fruit it produces every year are sold in markets and from street carts known as ""hindi"", most goes to oil. Some 8,000 litres were exported in 2021, bringing in five million euros in revenue, according to PAMPAT. The organisation has been helping farmers with training and business advice since 2013, and has seen rapid growth in the sector, Raddaoui said. ""Exports jumped by 50 percent between 2019 and 2021,"" he told AFP. ""This shows the attractiveness of the sector and the increase in demand from one year to the next."" Since the start of the millennium, the country has gone from having five processing plants to 55. Zelfen alone has 11, run by cooperatives. ""Before, everyone just wanted to emigrate, but today that’s ancient history — thanks to the oil,"" said Hamza Rochdi, a young farmer with 40 hectares of land. Hanane Messaoudi, who harvests the fruit for the minimum wage of just USD 125 a month, says demand for the fruit has improved her working conditions. Yet the high price of its oil is not the prickly pear’s only asset. In a dry country where access to water is already far below the 1,700 cubic metres per resident per year the United Nations defines as ""water stressed"", the drought-tolerant cactus is a safer bet compared with thirstier crops. ""The prickly pear is undemanding, adapts to lots of soil types and doesn’t use much water,"" Raddaoui said. The success of the crop in Zelfen has prompted farmers in other regions such as Nabeul and Kairouan to take an interest. But there is only so much demand for the product, and Bannani says ""marketing problems"" mean he only processes around a fifth of his harvest — some 20,000 tonnes of fruit — for oil."
Is chebula the new trendy anti-aging ingredient?,"Connoisseurs may know the ingredient under the name of ’chebulic myrobolan,’ the fruit of the Terminalia chebula or Haritaki, especially followers of Ayurveda, the ancient traditional Indian medicine. Rich in luteic acid and gallic acids called chebulin, it is starting to make a name for itself in the cosmetics sector in the United States, under the name ’chebula’. Well known for its anti-inflammatory, detoxifying, regenerating, chebula could easily be described as a multifunctional ingredient in some countries and regions, including India and Tibet. But that’s not all, thanks to is antioxidant virtues, the chebula is becoming a go-to in antiaging skincare routines in recent years, since it would help to smoothing and firming skin and making it more elastic. Paired with other moisturizing ingredients, it would also provide deep nourishment to the skin and help protect it against external aggressions. Among others, it can be found in True Botanicals’ Chebula Active Face Serum and Renew Chebula Extreme Skin Barrier Cream, in the Super Hydrate Overnight Mask by Paula’s Choice, and in Derma MD Skincare’s Chebula Skin Renew Antioxidant Serum. Highly coveted in the skincare realm, chebula is starting to appear in many beauty players’ trend predictions for the coming year. According to the latest report from online cosmetics platform Beauty Pie, chebula is making its way into the top 10 skincare trends of 2023, with a dramatic 922% increase in search volume on Google over the course of a year. The beauty specialist even expects a boom of some cosmetics based on the natural anti-aging ingredient within a few months."
Berkem upcycles French kiwi leaves to create a new active skincare ingredient,"Ki’Leaft is a 100% natural COSMOS-certified extract of kiwi (Actinidia chinensis) leaves. The new active ingredient is upcycled [1] from crop by-products from farms located near the Berkem Group’s extraction plant, in Dordogne, in the south-west of France. According to Berkem, Ki’Leaft meets market needs in new naturel active ingredients offering antioxidant, firming and regenerative properties, while also reinforcing the skin’s barrier function. The culmination of 10 years of research and development Ki’Leaft is an active ingredient rich in sugars and containing polyphenols [2]. Clinical studies have shown that Ki’Leaft provides an immediate tightening effect, contributes to skin regeneration, and strengthens the skin’s barrier function and structure. It also shows a high antioxidant capacity. “Ki’Leaft meets the cosmetics market’s expectations by offering benefits for the facial care market (serum, face treatments, etc.) which has experienced annual worldwide growth of 10% since 2020, [3]” highlights Berkem. Located near the main French kiwifruit farms, the Berkem factory in Gardonne, in the south-west of France, benefits from an easily accessible source of raw materials from controlled and certified organic cultivation. Indeed, the Nouvelle Aquitaine region accounts for 75% of French kiwi production. While the leaf picked with the fruit is mostly discarded during harvest, the new active ingredient developed by the Berkem Group brings this renewable resource to a second and high-value life. “With 30 years of experience in plant extraction, Groupe Berkem, a developer of plant-based chemistry solutions, constantly seeks to be a pioneer of innovative solutions in the field of health, beauty and nutrition sectors. The development of this new active ingredient with remarkable benefits by upcycling meets the demands of our customers in the cosmetics industry, both professionals and major brands, while also illustrating our Group’s CSR commitments,” says Charlène Martin, Marketing Manager, Groupe Berkem."

Merck: A trio of marine skincare ingredients to boost skin renewal,"Presented at the latest in-cosmetics Asia trade show, that took place in Bangkok, Thailand, from November 1-3, 2022, Merck’s new cosmetic active RonaCare JouvaMer and RonaCare ReviMer, have been designed to boost skin vitality and to be used within a wide range of topical products, from daily skin care to dermocosmetics. The products were recently launched in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The two products have been developed from brown seaweed endemic to the Breton coast in France. RonaCare JouvaMer [1], an extract of Pelvetia canaliculata brown algae, is an anti- aging booster that reduces wrinkles by stimulating collagen synthesis. Additionally, it protects and supports the extracellular matrix for denser, smoother skin. RonaCare ReviMer [2], an extract of Fucus serratus brown algae, shows preventive anti-pollution effects while enhancing the skin’s biomechanical properties. It also protects hyaluronic acid that helps provide firmer, more elastic skin, and reduces wrinkles. Complementing the already launched RonaCare RenouMer [3], the new ingredients form a marine trio that offers potent solutions for skin renewal. Indeed, according to Merck, RonaCare RenouMer, an extract of Polysiphonia elongata red algae, is highly effective in replenishing skin and counteracting the signs of aging. This skin moisture booster strongly increases skin’s moisture levels, promotes collagen build-up and its protection from degradation, which results in a re-densifying effect for visibly smoother, less wrinkled skin. “Algae have been used for centuries as very nutritious food ingredients because of their important minerals and vitamins for the body,” explained Carsten Plueg, Head of Innovation and Application within the Surface Solutions business unit of Merck. “Today, also the cosmetic industry is using those algae substances and the benefits they have on human skin. These marine actives are indeed particularly attractive for consumers as they combine the desire for naturalness and sustainability with proven efficacy in boosting well-aging and skin vitality.” According to Merck, all three products are efficacy proven and meet the current requirements of sustainability, traceability, and respect for biodiversity. Merck has established mutually agreed terms with France to financially contribute to and collaborate with the regional Fisheries and Aquaculture Committee of Brittany (CRPMEM) as part of the Nagoya protocol. RonaCare JouvaMer, RonaCare ReviMer and RonaCare RenouMer are Halal certified and vegan. They also fulfill the COSMOS-standard, which defines the requirements for organic and/or natural cosmetics."
Symrise stretches the boundaries of naturalness in perfumery,"Obtaining 100% natural fruit extracts and extracting odoriferous compounds from the fruits, known for their high water content, is a real challenge since distilling water is very complicated and traditional extraction methods do not work. This is where Symrise’s SymTrap extraction technology comes into play. Derived from the synergy between the Food and Fine Fragrance Symrise Divisions, SymTrap is used to extract odorant compounds from an ingredient in its aqueous state. This includes rinse water or residual juices produced by the extraction, distillation and freeze-drying of plants, fruits and vegetables. The technology can therefore be used to upcycle those waters and juices that will no longer go to waste. As it requires only a small amount of energy, SymTrap also has the advantage of a reduced carbon footprint. After a preview in July at the World Perfumery Congress in Miami, Symrise showcased at Beautyworld Middle East a range of fruity alcoholates that add up to the Garden Lab collection to form a range dubbed “Supernature”. “After the successful launch of our Garden Lab range, we continued our constant exchanges with our Taste, Nutrition and Health colleagues. They introduced us to their banana food production line from Ecuador and mentioned the resulting water phase side stream. We immedialtely saw the opportunity to develop a Banana SymTrap,” said Jennifer Buffalo, Laboratory Manager Natural Ingredients at Symrise. This creation was completed by three other alcoholates: Apple SymTrap, which offers a crunchy Granny Smith facet evolving into black tea and floral undertones, Strawberry SymTrap, and Blackcurant SymTrap, reminding the notes of blackcurrant liqueur from the Burgundy region and blackcurrent ice cream. Many other creations are possible and Symrise already has a Maracuja SymTrap, made from passion fruit, and a Cranberry SymTrap. “The history of perfumery has always been about exploring new and original notes. As explorers we are at the forefront of driving circularity through sustainable ingredient innovation,” highlights Ricardo Omori, President Global Fine Fragrance at Symrise. The Supernature range, as well as Symrise’s other fragrance ingredients - in particular the Madagascar and Artisan collections - are now gathered within Maison Lautier 1795, named after the Grasse-based supplier who had merged over the 1990s with the German company Haarmann & Reimer, which became Symrise in 2003. New generations of fragrance ingredients from green chemistry, white chemistry, and biotechnologies will be presented, among many other topics, at the next edition of the Fragrance Innovation Summit on December 1, 2022 in Paris .

Seppic creates hybrid foundations using hydrophilic pigments,"According to Seppic, the make-up market is in the midst of a revolution, the buzzword of which is “skincarization”, a trend where the logic of skincare extends to new categories. As a result: consumers now expect makeup products that take special care of their skin. The influence of skincare on make-up not only reflects in the use of skincare active ingredients in formulas, but also in the creation of innovative textures. “To create sensorial textures, inspired by skin care (O/W foundation, cream gel, ...) involving external water phases, formulators need Hydrophilic Coated Pigments to optimize foundation coverage and achieve good make-up performance,” says the company in statement. Therefore, Seppic has challenged its polymers and emulsifiers to obtain compatibility data with hydrophilic pigments in powder form and in dispersed liquid form. “The results will help formulators to choose the suitable products and build nice textures with this kind of pigment,” deems the subsidiary of the Air Liquide group. Among the polymers that were tested, Sepimax Zen (Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6) has proven to be the best performing polymer, while Solagum AX (Acacia Senegal Gum and Xanthan Gum), emerged as the best natural polymer. According to Seppic, various other polymers give good performance results too, such as Sepinov EMT 10 (Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer), Sepiplus S (Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer and Polyisobutene and PEG-7 Trimethylolpropane Cononut Ether), Sepiplus 400 (Polyacrylate-13 and Polyisobutene and Polysorbate 20) & Simulgel NS (Hydroxyethylacrylate/Sodium AcryloyldimethylTaurate Copolymer and Squalane and Polysorbate 60). Of course, it is possible to adjust the percentage of polymers and emulsifiers for a wide range of viscosities. For emulsifiers, several ingredients are performing depending on the requested sensoriality: Sensanov WR (C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate and C20-22 Alcohols), Montanov 202 (Arachidyl Alcohol and Behenyl Alcohol and Arachidyl Glucoside), Fluidifeel Easy (Lauryl Glucoside and Myristyl Glucoside and Polyglyceryl-6 Laurate) ... Thus, Seppic can offer solutions ranging from comfortable to high natural foundations, from thick to fluid textures. As consumers are increasingly looking for no-transfer and high coverage efficacy, Seppic has done some measurement in emulsion chassis. “Our simple formulas are non-transfert like a W/Si market benchmark and obtained better results than a water based foundation benchmark,” claims the company."
Silab’s Lightskin: a new depigmenting active from natural origin,"Lightskin is a natural depigmenting active ingredient obtained from biotechnological processes, rich in sulfur-containing peptides known for their capacity to limit melanogenesis. “Pigment defects are thus attenuated, complexion is lighter and more uniform, and radiance is revived in Caucasian and Asian skin,” said Silab in a statement. For this new active, Silab tapped into the potential of sulfur-containing peptides, a series of molecules known for their transversal ability to limit melanogenesis. Thus, Silab has selected the yeast Ogataea siamensis, whose natural capacity to produce sulfur-containing molecules constitutes a considerable selective advantage for its development in the phyllosphere of the medicinal plant Ervatamia coronaria. Building on its 15 years of expertise in biotechnologies, the French manufacturer was able to develop a unique process for bioguiding this yeast, specifically stimulating the production of large quantities of these molecules of interest. According to Silab, this richness in bioguided sulfur-containing peptides enabled the global depigmenting action of Lightskin to be doubled on Caucasian and Asian melanocytes, significantly limiting tyrosinase activity and melanin production. This efficacy was also demonstrated in pro-pigmenting contexts of pollution (receptor related to pollution (AhR) inactivated) and glycation (expression of the receptor for AGEs inhibited), the company highlighted. Lightskin was evaluated in volunteers selected on the presence of pigment spots, and more specifically on their high level of AGEs (Caucasian panel) or their history of living in polluted environments (Asian panel). “The results showed that the active ingredient at 2.5% reduces the appearance of spots after 56 days of treatment on both panels. Uniformity of the complexion is thus improved, and radiance is revived. 91% of Asian volunteers stated that their complexion was more uniform and brighter, and their spots less visible,” claimed Silab. With its targeted performance, Lightskin is a patented active ingredient recommended in all depigmenting care products at the amount of 0.25 to 2.50%. Available in aqueous solution, it complies with biodiversity regulations and has a natural origin content of 98.8% (ISO 16128). It meets international cosmetic regulations requirements (Europe, United States, China, Japan, etc.)."
Givaudan adds Scentaurus Melrose to their range of biodegradable fragrances,"Scentaurus Melrose is the latest addition to Givaudan’s palette of biodegradable fragrance precursors. This class of fragrances are designed to release fragrant molecules upon exposure to a natural external trigger such as oxygen, light, or humidity in the air. Using this technology for fragrance creation allows to bring long lastingness to fragrances in products such as fabric or home and personal care products. “It is a novel way of formulating that reinvents fragrance architecture by delivering some notes at later stages in order to satisfy consumer needs for performance and long lastingness,” explains Givaudan in a statement. Scentaurus Melrose adds to the existing family of fragrance precursors first introduced in 2006 with Scentaurus Tonkarose, the first light cleavable precursor in the perfumer’s palette, and the first to release two different odorants. The palette has grown to currently include Scentaurus Tonkarose, Scentaurus Clean, Scentaurus Juicy and Scentaurus Berry, each with a versatile olfactive profile that expands and enhances the cross-category creative range of Givaudan’s perfumers. Each Scentaurus ingredient is exclusive to the company. Scentaurus Melrose was developed according to the principles of Green Chemistry using Givaudan’s proprietary FiveCarbon Path where all carbon atoms in the bio-based starting material end up in the final product, resulting in zero carbon waste. “This exclusive research and development process brings an eco-minded approach to continuously improve the palette of fragrance ingredients by using materials based on renewable carbon while improving processes to reduce carbon and energy input,” adds the company. Scentaurus Melrose expands the company’s variety of scents with a long-lasting floral green effect with honey and linden blossom facets, and floral fresh rosy signals with powdery anisic undertones. “The first time I smelled Scentaurus Melrose, I found myself back on the French Riviera where I grew up, amidst the mimosa fields with their delicate combination of green, floral and powdery notes. In addition to its obvious green and honey notes, Melrose has a soft, powdery floral facet, making it an amazing precursor for adding a natural green floral character to any creation,” commented Paolo Andriollo, Givaudan Perfumer."
"Afyren launches industrial production of biosourced, low-carbon molecules","Fermentation is most definitely a remarkable source of alternative solutions to petrol-based chemistry! Initiated as soon as 2012 by PhD in Biology and Chemistry Jérémy Pessiot, Afyren’s strategy is aimed to replace the petroleum-based molecules essential to a wide variety of industries for their antibacterial, olfactory, and preservation properties with their biosourced equivalent. On September 29, the company reached the industrial phase of its project with the inauguration of its first biorefinery, Afyren Neoxy, which is meant to produce biosourced carboxylic acids. “This way, we will combine profitability and environmental protection with a zero-waste plant and very low CO2 emissions, since they are divided by five, compared to conventional solutions. And all this is done following circular economy principles”, explains Joachim Merziger, Afyren’s Marketing Director. The Afyren technology is based on the biomimetic fermentation of GMO-free co-products of the sugar industry. It helps produce a family of seven fully biosourced, very high-quality, extremely pure organic acids with between two and six carbon atoms. The Afyren acids meet the definition of natural aromas under Regulation (EC) no. 1334/2008 and are Ecocert- and Cosmos-certified. It is a short-channel European offering with a very satisfactory traceability. The acids produced can be used as such, as ingredients, or transformed into derivatives for the cosmetics and perfumes industries, for example. The Afyren propionic acid, which is only available as a petroleum-based product for now, will help create esters used as fragrances or aromas. As for acetic acid, it is used to produce nail varnish ingredients. “This family of acids is a toolkit for new, fully biosourced derivatives. The acid market in general is estimated at 13 billion euros, so it offers a huge potential for substituting substances derived from fossil resources with biosourced ingredients”, says Merziger. “Many cosmetics and perfumes players have set up very ambitious programmes to make their products more sustainable, and we offer them solutions and tools”, adds the Director. Since it became a publicly listed company in 2021, Afyren has been able to raise 70 million euros, finance R&D work, and start building this first industrial unit. They are now considering the possibility to implement this production in other geographical areas (North America and South-East Asia) for openings in 2026/2027. “The idea is to meet the demands of our global customers in the three major industrial hubs, i.e. Europe, Asia, and North America. Biomass supplies will be local: it is a key element of Afyren’s strategy. We aim to keep the benefits of a short channel and a reduced carbon footprint, and to secure our customers’ supplies,” explains Merziger. Afyren received support via the AFTER-BIOCHEM project, a skill pool of 12 European companies which validated the industrial project and the relevance of the products use. “It is a project in the project”, emphasizes Merziger. “Launched by Afyren, AFTER-BIOCHEM gathers participants from five European countries to strengthen the whole upstream-downstream chain around this first biorefinery. These players come from different sectors, like Südzucker, the main sugar leader and our co-product supplier, cosmetics expert Fiabila, Firmenich, for aromas and perfumes, representatives of human and animal nutrition, industrial chemistry…,” he concludes."
"""Sustainability is a full part of TechnicoFlor’s DNA,"" Bérengère Bourgarel","When did the question of sustainability arise at TechnicoFlor? Bérengère Bourgarel - The group has been developing 100% natural products for 15 years and is one of the pioneers in this field. Sustainability is deeply ingrained in our DNA. We launched a CSR approach in 2013, which led to the creation of fair trade channels, the launch of natural formulations, and the integration of fair trade materials in our compositions. Today, we can say that we are experts in natural and sustainable formulations. We took an even bigger step in terms of sustainability two years ago with the launch of numerous initiatives, including a tool that calculates the biodegradability of our perfume formulas, a responsible purchasing policy, and an eco-score that evaluates the impact of our formulas on the entire production chain, from creation to delivery of the perfume to our customers. What solutions has the group implemented in order to move in the direction of ever more natural and sustainable formulas and compositions? Bérengère Bourgarel - When we think of perfume, we often think of the bottle and cap, but the perfume itself, the juice, must also become more environmentally sustainable. To do this, we have to make shorter formulas and use ingredients — raw materials — that are increasingly sustainable. So for that we had to get informed, conduct research, and try to understand alongside suppliers how we could proceed, knowing that this is as much about naturality as it is about the process. This year, we managed to launch a collection from upcycled raw materials, and we realized that some materials were already upcycled, such as clementine peel, without being considered as such. We now have about 30 upcycled raw materials, both synthetic and natural, and this collection also meets a very strict environmental specification. Each of the perfumes had to be composed of one of these materials, have a biodegradability index of over 80%, and include a maximum of fair trade ingredients. How does upcycling work in the world of fragrance? Bérengère Bourgarel - At TechnicoFlor, we do not produce raw materials. We buy them from our suppliers, either in powder or liquid form, and then we create our compositions from what we have sourced. The challenge is to only source raw materials from our suppliers that are upcycled. And they can come from different industries; this has allowed us to discover different olfactory facets that we didn’t know. There are, for example, wood shavings that are recovered from woodworking, white wine lees from the deposit collected in barrels, and cocoa pods which, surprisingly enough, have odorant molecules. In the long run, we will inevitably find other raw materials to use. Today, there is a huge waste problem, and upcycling allows us to try to propose solutions. Is there some difficulty in combining the art of conventional perfumery with techniques or solutions that are less harmful to the environment? Bérengère Bourgarel - Creating a perfume with strict specifications is necessarily a challenge, but that’s also what’s interesting about this job. You have to dig deep, push your creativity, and find a new way of working. It just takes a little more time. There are going to be more and more constraints, so you just have to adapt and be creative. Waste is at the centre of attention these days, becoming the raw material of choice in many sectors. Is it really a sustainable solution? Bérengère Bourgarel - We’ll find out in the future. We are inevitably moving towards this, because thanks to biotechnology we can obtain almost anything we want. As natural resources are gradually depleted, the perfumery sector, like other industries, could in the future rely on biotechnology. In any case, there is true awareness in the perfumery industry, and things are evolving very quickly in terms of environmental responsibility. This can only be a good thing. Would you go as far as saying that you bottle waste? Bérengère Bourgarel - I don’t know if I would go that far. The word ’waste’ is so pejorative... We have the image of something that is not engaging, that does not smell good, the opposite of perfumery finally. But it’s undoubtedly the future. We are going to run out of space one day on Earth, and waste takes up a lot of it, it’s problematic, so upcycling is inevitably part of the future of perfumery. What’s the next step in perfumery in order to adopt an even more responsible model? Bérengère Bourgarel - As I said earlier, the next step will be biotechnology. This is the ultimate in environmental responsibility."
Lubrizol offers exposome protection with multifunctional biotech ingredient,"LLS Beauty’s new Xpozuki [1] active ingredient has been designed to protect the skin, scalp and hair against exposome-induced stressors, defined as the totality of exposures to which an individual is subjected throughout its life, including from the sun, pollution and climate change, as well as chemical and physical aggressions. These factors, combined with the body’s response to each, can lead to premature signs of aging. This multifunctional, biotechnological ingredient is sourced from organically farmed azuki beans  or red mung bean (Vigna angularis). They are rich in a category of natural peptides - that LLS Beauty has named Azukides - which have shown to be responsible for the antioxidant effects of the ingredients. Thanks to proprietary biotechnological processes, LLS Beauty has been able to enrich the content of Azukides in the ingredient. Xpozuki is made of 100% content of natural origin, as defined by the ISO 16128 standard. According to Lubrizol, Xpozuki prevents, defends and repairs damage in the skin, scalp and hair linked to the exposome. Testing has shown the ingredient provides: – Skin, scalp and hair protection, defence and repair from exposome damage.
– More protected skin barrier and improved skin appearance, including a more even and brighter skin tone, minimized skin redness and improved surface texture irregularities.
– Improved multiethnic hair vitality with less split ends, improved hair fibre alignment and curl definition and reduced hair frizz and volume. The firm thus highlights  Xpozuki is adapted to all ethnicities, allowing everybody to enjoy outdoor activities while protecting their skin, hair and scalp against exposome-induced stressors."
Givaudan Active Beauty launches radish-based purple pigment for make-up,"Givaudan Active Beauty is launching New Purple 2364 [1], a vegan pigment designed for use in make-up formulations. Extracted by green fractionation from red radish (Raphanus Sativus L.), this new pigment complements Givaudan’s range of sustainable alternatives to synthetic pigments initiated in 2020 with the launch of New Red 1805, a vegan red pigment. “For centuries, purple has been valued in different cultures as a colour representing elegance, consciousness and power. Named colour of the year 2022 by Pantone, purple has earned a place as one of the hottest shades in make-up formulation and among those that go best with all skin tones,” explained Givaudan Active Beauty in a statement. According to the company, new Purple 2364 shows exceptional stability to temperature exposure and light radiation when formulated at 10%. Clinical evaluations on three different complexions (African, Asian and Caucasian) have also showed the pigment offers a vivid, intense and homogeneous colour when applied on lips, lids or nails. Givaudan Active Beauty conducted a consumer study in France with regular makeup users aged 18 to 50, and found that 88% of respondents considered New Purple 2364  as a trendy shade. Moreover, 84% of them felt that the colour went well with their skin tone. [2] Givaudan also designed the new pigment to meet the current craze for multifunctional ingredients. New Purple 2364 thus offers anti-oxidation, anti-glycation and anti-hyaluronidase protection for skin and nails. To illustrate the properties of New Purple 2364 , the Givaudan Active Beauty formulation team has created a creamy vibrant and sustainable eyeshadow dubbed “Cosmic purple”. Featuring several Givaudan exclusive ingredients, including New Purple 2364, Omegablue and Cristalhyal e-Perfection, the product combines high-impact colour, pigmentation, soothing and smoothing effects. “New Purple 2364 is more than a vibrant pigment - it responds to consumer values with 100% vegan and natural origin content,” highlights Yohan Rolland, Personal Care Category Manager for Active Beauty at Givaudan Active Beauty."
"Takasago unveils a range of pure, intense materials","Last June, Takasago opened its doors to the press to reveal a range of new products: the series of captive molecules – for its exclusive use – and specialties – designed for the market – was focused on three main principles: green tech, the beauty of purity, and the olfactory signature (long wear, diffusion). To perfumer Aurélien Guichard, “Green chemistry and ingredient purity have been two major pillars for Takasago since the 1970s. But sometimes, this purity is counterbalanced by a lack of power. By offering materials with more impact, the new palette sharpens perfumers’ creativity.” Takasago’s care for the environment includes synthesizing ingredients both derived from natural resources (biobased) and biodegradable. Pine trees and upcycled materials, which can be obtained by distilling orange, for example, like limonene, make it possible to create biobased molecules with at least 50% of renewable carbon. These include biomuguet, an intense floral and ozonic note which results in a thrush scent that does not fall under IFRA’s restrictions on lyral and lilial. Other ingredients are derived from white biotechnologies based on the ancestral Japanese expertise in fermentation. Sugar cane is transformed into aromatic molecules thanks to enzymes like yeast and bacteria. This highly environmentally friendly, energy-efficient process does not require petroleum derivatives. A result of this technique, biocyclamol offers a long-lasting, rose floral note whose freshness and transparency add a modern touch to thrush. Minimalism and purity Takasago’s creativity is also guided by the Shibui aesthetics, i.e. the beauty of purity: a minimalist creative style for simple formulas with fewer ingredients, since they are purer and have more impact. That is where the secret of Takasago’s expertise lies: creating pure materials thanks to chiral chemistry. This process, which won a Nobel Prize in 2001, is aimed to replicate a biobased or natural fragrant body in its purest state. This technique offloads the ingredient from its roughness to only keep the most interesting part, olfactory-wise, and the closest to nature. That is how they obtained L-Citronellyl Acetate (84% of natural origin), a complex, faceted, addictive note with fruity, floral, metallic hints. The other innovation concerns the creation of CX ingredients, purified versions of already-known molecules. Originally in the form of crystals, these materials undergo a second crystallization aimed to beautify them. Stripped of their least refined facets, they reveal new olfactory undertones. Ambroxan CX, the purified version of this very popular amber wood, puts an emphasis on mineral and animal tones with an intensity which makes it even more addictive. The third creative principle of this new palette is the creation of concise formulas with ingredients with more impact. Synthesis is no longer about mimicking nature, it is about exceeding limits. Cutting-edge technologies help obtain materials which offer higher performances in terms of long wear and trail, as well as molecules with innovative facets. The latter are a real breath of fresh air for perfumers, who draw creative ideas from them. Pamplefix, a captive molecule whose freshness reveals an astonishing persistence, given the category (green, citrus), perfectly combines with woody notes. In addition, these molecules do not necessarily fall under restrictive regulations, for example if iconic materials are replaced. Sakura Salicylate, a soft floral note, can replace the benzyl salicylates recently limited by IFRA, to create a solar scent. All in all, about fifteen ingredients were created to offer perfumers a new playground. This palette results from a long development process, since it takes at least five years, starting from the discovery of a molecule, to assess it, possibly industrialize it, and register it. Among several thousand proposals, only a few get through all the validation steps. This long, hard work should eventually be completed with the expertise of neurosciences to measure the emotional and holistic impact of the molecules on consumers."

Solvay launches a new range of low carbon footprint biosurfactants,"Solvay has introduced Mirasoft SL L60 and Mirasoft SL A60 - two new high-performance biosurfactants that enable the development of more sustainable beauty care products. Based on rapeseed oil and sugar with low environmental and carbon footprint, these glycolipid biosurfactants are suitable for a broad range of applications in beauty and personal care products, such as shampoos, conditioners, shower gels, face washes and creams. The two new bio-surfactants are designed to provide the same performance as synthetic ingredients without harmful environmental effects. Made from a fermentation process that Solvay describes as “cost-effective”, Mirasoft SL L60 and Mirasoft SL A60 are 100% biobased and biodegradable. “With the potential of a net neutral carbon footprint in the near future, biosurfactants represent a step-change technology in the eco-design of next-generation beauty care products. The eco-profile of Mirasoft SL L60 and Mirasoft SL A60 is truly a breakthrough compared to conventional, fossil fuel-based surfactants”, said Galder Cristobal, research & innovation director, Home & Personal Care at Solvay. The launch of the new Mirasoft range aligns with Solvay’s most recent growth platform on “Renewable materials and biotechnology”, which aims to meet the growing demand for sustainable solutions by increasing the share of renewable carbon in the group’s product offering. The aim of the new platform is to increase the share of renewable carbon [1] in Solvay’s product offering and developing new business opportunities enabled by biotechnology. It complements Solvay’s three existing growth platforms – Battery Materials, Green Hydrogen and Thermoplastic Composites. The Solvay group has set itself the objectives of increasing by 2030 the share of sustainable solutions in its sales to 65% and more than doubling the share in its sales of products based on circular raw materials or energy compared to 2018, as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030. “This product launch underlines both our commitment to surfactants technology and our long-term vision for the future,” commented Jean-Guy Le Helloco, global vice president, home and personal care at Solvay. “We focus on future technology shifts to enable our customers to reach their sustainability goals.”"
"Aqua Natco, the very first technology for perfumes of natural origin in water","The Aqua Natco technology is introduced as a first technique on a market driven by consumer demand for alternative, alcohol-free perfumes of natural origin with a low environmental impact. Expressions Parfumées aimed to meet this demand and their customers’ by developing a new technology adapted to 100% COSMOS compositions. “When you work with perfumes of natural origin and water, you encounter two major issues. The main one is solubility, since a perfume is mainly composed of lipophilic raw materials. The second is solvation [1], to obtain an even, transparent liquid perfume,” explains Jennifer Buzzi, Development & Innovation Director. Until recently, the charge in water of a perfume composed of materials of natural origin was limited to low doses from 1 to 3%. Now, the Aqua Natco system allows for a high perfume dose of about 10% – a standard concentration in fine perfumery. By solving solubility and solvation issues, Aqua Natco also makes it possible to work with an unlimited olfactory palette and get perfectly transparent aqueous solutions. Since perfumery raw materials are not always in the liquid form – they can be powders, resins, or crystals – it is necessary to use solvents to get even, transparent perfumes. In addition, some raw materials of natural origin, in particular citrus essential oils, are hardly compatible with the existing solvents of natural origin. “There are very few solvents in COSMOS-certified perfumery. The most efficient in terms of water solubilization are also the least efficient as regards solvation with these raw materials,” explains the Manager. The solution developed by Expressions Parfumées consists of a mixture of two solvents, one of which is widely used in cosmetics, but very little in perfumery, together with a new solubilization system. “There is a real synergy between the two solvents which helps solve solvation and solubilization problems. And everything is COSMOS-certified: perfumes, solubilizing agents, preservatives, and solvents,” adds Jennifer Buzzi. The product derived from this technology is named AquaBoost Natco. It should be diluted at a concentration of 30% in water. In these 30%, there are 10% of extract and 20% of technology. “We are the first to have developed a solution to charge up to 10% of perfume of natural origin in water. It is also a turnkey technology. We sell a perfume ready to be diluted in water. Either the customer buys it to make their own dilution and add the preservative themselves, or we offer to do it all,” adds Jennifer Buzzi. According to the tests carried out by Expressions Parfumées, the Aqua Natco technology offers equal or even better olfactory results than alcohol-based versions. “We carried out tests on perfumes of different olfactory families and observed very high stability performance. 93% of the intensity was preserved after 4 hours, 85% after 24 hours. In addition, compared to alcohol, the intensity was the same or even better at the application, depending on the perfume references,” says the Director. As regards turbidity (measurement of cloudiness levels), the Aqua Natco perfumes offer a maximum index of 7 FNUs on a scale from 0 (transparency) to 200 (opacity). Lastly, according to a life cycle assessment carried out by the Evea agency, which took into account 16 environmental indicators from raw material extraction to end-of-life, the Aqua Natco technology offers a 6% reduced impact, compared to alcohol-based eaux de toilette."
Clariant launches online tool to calculate percentage formulation naturality,"Powered by standardized data on the Renewable Carbon/Natural Origin indices of over 800 Clariant and non-Clariant ingredients for personal care applications the new tool offers formulators and brands the chance to calculate the percentage natural content of a large array of formulations. In addition, the tool is designed to showcase the individual impact of specific ingredient choices on formulation naturality. “BeautyForward is always about understanding and addressing needs in personal care. There is evident increasing consumer preference for natural, specifically plant-based ingredients, as well as a growing expectation for brands to understand and communicate on naturality with transparency. Our calculator equips them to do this, by providing the necessary personal care ingredient data in an intuitive, digital format. We’re proud to support the creation of more sustainable personal care products,” said Hermann Bach, Global Head of Strategic Marketing and Innovation at Clariant. As the industry’s focus on developing lower impact beauty grows, Clariant steps up to standardize, quantify and share the naturality of personal care ingredients - including that of over 300 ingredients stemming from their own portfolio. The new tool calculates personal care formulation naturality according to the ISO 16128 [1] methodology and offers two options to aid research. First up, users can create their own new natural formulation from scratch, adding constituent ingredients in their respective quantities by INCI or trade name. Based on this, the individual ingredient’s naturality is provided, following the Renewable Carbon Index (RCI) for carbon-based ingredients, and the Natural Origin Index (NOI) if non-carbon-based. The tool continues by calculating the total formulation naturality based on each ingredient’s contribution. Alternatively, the users may opt for a more guided approach; the BeautyForward calculation tool comes equipped with a series of exemplary and customizable skin and hair care formulations, with up to 99% naturality. Users can copy the formulations and edit them, playing around with ingredient selection by adding and removing products to find the ideal fit for their needs and percentage natural content targets. Formulations can be saved within each user’s personal accounts for access and reference at a later date. To support with ingredient research, the tool also makes it possible for users to access more detailed ingredient information, as well as to request samples. The BeautyForward 6 tool is accessible on ClariHub personal care, Clariant’s free and customer-exclusive platform. Register is required to use all functionalities."
Oysters reveal their benefits and enter into cosmetic formulations,"Oyster-based cosmetics? The idea may seem far-fetched, even if the cosmetics industry already use a bunch of unusual ingredients. Indeed, much like broccoli or onions, oysters offer many interesting benefits for the skin. Brands interested in oysters use absolutely every part of it, from the flesh to the shell, claiming varied and diverse benefits, including anti-aging, purifying, remineralizing and cleansing for skin, hair and even dental health. Natural cosmetics brand Perlucine (created by the Aquatonale Group) is one of the brands that has been embracing the virtues of the oyster, more precisely the shell of the white oyster. Harvested by hand on the beaches of Brittany, France, oyster shells are carefully cleaned before being made into powder to enrich the formulas of different products, from facial cleansing powder to body scrubs, artisanal soaps, shampoo powder and even powdered toothpaste. The range is Ecocert Cosmos certified. Meanwhile French brand Edulis has recently released a range of cosmetics formulated with the extracts of patented oyster oils encapsulated in clay, in order to take advantage of the mollusk’s unique properties all day long. Created at Cap Ferret, this innovative line is more interested in the properties of the European flat oyster from the Arcachon Basin, called Ostrea Edulis. ""We have extracted natural active elements that are nourishing and stimulating, for a firmer, fresher feel and an immediate tightening effect that’s safe for skin,"" explains the brand. Currently Edulis has three products on offer — a serum, a day cream and a night cream — combining all the benefits of oyster extracts with those of ulva lactuca seaweed from Brittany, desert date palm oil, kokum butter and frankincense resin, all natural ingredients. Not content with only attracting attention in the cosmetics industry, oysters can also be transformed into a number of materials in order to reduce waste — and to also take advantage of its numerous benefits. Through upcycling, they can be transformed into natural fertilizer and even descaling material for household appliances. The calcium carbonate from the shells can also be used as a basis for creating alternative sustainable materials."
Gattefossé to build its first North American production site in Texas,"A specialist in lipid chemistry and plant extraction for the personal care and pharmaceutical industries, Gattefossé has settled its presence in North America in 1987. At that time, it was the Group’s first affiliate created overseas. To better address the needs of its customers, the French group opened a Technical Center of Excellence in 2017 in Paramus, New Jersey. The works of Gattefossé’s very first North American manufacturing facility in Lufkin, Texas, will be officially launched on Wednesday June 8th, 2022, during a ceremony with Gattefossé teams and officials of the city. This new asset will manufacture lipid-based specialty ingredients for the personal care and pharmaceutical industries and will enable to grow the global production capacity of the Group. Dubbed Gattex, the plant is expected to be up and running in 2024. ""Building a new production site in North America will enable the Group to respond to several strategic challenges. First, increasing our global production capacity and offering a back-up on three continents. Second, managing our ecological impacts thanks to reduced lead time in deliveries and to the eco design of the facility.  This major investment of 50+ million dollars is the most important project that the Group ever led in its history. This move is in line with our evolution from a medium sized company to a global industrial group established in its major markets,” explains Eduardo De Purgly, Gattefossé Group CEO. The Gattex project is in line with the CSR roadmap of the Group, known as Gatt’Up & Act. The production site will primarily service regional customers, thus limiting negative environmental impacts linked to intercontinental transportation. The plant will be LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified, a widely used green building rating system. “The presence of Gattefossé in North America started with the creation of Gattefossé USA in 1982. Since then, the organization has strongly grown. A significant milestone was the opening of the Technical Center of Excellence in 2017 in Paramus, New Jersey. The building of a brand-new manufacturing unit in Lufkin, Texas, is a milestone in line with our strategy to better penetrate North America, leading market for the pharmaceuticals  and personal care industries. It will improve customer intimacy while contributing to the local economy thanks to the creation of new jobs. Moreover, it will satisfy our customers’ demand for the ‘Made in the USA’ label,” says Éric Brun, President and CEO of Gattefossé USA and Canada. In addition to the main production site located in Lyon, France, Gattefossé currently operates two production lines in Singapore and Spain. Three Technical Centers of Excellence have also been created in India, China and the United States – in addition to the main lab in France - to offer an essential interface with both pharmaceutical and personal care customers worldwide, by providing formulation troubleshooting, inspiration and technical support."
Cosmetic textures: how IMCD plays with appearances,"Solid textures in all forms, waxes, powders, oily or aqueous emulsions… as naturalness and the search for more sustainable solutions became central to product development, cosmetic galenics gained much importance on the market. Indeed, if consumers look for natural and sustainable products, they are hardly willing to compromise on sensoriality, efficacy, and ease-of-use, which they got used to with modern cosmetics. “The natural origin index defined by standard ISO 16128 is one of our customers’ main criteria today. The percentage of ingredients of natural origin in a product has become a reference in cosmetics formulation”, confirms Anne-Sophie Gardes, EMEA Regional Technical Director Beauty & Personal Care at IMCD. To play this game, cosmetic formulation laboratories have to prove extremely creative in combining ingredients that offer both high levels of naturalness and the efficacy and pleasure of use expected. And there is a segment where you can definitely not make any compromise: sun protection! “When it comes to formulation, it is one of the trickiest categories today. You need to offer high protection levels, while meeting legitimate expectations as regards environmental protection and naturalness,” the scientist adds. Choices need to be made between the various filters available, depending on the protection spectrum wanted, the potential environmental impact, in particular on corals and marine organisms, local regulations, and brands’ “black lists”. A sponsor of the Sensory Bar at the last in-cosmetics Global show in Paris, IMCD Beauty & Personal Care had chosen to put forward this creative challenge with two sun care formulas boasting both innovative and astonishing textures: Extra Fluid Sunscreen, a waterless fluid sunscreen, and Hydra Sun Pearls, solid pearls containing 33% of water to spread on the skin. “We wanted to show that there can be a real gap between the look of formulas and their actual compositions. The former is milky, so it evokes an aqueous emulsion, and yet it is waterless. The latter is composed of small beads, so we expect an anhydrous formula with a lot of wax, but it actually contains water,” explains Anne-Sophie Gardes. For Extra Fluid Sunscreen, a body and face sunscreen with a 93.34% natural origin index, IMCD used the NIKKOL Nikkomulese WO-NS emulsifier, an optimized mixture of two emulsifying molecules and a structuring agent to obtain particle dispersion, while boosting the SPF. The silky texture was worked with emollients and a mattifying powder (GRANPOWDER BBP-700) to reduce the oily effect of oils. Beeswax and a gelling rheology modifier (MIGLYOL GEL) also help maintain the zinc oxide (UV Cut ZnO-65-CC) in suspension. This mineral filter offers good UVB and UVA protection, so it makes it easier to create short formulas. The SPF value obtained in vitro reaches 51.4 (47.8 in vivo) for a UVA PF of 25.3. “With this fluid formula, you get a sunscreen that is easy to apply and ideal for both the face and body. Zinc oxide provides excellent protection without leaving white traces, thanks to quality dispersion and to the synergy it creates with a specific association of ingredients.” The Hydra Sun Pearls SPF 25 sun beads were designed to offer a monodose of protective hand care. Each bead melts in the hand to always deliver the same quantity of cream. Despite their solid form, these beads contain 33% of water, which provides them with a light, low-oil sensorial texture far from heavy butter- and wax-based formulas. “Hand creams are increasingly claimed to offer an SPF. Here, it is a water-in-oil emulsion. The outer phase is oily, which makes the skin feel comfortable. The aqueous phase offers freshness and lightness,” emphasizes Anne-Sophie Gardes. “The monodose bead form helps reduce waste by delivering the right dose required for each use.” Here, again, the main emulsifier is NIKKOL Nikkomulese WO-NS. It is completed with rice bran wax to provide structure and a zinc oxide dispersion (UV CUT ZnO-65 CC) to obtain the sun protection needed. The formula is free from chemical filters and titanium dioxide and the natural origin index reaches 99.35%. This is outstanding evidence of the creative possibilities offered by the great variety of cosmetic ingredients now available on the market – even when trying to reach the highest naturalness percentage possible for formulas as sensitive as sunscreens!"
Fragrances: Eurofragance gains momentum in sustainable innovation,"At the in-cosmetics Global trade show in Paris, Eurofragance has introduced three key innovations: a collection of vegan, sustainable and eco- certifiable fragrances dubbed Ecoconscious; Sensolab, a collection of fragrances designed to upgrade the sensorial level of solid and anhydrous formats; a first captive perfumery ingredient dubbed L’Âme du Bois. The Sensolab collection has been designed to meet the sensory requirements of new solid and anhydrous formats while being in line with their environmental-friendly approach. The set of products showcased during the show included: a body lotion stick fragranced with bergamot and cannabis notes; a water-free coffee and white flower scented solid conditioner; and a powder shampoo with hints of apricot and carrot. Other highlights of this collection are: a pocket deodorant in a compact powder format with notes of moringa flower, which absorbs body odours and leaves a silky sensation on skin; a bath confetti soap that brings playfulness to the shower, in a format that diffuses olfactive notes of mandarin. The company also introduced Ecoconscious, a collection of vegan, sustainable fragrances with natural ingredients, formulated with floral-fruity, citrus and woody, fruity- sweet and fruity-aqueous notes, some of them being eco-certifiable. In addition, Eurofragance unveiled various applications created with L’Âme du Bois, the first captive perfumery ingredient launched in October 2021. These new series of applications was an opportunity to show a first olfactory range based on the innovation in the form of fine fragrances, a shampoo and a scented candle. ""Our presence at in-cosmetics illustrates our particular desire to accelerate our growth in personal care. We have a palette of high-quality raw materials and an excellent level of customer service along with valuable market knowledge that make us ready to respond to new consumer demands,” highlighted Olegario Monegal, Global Business Unit Director of Home and Personal Care."
TechnicoFlor illustrates the potential of upcycling with eight fragrances,"As far as perfumery and cosmetic ingredients are concerned, upcycling is one of the most powerful trends of the moment. The growing interest in these new generation of sustainable materials, led the way to the launch of several ingredients resulting from this “creative reuse” at the last edition of the in-cosmetics Global show, which was held in Paris at the beginning of April. In perfumes, this desire to bring new value to previously neglected resources was illustrated by Cosmos’s Golden Berry, an ingredient made from the dried calyx of physalis, and by Eurofragance’s L’Âme du Bois, a captive fragrant ingredient derived from wood chips. TechnicoFlor perfumers saw in this trend a new olfactory playground and at in-cosmetics Global presented a collection of eight responsible fragrances developed from upcycled raw materials, in compliance with stringent environmental specifications. The challenge was to highlight an upcycled raw material within formulas that would be ""free from skin sensitizing danger"", 100% vegan, with a high percentage of biodegradable ingredients, a controlled environmental impact, and with fair trade materials. Within their palette of upcycled raw materials, TechnicoFlor perfumers selected white wine lees (resulting from the deposit generated during the aging period of wine and champagne in barrels), oak wood (resulting from woodchips of wine barrels upgraded by CO2 extraction), carrot seeds (derived from seeds with low germinative potential), cocoa absolute (derived from cocoa pods), tangerine (extracted from the peel of the fruit), cypress absolute (derived from waste from the wooden furniture industry), or rose essential (derived from the distillation of petals that have already been used to create rose absolute). The selection process led to the creation of eight new, original and responsible fragrances — Raisin Divin, Up To Wood, Bois Tonic, Purple Fiction, Cacao Rosso, Sorbet Corse, Cypress’tige, Rosylicious — thus demonstrating that it is possible to transform ""waste"" into small olfactory treasures! An ingredient can be considered upcycled when it is obtained by recovering by-products from industrial or agricultural transformation processes. Upcycled ingredients can be of natural or synthetic origin. By giving new life to materials that are often intended to be discarded, upcycling helps to decrease the waste of resources and is part of the circular economy movement and the regenerative culture. It also contributes to add unexpected materials to the perfumers’ palette. This initiative from the French fragrance house is in line with its strategy of becoming a key expert in natural and responsible perfumery, which includes the creation of 100% natural ranges that comply with COSMOS Organic requirements (NatFlor perfumes), a committed purchasing policy, the sourcing of eco-responsible raw materials (BetterTomorrow®), a tool for measuring the biodegradability of perfumes (BioD-Scent®)."
Rootness Awake: Clariant’s new botanical active ingredient for the eye area,"Rootness Awake is the latest from the partnership between Clariant and Plant Advanced Technologies PAT, a French start-up well known for their exclusive technology that allows to cultivate plants in aeroponic and optimized conditions in order to boost the production of large quantities of highly interesting compounds. Rootness Awake is an enriched extract of inflammation-fighting compounds obtained from sustainably-grown  Ipomoea batatas  (sweet potato) roots. Based on PAT’s patented technology, the soil-free cultivated roots were submitted to gentle exudation. The living roots are thus delivering phytochemical profiles in high concentrations. In that case, the target compounds were Dicaffeoylquinate esters (DCQE), a range of molecules that are very difficult to source through other processes and already known for their remarkable antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Rootness Awake offers efficacy in reducing discoloration and ensuring firmness, promoting a revitalized more youthful eye contour. Indeed, the new active ingredient focuses on several physiological aspects: decreasing the release of inflammatory mediators, helping reduce the microvascular network, and ensuring skin thickness, integrity and firmness are strengthened. All of these combine to reduce under-eye pigmentation and edema (fluid build-up). The extract’s activity is demonstrated in in vitro, ex vivo and also clinical evaluations. According to Clariant, in tests over 28 days on women aged 18-35 years showing constant signs of fatigue, Rootness Awake is shown to improve and smooth out dark circles, reduce puffiness, and strengthen eye contour stiffness. The overall result is a lightened, more “awake” eye contour. The eye contour area is one of the first places where signs of fatigue and aging appear. The skin here is exceptionally thin which means the bluish-red hue of the vascular network is easy to see. Low contents of collagen and elastic fibers also make the area more sensitive to shadowing due to skin laxity and sagging. Inflammation in cells caused by pollution and UV radiation, stress, chronic lack of sleep, and an unhealthy lifestyle is known to exacerbate disruption to this area and the visible effects. “Dark circles and puffiness accentuate a tired appearance and are common beauty concerns regardless of gender and age,” comments Julie Droux, Senior Technical Marketing Specialist, Clariant Natural Ingredients. “Plant Milking Technology has enabled us to use an eco-friendly process to discover active molecules with potent properties in sweet potato roots, and to create an enriched extract with high efficacy in tackling many of the biological pathways responsible for alteration of the eye contour. Rootness Awake gives formulators new, unique opportunities to develop effective targeted care and eye contour products that contribute to progressing sustainability in skincare.” The new active ingredient adds up to Clariant’s Premium range, which already includes Prenylium and Rootness Energize, which were launched in 2020."
"Myralys, an eyelid lifter and under-eye rejuvenator by Greentech","Introduced at in-cosmetics in Paris, Greentech’s new active ingredient is a COSMOS-certified organic active ingredient, sourced from organic wild yellow gentian roots. Sustainably harvested in France by by gentian-pickers trained in good harvesting practices, Myralys is highly purified in gentiopicroside to lift upper eyelids and reduce dark circles and eye bags of lower eyelids for a time-defying look. ""Our new organic active ingredient Myralys, formulated at 0.5%, has shown remarkable effectiveness in smoothing wrinkles and reducing the appearance of puffiness after 14 days of twice-daily use on volunteers with older-looking eye contours. A lifting effect is clearly observed on slackened upper eyelids (smoother, less wrinkled) and a regenerating effect on the entire lower eye contour,” explains Sébastien Hameury, Marketing Director at Greentech. Myralys reduces lipid peroxidation, activates the Nrf2 antioxidant defense pathway and stimulates the expression of Glyoxalase-1 (a major detoxifying enzyme), to limit oxidation reactions and carbonyl stress leading to the formation of AGEs. It also limits the formation of AGEs accelerated by UV while promoting collagen synthesis, thus preserving and strengthening the skin’s support structures. Myralys limits inflammation and angiogenesis, both of which are promoted by AGEs and carbonyl stress. Another new development announced at in-cosmetics was the repositioning of the Cannabidiol isolate from hemp grown sustainably in South America and processed locally, obtained by supercritical CO2 extraction.  This high quality active ingredient, titrated to a minimum of 98% CBD, has a very strong anti-inflammatory power. It also has a very marked action on sebo-regulation, for anti-imperfections/acne and radiance-boosting actions. Traceability, sustainability, transparency and innovation were among the highlights of the last edition of the in-cosmetics Global event as shown in our special issue: Cosmetic Ingredients - April 2022.

"Seppic presents Cosmetic Mixology, a duo of robust and sensorial formulas","Premium Beauty News - How did you get the idea to work on the theme of home cosmetics? Lorraine Denois - Our role as a supplier of cosmetic ingredients is to help our customers decipher current trends and propose formulation concepts and ingredients that meet current and future market demands. During the pandemic, we observed a renewed interest in the homemade trend, especially in cosmetics with a wellness dimension. Blend It Yourself, or BIY, consists in letting the consumer mix ingredients provided by brands with precise instructions, tips and precautions for use, to create a product that perfectly reflects their own needs. That’s the ideal solution for those who want to personalize their beauty care but lack the time or knowledge to make their own beauty recipes. It’s seductive also by its image both ecological and ""transparent"": the BlY has become a mode of consumption. Premium Beauty News - How does Seppic help its customers to respond to the Blend it yourself trend? Lorraine Denois - In response, Seppic launched, during in-cosmetics Global in early April 2022, a duo of formulas called COSMETIC MIXOLOGY. The marketing and innovation teams have pooled their expertise to come up with a ""Blend it yourself"" concept that is safe and fun for consumers. With these two bases, Seppic offers a simplified and safer customization solution for consumers who are not always aware about the risks and constraints of home-made cosmetic formulation. These two formula bases can be customized with active ingredients that are easy to find at home to meet various applications (face care, hair care, body care). To ensure the robustness of the final formulas, the two chassis were tested with ten home-made active ingredients with different profiles (viscosity, pH, presence of electrolytes, solubility). Among them: lemon juice for a radiance face mask, coffee grounds for a body scrub and pomegranate vinegar for an all-in-one hair care. In addition to responding to a current market trend, our two formulas have been designed taking into account the need of consumers for minimalist formulas and their requirements for high naturalness and safety for human health. Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us more about these two bases? Lorraine Denois - COSMETIC MIXOLOGY includes two formulas with different sensory characteristics: – A creamy base to customize: a strong emulsion base combining softness and creaminess. Emulsion stability and robustness are provided by an emulsifier MONTANOV™ 202 and two polymers, SOLAGUM™AX & SEPIMAX ZEN™, to enhance the formula’s resistance to electrolyte-rich actives. This minimalist formula also contains EMOGREEN™ L15, an emollient for sensory comfort and AQUAXYL™, an essential sugar-based moisturizing agent. – A gel-cream base to customize: a solid pebble to rehydrate forming a fresh gel with a light touch. The SOLAGUM™TARA & SEPIMAX ZEN™ polymer pairing forms a fresh, watery gel-cream and strengthens the formula’s resistance to electrolyte-rich actives. Three additional ingredients have been added: EMOGREEN™ L19, an emollient for sensory comfort, SEPIFINE™ BB, a texturizing agent to provide softness and AQUAXYL™, an essential sugar-based moisturizing agent. These two formulas allow our customers to offer the final consumer two different experiences in terms of sensoriality and customization. Premium Beauty News - Do you think this trend will continue in the coming years? Lorraine Denois - This trend toward active consumer participation is becoming increasingly digital. Some companies rely on personalized online questionnaires to develop formulas and beauty programs with the help of artificial intelligence, while others allow the individual to take control of the mixing process. Applications, connected machines, mini cosmetic formulation laboratories, are multiplying, allowing to customize cosmetic care according to one’s desires or needs. This customization goes as far as the packaging. Consumers can express their own personality and create their own designs on the packaging. It is likely that this type of service will continue to develop with the evolution of increasingly intuitive and complete internet interfaces that will seduce consumers looking for personalization and unique solutions. Home blending, cosmetic devices, digital beauty analysis, packaging customization ... are clearly an important part of the future of personalized beauty, focused on inclusiveness, precision and sustainability."
Codif creates a bio-inspired active from marine algae collected in Normandy,"This alga is able to protect itself by building a calcite armour (called coccolith) through the absorption of huge quantities of atmospheric carbon. This is why it is commonly referred to as “a green lung for the planet”. Each year, ocean plankton absorbs 2 billion tonnes of CO2. This ultra-resistant micro-alga has the particularity of having 15% of its genome dedicated to resistance to stress, and is therefore of high interest for the skin. Inspired and extracted from Emiliania huxleyi, Codif’s Idaskin concentrates the properties of 50,000 algal cells in a single drop. According to Codif TN, this active ingredient boosts the skin’s resilience to the stress caused by environmental factors (exposome) and improves cell vitality, for a fresh and revitalized complexion. This water soluble ingredient is to be used at 1% in anti-pollution mists and daily creams. Actually, samples of Emiliania huxleyi were collected near Étretat cliffs, in Normandy, France. The samples were then grown in France, in bioreactors using the Bioth-Ecology technology from Codif TN. Idaskin is available two versions: – Idaskin PDO- CH, which is China compliant (INCI: Sea water (and) Propanediol (and) Arginine (and) Lysine)
– Idaskin PDO, which is not China compliant (INCI: Sea water (and) Propanediol (and) Emiliania huxleyi extract) Both versions are COSMOS approved.

Sustainable personal care ingredients take centre stage at in-cosmetics Global,"Innovation was at the top of the agenda throughout the three-day event held on April 05-07 in Paris, where natural and sustainable cosmetic and personal care had hardly any rivals. The trends associated with holistic beauty were also a key feature of the event. Among the exhibitors announcing their latest launches, Gattefossé, for instance, revealed its new plant-derived active ingredient, Solastemis. Designed to offer brands, particularly dermo-cosmetics, a powerful active ingredient to protect the skin against UV rays, it responds to the growing needs of consumers concerned about the health of their skin. Meanwhile, Symrise debuted its latest innovation in modern product protection in the form of its Hydrolite 8 green - the first high quality 100% bio-based, neat caprylyl glycol launched in the cosmetics market. Elsewhere on the show floor, Clariant Natural Ingredients introduced Prunizen - a new natural, ‘feel good’ active that helps to fight stress-induced hair loss, improve hair vitality and density, and restore hair and scalp wellbeing. While Vantage Personal Care introduced a brand-new formulation platform focused on providing formulators with a broad combination of highly traceable, sustainable, and deeply impactful ingredients – highly relevant for conscious consumers. Dow also unveiled five new technologies alongside its ECOllaboration Concepts Collection to address growing consumer demand for sustainable and inclusive solutions. Of the new product announcements, four covered skin and hair applications. The group also showcased a series of six new products including MaizeCare Clarity Polymer – a unique corn-based ingredient that enables the formulation of crystal-clear hair styling formulations; Dowsil 979 Emulsion for use in conditioners, leave-in and shampoo formats; and EcoSmooth Rice Husk Cometic Powder, an upcycled white silica powder designed to be added in a wide range of common skin care, colour cosmetics, and hair care formulation types. With an overarching focus on sustainability, this year’s in-cosmetics Global demonstrated the steps being taken by the beauty and personal care industry to reduce its environmental impact through ingredient choices and formulation methods. The event’s Sustainability Corner, sponsored by AAK, returned to offer attendees a snapshot of the latest advancements and accomplishments in sustainable personal care. Visiting the Sustainability Corner at in-cosmetics Global, Hélène Villecroze, Eco Design Manager, Chanel Parfums Beauté, said: “As environmental concerns increase, it’s better for consumers to have another perspective on sustainability and a point of view for ingredients. The Sustainability Corner offers a summary of the best products that exhibitors are presenting, giving examples, and proposing more sustainable ideas.” Fellow attendee, Agatha Bernedot, Product Development Manager, Fresh added: “The Sustainability Corner has made me realise there are some good solutions to sustainability which I plan to use to challenge our formulation development team. This is a tricky area, and it is hard to keep the consumer happy whilst being natural and sustainable.” Other interactive product features pulled in crowds throughout the duration of the three-day event, included the newest raw ingredients to hit the market in the Innovation Zone, sponsored by Ashland; new and invigorating sensations in the Sensory Bar, sponsored by IMCD; and innovative pigments and technologies in the Make-up Bar, sponsored by Lubrizol Life Science. Speaking about the product areas, Florence L’Alloret, Innovation Project Leader, L’Oréal said: “The interactive features at in-cosmetics Global are a great way to get a global overview of the latest innovations across a wide range of topics. I’m particularly interested in finding ingredients sourced from nature and I’ve been able to find lots of interest.” Next year, in-cosmetics Global will take place in Barcelona from 28-30 March 2023."
Seqens Cosmetics launches a bio-inspired ingredient to heal inflamed skins,"“We have known since the end of the 1970s [1] that certain animals are able to find substances in their environment that allow them to heal themselves,” explains Aïna Queiroz, Head of Innovation & Scientific Communication at Seqens Cosmetics. Despite the immense potential of this discovery, it had so far gone unexploited in the cosmetics industry. After the launch of several platforms dedicated to the Exposome, Longevity and Emotional Glyco-intelligence, Seqens Cosmetics is highlighting biomimicry as a way to discover new active molecules through its new Etho-Phytology innovation platform. It is therefore by studying models and strategies that have been proven in nature for millions of years that Seqens found the avenue that led to the creation of Phyt’Anim Grains of Paradise. In this case, the source of inspiration of the cosmetic ingredients manufacturer were some particularly fascinating doctors: gorillas of Africa’s western lowland! Thanks to a database of plants used by animals to treat themselves, Seqens Cosmetics has indeed identified the consumption by gorillas of seeds of the paradise plant (Aframomum melegueta) [2] as a means to protect themselves from myocardium inflammatory disorders. “This plant protects the myocardium of the gorilla by fighting against certain inflammatory disorders (via the COX-2 pathway) that cause fibrosing cardiomyopathy (Dybas and Raskin, 2007). Research has shown that for the captive primates, lack of access to grains of paradise led to a sharp increase in this pathology (Ilic et al., 2014),” said Seqens Cosmetics. Aware of the importance of this same COX-2 pathway at the level of skin inflammation, Seqens Cosmetics thus studied the effects of this seed on a new skin model to extract the most effective anti-inflammatory fraction, enriched with 6-gingerol. The active ingredient developed makes it possible to relieve irritated skin and accelerate the resolution of chronic inflammation, whether on an in vitro, ex vivo or clinical scale. “By readjusting the balance between pro-inflammatory mediators (COX-2, IL-22, FPR2) and anti- inflammatory mediators (IL-10, TGF-β), Phyt’anim Grains of Paradise helps to reduce the visible signs of skin inflammation,” claims Seqens. The double-blind clinical study, carried out vs placebo on irritated skin, thus highlights a significant effect of the ingredient both on transepidermal water loss (TEWL) after 24 hours, and on redness and vascular intensity after just 5 days. The company also wanted to understand how primates select plants in their environment. Taste receptors are crucial in signalling to the animal the presence of useful molecules. This is particularly true for the gorilla whose diet is essentially herbivorous. Noting the surprising presence of these same taste receptors on the skin, Seqens Cosmetics has therefore evaluated the impact of Phyt’anim Grains of Paradise on this relatively unexplored skin axis. According to the company, the results obtained prove that the active ingredient modulates the expression of a G protein associated with a taste receptor during inflammation. “These new data open the way to understanding the role of these receptors at the skin level and demonstrate the importance of considering them in dermo-cosmetics,” concludes Seqens. Other cases of self-medication behavior, in species other than primates, are currently being explored at Seqens in order to give birth to a new generation of bio-inspired cosmetic actives."
BASF’s Care Creations® launches the Responsibly Active sustainability program,"“Caring is in our nature and deeply rooted in our DNA. That’s why we are committed to protecting the world in which we all live and work. Our vision is to align our actions in a sustainable way – to protect our planet and its resources, and to make an active contribution to all of the people along our bioactive ingredients value chain. To turn this vision into reality, we launched our Responsibly Active program which includes clear commitments and action plans,” says Lucilene Veira Nunes, Head of Business Management for the active ingredients business of BASF in Europe. Together with the team, she is responsible for setting up the program. For companies and their stakeholders in the beauty and cosmetics industry, sustainability is no longer a “nice option”. It has become a necessity and therefore a decisive success factor for the survival of our planet and each company’s own long-term development. Consumers are increasingly demanding sustainable products and choosing brands and companies based on ethical aspects, including their initiatives towards the environment and climate. Business customers also choose suppliers according to their contributions along the entire value chain. “With Responsibly Active, we foster and channel our contributions in our respective fields of action to help curb climate change and make our world a better place. We also support current and potential customers in achieving their own sustainability goals,” explains Veira Nunes. With its special focus on botanical sourcing for BASF’s bioactives portfolio, the program is based on three pillars to connect the innovative bioactive solutions with consumer needs while protecting natural resources for generations to come. Preserving natural resources and ecosystems is essential to the company since plants are at the core of BASF’s bioactives portfolio and biodiversity is the company’s reservoir to innovate. Therefore, BASF’s Care Creations® maximizes the use of renewable resources and fosters organic farming practices. Dedicated initiatives respect and protect local biodiversity and avoid land degradation and deforestation within the supply chains. They also aim at making each botanical traceable back to the source, and thus creating trust and freedom of choice for BASF customers. People who are far away from where the raw materials are produced are also taking responsibility to protect natural resources. One example is Philippe. As the Raw Material Sourcing & Extraction Manager at the BASF site in Pulnoy, France, he has been working for years on smart ideas such as upcycling waste from the moringa oil extraction process to obtain highly effective bioactives. He is only one example of many within the company about how employees are contributing to the sustainability of the business. The second pillar stands for BASF taking responsibility for people and the conditions in which they live and work. Everyone should be treated with fairness and respect. Adamantly committed to human rights and proper working conditions, BASF also recognizes and values traditional knowledge and indigenous rights. Promoting diverse and equitable work, BASF actively supports the inclusion of women and small holder farms. Take women like Fadna, who work in the Targanine cooperative, BASF’s Moroccan fair-trade partner and sustainable argan oil supplier. Thanks to a literacy program and other benefits, she can lead a life of self-sufficiency for herself and her family. However, making a positive impact is not only limited to the individuals directly involved. Strong partnerships with botanical suppliers are also designed to foster long-term local development and raise communities’ livelihoods. The third pillar of Responsibly Active is about impact on climate and the environment. This is where central fields of action have been defined to reduce the environmental and carbon footprint by consuming less water and energy while minimizing waste. Another topic at the core of the program is making packaging more sustainable by reducing it and using recyclable and recycled materials. Making the company’s operations climate neutral while reducing the environmental impact involves ongoing teamwork and the understanding that everyone has the power to drive change. A notable example is Farid, an EHS Engineer at BASF, and his team. They came up with a process to valorize botanical wastes, which can be used by farmers as organic fertilizers or to produce more than 18 MWh of green energy for local purposes. To ensure that action really speaks louder than words, concrete targets and key actions have been set up for all three pillars. Ambitious goals, to be achieved in the spirit of fairness, trustworthy partnerships and mindful cooperation help to create efforts that are worth embarking on together in every way. And BASF’s Care Creations® is willing to go the extra mile towards greater sustainability – together with customers, employees, suppliers, partners, and everyone involved along the entire bioactives value chain. And this is exactly what is meant by stating “Together we are Responsibly Active”. Join BASF’s journey and learn more about Responsibly Active:

in-cosmetics Global: naturalness and upcycling as recovery ingredients,"As determined as they are to meet the crucial traceability needs evoked in brands’ marketing content, suppliers keep focusing their efforts on the search for natural ingredients. Starting from a fruit species cultivated and harvested by hand on Reunion Island according to zero waste principles, Gattefossé developed the new Solastemis active whose molecules are extracted from chayote, also known as Christophine. Solastemis promotes protection against photoageing by preserving keratinocyte DNA from the damage induced by UVAs. Greentech used yellow gentian roots sustainably handpicked in France to develop the Myralis active, which targets problems on the eye contour area, the upper eyelids, the Valley of Tears, dark circles, and bags. Robertet showcased their range of natural actives for nutricosmetics and cosmetics, including flagship ingredients Lipowheat, a source of phytoceramides, and Keranat, a millet extract which prevents hair loss. It was also an opportunity for the Grasse-based company to highlight the ActiScent range, playing on the duality of olfaction and the physiological properties of the perfumer’s natural raw materials. These active perfumes can offer firming benefits, like ActiScent Aqua Criste, or fortifying virtues, like ActiScent Lovely Flower. Beyond naturalness, upcyling seems more and more desirable as a proven means to prevent resource and energy waste. Cosmo Fragrance developed the Golden Berry natural ingredient based on dried chalice of physalis, a fruit sourced from an ethical Columbian farm. “It is a really common fruit consumed in South America. Its envelope had not yet been exploited. Consumers definitely need authentic rhetoric. Today, they do want natural products, but they want them to come from traceable chains with well-identified producers,” explains Alexandrine Demachy, General Manager France. Extracted with supercritical CO2, this ingredient offers anti-ageing cosmetic properties as well as floral, fruity notes for perfumes. Eurofragrance drew inspiration from wood to develop its first captive. The Barcelona-based composition company showcased L’Âme du Bois, which is obtained from chips from a particular essence. L’Âme du Bois is meant to create premium perfumes of all categories: fine perfumery, home care, and personal care. “It is a multifaceted innovative ingredient, it seems to act as a bond between all kinds of woods,” says senior perfumer Angéline Leporini-Poubeau. As for Lucas Meyer IFF, they upgraded perfumery by-products to create the Wastar collection using the residues obtained from the extraction of the natural olfactory compounds of the LMR Naturals by IFF range. At the show, they introduced pink peppers, with Wastar Pink Berry, which soothes scalp irritation, helps reduce redness, and calms itchiness, but also lavender, with Wastar Lavender, which protects the skin from indoor pollution by strengthening the skin barrier function, reducing inflammation, and enhancing the skin’s brightness for a radiant, healthy appearance. Mibelle also produced a new active derived from upcycling: SLVR’Coffee, a coffee silver skin extract, is a by-product derived from coffee bean roasting which hydrates and comforts dry skins. Directly inspired from the holistic beauty trend, the skin’s brightness and ability to reflect joy of life and health constitute a recurring theme of the search for cosmetic ingredients. Solabia associated two new natural actives in relation to this issue. Sealight beautifies radiance with an eye contour action on dark circles, bags, wrinkles, and crow’s feet. This new, organic-certified ingredient is rich in sulphate arabinogalactans exclusively contained in the Codium fragile algae and sustainably harvested on the Portuguese coast. It reactivates microcirculation to offer cells optimum nutrition and enhances elasticity for a global anti-ageing action and a brighter gaze. Derived from kale, a detox superfood cultivated in an organic cooperative in Brittany, the Neoglow plant-derived active offers gentle organic exfoliation suitable for dry and sensitive skins. Combined with a generous quantity of isothiocyanates, this exfoliating effect boosts the cell metabolism needed for skin detoxification and epidermal renewal. Neoglow provides a global revitalizing effect. Also banking on the ability of living organisms to repair themselves, Silab launches the Regenixir anti-ageing natural active of biotechnological origin. Due to its global action, Regenixir promotes the regeneration of mature skins. Solid, powder, leave-on cosmetics, substitution with floral waters… all these approaches are in line with the major current expectations related to water preservation. Solabia put this issue forward with the Waterless box which offers various face, body, and hair care solutions formulated accordingly, using only two teaspoons of water for all eight products showcased. A renowned specialist in the natural perfume segment, Expressions Parfumées showcased their NatCo perfume range designed for the organic market. The Touch Natco technological innovation now makes it possible to offer a solid version of these natural perfumes. In addition, the AquaBoost NatCo technology developed three years ago to substitute alcohol with water in perfumes is now available for natural perfumes, known for being more difficult to solubilize. This patented technique consists in diluting a concentrated natural perfume at a concentration of 30% in water for a final dose of 10% in the perfume. With this aqueous base, the final Cosmos-certified result offers an olfactory intensity estimated at 93% after 4 hours and 85% after 24 hours.

Givaudan grows vetiver in the sand for olfactory and eco-friendly benefits,"Since 2018, Givaudan has been relying on the expertise of agronomists to reduce the ecological impact of its materials and fragrances. Upstream extraction techniques, plant cultivation methods are, indeed, essential means for the preservation of natural resources. The fragrance house is therefore considering the creation of alternative supply chains, thanks to regenerative and planet-friendly practices, in the image of its rosemary, patchouli and vetiver crops. Vetiver, an age-old root, native to India, has crossed many borders, with 60% of production now coming from Haiti. Givaudan participated in vetiver cultivation program in India through an innovation partnership with Synthite. A new material, ethically sourced, by working alongside local partners and producers directly in the country of origin. As most of arable land in India is used primarily for food crops, Givaudan has chosen unused arid lands to grow its vetiver. A strip of sand in south-eastern India, opposite Sri Lanka, was selected. Although it is the same variety of vetiver as the one grown in Haiti, the new ingredient obtained presents other olfactory facets; a characteristic linked to the soil, to specific cultivation practices, but also to a shortened distillation process. Where Haitian vetiver is very ""nutty"" and oily, Vetiver des Sables is more mineral. With its intense and soaring properties, this essential oil also features hints of ambergris and cypriol. It blends well with ambery woods that are very much in vogue at the moment. Sand vetiver and Haitian vetiver thus complement each other perfectly and find a place of their own in the perfumer’s palette. With this new natural material, Givaudan demonstrates the worth of agronomy in preserving fragrance crops for the future. Taking an interest in soils offers a unique opportunity for achieving a triple purpose: olfactory, environmental and societal."
Expanscience: a prebiotic active from kapok tree to boost sexual well-being,"Officially launched during the latest edition of the in-cosmetics Global show, Calybiota Bio [1] is a natural extract rich in polysaccharides, obtained from the calyx of red kapok tree (Bombax costatum) flowers, sustainably sourced in Burkina Faso, West Africa. Calybiota Bio is particularly recommended for the intimate area hygiene and care. A clinical study has demonstrated its protective role on the vaginal flora, revealing a prebiotic effect on this flora’s lactobacilli, together with a reduction in inflammation and in discomfort sensations. It helps soothing and moisturizing the intimate area and improves women’s sexual life. The new ingredient is also recommended for acne-prone skin, skin prone atopy/eczema or hypersensitivity, as well as for deodorant formulas. Calyxes - the part located at the base of the flower - of the red kapok tree are traditionally used in African dishes to bind sauces. Flowers are collected in the classified forest and biosphere reserve of the “Mare aux Hippopotames de Balla” in the Satiri district, which is part of the UNESCO’s ""Man & the Biosphere"" program. Local communities have been trained in good harvesting practices and a field study has been performed in order to assess the environmental and social impact of the supply chain. Laboratoires Expanscience also participated in the construction of the cooperative’s headquarters (warehouse, office, and meeting room) in the Balla village. From an environmental point of view, enhancing the local value of the red kapok tree is of high interest. Indeed, the red kapok tree is an oxalogen tree, meaning that it has the ""oxalate-carbonate pathway"" in its metabolism allowing it to form calcium carbonate in the soil, “one of the most sustainable forms of carbon sink,” highlights Expanscience.

Transparency: One of the main COVID-19 legacy when it comes to beauty,"Consumers want to be reassured about the composition of products, especially those they ingest and apply on their skins almost on a daily basis. Naturally, they have grown increasingly mindful of the composition of the products they buy and curious about how they are produced: a trend that the pandemic has only reinforced. “These days, consumers are buying with a conscience and brands need to be transparent about their ethical impacts, displaying them in clear and tangible ways,” said Mintel following a trends analysis undertaken for the in-cosmetics Global show, which was held in Paris last week. According to Mintel, in order to be ahead of the game, companies must ensure they are transparent in communicating measurable metrics about their ethics and sustainability credentials. While sustainability claims in beauty products have become mainstream and still remain at the top of the agenda, customers are also looking at brands’ commitments to diversity and equality, as well as ethical supply chain practices. As a result, brands and manufacturers have to be more cautious as regards sourcing: at the forefront, producers and raw material suppliers are expected to get involved. Indeed, for the sake of traceability, supply chains need to comply with brands’ new constraints, while innovating. Traceability, sustainability, transparency and innovation were among the highlights of the last edition of the in-cosmetics Global show as shown in our special issue: Cosmetic Ingredients - April 2022.

Seppic offers DIY solutions and a sustainable alternative to heavy silicones,"On the occasion of the in-cosmetic trade show, Seppic presented a new alternative to synthetic silicones as well as a concept suiting the growing trend of home-made products. The Emogreen HP40 ingredient is the first natural alternative to heavy silicones. 100% vegetable and biodegradable, its properties will find applications in haircare, skincare, make-up and suncare products, with the same sensory profile and performance as silicones commonly used in formulas (Polybutene, Dimethicone/Dimethiconol, Cyclopentasiloxane/Dimethiconol, synthetic film-formers...). Particularly suitable for hair applications, it preserves keratin integrity despite thermal stress and protects the hair. In addition, in response to the growing popularity of ""home-made"" cosmetics, Seppic has come up with a ""Blend it Yourself"" concept based on a duo of minimalist ""chassis"" formulas to customise at home. These two Cosmetic Mixology formulas, developed using Seppic ingredients, have different sensory characteristics: a cream emulsion and a solid pebble to rehydrate. The stability and robustness of the emulsion base is provided by the emulsifier Montanov 202 and two polymers, Solagum AX and Sepimax Zen to enhance the formula’s resistance to electrolyte-rich actives. This minimalist formula also contains the emollient Emogreen L15 and Aquaxyl, an essential sugar-based moisturiser. The solid pebble to rehydrate forms a fresh, light-touch gel cream composed of a pair of polymers Solagum Tara & Sepimax Zen. Three other ingredients were added, Emogreen L19, for sensory comfort, Sepifine BB, a texturizer and Aquaxyl. These two bases were tested with ten active ingredients that can be found at home with different profiles in terms of viscosity, pH, presence of electrolytes, solubility. These include lemon juice for a radiance face mask, coffee grounds for a body scrub and pomegranate vinegar for an all-in-one hair care."
Global Bioenergies starts commercial production of its renewable isododecane,"The first batches of biosourced isobutene have been manufactured at this unit in March 2022. This new and fully French production chain, using raw materials sourced locally, was established thanks to developments in the manufacturing process, which now relies on subcontractors both upstream (industrial fermentation) and downstream (green chemistry). All of that fully on schedule according to Global Bioenergies. The commercial launch of the first renewable isododécane will take place under the “Isonaturane 12” brand at in-cosmetics in Paris from 5 to 7 April, 2022. “The in-cosmetics show is a great place to showcase innovations and the ideal venue to launch a new ingredient on the market. It will represent a new milestone for Global Bioenergies: Isonaturane 12 has cleared all the regulatory hurdles. It has been validated at market scale with our LAST make-up brand, the first in the world to combine longwear, waterproof and no transfer properties with natural origin. Our aim is now to distribute this innovative ingredient to players in the field, in order to help them convert their make-up ranges to naturalness without any compromise on performance. The start-up of the new unit will enable us to respond to sampling requests from numerous prospects, and complete referencing procedures prior to the commercial delivery of material in the second half of 2022,” said Daphne Galvez, Global Bioenergies Head of Sales. According to Global Bioenergies, the success of the unit’s start-up without any major difficulties means that the scale-up schedule can be accelerated: the Company now expects to reach full capacity by the end of 2022, rather than over 18 months as initially projected. That will take the unit’s isobutene annual production capacity to 100 tonnes. The isobutene will then be converted into isododecane for the make-up ingredients market. The scale-up to 1,000 tonnes, planned for late 2024 or early 2025, is starting to look like a realistic prospect. The aim will be to target the broader dermo-cosmetics and hair care markets. Beyond personal care products, Global Bioenergies continues to target the much larger aviation biofuels market by 2026 or 2027. Using the ingredient in this sector will bring a significant environmental impact (CO2 reductions), while at the same time helping reduce Europe’s energy dependency. “The fight against global warming and the quest to achieve Europe’s strategic challenges have become central concerns across the board, and remind us of the relevance of the Company’s strategy and investments since its creation in 2008. Our target markets, cosmetic ingredients in the short term and aviation biofuels in the medium term, are booming: the number of potential customers is increasing rapidly, as are the potential competitors for our Company. We can now state that our process, patiently developed over more than 10 years, is unique and offers specific and decisive advantages that will enable us to compete in the cosmetic ingredients market. In the aviation biofuels market, it will be necessary to improve performance further, but we believe that to be achievable within 12 to 24 months. We will then boast the best fermentation process in the world to decarbonise air transport,” concluded Marc Delcourt, Chief Executive Officer of Global Bioenergies."
Ethical sourcing is becoming the norm for natural ingredients in cosmetics,"A wide range of natural ingredients are now used in cosmetic and personal care products. Vegetable oils, fats, and butters are highly established, however many functional ingredients like surfactants, emollients, and thickeners are now made from natural raw materials. The trend is for operators to ethically source raw materials of natural origin. Palm kernel oil is the most widely used vegetable oil in the cosmetics industry. About 20 percent of palm oil is now produced according to RSPO or related sustainability schemes. Large cosmetic firms, including Unilever and L’Oréal, have committed to source only sustainable palm oil. Over 20 operators have joined the Action for Sustainable Derivatives, an industry-led collaboration that encourages responsible production and sourcing of palm oil derivatives. The number of sustainability charters and certification schemes for vegetable oils is increasing. The Sustainable Coconut & Coconut Oil Roundtable introduced its first charter in 2020. A similar scheme for sustainable castor been oil has been in place since 2016. Croda recently adopted the ISCC Plus certification to show transparency and traceability in its vegetable oil supply chains. Organic ingredients are also gaining popularity. The move is partly driven by the success of the leading certification schemes COSMOS and Natrue. Almost 40,000 cosmetic products are now certified according to these standards. Initially launched in Europe, the certification schemes have expanded to the Asia-Pacific and the Americas. Fair trade standards are being adopted by suppliers of agricultural-based raw materials. Coconut oil, olive oil, shea butter, cocoa, tea tree and essential oils are some of the certified ingredients making their way into cosmetic & personal care products. Cosmetic companies are brandishing the Fairtrade mark on products containing such ingredients. Some certification schemes are crossing over from the food industry. The Vegan Society trademark, initially launched in 1990 for vegan food products, now has over 24,000 certified cosmetic products. The Body Shop is one of its largest backers, declaring all its products will be certified by the end of 2023. In the USA, the Non-GMO Project Verified certification scheme is the fastest growing. Also initially introduced for food products, the scheme has been adopted by almost 70 cosmetic & personal care brands. In Asia, the Halal label is becoming increasingly evident. It is most popular in Indonesia where the government introduced mandatory halal labelling for cosmetics last year. Ecovia Intelligence expects the number of sustainability schemes and standards to continue to grow. The increasing use of natural raw materials puts pressure on cosmetic & ingredient firms to ethically source and take the certification route. Some operators will opt for organic, fair trade, or sustainability schemes like RSPO to prove they meet high environmental / social standards. Others will focus on traceability to show their raw materials are deforestation-free, GM-free, vegan, and / or halal. Whichever direction they take, ethical sourcing is becoming a permanent fixture in the cosmetics industry. Ecovia Intelligence will give a seminar on ethical sourcing at in-cosmetics Global (5-7th April, Paris) and 11-22 April (virtual). Register here."
Givaudan adds Patchoul’Up to their collection of upcycled active ingredients,"The Supplier of active ingredients for the beauty industry is introducing a 100% upcycled extract that is able to rebalance sebum production, eliminate dry flakes and normalise the scalp microbiome. The new ingredient was designed to support demand for solutions that preserve precious natural resources while delivering efficient benefits. Dubbed Patchoul’Up, the new eco-designed ingredient is crafted through green fractionation from distilled patchouli leaves - responsibly sourced in Indonesia - after their use as a raw material in fragrance creation. Since 2013, Givaudan has been working closely with local producers on the Island of Sulawesi (Indonesia) to develop a sustainable smallholder patchouli business. Hundreds of producers and local suppliers are involved in the production of patchouli oil for perfumery, and now for scalp-care ingredients. “The Givaudan Foundation is working hand in hand alongside this initiative to combat illiteracy and nurture a love of reading among local children by establishing school libraries,” explained the company in a statement. With Patchoul’Up, Givaudan Active Beauty aims to meet the growing demand for result-oriented functional hair-related products, including hair and scalp treatments. The new ingredient addresses the “skinification” trend, reflecting consumer demand for products powered by an active ingredient able to treat hair and scalp issues just as they do for skin. According to the company, 85% of consumers have previously experienced dry flakes, with 40% mentioning dandruff and dry flakes as their main scalp issue. “It’s interesting to note that consumers are increasingly educated on this topic, with 44% of those who have experienced dry flakes believing the cause to be an unhealthy scalp microbiome,” Givaudan added. Givaudan claims Patchoul’Up offers a solution by acting at 6 synergistic levels to: – rebalance sebum production by 39%,
– smoothly reduce scalp dry flakes by 31%,
– normalise scalp microbiota,
– regulate stratum corneum desquamation,
– improve scalp condition in 100% of volunteers,
– provide well-being benefits. “We continually push the boundaries to offer new sustainable and responsibly sourced ingredients to the cosmetic industry, a ’must-have’ to satisfy today’s customer and consumer demands. For us, upcycling is not just a trend but a true path to success on our journey as a sustainable business. Patchoul’Up now adds to our collection of upcycled ingredients first introduced in 2018 with the launch of the skincare ingredient Vetivyne, and Koffee’Up Grade in 2020,” concluded Fabrice Lefevre, Innovation and Marketing Director Active Beauty at Givaudan."
"“We are anticipating more than 7,000 visitors,” Roziani Zulkifli, in-cosmetics","Premium Beauty News - What are the prospects for this first in-person European event since 2019? Roziani Zulkifli - Indeed, after a long-anticipated wait, in-cosmetics Global is returning to the Paris Expo Porte de Versailles from 5-7 April, offering the industry the chance to reconnect in person. Since the last face-to-face show in 2019, hundreds of R&D professionals from all around the globe have expressed their excitement to finally return to the show floor, ready to reveal the latest innovations and developments in the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industry. With that in mind, we are expecting more than 650 exhibitors at this year’s event. With the pandemic still preventing travel restrictions, footfall will inevitably be less than in previous years, however, we still stand in good stead in terms of expected visitors. We are anticipating more than 7,000 visitors to the show, of which 75% are from Europe. Premium Beauty News - What will be the main highlights of the show? Roziani Zulkifli - After what has been a challenging time throughout the pandemic, I am certain that the dominating factor shared amongst all of the exhibitors and visitors attending will be the excitement of reconnecting and reuniting face-to-face at a physical event. Equally, as one of the most popular and vibrant areas of in-cosmetics, another highlight of the show will be the Innovation Zone which is set to showcase the latest raw materials ready to hit the market. The Sustainability Corner is always a show favourite, offering an interactive space for this year’s stimulating educational programme to take place, featuring the latest advancements in sustainable personal care. The R&D Tour is also something formulators can look forward to year-on-year, especially with the 2022 edition honing in on topical areas such as natural products, skin protection and personal care, all of which are good for the body and mind. Premium Beauty News - What trends do you anticipate to be showcased on the show floor? Roziani Zulkifli - In terms of trends, we can see that sustainability, naturals and anti-ageing will be high on the agenda for everyone at this year’s show. Within sustainability and naturals, microbiome and biotech will be the main focus, meanwhile, for those interested in anti-ageing trends, we can expect to see an emphasis on cellular repair. UV and blue light protection are also an area of focus this year. As more and more people are increasingly spending considerable amounts of time in the digital world, therefore exposing themselves to HEV light (High-Energy Visible Light) that is damaging for the skin, it is not surprising that blue light protection continues to be a topic of interest. Anne Schrötter will be leading a Technical Seminar on blue light, demonstrating how natural bioactives meet the latest consumer needs and market trends when it comes to skin barrier repair and global protection. Premium Beauty News - You announced a hybrid event. Can you describe how the virtual event will be articulated with the physical one? Roziani Zulkifli - After listening to feedback from attendees at online in-cosmetic events throughout the pandemic, we are very excited to extend the in-person event by offering attendees the chance to continue conversations via a new hybrid approach post-show. Our exhibitors and visitors will be presented with further opportunities to network, giving them the best of both worlds. Our new, online platform will be open from 11-22 April where it will be available for both exhibitors and visitors to arrange virtual meetings, as well as being able to access a comprehensive range of on-demand and live content to continue their show journey. The platform will not only provide access to those who cannot attend due to travel restrictions, but it also allows a wider audience to participate and benefit from the networking opportunities that in-cosmetics has always offered to our in-person attendees. Planning and using all of the show’s resources to their full extent is key. The online connections are not just limited to our visitors and the exhibitors they’ve discovered online. It can also be used to continue those conversations started in Paris or to follow up with leads that exhibitors have collected from the smart readers and apps used at the show. Premium Beauty News - Will all exhibitors participate in both events (in person and digital)? Roziani Zulkifli - Absolutely. All of our main stand-holders will be participating both in-person and online, and we are also expecting those exhibitors who are experiencing continued government travel restrictions to be joining us on the virtual platform, providing everyone with an equal chance to connect, inspire and learn. Either way, our emphasis for this year’s in-cosmetics Global is firmly set on ensuring everyone has a safe and secure environment to conduct business. This includes three exciting days of busy, in-person networking, and for the first time in the show’s history, a follow-up virtual event that is designed to maximise every opportunity to collaborate and learn. That is why we’re very much looking forward to welcoming our exhibitors, attendees and speakers, both in-person and online next month at in-cosmetics Global 2022. Registration is now open.

BASF launches four patented biomimetic peptides for dermocosmetic products,"BASF’s newly launched Peptovitae range includes four patented peptides developed in Asia through an exclusive relationship with Caregen, a Korean-based company specializing in biomimetic peptide research and development. According to BASF Care Creations, the Peptovitae series represents a new generation of scientifically developed biomimetic peptides, addressing a wider range of skin concerns than are traditionally associated with the use of peptides. Each of the four new peptides is associated with specific personal care skin benefits: – Peptovitae Matrix addresses the signs of aging;
– Peptovitae Bright enhances the brightness of skin;
– Peptovitae Derma soothes skins that are prone to dryness and itching;
– Peptovitae Clear calms and moisturizes the skin. The double-layered, liposome-based encapsulation system used in the Peptovitae series allows finished products to deliver the benefit of these biomimetic peptides to skin appearance. “BASF has adapted these peptides to ensure they meet cosmetic industry standards, thereby making these products available to our customers and consumers,” said Viju Jose, Vice President, Personal Care Solutions, Care Chemicals, BASF Asia Pacific. According to BASF, consumers - both in Asia and in Western countries - are increasingly looking for safe and effective skin care-regime-based solutions with high efficacy as an alternative to procedure-based treatments to address their personal skin needs. In this context, the company thinks these new peptides will enable skincare brands to develop innovative products with enhanced benefits. “The strong growth of dermocosmetics in China and the doubling of the share of dermocosmetics in the global beauty market over the last 15 years are evidence of the robust growth in products containing peptides and the shift by consumers towards biomimetic skin care regimes,” added Eunice Jeong, Head of Regional Market Development, Personal Care Solutions, Care Chemicals, BASF Asia Pacific."
Clariant transitions towards renewable carbon with bio-based surfactants range,"With the introduction of 100% bio-based surfactants and PEGs, Clariant significantly expands the number of ingredients in its Vita range. Vita products are based on renewable feedstocks and have at least 98% Renewable Carbon Index (RCI) thus providing low carbon footprint solutions to manufacturers. “As our climate gives us increasing and alarming signals of change, individuals and industries are looking for ways to reduce their environmental footprints, and the demand for bio-based chemicals is set to grow strongly in the coming years,” Clariant explains in a statement. Designed for natural formulations targeting a high Renewable Carbon Index (RCI), the new Vita products support manufacturers in maximizing the bio-based carbon content of consumer goods such as detergents, hair and body shampoos, but also paints, industrial lubricants, and crop formulations. To create these new surfactants and PEGs, Clariant uses 100% bio-ethanol derived from sugar cane or corn  to create the required ethylene oxide. The bio-based material is fully segregated along the value chain from the field to the final consumer product. Because only bio-based feedstocks are used, the new ingredients have significantly lower carbon footprints than their fossil-based counterparts. According to Clariant, the Vita surfactants can help save up to 85% of CO₂ emissions compared to their fossil analogues. These new solutions are chemically equivalent to fossil versions, the company explained. They offer the same performance and efficiency to formulators and brand owners. The range currently includes more than 70 bio-based products, and the range will continue to be expanded to meet evolving market needs. In Q1 2022, double-digit kilotons of the bio-based surfactants and PEGs will be available for the worldwide business segments from Clariant IGL Specialty Chemicals (CISC), a Clariant joint venture. “From the packaging to the many ingredients, a typical consumer product in coatings, personal care, home care, industrial, and agricultural applications still uses petrochemicals and therefore fossil carbon,” said Christian Vang, Global Head of Business Unit Industrial & Consumer Specialties, Clariant. “Switching to bio-based carbon chemistry remains a big challenge for manufacturers and by launching the Vita surfactant and PEG range we are offering them an important new solution to achieve this.”"
"Mustard, broccoli, oysters: When age-old remedies come to beauty routines","While the kitchen and the bathroom were once two very distinct spaces, this no longer seems to be the case. The foods we’re used to seeing on our plates are now making their way into beauty kits, taking on a variety of forms, from oils to skincare creams to shampoos, serums and facial cleansers. That’s nothing new, certainly. The cosmetics industry has long been drawing from our kitchen cupboards to exploit the virtues of natural ingredients such as honey, olive oil, sugar, eggs and lemon. But age-old remedies and recipes are more than ever inspiring new beauty players. Let’s take a look at some of the latest contenders. Broccoli, for instance, would be packed with benefits, including countless cosmetic virtues still little known to many. Broccoli oil would have moisturizing and nourishing properties, both for skin and hair. Dry, damaged or even dull hair will therefore appreciate the ability of broccoli to make it shinier and silkier. This brassica would also naturally tame frizz, and help make detangling easier. As such, it’s an ideal partner for shampoos and/or conditioners. The vegetable can be found in this form at Unbottled — a brand known for its responsible solid cosmetics — which combines broccoli, argan and green clay to promise shinier hair. The Compagnie des Sens chooses an organic virgin vegetable oil, while Freshly Cosmetics opts for a facial mask made of charcoal, seaweed, clays and broccoli enzymes. In the past, the hair benefits of mustard have been applied in hair masks. There are now vegetable oils, or even shampoos, leveraging on the age-old ingredient. But mustard seeds would also have skin benefits. Brands such as WAAM Cosmetics, My Mira and MyCosmetik therefore offer mustard oils for hair and skin. Essentially offered in the form of oil, the onion - and, in particular, the red onion - is an object of growing interest from the cosmetics industry. As soon as this year, we could start seeing creams, masks and serums formulated with its extracts. If red onions are the beauty industry’s most coveted variety, it’s because they appear to be the richest variety in sulfur compounds. These are beneficial for hair, promoting its regrowth. But onion can also be a top ally for problem skin, thanks to its purifying virtues, helping fight against acne and reduce scarring. Still relatively little marketed, natural onion oil is proposed by certain retailers and specialized brands, as well as by the brand WAAM Cosmetics, which evidently has a taste for unusual natural ingredients. But how far can this phenomenon go? It’s hard to say, as consumers are now very fond of natural cosmetics, relegating long-winded formulas to the back of their beauty kits. And, as we know, the riches of nature are virtually infinite. In fact, a French brand called Perlucine now even offers a whole range of cosmetics — for face, body and hair — with white oyster shell powder. They may not be crunchy, but they’re no less indulgent!"
"After CBD, cosmetic science investigates the benefits of CBG","The sale of cannabis derivatives is still a subject of debate, with different countries taking different views of and approaches to the marketing of cannabidiol (CBD) products. In spite of that, cannabidiol — one of the compounds contained in hemp — is proving a hit around the world, with a market that could reach $13.4 billion by 2028, according to Grand View Research. But this active substance could now be joined by another, even less well known compound called CBG, which stands for cannabigerol. Like cannabidiol, CBG is one of the hundred or so cannabinoids present in cannabis. It’s just that, for the moment, it’s much less known than CBD. That said, it’s starting to interest scientists and manufacturers who are currently exploring its potential in order to introduce this compound to the realms of wellness and beauty. Non-psychotropic, like CBD and unlike THC, it is, in a way, the basis of its counterparts since it transforms into other cannabinoids — including the latter two — during the growth of the plant. This can explain why it is found in relatively small quantities, and in low concentrations. But its properties are no less useful. Just as CBD has now found its way into many bathrooms — in forms as diverse as oils, serums, creams, cleansers, scrubs and even deodorants — we could soon see the same lines of products enriched this time with CBG. Some players are already working on the virtues highlighted by scientific studies — namely anti-inflammatory, soothing, antibacterial and antioxidant properties... Note too, that since 2021, CBG has been included in the European Union’s database of cosmetics ingredients (CosIng). CBG oils are already available in specialist stores, promising relaxing virtues that can help combat stress and fatigue. But the cosmetics industry could quickly seize on this new ally to offer a wider range of products for the skin. For its part, the France-based network of specialist CBD boutiques, Purple Store, this week announced that it is ""embarking on the development of CBG-based products,"" which could range from wellness products to cosmetics. In any case, it’s a trend to follow closely."
"Sensoriality, wellbeing, emotion: Seppic’s vision of cosmetics and happiness","In order to respond to the quest for well-being and happiness that emerges after the successive lockdowns linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, Seppic relies on highly sensorial cosmetic textures, a source of pleasure and precious moments of relaxation. But also on ingredients that bring well-being and positive emotions. On the occasion of Cosmet’Agora, Seppic therefore created formulas dedicated to happiness and well-being. The transforming formula Cosmos Skin Bliss thus offers a rich initial texture that releases an aqueous film after spreading. Its quick absorption leaves a refreshing bare skin effect. This multifunctional product adapts to all needs. This formula uses the patented Geltrap technology, an emulsion with an extra water-rich gelled internal aqueous phase, appreciated by all geographical areas. On the anti-ageing side, the formula boosts self-esteem with Aspar’Age, an active ingredient that helps consumers feeling younger (the benefit was confirmed by personal, instrumental and observer evaluations). According to Seppic: “It’s a dose of good mood in a tube!” Always on the lookout for immediate well-being, consumers are looking for skincare products that suit their needs and desires. The refreshing Fresh Water Drop provides immediate pleasure thanks to the quick break effect of the Sepinov Weo polymer. Moreover, it contains Antileukine 6, an oily active ingredient named ""golden algae"", soothing and protecting the skin after sun exposure. A dose of freshness and well- being that brings a boost! And for consumers who are interested in a holistic approach to body and mind, the Happy Skin Inside & Out kit is ideal. It contains a ""pro-ageing"" skin care that stimulates hearing, smell, sight with the appearance of a pink foam and a soft and comfortable touch thanks to the combination of Emogreen, Montanov 202 and Sepimax Zen for a unique multi-sensory experience; and for taste, it is accompanied by nutritive gums containing Ceramosides, an hydrating and anti-aging active from Seppic’s nutrition expertise. The cosmetic care contains the cosmetic grade Ceramosides HP. This ""inside & out"" beauty routine is thus global. Three other formulas combining cosmetics and emotions are also available in Seppic’s Cosmet’Agora kit. “At a time when consumers are looking for a sensory and emotional experience in cosmetics, Seppic innovates by inspiring its customers through its ‘Happy Cosmetic’ collection and invites them to rediscover its ingredients that ‘boost’ positive emotions,” highlight the company."
Cosmet’Agora 2022: Happy Cosmetics as a post-COVID perspective,"Nomadic, regressive, fun to use, melting, solid, anhydrous, yet often daring, the formulas presented at Cosmet’Agora, on January 11th and 12th in Paris, tried their best to combine ecology and ethics with sensoriality and pleasure, without which there would be no cosmetic industry. For stress-free travels and light luggage, many single-dose formats, with different technologies, were on display. In the form of multicoloured beads, IMCD’s Hand Cream to Share (NOI of 99.2% [1]) combines 40% water with a duo of waxes (sunflower for the shape and candelilla for the sensoriality), in a W/O emulsion. At Gattefossé, the combination of Geleol MB and Emulium Kappa MB allows obtaining the black pebbles of Magma Mask (NOI of 98%). Mixed in the palm of the hand with either the Everything Balm or warm water, each pebble delivers the desired amount of product. Another remarkable formula in the Escapism collection is the Slide n’Foam (NOI of 92%), a cube offering a new face cleansing gesture. Unlike soap, it can be applied directly to dry skin, to start melting just enough thanks to Lipocire A SG. Activated with water, the film turns into a foam, boosted by Acticire MB, before being rinsed off. DIY fans will be able to travel from home thanks to the ritual proposed by Lavolée: ""5 days, 5 Pearls of the World"". The products (100% natural and water-dispersible), after being crushed in a mortar will deliver a moisturising face and body cream. Each day/pearl is associated with a colour and an active ingredient coming from a different continent, represented by a dream beach. After the Zanzibar pearls, the Venice Beach pearls, the Maya Bay pearls and the Palombaggia pearls, the Copacabana pearl will surprise its user with a two-step ritual. After opening it in two, the user will collect a face and body scrub before preparing his or her skin moisturiser. For trips to sunny destinations, Stéarinerie Dubois has concocted Smile Protect, a solid SPF30 O/W sun emulsion (in vitro measured). The association of the self-emulsifying base DUB Base Expert + and the waxy ester DUB Cire H1 adds smoothness and comfort to the application, while the dispersing base DUB Helioptima allows reducing the number of UV filters, without compromising on the SPF. Some exhibitors invited their visitors to take a trip back to childhood, such as Azelis, whose Wonderland Paris formula kit celebrated the 30th anniversary of Disneyland Paris. The ultra-melting and fresh Lie l’eau et Stick eye serum is not stearate-based but formulated without soap, thanks to a combination of three hydrocolloids: A carrageenan (Genugel CG-130) and a gellan gum with a low degree of acylation (Kelcogel CG-LA) help to ensure the staying power and transparency, as well as the suspension of flakes, while a lambda grade of carrageenan (Genuvisvo CG 129) delivers the necessary smoothness for application. The Reine des Perles hand cream combines two gellan gums (Kelcogel CG-LA and CG-LA) in a soft and melting solid foam texture. Each pearl includes antibacterial and nourishing agents to meet today’s market expectations. Back to childhood games again with Anjac, whose modelling pastes (NOI of 99%) offer a double transformation texture. Each modelling gum will serve for 2 or 3 uses: Mixed with water, it forms an exfoliating cream with an adjustable consistency. And for an indulgent scrub, Lessonia’s Choco Soap bar combines the richness and softness of cocoa butter and powder with the exfoliating properties of coffee grounds. This exfoliating soap (100% of natural origin) for the hands, body and face, proposed in single-dose packages, can be easily slipped in a handbag. In its solid emulsion Rise and Shine Eye Lotion (NOI of 100%) in the form of a coffee bean, Hallstar combines coffee oil and butter with LOOK Oleoactif and LIFT Oleoactif for global action on the eye contour. On the side of delicacies, candies have given rise to many interpretations. This is the case with Daito Kasei’s Candies Day Cream, to rehydrate before application, with each colour corresponding to a care routine to select according to the mood of the day. Cargill’s Solid Cleansing Jellies, formulated with carrageenans, can also be chosen according to one’s early morning mood, and envelop the skin with a sweet gourmand fragrance, even after rinsing. Taking the concept to the extreme, Greentech created Mask’ambar CBD, a bar with an ultra-regressive chocolate-caramel scent. Once rehydrated and applied as a mask, it only takes a fun gesture to remove the formula after spraying the peel-off solution. Each bar contains soothing CBD Isolate 1 and Circalys 2, which are believed to work on the brain-skin axis to reduce signs of fatigue and negative emotions. Beyond solid formulas, many of the innovations presented offered (more or less) new perspectives regarding water preservation. For example, PolymerExpert presented Heureux Événement, a skincare product (99.5% of natural origin) containing three preservative-free oil jellies packed in a single bottle. This care softens and moisturises the skin of expectant mothers during the last two trimesters of their pregnancy, and restores skin suppleness in the first months after childbirth. Solabia has also looked into different ways of reducing water consumption in cosmetic formulas: Solid formulas, no-rinse products, or simply by replacing demineralised water with vegetable water with a cosmetic benefit. Its Waterless Beauty Box for instance contains a shower gel in tablet form, a body butter, a restructuring stick for the face, a handmade solid shampoo, but also a two-phase hair care product (95% natural ingredients) with cascara extracts (Oleat Osun Cascara and Cascara Water) rich in polyphenols, in which cascara water replaces part of the demineralised water to increase the cosmetic benefit. Along the same lines, Quimdis offers Pow’deo, a powder deodorant to dilute in a reusable roll-on pack. The minimalist formula (only 10 ingredients, 96% of which are of natural origin) combines starch powders with bicarbonate and an active ingredient derived from zinc to regulate the skin pH and ensure sweat absorption. Another formula to rehydrate is Osmosand by Lucas Meyer, a hair care product in powder form to rehydrate before rinsing it off after application. Ecogel, an emulsifying-gelling agent binds the texture and adds creaminess. To make the most of water in its formula, the Osmomist milky mist, another innovation in the Osmosys collection, is formulated with Hamamelis water, stabilised with Heliofeel 22 MB. Making it very easy to apply, Saci-CFPA’s Milky Sand Radiant Body Serum can be applied directly on the skin after showering, which means it does not need to be rehydrated. On contact with damp skin, this 100% natural powder is activated in a moisturising and illuminating serum for a healthy glow. A formula which received the 1st prize in the formulation contest organised, as every year, on the occasion of the show.

Olfactory reformulation: a creative practice for timeless perfumes,"Reformulation is an integral part of the perfumer’s job. The main reason for it is the need to adapt fragrances to the changeable availability of raw materials. In addition to regulatory restrictions, in particular in Europe, there are “shortages of both natural and synthetic ingredients for climatic or geographic reasons, or because plants are shut down, for example,” explains Suzy Le Helley, perfumer at Symrise. Trained at the technical reformulation division of the fragrance composition company, she gradually learned to complete the reformulation work with literature search and olfactory analyses. It is a demanding experience, in particular with old perfumes, “whose fans know all notes by heart.” This practice can prove extremely complex with De Laire Bases, some of whose materials are now banned. For these combinations much useful to perfumers, the olfactory outcome can be very tricky to reproduce. “My greatest challenge was to rework a 1950s ‘formula à tiroirs’ comprising several De Laire Bases, i.e. almost 500 raw materials. This huge work took me over a year,” recalls the young woman. And yet, recent perfumes, which should also be made compliant with IFRA standards, do represent a challenge. “For example, short, readable formulas created by Jean-Claude Ellena, Michel Almairac, or Maurice Roucel, in which every ingredient has its own place, require refined, very precise substitution work.” The phase of evaporation on the skin, which is essential, also requires much attention and creativity. Reformulation of old perfumes without archives is yet another issue. The rebirth of old brands (Teo cabanel, Jovoy, Houbigant, Lubin, Le Galion, or, more recently, Marcelle Dormoy, Maison Violet, Cherigan, Bienaimé) increased this phenomenon, although some of them were able to keep their documentation. Cinquième Sens recently tried to take up this challenge. “We had to recompose a 1930s perfume based on a sample which dated back to the 1950s, without the original formula,” explains perfumer Alice Dattée. If chromatography is a precious help, it is not enough. “The sample was old, the top notes had evaporated,” she explains. It is a real balancing act to harmonize creative middle and back notes. This long-term work combines olfactory analyses, culture, and strategy. For once, the IFRA directives were favourable to perfumers. “With IFRA 48, the coumarin assay would not have been viable, whereas IFRA 49 helped position the perfume as a mixed fragrance to take advantage of more flexible standards.” The most difficult with these old perfumes is to transcribe the nitrated musk effect with today’s ingredients, agree Alice Dattée and Suzy Le Helley. Indeed, another major issue has to do with the use of natural ingredients which have become very costly: it can involve reducing their dose. “Then, you need to get as close as possible to the original’s spirit, while remaining up-to-date,” analyzes Alice Dattée. “It is almost improvisation to reformulate old perfumes which have disappeared,” confirms Patrice Revillard, of Laboratoire Maelstrom. The perfumer won the competition organized by Panouge to recreate L’Iris Gris by Jacques Fath (1947), a fragrance that has become mythical. “It was tricky to get as close to the original version as possible, because this perfume is known based on vintage versions that have changed and macerated over time,” explains Patrice Revillard. Without the original formula, he worked on the version kept by L’Osmothèque and enriched his olfactory analysis with well-preserved vintage fragrances. The biggest issue lied in the use of the eugenol note, which is very limited by European Directives. “That is why our formula is a little less spicy, less ‘eyelet’ than the original,” says Patrice Revillard. “Luckily, since the writing style of L’Iris Gris is quite modern, we did not have to replace notes like nitrated musks, liliales, or oak moss.” This illusionist work consists in reinterpreting the perfume rather than technically reproducing the formula. “We were lucky enough to work with an unlimited budget, because the natural fragrances of that time have become very costly,” adds Patrice Revillard, who will soon take up the challenge of working with a more restricted budget, since Panouge aims to launch a more affordable version of L’Iris Gris. Well, it is said that constraints stimulate creativity…"

Silab reconnects aged fibroblasts to help regenerate mature skin,"According to Sibab research, the so-called “fibroblast regenerating complex”, the cooperation process between the cutaneous, immune and vascular systems that is instrumental to cutaneous regeneration is altered with age. The capacity of fibroblasts to interconnect the three systems, via the secretion of a pool of growth factors, is thereof reduced. In order to revitalize the key processes of regeneration, Silab developed Regenixir [1], a patented regenerating active ingredient that stimulates the skin’s capacity to synthesize its own “growth elixir.” According to the French-based manufacturer of cosmetic active ingredients, by restoring the capacity of aged fibroblasts to interact with their environment, Regenixir enables a transversal action on the three interconnected systems: – cutaneous system: matrix restructuring and epidermal renewal are improved [2];
– vascular system: formation of a vascular network is restored [3];
– immune system: pro-regenerating macrophages population is increased. In clinical tests, an emulsion with Regenixir at 2.5% demonstrated an anti-wrinkle effect as of 21 days of application, by significantly reducing crow’s feet wrinkles in Caucasian (-10%) and Asian subjects (-6%). According to Silab, tested in Caucasian volunteers in the same conditions, the active ingredient: – improves the biomechanical properties of the skin (firmness: +10%; elasticity: +14%; tonicity: +25%);
– attenuates the visibility of microvessels (-6%) and demonstrates an anti-under-eye circles efficacy by significantly improving the colour of under-eye circles;
– significantly restores the parameters characteristic of complexion radiance (reflection: +9%; pink colour: +15%; olive colour: -7%; luminosity: -6%). “All these effects continue after 42 days of treatment and are perceived by the volunteers themselves,” said Silab. For developing Regenixir, Silab has focused on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Widely used in the food industry, this yeast is also recognized by the medical and scientific community for its countless properties: richness in nutrients, capacity to stimulate energy production and immune defences, etc. From S. cerevisiae, Silab has extracted oligo-β-glucans that can restore the interconnectivity of the cutaneous, immune and vascular systems for a regenerating anti-aging effect. Available in aqueous solution (recommended amount: 0.25 to 2.5%), Regenixir has a content of natural origin of 99% (ISO 16128) and is compliant with international cosmetic regulations (Europe, United States, China, Japan, etc.)."
2022 inspirational formulas: on the go and anhydrous products by Gattefossé,"Dubbed Escapism, Gattefossé’s new inspirational collection aims to be an invitation to dream of new destinations while rethinking the art of travelling. Therefore, the company’s applications laboratory has developed practical solid and anhydrous formulations to transform the beauty routines of travellers. Solid cosmetics are not only trends, since they are part of a global movement to protect the planet by reducing the overall impact on the environment, including beauty. However, beyond the many benefits they have to offer to the environment, the characteristics of solid cosmetics make them the best solution for travelling. Indeed, they are easily transportable, smaller and lighter than conventional versions. They are also multifunctional, with a size that can be adapted to the trip duration and most of them do not leave any waste behind. This year, Gattefossé developed 5 new formulations: Magma Mask, a mask in the form of solid black pellet to grind to powder; Everything Balm, a multifunctional anhydrous balm texture; Softer Skin Stick, a scrub made from vegetal waxes and apricot kernels and shaped in a stick format for convenient use; Scalp & Body Scrub, an exfoliating wax that rinses easily; and finally Slide n’ Foam, a solid face cleanser. ""As its name suggests, Inspiration is a collection of formulas created, to inspire formulators by highlighting Gattefossé ingredients used out of their comfort zone. Each year, we focus on one or more themes illustrated with new formulations. The idea is above all for our lab team members to let their imagination and creativity run free, to propose original and surprising formulas while respecting our charter in terms of naturality and sustainability,"" said Flora Bollon, Product Marketing Leader Texture & Applications at Gattefossé."
Solvay unveils two biodegradable guar ingredients for beauty care products,"According to Solvay, Jaguar C500 STD, a conditioning polymer, and Jaguar HP-8 COS SGI, a multifunctional polymer, will help formulators to produce beauty care solutions with superior benefits and desirable biodegradability claims thereby responding to both stringent global regulations and the changing expectations of consumers searching for more responsible, sustainable products. “Consumers are becoming more aware of how their actions impact the health of our planet,” explained Stephanie Neplaz, global marketing innovation director, hair care at Solvay. “This means they are looking for beauty products made with biodegradable ingredients that have a positive impact on their hair or skin as well as on the planet.” The guar beans used to create these polymers are sourced in India where Solvay is supporting sustainable guar sourcing through the Sustainable Guar Initiative program, which is part of the group’s sustainability agenda. The Sustainable Guar Initiative aims to implement best farming practices to improve guar quality and supply security while enabling farmers to earn a better living, and to preserve precious groundwater, and empower local women. “We are constantly investing in innovation, technology, and developing our Jaguar portfolio,” said Jean-Guy Le Helloco, global vice president, home and personal care at Solvay. “And we have more innovations, such as next generation biodegradable polymers, on the horizon.”"
Three natural ingredients coming to beauty routines in 2022,"The pandemic has sounded the death knell for complex product formulas and endless beauty routines, paving the way for more authentic, natural approach and preventative care. Beauty is now more minimalist, focusing on a few key active ingredients instead of multiple layers of creams, serums and other products. Throughout 2021, the craze on TikTok - Gen Z’s preferred social network - was all about grandma’s age-old remedies based on natural ingredients. If retinol — considered one of the most effective anti-aging active ingredients — is the star ingredient at the start of the year, as it has been around the world throughout 2021 (alongside aloe vera and vitamin C) according to a recent research from Skincare Hero, some botanical ingredients may supplant this active form of vitamin A in the coming months. The prickly pear, for instance, is enjoying increasing success thanks to its anti-aging properties. Found in Mexico and the Maghreb, prickly pear seed oil is now renowned throughout the world for its anti-aging properties, now giving rise to numerous cosmetics formulated with this natural ingredient. Rich in vitamin E, polyunsaturated fatty acids and sterols, prickly pear seed oil not only reduces the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines, but also improves skin tone and fights premature aging. And to top it all off, it is believed to have healing properties. While it is found in the form of a plant-based oil, there is a growing number of cosmetics based on prickly pear, including creams and masks for the skin and hair. Star of social media in 2021, rice is now an exceptional ingredient in cosmetics, enhancing dull skin, combination to oily skin, as well as mature skin. In fact, TikTokers came up with hacks and challenges throughout 2021 to highlight the many virtues of rice, using hashtags like #ricewaterhairchallenge (75 million views) and #ricewaterforskin (3.6 million views). While there were already rice-based cosmetics, it hasn’t taken long to see the emergence of many more, from rice powder masks to rice bran plant oils, exfoliants, mattifying powders and the likes. Used for centuries in Asia to enhance women’s skin and hair, rice powder is known for its strong absorbing and mattifying power, whereas rice water, rich in antioxidants, fights the signs of aging while improving skin firmness and deep moisturizing. And as if that wasn’t enough, rice is also a great ally for hair, making it stronger and shinier. Properties that are now highlighted in a host of beauty brands’ products in the cosmetics aisle. If the environmental qualities of flax have allowed it to make a comeback in the fashion world in 2021, its benefits for the skin are perhaps less well known. And yet, the powers of its flowers and seeds make it an essential ally for sensitive, dry and mature skin. And it’s clear that cosmetic brands have caught on too, bringing out a vast choice of creams, serums and oils based on this ingredient that’s soon to be a must-have. The most sensitive skins will appreciate the soothing, anti-inflammatory and emollient powers of flax, which, as a bonus, has regenerating and repairing properties. But flax is also everywhere in the moisturizing section since it has nourishing virtues, while improving the elasticity and tonicity of the skin. Like prickly pear and rice, flax is also a top choice for mature skin because it would help delay skin relaxation and sagging. And, like its counterparts, it is not to be outdone when it comes to boosting hair in need of strength and thickness."
Firmenich and Jungle create a sustainable lily of the valley extract,"Lily of the valley is known in perfumery as one of the most iconic “silent flowers”, a flower that yields no essence, and its use in the composition of fragrances is therefore very difficult, if not impossible. In order to create the first-ever commercial sustainable extract obtained from the lily of the valley flower, Firmenich has relied on its patented Firgood extraction technology, which uses the water contained in botanical cells: once warmed up by electromagnetic vibration, the water carries the odorant components, to yield the final pure extract. Developped for the luxury perfume market, Muguet Firgood was developed through a collaboration with French start-up Jungle, a specialist in vertical agriculture, a technology allowing to grow crops in vertically stacked layers for reduced land and water use. According to Firmenich, Muguet Firgood is a pure and 100% natural ingredient with fresh and authentic notes never obtained before. “It is the first time in the history of perfumery that an extract of this flower has been captured with a safe and sustainable process, offering a completely new olfactory profile with genuine tonalities,” said the company in a statement. The Firgood technology does not require any solvent. The dry biomasses only needs water humidification and the whole extraction process only requires low energy consumption and generates clean wastes that can easily be upcycled. Combined with Jungle’s unique capabilities in vertical farming, allowing to create clean and highly efficient farms, the technology provides high yields with a very low environmental impact. “Our strategic partnership and joint expertise with Jungle on sustainable technologies now makes it possible for our perfumers to capture and harness the genuine natural scent of this exquisite flower to the benefit of our customers and of consumers,” said Julien Firmenich, Vice President Product Strategy and Promotion. “Muguet Firgood is a truly rare and precious ingredient.” Firmenich will market Muguet Firgood as a captive ingredient intended for the fine fragrance market. It will thus complete the exclusive range of natural ingredients available to the company’s perfumers. By combining their respective expertise, the partnership between Firmenich and Jungle should shape new sustainable natural ingredients for the fragrance market. “This project with Firmenich has strengthened our protocols and expertise in cultivating plants, in our vertical farms, for their enhanced biological activity,” underlined Gilles Dreyfus, President and Co-founder of Jungle. “We are now well positioned to support the cosmetics and nutraceutical industries by providing safe, local and reproductible plant extracts.”"
"Sozio launches Cosmocaps, a 100% natural encapsulation technology","Developed to provide an alternative to synthetic microcapsules, the Cosmoscaps are microcapsules that encapsulate perfumes into a vegetable matrix made of natural waxes. This 100% natural innovation is also Cosmos-certified. ""This technology is the result of a reflection that we had started to be able to provide our customers in the natural segment - accounting for 30% of our portfolio - with an encapsulation technology. The innovation does not only provide a solution without microplastics but also a Cosmos certified solution to natural cosmetic brands,” explains Laurie Junillon, Marketing & Communication Director at Sozio. According to Sozio, the vegetable base gives Cosmocaps a double action: they ensure a controlled release of the fragrance on the skin throughout the day and bring emollient properties to the formulas. As far as the performance olfactive is concerned, the fragrance benefits from a progressive and continuous diffusion on the skin, before and after rinsing. In addition, Sozio’s Cosmocaps provide a cosmetic benefit thanks to the emollient properties of their vegetable matrix, which nourishes and restructures the skin. According to Sozio, the Cosmocaps are adapted to all cosmetic bases, in particular aqueous emulsions, whether for rinse or leave-on products. However, they are not compatible with alcoholic bases. The Cosmocaps do not cause any change in the product’s texture, a slight clouding of the formula can however be observed."
"Beraca launches Berashades, a range of natural colours for cosmetics","The launch features a palette of five naturally coloured clays for mineral cosmetics - Ivory, Beige, Bronze, Caramel and Ebony. These five shades allow to mix customize more than 3,000 colour combinations adapted to the different skin tones, claims Beraca. The shades in the Berashades palette with meets vegan claims and offer good coverage, allowing a more natural appearance and matte effect, in addition to stable colour resulting from a micronization process. [1] As a mineral ingredient, they also offer detoxifying and a remineralizing effect, adds the Brazilian company. The skin barrier protection offered by Berashades was assessed in a TEWL Test that showed a significant reduction of transepidermal water loss, thus demonstrating the ability of the ingredient to ensure skin integrity and hydration. Additionally, a cutometer test to study skin firmness showed improved firmness after seven consecutive days. In parallel, Beraca also launched an online tool, The Berashades Mixer, which is a digital platform that allows formulators to create their own shades with simultaneous access to different levels of benefits delivered by the ingredient, such as hydration, skin ́s barrier function and firmness. This technology aims to assist professionals in each of the tones created, in particular in order to reduce time-to-market. Berashades was designed for use in a wide range of cosmetic products, including makeup (mascara, foundation, concealer, compact powder, tanning powder, contour palette), hair care (powdered or dry coloured shampoo, root retouch), skin care (tanning oil, cream and moisturizer, BB cream, CC cream). Clays are a major trend in the cosmetics industry. According to Mintel GNPD, the number of global skin care products containing clay has grown by 27% in the last five years, reaching 819 launches in 2020. For hair care, the growth was 62% in the last two years, registering 232 new products in 2020."
Berkem targets skin irritation with a polyphenols-rich botanical ingredient,"Berkem, which recently announced an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in order to be listed at Euronext Growth in Paris, has just unveiled a new plant active ingredient intended to relieve the skin for the stress and discomfort induced by mask-wearing, also known as “maskne” (or mask-related acne). Dubbed Skin’Calm [1], this active ingredient is extracted from the flower of false acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia). Sourced in France from organically grown plants, Skin’Calm is rich in sugars and polyphenols [2], both of which help fight certain skin disorders by soothing the skin, rebalancing its pH and correcting imperfections. The soothing properties of the active ingredient were evaluated by an ex-vivo proteomic study (a screening of all skin proteins in order to identify those impacted by the botanical extract), which revealed a 25% decrease in the expression of the S100-A8 protein (compared to usual levels). This protein is known for playing a prominent role in the regulation of inflammatory processes and immune response. An in-vivo test confirmed the ingredient’s anti-blemish effect, its ability to reduce discomfort sensations and oily skin, and to improve the skin’s texture. ""As a skin care ingredient Skin’Calm was eagerly awaited by professionals in the cosmetics industry, who are keen to offer products adapted to ’maskne’,"" explains Berkem in a statement. Driven by a particular attention to skin health and the overall search for well-being, the dermo-cosmetics market is growing strongly, together with strong expectations regarding the use of natural ingredients. Since the start of 2020, demand has only accelerated, in particular due to the stress generated by the obligation to wear facial covers in link to the health situation. ""Maskne"" - or the skin irritation linked to mask-wearing - is often cited as a major concern of consumers in post-Covid times globally.  A study by market research firm The NPD Group, pointed that sales of face care products claiming anti-acne and anti-blemish benefits grew by 32% between 2019 and 2020. “Skin’Calm is a 3-in-1 ingredient that meets the strong expectations of the cosmetics market. It promotes skin’s balance together with soothing and anti-imperfection benefits,” highlights Charlène Martin, BtoB plant extraction product manager at Berkem. Berkem’s Skin’Calm complies with China’s cosmetic regulations and can be used as an ingredient for soothing face and body care products, and to reduce face skin blemishes."
Lubrizol emphasizes eyes beauty with new sustainably sourced botanical active,"Dubbed Resulook, the new botanical ingredient crafted by Lubrizol Life Science - Beauty (LLS Beauty) is sustainably sourced from Myrothamnus flabellifolius, an African species also known as the “resurrection plant” for its ability to remain dormant during drought, then revive after a rainfall. The Zulu people believe that this reviving ability can be transmitted to those who use the plant. Inspired by the traditional uses of the botanical, LLS Beauty created Resulook to enhance the appearance of the eyes. To achieve this unique benefit, the company used an eco-friendly alternative to conventional chemical solvent. In addition to a lower environmental footprint, the so-called Phenobio subcritical water technology generates a broader range of phytoactives in higher concentrations. “Today, the emphasis on eyes in the beauty business is greater than ever due to mask wearing brought on by the pandemic. Healthy, fuller eyelashes and brows complement and flatter the eyes, whether the customer wears makeup or not. Now, more so than ever, our eyes make a first impression,” highlights the company. According to LLS Beauty, in vitro testing has shown that Resulook improves hair anchorage and supports hair growth. Furthermore, clinical testing performed with a serum and a mascara containing 2% ingredient showed a 164% increase in eyelash length compared to a placebo. Other results were a lash lift effect and filling effect for bolder eyebrows. The resurrection plant is ethically sourced by a company that works with rural farmers trained in sustainable practices. “The business contributes to community development throughout Zimbabwe by creating jobs and improving living conditions,” said LLS Beauty. The company also works closely with the nonprofit Samara Foundation to give back to rural harvesting communities."
"Givaudan unveils microbiome-friendly fragrance technology, Z-biome","Givaudan’s scientists and perfumers have developped two new technologies, My Z-biome and Z-biome Deo, designed to ensure consumers can choose not only beautiful scents, but also microbiome-friendly fragrances across a range of personal care products and body deodorants. My Z-biome is a fragrance design tool that allows Givaudan perfumers to craft fragrances that take special consideration of the skin’s microflora. More focused on personal hygiene, the Z-biome Deo technology allows the creation of microbiome-friendly and deo-effective fragrances. The fragrance giant says Z-biome Deo is based on “more than 30 years of expertise in malodour counteraction research to effectively combat sweat malodour while respecting the natural perspiration process.” According to Givaudan, these innovations match with the growing desire of consumers to protect their skin’s microbiome in a context where more and more people believe that wellbeing is connected to the health of the skin. To develop these new fragrance technologies, Givaudan as conducted extensive testing of raw perfumery ingredients for their impact on the skin’s most common bacteria population. Givaudan says the Z-biome Platform, paired with the expertise of their perfumers, will help brands create products that take care of the skin and work in harmony with the skin’s natural microbiome. “We always try to develop new technologies which are relevant to consumers’ needs, so the new Z-biome platform helps address the desire to protect the skin microbiome as well as enhancing overall wellbeing. We’re very proud of developing these new technologies that are in line with our purpose of creating for happier, healthier lives, with love for nature,” said Jeremy Compton, Global Head of Science & Technology, Fragrances at Givaudan."
"Skincare: “Good skin”, the return to a natural and serene beauty","Although the situation may vary significantly from one market to another, the pandemic has had a profound impact on consumer habits. Make-up is mostly down, while hygiene, hair care and skincare have benefited from the confinements. Perfume, after a worldwide drop, is experiencing a fine upturn in many markets. Not only has the interest in skincare products undeniably increased during the confinement periods, but skincare habits have also changed durably: No more layering of products, the trend is towards simplification, respect for the skin, and ""skin fasting"". Above all, the objective is the well-being of the skin for a fresh and natural complexion. People invest in daily care and hygiene rather than spending time concealing imperfections. They want perfect, luminous, unified skin... with a minimum of products while integrating new facial massage techniques. Another, even more minimalist trend, skin fasting, recommends using a minimum of products to let the skin self-regulate and regenerate itself. This skin fasting, which streamlines the application of cosmetics to two or three essential products, is said to give results after only two weeks. The skipcare trend also aims to reduce the number of products, to do better with less, but also to fight against wastage. The skincare ritual is reduced to a cleanser and a moisturiser. The choice of products used is all the more relevant as they must be effective, more concentrated in active ingredients and multifunctional. This minimalism does not mean that the time spent on skin care will be reduced. On the contrary, the use of accessories or optimisation techniques for greater efficiency is in vogue. As proof, Google searches on these subjects have more than fourfolded in 2021. Self-massage, use of a jade or rose quartz roller depending on the benefits sought, the gua sha technique (scraping, sand) or more high-tech techniques such as those offered by the Swedish brand Foreo. Its bestseller LUNA 3, made up of silicone dots, combined with T-Sonic pulses, removes up to 99.5% of impurities. The latest addition, BEAR combines advanced micro-currents, pulsations and Anti-Shock System to stimulate the 69 muscles of the face and neck. Firming effect guaranteed! Estée Lauder recently filed two separate patents, one for a reusable dispenser that cools the product before use to optimise its properties, the other for a multi-layer heating pad. The product alone is no longer sufficient and the search for ever more optimal efficiency is becoming the absolute quest. Women want a luminous skin, with a perfect glow, smooth, free of imperfections... the perfect glow. Brands have therefore reinvested in this niche by offering new galenic formulas such as exfoliating foams and lotions that are easier to use, concentrated in active ingredients or based on patented enzymatic complexes. The deep cleansing of the face once again becomes a fundamental gesture. And to add a touch of perfection, a BB or CC cream will replace the now obsolete foundation. Faced with these new challenges, laboratories must revisit their formulas. On the one hand, they have to integrate these new skincare routines by working on the sensory side, and on the other, they have to find simpler, more natural formulas, free of controversial ingredients... in short, more ""eco-designed"". According to Mintel [1], 62% of Millennials care about INCI lists and other information on the packaging, including environmental friendliness. Hygiene and hand care is also a new area of focus, due to COVID. Brands will have to come up with new solutions to meet demand. For ingredient suppliers, the challenge is to reconcile all aspects of CSR while keeping in mind the main consumer requirements.

Aloe vera tops the skincare charts as the world’s most-searched ingredient,"The pandemic has changed the face of cosmetics, making skincare products — preferably natural ones — rise to prime popularity. As a result, consumers are now looking for simplified formulas based on one or two ingredients with multiple benefits. Expert advice website Skincare Hero [1] looked at the most coveted ingredients by country, then by geographical area, by analyzing Google data on the subject. And the result is clear: aloe vera is the most searched skincare ingredient in 37 countries around the world. As seen in a previous study, hydration is at the heart of men’s and women’s skin care concerns. So, it’s perhaps not all that surprising to learn that an ingredient with strong moisturizing powers is being embraced in many countries around the world. Grown in places with generally warm climates, such as North Africa, South America and the Mediterranean, this age-old plant is primarily known for its high concentration of water, making it a great ally for dry and dehydrated skin. In detail, aloe vera tops the skincare ingredient search results in Italy, Finland, Switzerland, Sweden, Portugal, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Guyana, Paraguay, Costa Rica, Guadeloupe, Jamaica and Panama. Indeed, it seems that the star ingredient is especially popular among Europeans and Americans. The study also reveals that the most searched question about aloe vera is none other than: ""does aloe vera clear pimples?"" As it happens, the plant has healing virtues, which means it can play a role in fighting acne. Many people around the globe are now looking for ways of getting beautiful, natural skin, with no gimmicks. This is reflected in the recent craze for vitamin C, which has become a cosmetic must-have in recent months. Not only does it bring radiance to the complexion, but it can also reduce the signs of aging — a godsend for residents of the 12 countries in the world where it’s the most searched ingredient. These include Greece, Serbia, Slovenia, Malta, Bulgaria and even Fiji, mainly. Note that people in North and South America don’t seem particularly interested in this ingredient, which only tops the list in St. Vincent, in the heart of the Caribbean. This time, internet users’ top question is: ""should you use vitamin C serum every day?"" Something that is indeed recommended by specialists, who advise using it in a day cream. Neck and neck with vitamin C, retinol is also the top-searched ingredient in 12 countries around the world. A member of the retinoid family — a class of chemical compounds derived from vitamin A — retinol is now considered one of the most effective anti-aging agents. This seems to be important, even essential, for people in France, Belgium, Norway, Spain, Mexico, Brazil and even Colombia. As with many active ingredients intended to fight the signs of ageing, internet users are primarily wondering at what age to start using retinol. Note that hyaluronic acid, which leads searches in ’just’ seven countries, is nevertheless the star ingredient in the United States, Canada, and Australia."
Seppic adds sensoriality to clean beauty formulas with new rheology modifier,"Launched worldwide for cosmetic application, Sepilus K is a concentrated liquid polymer designed to give a touch of sensory elegance to particularly demanding formulations such as minimalist formulas or those compliant with ""Clean Beauty"". Already launched for a year in Asia where it has met with rapid success, Sepiplus K is Winner of Ringier Technology Innovation Awards 2021 in China for its high performance and its possibility to formulate with cold process. Sepiplus K is solvent, preservative and EO-free. Cold processable, it requires very little energy for formulation. “A considerable advantage for the development of more ecological products,” explains Seppic in a statement. It is not considered a microplastic [1] and comes as a concentrated inverse emulsion. Sepiplus K provides high performance in terms of thickening, oil stabilizing and resistance to electrolytes. It is pre-neutralised and efficient on a large pH range from 3 to 12. “Sepiplus K imparts a silicone-like gliding skin feel with a non-tacky and non-sticky finish. It has been scientifically proven in a study carried out in China according to the R3M score [2], that it activates the positive emotions of consumers, an important factor in the appreciation of cosmetic products,” adds Seppic."
Eurofragance debuts first captive with an upcycled genderless woody note,"According to Eurofragance, this new perfumery ingredient is significant in three respects: it completes the woody notes olfactive family; it is made from upcycled wood waste; and it has a genderless olfactive profile that meets today’s consumers expectations in the high-end fragrance segment. For the creation of their first captive note, Eurofragance paid great attention to sustainability. To avoid deforestation and any negative impact on the environment, the company chose to use discarded sawdust from a particular tree. The long upcycling process required to remove, via natural purification methods, all superfluous molecules from the wood compound, but to keep those of perfumistic interest. ""This time- consuming purification step was repeated over and over, over several months. In the end, [the team of researchers] was able to uncover an ingredient with the best olfactory profile, while retaining the soul of the wood,"" said Eurofragance. In French, soul (or essence) translates into “âme.” Hence, Eurofragance named their captive L’Âme du Bois, the soul of wood. While wood notes have always held an important place in the perfumer’s palette, as key ingredients to create the heart or base of a fragrance, they were historically perceived as being more masculine. However, for this new creation, Eurofragance aimed to design an ingredient that could appeal to women and men alike, and also resonate for those seeking more unisex scents. “L’Âme du Bois is avant-garde in terms of its conception, but, above all, for what it brings to fragrance creation. It redefines woody notes in a manner befitting our time. L’Âme du Bois is inclusive and all-embracing of other accords and olfactive notes. For Perfumers, L’Âme du Bois is a true breakthrough,” said Henry van den Heuvel, Global Creative Director and Senior Perfumer at Eurofragance. According to Felipe San Juan Tejada, R&D Scientist at Eurofragance, in the near term L’Âme du Bois should be reserved for the design of prestige fragrances and for all premium product categories, be it fine fragrance, home or personal care. Eurofragance’s L’Âme du Bois was unveiled at the Beautyworld Middle East trade show, which was held in Dubai from 05-07 October 2021. To illustrate the potential of this new captive the Spanish company used it to craft an exclusive collection of fragrances that was presented to visitors. In weeks to come, Eurofragance will present these creations to customers around the world who could not make it to Dubai."
"Givaudan’s Sericoside, a natural ingredient to regenerate the skin","“When it comes to anti-ageing, consumers want to see a reduction in lines, wrinkles and sagging skin,” explains Givaudan Active Beauty. Indeed, according to a recent study conducted by the manufacturer of active cosmetic ingredients, 75% of women consider these signs of ageing most responsible for looking older. [1] To address this concern, Givaudan Active Beauty presents Sericoside, a natural active ingredient able to rejuvenate and regenerate the skin, two claims loved by 66% of consumers when asked for expected antiageing benefits of a skincare product. Sericoside is crafted by green fractionation from Terminalia sericea roots, an African Silver tree whose name reveals the activity of the extract, as the adjective sericea, in ancient Latin, means “silky, smooth as silk”. According to Givaudan, it can offer skin a second youth by “resetting its cellular memory.” “Sericoside is a pure molecule obtained from the roots of Terminalia sericea, a tree that grows in the miombo forest of Central and Southern Africa. Through cellular reprogramming, Sericoside acts on multiple aspects of skin regeneration, activating many endogenous resources like antioxidant defences to reduce undereye bag and dark circles while also firming the skin. As an anti-ageing ingredient, Sericoside acts on skin texture and density by reducing wrinkles, fatigue and roughness aspects,” explained Giada Maramaldi, Personal Care Category Manager at Givaudan Active Beauty. Clinically tested on volunteers, Sericoside demonstrates significant results when formulated at low dosage (0.5%). Several parameters, all indicators of ageing, were evaluated during the study: skin elasticity and firmness were assessed by means of a cutometer on the right cheek at the baseline, at D15 and D30. According to Givaudan, fter only one month of application, skin tonicity had improved by 19.8% and signs of fatigue decreased by 16.5%. A positive effect was also visible on dark circles with 45% of the panel showing a perceptible improvement, along with a reduction in the volume of under-eye bags. These results have inspired Givaudan’s Active Beauty team to develop a brand new marketing concept,  Dream Contour, an eye-contour cream powered by Sericoside to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and dark circles and restore a youthful look. This 2-in-1 cream is also formulated with Escin, a natural ingredient crafted from horse chestnut, and Eliorelys, designed from cherry tree blossoms, to improve signs of ageing while instantly reducing under-eye puffiness thanks to its smoothing blur effect."
Croda: A new encapsulation technology for targeted sebum reduction on the scalp,"Croda has unveiled Nutrinvent Balance, a novel encapsulate designed to deliver instant sebum reducing benefits on the scalp, as the very latest innovation in their hair care ingredient portfolio. Nutrinvent Balance employs a novel encapsulation technology to ensure the targeted delivery and controlled release of actives onto the scalp and hair. According to Croda, the new ingredient is suitable for inclusion in a wide variety of hair care formulations, and delivers instant sebum reduction on the scalp from the first application. Nutrinvent Balance specifically targets consumers prone to scalp oiliness. “With effects that continue to improve with repeated applications, consumers are offered an opportunity to adapt their usual hair wash routines, with consumer perceivable improvements in scalp oiliness and hair aesthetics, for hair that looks and feels cleaner for longer,” said the company in a statement. According to Croda, consumers are seeking more convenient and sustainable hair care solutions. They’re increasingly looking for time-saving solutions, but a also increasingly aware of the need to maintain scalp wellness. This is particularly the case of those who have adopted intensive hair wash routines to combat scalp oiliness. They are now looking for gentler solutions to tackle oily scalps without compromising on the condition of the scalp or hair aesthetics. Nutrinvent Balance is a vegan ingredient, featuring 98% natural content according to ISO 16128 and can help reducing water consumption during use."
Is ashitaba beauty industry’s latest star ingredient?,"Ashitaba is also known as Angelica keiskei, which means ""tomorrow’s leaf."" It’s a plant that belongs to the carrot family, and is native to Japan — more precisely, to the country’s Pacific coast. But while carrots promise a healthy glow and a long-lasting tan, while making skin more supple, ashitaba is known for other virtues. Ashitaba is a perennial plant with divided green leaves and white flowers. Its stems contain edible yellow sap. It is primarily as a food — a superfood, even — that the plant became famous. In Japan, it’s consumed as a vegetable, but it is also often found in the form of tea, and used as an ingredient in certain ""health"" drinks. According to Japan’s tradition, Ashitaba is said to improve the health of those who consume it, while helping extend their lives by several years. Although these benefits have not been confirmed by scientific studies, the profusion of ashitaba-based foods and products now springing up worldwide testifies to a certain enthusiasm and interest for the plant. In addition, a study published in the scientific journal Nature Communications in 2019 identified DMC (4,4’-dimethoxychalcone) — a flavonoid found in ashitaba — as a natural compound with anti-aging properties. It is precisely these virtues that seem to interest some sections of the beauty industry today. It is mainly in the form of oil that we find this plant, often combined with other natural ingredients, promising an elixir of youth. Ashitaba has recently appeared in the composition of some cosmetic products. Based in France, the cosmetics Japanese-inspired brand Bijin is one of the first to promote this ingredient, which can be found in its ""Concentré Jeunesse Visage"" [Youthful Face Concentrate] from its Secret d’Okinawa range. Here, it is used in the form of an infusion, in association with Gettō — another plant from Japan considered to have anti-aging properties. It promises to deeply nourish and preserve the skin while fighting against skin aging. In a statement from the brand, Bijin explains that ashitaba is renowned for its anti-aging power, naturally reducing cellular decline by decreasing the formation of free radicals. The brand’s ""Concentré Jeunesse Visage"" has a 100% plant-based formula and is available for €49 per 50 ml via its e-store."

in-cosmetics Global skips over Barcelona edition and heads to Paris in 2022,"The organiser of the events dedicated to personal care ingredients has announced today that in-cosmetics Global will be held on 5-7 April 2022 in Paris, and that in-cosmetics Asia will take place on 1-3 November 2022 in Bangkok. Furthermore, in-cosmetics Latin America, which was planned to take place in São Paulo, Brazil from 22-23 September 2021, will now take place from 10-11 November. The decision to reschedule the events is due to the ongoing travel restrictions due to the pandemic, explained RX. “Despite live events now taking place, we have to consider the international nature of in-cosmetics Global. We have seen positive signs over the last few months with successes in the vaccination programme rollout, but new variants have created increased uncertainties and steady progress is not the case everywhere. We have been in continuous contact with both exhibitors and visitors, and it is clear the level of confidence to travel and attend large-scale international B2B exhibitions in the cosmetics industry is not there yet. Our primary aim is to meet the expectations of our exhibitors and visitors, and this we believe will happen in 2022,” said Roziani Zulkifli, Exhibition Director of in-cosmetics Global, in a statement. Also speaking about the announcement, Sarah Gibson, Exhibition Director of in-cosmetics Asia, said: “Thailand’s COVID cases are on the rise with Bangkok and neighbouring provinces placed in the dark red zone of maximum restrictions to curb the spread of infection. The new delta variant cases are increasing across Asia with widespread travel bans and further tightening of government movement measures. We believe that the most responsible decision at this stage is to allow time for Thailand and the ASEAN region to recover, and when safe, re-unite the Asia cosmetics community in 2022.” “After monitoring the coronavirus situation in Brazil, we’ve decided to postpone our Latin America show to November, which will give the country’s vaccination programme a further seven weeks to boost immunity. It was a difficult decision to make as we’re aware of the event’s importance to the region’s personal care industry and the demand for face-to-face networking. However, we believe it is the best course of action for all involved to ensure we can deliver a valuable business event to our exhibitors and attendees,” added Daniel Zanetti, Exhibition Director at in-cosmetics Latin America."
Solvay introduces a comprehensive restorative routine for textured hair,"Solvay has unveiled a complete routine for textured hair, featuring 10 products formulated to help textured hair consumers cleanse, moisturize and style their hair with products made specifically for them. According to Solvay, up to 75% of the world’s population has textured hair (40%-50% in the USA, 75% in Latin America, 20% in Europe,90% in Africa, 20% in the South of Asia), and natural hairstyles are increasingly seen as an element of personal identity. Yet, there is still a notable gap in high-end shampoos, conditioners and other hair care products made for these unique hair types. Solvay therefore strove to meet the challenge within the personal care world with ready-to-use formulations designed to help textured hair consumers embrace their natural hair. Acknowledging the many different types of hair was just the first step in creating hair care solutions formulated for textured hair. Then, in partnership with the textured hair stylists and models at Studio Ana’e, in Paris, France,Solvay’s scientists were able to evaluate and validate each of their products when used in real-world conditions. “As curls are becoming a huge part of the hair care and hairstyling market, we are often asked to share our expertise in the field,” said Aude Livoreil-Djampou, Founder of Studio Ana’e. “We particularly enjoyed this partnership because the whole Solvay team was totally dedicated to understanding the needs of curly haired women and men. The quality of the products we tested reflects their commitment to provide their clients with a high-level textured hair regimen.” In order to better address consumers expectations, in addition to providing highly specialized benefits for textured hair, Solvay has also developed many of the formulations with natural and eco-friendly ingredients. Solvay’s Restorative Textured Hair Routine includes: a ""Pure Clean Shampoo"", a ""Hydration Boost Shampoo"", a ""Cleansing Cream"", a ""Luxurious Moisturizing Conditioner"", a ""Moisture Lock Mask"", and a ""Wake-Up Curls Day Cream"". The other four products in the range will be unveiled soon. To learn more about the restorative textured hair routine Solvay’s formulation eBooklet is available online."
Eden Ecosystem presents new plant extraction model,"Premium Beauty News - What does the Eden Ecosystem model consist of? Rémi Pulvérail - It is the very first highly innovative project to include all key elements of the value chain: first, the optimized ultrasound extraction technology, which more efficiently captures what is in the plant, then the integrated farming dimension by means of our association with Cassan - one of the main Provence aromatic plant distilling company - and lastly, the creation and manufacturing of exclusive, original, tailor-made extracts. In short, our project unites the farmers that cultivate the plants, the engineers that develop the extract recipe using our innovative technology, and the plant that manufactures the extract with full control and traceability. This uncompromising project guarantees made-in-France products, short supply chains, and compliance with the circular economy and green chemistry principles. Premium Beauty News -  Why partner with farmers? Rémi Pulvérail - We have a partnership with Cassan, a distilling company which manages a family farming property that spreads out across 100 hectares in the Drôme, Vaucluse, and Alpes-de-Haute-Provence regions in southern France. It will help us upgrade the distillation waste generated by Cassan, but also manage exclusive cultures that meet both traceability and circular economy requirements for all customers interested. Co-founder of Eden Ecosystem Cassan boasts farming expertise as regards culture implementation and follow-up. With these exclusive parcels, we are actually considering producing great wines and putting forward the diversity of each region. Just like for wine, lavender, for example, does not provide the same results at all depending on its location, soil, altitude, and variety… So, for example, regarding perfumes, we aim to make people discover the olfactory diversity of these various regions and highlight the added value of all the aromatic plants we have in France – that is what consumers want today. Now, to us, all this involves partnering with farmers and putting forward their production in full transparency. Customers need to be aware of the farming reality. In the long run, we aim to develop new supply chains in these areas because they boast real expertise in perfume plants, and we also intend to exploit parcels on very large surface areas. Premium Beauty News - Why choose the ultrasound technology? Rémi Pulvérail - It was one of the most interesting gentle plant extraction technologies for our business model. We use ultrasounds to optimize the extraction, but also green solvents, exclusively. This technology helps capture plant actives more efficiently. The process involves very low temperatures for a shorter time, so it preserves the plant better. Lastly, ultrasounds help make molecules explode more efficiently, which makes it possible to extract more for a different result from those obtained with standard methods. We mainly work on dry plants: spices, roots, wood… so we can more easily manage the constraints related to harvest periods. Ultimately, by upgrading distillation grains, we carry out a double extraction from the same plant. L’Atelier Français des Matières invested a lot in this technology: 25% of our turnover every year over the past five years with very interesting results validated by Antoine Lie, a Master Perfumer and project partner. Premium Beauty News - Who is the target for these extracts? Rémi Pulvérail - We target all brand types, from major players to small companies in the fields of fine fragrances, cosmetics, aromatherapy and food supplements. We aim to build up strong partnerships with companies willing to put forward all players of the value chain in a fair manner."
Mibelle debuts new moss based ingredient to harmonize the skin’s moisture flow,"A few years after the launch of MossCellTec No.1, the Swiss-based supplier of cosmetic ingredient is launching MossCellTec Aloe [1], an unequaled aloe-moss extract sustainably obtained. Derived from aloe-moss (Aloina aloides), a tiny dark green to reddish-brown moss measuring 2 to 5 mm in height and known as “common aloe-moss”, MossCellTec Aloe improves cell-to-cell communication via connexin channels, optimally evens the moisture distribution in the skin and reduces the volume and depth of wrinkles. Due to the similarity in the appearance of the leaves, aloe-moss was named after the Aloe vera plant. This rare and tiny moss species has a high water retention capacity. Compared to seed plants, mosses do not have roots and water transport systems. Instead, they absorb water directly into their leaves. Mosses can trap excess water and nutrients from the soil and air. In vivo tests have shown that MossCellTec Aloe can reduce signs of skin aging (skin elasticity, wrinkle volume and depth), improve skin hydration and improve moisture homogeneity. MossCellTec Aloe is based on Mibelle Biochemistry’s MossCellTec technology which allows for the sustainable large-scale production of the moss extract."

"“in-cosmetics Global 2021 will be a hybrid event,” says Roziani Zulkifli","Premium Beauty News - The next in-cosmetics show will be a hybrid event. Can you tell us more about that?  Roziani Zulkifli - We know that nothing beats physical interaction, so, when face to face interactions do take place at the show, it will be the same as always but with the addition of health and safety precautions. This will ensure a safe experience for everyone involved whilst preserving the essence of the renowned event. Firstly, the virtual platform will open on 13 September to allow exhibitors and visitors to begin connecting and scheduling meetings for when they meet in-person in Barcelona from 5-7 October. The true virtual experience will commence post-show on 11 October as the online platform will be open again to allow R&D professionals and suppliers to meet digitally, in case they didn’t get the chance to do so in person. In addition, there will also be lots of live and on-demand content in the form of webinars, demos, tours and sessions that will run over the following weeks. On 29 October, we’ll wrap up in-cosmetics Global and bid farewell until next year, where we’ll reunite the personal care industry once again in Paris! Premium Beauty News - Will all exhibitors participate in both events (in person and digital)? Roziani Zulkifli - Exhibitors will participate in both the virtual and physical events as those that enrolled for the in-person show also receive a virtual listing as part of their stand package. However, as some companies may not be able to make it to Barcelona, we’ve also provided the option to just attend virtually to ensure they don’t miss out on all of the invaluable networking opportunities offered. Premium Beauty News - How both events will be articulated? Roziani Zulkifli - The in-person event will be the primary way to source ingredients, make connections, and generate new business leads. But the virtual event will complement it by allowing visitors to catch up on anything they may have missed at the show and start conversations with exhibitors they didn’t have time to meet onsite. Premium Beauty News - Do you already know how many exhibitors will attend this year? Roziani Zulkifli - We currently have 500 exhibitors attending the show. Premium Beauty News - What sanitary measures and restrictions will be implemented during the in-person event in Barcelona? Roziani Zulkifli - The health and safety of visitors, exhibitors and staff remains our top priority, and so we’re working closely with local authorities and the Fira Barcelona venue to adopt a robust ‘Health & Safety 5-point Strategy’ and implement all necessary precautions. The changes at in-cosmetics Global include an exhibition hall capacity of 1 person per 2.5m² and a one-way system to help maintain the government regulations of a minimum 1.5 metre social distancing. There will also be the highest standards of cleaning before, during and after the event, readily available hand sanitisers throughout the venue as well as increased ventilation to improve fresh air circulation. As COVID-19 safety and security requires participation from everyone, all those attending the event will be expected to follow a number of hygiene measures such as wearing face coverings, maintaining physical distancing, and refraining from shaking hands. Exhibitors will also be reviewing the design of their stands to assist with these measures and will be required to clearly display the maximum capacity to prevent overcrowding. Premium Beauty News - Next year the show will be in Paris. Any specific forecasts for this return to a normal (hopefully) show? Roziani Zulkifli - We are very excited for in-cosmetics Global 2022, which will take place in Paris on 5-7 April, but our primary focus at this time is the event taking place this October in Barcelona! For over a year, in-person activity has been put on hold due to the pandemic which has resulted in a string of event cancellations and postponements in all industries across the globe. We are very proud of our transition to virtual events, but it is our physical events that we are renowned for, and their absence has only strengthened our belief in the need for face-to-face events. We’re working extremely hard to see the return of in-cosmetics Global in a COVID-19 secure format. The next edition of in-cosmetics Global is due to take place from 5-7 October 2021 in Barcelona, Spain. For more information visit: www.in-cosmetics.com/global/en-gb.html "
Firmenich explores new territories with a sustainable technology,"The Swiss-based manufacturer of perfumes and aromas has patented a new extraction technology that enables the processing of biomass never previously used in the industry for natural ingredients. Named Firgood, this technology uses only the water that is an inherent part of the biomass cells. Once warmed up by electromagnetic vibration, the water carries the odorant components, to yield the final pure extract. According to Firmenich, this technology is the culmination of advances in sustainable extraction and is more environmentally friendly than any other extraction method. Solvent-free, dry biomasses only require water humidification. In addition, the whole extraction process only requires low energy consumption and generates clean wastes that can easily be upcycled. “This advanced and highly sustainable technology is a revolution for natural ingredients in our industry. It opens new creative territories, unexplored until now,” said Gilbert Ghostine, CEO of Firmenich. To implement this process, Firmenich has developed a new industrial tool within its centre of excellence for natural ingredients located in Grasse, in the south of France. “We have successfully scaled-up from lab and pilot plant to two industrial lines, offering production capacity that ranges from hundreds of kilograms to several tons of primary extracts,” added Boet Brinkgreve, President, Ingredients. The Firgood technology has already led to the addition of three natural extracts to Firmenich’s creative palette:  a pear extract, a ginger extract and a green bell pepper extract. In the coming months, 10 additional ingredients will be introduced, followed by a rich pipeline of future launches for both perfumery and taste applications. This type of innovation, which is also illustrated by the Symtrap process developed by Symrise, makes it possible to bring previously unseen ingredients into the creative palette of formulators and perfumers, with potential new sensory experiences and cosmetic advances for consumers."
IFF expands olfactory know-how with Science of Wellness programme,"This trend is nothing new, but it got well-established in 2020: scents, which are essential to the public, became a source of wellness and comfort. Like a return to the origins of perfume, in a way, says IFF, based on a survey of 10,000 consumers from 14 different countries. According to the perfume manufacturer, 87% of consumers want fragrances that offer emotional or physical benefits. This search is reflected on the global perfume, wellness, and beauty market. In 2018, according to the Global Wellness Institute, this market reached 4,500 billion dollars, a quarter of which was represented by personal care, beauty, and anti-ageing. A majority of the 10,000 people surveyed by IFF in 2021 said they were keen on aromatherapy, Ayurveda, and Chinese medicine. However, among this group, 67% would like their products to be developed using science. Consumers want wellness and energy on a daily basis thanks to perfumes, which are now viewed as able to create positive emotions. To meet these expectations, IFF asked their experts to set up the Science of Wellness programme. After forty years of research, this tool can now study “the brain activity related to smells and perfume,” explains Céline Manetta, PhD in Psychology and Senior Consumer Science Manager at IFF. Initially launched in the 1980s, this programme was used in the 1990s to study the links between smells, colours, and textures. Year after year, IFF completed it with new neurosciences knowledge and methods and the calculation power of Data Science. By combining Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence, and Statistics, Big Data helped significantly increase the number of combinations possible between ingredients to get high-performance synergies on brain perception. Billions of pieces of information were cross-referenced for perfumers to pick up what they need in this database when they receive a new brief, so they get the emotional benefit wanted. By combining science and creativity, the Science of Wellness programme offers “augmented perfumery for holistic wellness”, says Céline Manetta. For IFF’s brand customers, the programme provides more accuracy to awaken the emotions users want. Thanks to an in-house team of over 60 people including PhDs in Psychology, statisticians, researchers, and olfactory experts directly in contact with perfumers, this expert programme helps make progress in terms of formulation and olfactory know-how. It is based on a multifaceted approach structured around three dimensions – emotional, cognitive, and physical – to create perfumed products with beneficial virtues for consumers. As regards emotions, brands can target benefits in terms of happiness, relaxation, or seduction. The cognitive area covers full awareness, attention, self-esteem, and memory. Lastly, physical benefits can include sleep quality and skincare. The Science of Wellness programme offers new formulation possibilities to enhance the creative approach of perfumers. The latter can rely on data based on consumer studies and on the analysis of over 6,000 ingredients, accords, and perfumes. “This tool is highly inspiring creation-wise”, explains Juliette Karagueuzoglou, perfumer at IFF. “Since we work closely with this programme’s team, we can add the relevant ingredients to our formulas,” she adds. This AI system offers “new accords and makes it possible to discover new facets of raw materials”. IFF recently drew inspiration from this programme to convey the notion of youth, romanticism, and happiness required in the brief of Eternity Summer by Calvin Klein. The perfumers chose to work with Rose Essentielle LMR, which creates a sensation of happiness, and relaxing Sambac jasmine from India. This search for wellness and authenticity when buying a fragrance was already visible before the pandemic. This phenomenon obviously grew during this stressful period. (Temporarily?) giving up on seduction, perfumes are now related to the search for meaning. This issue being quite complex, AI efficiently feeds perfumers’ creative work and expertise."
"Circalys, a chrono-detox active ingredient inspired by Ayurveda","Modern lifestyles are always more intense and have a real impact on the appearance of the skin. “Disturbed circadian rhythm, our inside clock, affects most of biological processes, leading to a tired skin and a bad mood,” explains Greentech. To prevent these negative repercussions, Greentech has created Circalys, an active ingredient titrated in andrographolide, a molecule identified by the group’s scientists as able to counteract circadian disruption and revitalize skin. Inspired by Ayurveda, Circalys was developed from Green Chiretta (Andrographis paniculata), a major detoxifying plant in Ayurvedic traditional medicine. According to Greentech, Circalys helps modulate skin rhythms, by restoring a “young” invigorating clock gene expression profile in old/tired skin cells and by acting on circadian modulators related to key cellular pathways. “It extends cell longevity, reduces cell damages, promoting skin revitalization. Circalys also stimulates key signaling pathways connecting skin and brain, also influenced by circadian clock. It boosts oxytocin, endocannabinoid and endorphin signaling pathways to relax and protect skin from modern life impacts.” Greentech has tested the efficacy of the new ingredient on night/shift workers in a double-blind clinical study. According to the company, the use of Circalys during 28 days led to a significant reduction of visible signs of fatigue : eye bags, dark circles and under-eye wrinkles. Volunteers also found their skin more radiant, comfortable and rested. In addition, with the help of three “scientifically recognized” psychological tests, Greentech has also shown that the use of Circalys in a cosmetic formula also significantly modulated the impacts of fatigue on mood : boosted feeling of well-being, reduced perceived stress and negative affect («yoga-like» effect). The development of this new active is part of the psychobiological approach implemented by Greentech in connection with the growing expectations of consumers in terms of well-being. “An increasing number of scientific studies established a bidirectional link between skin/hair aspect or disorders and the psychological state of people. Skin and hair are the most noticeable parts of our body and thus important for self-image and mental health,” explains the French manufacturer of natural active ingredients. “Skin has revealed itself to be a complex organ involved in multiple neuro-immuno-endocrine functions, connecting skin and brain, and involved in many skin and hair functions.” Today, four Greentech active ingredients are based on this systemic approach, addressing different skin and hair issues, supported by articles published in international scientific journals: – Circalys, to counteract the impacts on skin and mood of fatigue and modern lifestyles;
– Hebelys, to address skin and emotional need of the silver generation woman with Positive Aging.
– Expozen, to sooth visible and perceived signs of skin sensitivity.
– Arcolys, to restore natural hair colour and boost self-esteem."
"Sustainable beauty: A tailor-made, plant-based approach for tomorrow’s cosmetics","The revolution of “Sustainable beauty” has become a thriving market and has been booming for the past few years. In 2019, it was estimated at $39 billion and could reach $48 billion by 2024, growing at a rate of 5.7%. [1] For final consumers, however, sustainability applied to the cosmetics sector is sometimes misunderstood. Therefore, it is necessary to define what sustainable beauty means and how key players in the industry are changing their approach. The need for a more sustainable approach shared by the whole cosmetics industry, comes with the necessity for more clarity, in order to give consumers a better understanding of what they will apply on their skin. “Consumers are looking to make more commitment to sustainability. What do they expect from us? To be more transparent, authentic, and responsible. As consumers also need to feel perfectly safe, they are looking for products with the right balance between nature and technology. This is our responsibility to meet the final consumers’ expectations for sustainable beauty and offer clean and safe ingredients while preserving our resources,” comments Ophélie Bourgon, Marketing Manager Europe and the Americas at Roquette Beauté. At Roquette, sustainable beauty is empowered by more than 85 years of recognized experience in health and nutrition, now applying its expertise to beauty through sustainable, innovative and high performance plant-based raw materials. For consumers, this statement is a guideline, communicating a desire to protect people’s skin, which represents a surface of 2 square meters per person, in the most natural way. In China, for example, 64% of females aged 18-49 perceive that naturally derived ingredients are more effective in maintaining skin health. [2] As a global leader in plant-based ingredients, Roquette is committed to provide traceability of raw materials to offer high quality solutions for consumers. For that purpose, Roquette has defined four sustainable development commitments: Innovating, Sourcing, Biorefining and Acting sustainably. The Innovating pillar aims to understand consumers’ needs and anticipate customers’ expectations. Thanks to a constant drive for innovation and a long-term vision, the group is committed to improving the well-being of millions of people all over the world while taking care of resources and territories. In continuity with this, Roquette has set commitments for a Biorefining pillar, which leads Roquette to improve its energy consumption, by investing in projects like geothermal power and biomass, to be able to offer more environmentally friendly ingredients. Since 2009, Roquette has been a member of the United Nations Global Compact, based on 10 principles about Human Rights, Labor, Environment and Anti-Corruption. This responsibility also applies to Roquette’s suppliers, who are asked to sign Roquette’s Code of Conduct for Suppliers. This is an approach defined by the Sourcing pillar, to build partnerships with plant breeders and farmers to select and use the most suitable agricultural resources. In line with its pledge to source sustainably, Roquette has joined the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) Platform that supports global and local responsible sourcing and good agricultural practices. Finally, bringing the best to Roquette’s consumers also means answering the needs of the company’s employees by protecting their social rights and reducing health and safety risks to a minimum, valuing diversity, inclusion and promoting the sharing of best practices in a multicultural network. These commitments, defined by the Acting pillar, are key for Roquette! As a responsible company towards its consumers and final customers, Roquette Beauté has set a series of engagements that place the quality and the performance of their multifunctional solutions for personal care as its highest priority. At Roquette Beauté, 90% of its ingredients are produced in France, with the remaining 10% produced in Europe and 100% are developed in respect of the ISO 16128 norm. Furthermore, its industrial sites are members of SEDEX (Supplier Ethical Data EXchange), an ethical data platform for exchange on responsible and sustainable business practices, based on regular on-site SMETA (Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit) audits. Every year, ECOVADIS evaluates and benchmarks the sustainability performance of Roquette, which is made available on their data exchange platform. Within a sector that is more than ever anticipating the demands of a continually more environmentally friendly industry, using raw materials such as corn, wheat, potatoes and peas coming exclusively from Europe and generating less than 0.5% of waste to produce innovative plant-based ingredients for cosmetics, is one of the best examples of sustainability for Roquette Beauté. Roquette Beauté is committed to its motto “Sustainable beauty is all about Skin Health and Nutrition” and being the best partner to people’s skin, health and nutrition."
Lubrizol unveils new formulation benefits for Kelco-Care Diutan Gum,"With a similar structure to xanthan gum, Kelco-Care diutan gum is a microbial polysaccharide produced by fermentation. Introduced to the market last year, the ingredient has thickening and suspending capabilities that can impart protection and repair benefits to hair fibres even at low use levels. According to LLS Beauty, these properties make the new ingredient ideally suitable for conditioners, treatments and hair colour where it can be used in a wide range of pH and temperatures. Thanks to its film forming capabilities “with excellent conditioning benefits”, Kelco-Care diutan gum also “give a nice, silky sensory experience to the hair with no drag or stickiness,” claims LLS Beauty. New tests allowed to uncover new benefits of Kelco-Care diutan gum for skin care, sun care and colour cosmetics formulations. According to LLS Beauty, the ingredient provides : – Immediate moisturizing effect that lasts all day long making it a truly multifunctional ingredient for skin care formulations;
– Excellent stability at high temperature, maintaining the viscosity of sunscreens during the summer season;
– Strong pigment suspension capabilities to meet the growing demand for natural-derived makeup. In addition, Kelco-Care diutan gum is easy to disperse and cold processable in formulations. It is also high efficiency due to high pseudoplasticity with greater low shear rate viscosity (and yield), adds LLS Beauty. “Our team of researchers and scientists continue to look for new ways to enhance our nature-based ingredients to meet sustainability goals and consumer expectations,” said Maxime Fougère, Global Marketing Manager, LLS Beauty. “We’re excited to have found new benefits for Kelco-Care diutan gum that meet these needs.”"
"Sophim: a virtuous, sustainable squalane derived from olive cultures","If squalene derived from shark liver has almost disappeared from cosmetic formulas, it remains a significant emollient in product compositions. Initially created to provide the industry with this basic ingredient, Sophim soon chose olive, a raw material native of the Mediterranean basin which offers a plant-derived squalene with specificities identical to that of animal origin. “We started in 1996, but the demand started regularly increasing only about ten years later. Olive squalene has really taken off since then,” says CEO Alexis Margnat. In 2005, the company made considerable investments to get the production capacities necessary to meet market needs. Later, in 2014, they purchased a plant in Almeria, Spain, to get closer to raw materials. “We work with waste from the olive oil industry. These by-products derived from olive oil refinement are fatty acids which contain 5% to 10% of squalene,” explains Alexis Margnat. The Spanish site collects the squalene retrieved from these by-products, and then sends it to France for it to be purified and transformed into squalane. The remainder is also transformed into biodiesel in Spain. “We valorize the whole raw material. The non-squalene fraction is transformed: 95% of our by-products are mainly valorized into biodiesel we sell to the oil industry. It is a real circular economy,” adds the CEO. Thanks to both a unique industrial capacity and full integration of the transformation process for a pure, plant-derived, Cosmos-approved ingredient, Sophim has become a major player on the cosmetics market, which is increasingly turned to naturalness. Today, the company boasts almost half the market shares of plant-derived squalane. “80% of our products are exported, while 20% are sold in France. Europe accounts for 40% of our sales – the rest goes to Asia, the area with the strongest growth for several years, in particular in Japan, China, and Korea,” says Alexis Margnat. Although it was affected by the slowdown due to the different lockdown periods in 2020, the company chose to continue to operate. And they were right to: they ended the year with a better turnover than in 2019 and achieved a 30% growth during the first quarter 2021. “We have observed a very strong recovery in France and on the European market,” says Alexis Margnat, who is considering diversifying activities in 2021 to adapt to new markets."
DNA & Cosmetics to promote the traceability of natural resources,"Initiated by DNA Gensee (a company specializing in the DNA analysis of plants, algae and beehive products), the DNA & Cosmetics consortium aims to provide models to the cosmetics and perfumery sector to ensure the safety of plant raw materials and allow for better control of natural resources, from the plant to the consumer. Using a scientific method based on DNA analysis, the members of the consortium [1] plan to build the first reliable database that will guarantee the botanical authenticity of the plant resources used in their products. The members of this consortium are eager to commit to more secure supplies and controlled exploitation of plant resources used to formulate cosmetic products. The main purpose is to be able, when purchasing natural raw materials, to ensure that brands and their suppliers source the right plant (belonging to the desired botanical family, genus and species). These issues are in line with the growing expectations of consumers in terms of safety, authenticity and transparency. They are also of major importance in connection with the application of the Nagoya protocol. The DNA analysis technology can identify plant species and even varieties with great reliability: this analysis allows us, for example, to distinguish the white lily (Lilium candidum) from the royal white lily (Lilium regale). As a matter of illustration, the consortium has undertaken a scientific work on lavender, an emblematic species in the cosmetics and perfume sectors. According to the consortium founders - both cosmetic groups and ingredient suppliers - this initiative enables companies to act concretely to accelerate the ecological and solidarity transition while contributing to the health of all by guaranteeing the absence of fraud in raw materials."
"“The clean perfumery trend is a growth driver”, Frédéric Braud, Sozio","Premium Beauty News - Sozio has made many announcements since the beginning of the year. Frédéric Braud - Our recent purchases are perfectly in line with our growth strategy, both in terms of geography and market segments. The fact that we purchased Alpine Aromatics in 2011, and then Elias Fragrance in 2015 helped us settle in the USA. In France, after purchasing Sentaromatique in 2012, we were able to really establish ourselves in Grasse and better adapt to the craze for natural and organic perfumes. Also, we purchased two other companies based in Grasse, APF Arômes et Parfums in 2013, and then Fragworld in 2016, which contributed to our growth in Fine Fragrances and strengthened our presence in Asia and the Middle East, where these companies were very well-established. Likewise, we purchased Phoenix Fragrances Ltd. last March, so we now boast a solid base and a production centre in the UK, a very specific perfume market. The company achieves 85% of its turnover on the British market, on the cosmetics and home care segments, where we are very present. Besides, 40% of their perfumes are natural. There is a real strategic complementarity and multiple synergies. As for Scentessence, a Brittany-based company specialized in natural perfumes for detergents in France, this purchase further strengthened our presence on these markets. Premium Beauty News - Botanicals by Sozio helped you diversify your ingredient offering, did it not? Frédéric Braud - We launched this division both as part of our strategy to diversify our product offering and because we wanted to meet new market trends. Over the past 15 years, at least, we have significantly strengthened our presence on the natural perfume segment. Today, natural products account for 30% of our sales in France. We were gradually led to source raw materials with much rigour in terms of traceability and ethics. Our customers benefit from this know-how. Many of our customers used to purchase raw materials from traders with few guarantees as regards sourcing. With Botanicals by Sozio, they take advantage of our own supplier chains and, consequently, of both our fair farmer compensation policy and all the traceability guarantees we implemented. Today, all this is essential, given the strong transparency and ethics expectations. Premium Beauty News - Is that also a way to revive your history? Frédéric Braud - Sozio is a centuries-old company founded in 1758 in Grasse. It was a pioneer in French perfumery, so our launching the Botanicals by Sozio division is also a return to our origins: perfume essences and absolutes. But our history is also that of a company with a family spirit and a long-term perspective. We are craftsmen specialized in perfumes. Our customers get the tailor-made approach and flexibility medium-sized companies can offer. Premium Beauty News - You are doing pretty well after a tough year 2020, are you not? Frédéric Braud - Indeed, we have not really suffered from the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, our turnover rose by 9%, and we increased our sales by 23% in the first quarter 2021, on a like-for-like basis. Our subsidiary in the USA is doing very well. It is very well-established on markets that remained drivers despite the pandemic (industrial detergents and home fragrances). Also, we have achieved significant growths in Asia for several months. Of course, recovery remains fragile in Europe, but we have received many projects for launches scheduled next September and October, so we are optimistic for the second part of the year. The situation is trickier in the Middle East, but it remains a key region for the global perfume market. We will have a stand at BeautyWorld Middle East, next October in Dubai, and at in-Cosmetics Global in Barcelona. We achieved a 50-million-euro turnover in 2020, and with our various purchases, our sales should reach 62 to 65 million euros in 2021. We make 40% of our turnover in the Europe-Middle-East-Africa region, 40% in the Americas, and 20% in Asia. Premium Beauty News - How do you think the market will evolve? Frédéric Braud - Natural perfumes are a growth driver: there is a real craze for these products. Plus, perfumers’ palettes were considerably broadened, thanks to natural isolates, which provided alternatives to essential oils. However, naturalness is far from being the only market challenge. Clean Beauty and Clean Perfumery are two other major trends that drive the market growth. Our strategy consists in being as close as possible to these new expectations. Last year, we created our own clean fragrance label based on strict specifications: we removed all molecules suspected of being harmful for human health and the environment. These perfumes are intended for detergents, personal care and cosmetics. They are not 100% natural perfumes: they do contain synthetic materials, but these were chosen because they do not have a negative impact. For our clean range and natural perfumes, we chose a comprehensive transparency policy: we shared all our formulas with our customers, without mentioning the doses, in order to meet brands’ complex requirements… The demand for transparency cannot but be taken into account, although perfumes cannot be patented – which explains why manufacturing secrets need to be preserved. Last April, we launched a new tool to calculate the biodegradability of perfumes. Based on the profile of raw materials, we can now calculate a score for each perfume. We have already used this tool within the company to create biodegradable perfumes, and we are now making it available to our customers. Again, to meet this demand, we are going to broaden our Botanicals by Sozio offering and strengthen our supply chain controls with specific contracts with farmers and purchases, or by creating local distillation units, in particular in Indonesia and Madagascar. In addition, we will develop an increasing number of raw materials derived from natural isolates by fermenting or fragmenting essential oils. We are also working on specific innovations: highly-perfumed gels (for air fresheners or wax melters…), a COSMOS-certified natural micro-encapsulation for cosmetics… All this should help us attract new customers!"
"""We want to become a leader in Brazil"", Damien Lamquet, Greentech Brasil","The factory which has just been completed in Diadema, south of the urban area of São Paulo, marks a new start for Greentech Brasil, even though the French manufacturer of plant active ingredients has been based in the country since 2015. “The initial idea was to explore the Brazilian market and distribute made in France ingredients, but the idea has evolved in the direction of local production,” explains Damien Lamquet, director of Greentech in Brazil. The project accelerated when Greentech acquired Mapric, a Brazilian supplier of ingredients for the cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and nutraceutical industries, in November 2016. “Mapric was a distributor, and Greentech a manufacturer that had yet to make a name for itself in the Brazilian market. With this purchase, we have gained in capillarity”, notes  the director. ""The time had come for Mapric to finally become Greentech Brasil"", adds Damien Lamquet. With 3,500 m2, of which 600 m2 are fully dedicated to manufacturing, the new plant can produce up to 10 tonnes of active ingredients per day - for comparison, the French plant currently produces up to 12 tonnes per day. Greentech also increased the site’s storage and fractionation capacities, which previously occupied a 700 m2 hangar south of São Paulo. Although the factory is already in operation, an official inauguration ceremony is planned for the beginning of the second half of the year, or when it is possible to bring part of the French team to Brazil. Designed to better respond to local demands and strengthen customer service, the Brazilian factory will also enable Greentech to develop new markets. ""The plant has the potential to become our production centre in Latin America, a market still underserved by the company,"" says Damien Lamquet. Currently, Greentech is present on the continent through distributors. “We want to set up a team to address the demand in Latin America, with a special focus on Peru, Colombia, Chile and Argentina,” he adds. Greentech Brasil also intends to invest in scientific research and expand its knowledge of the Brazilian biodiversity. “Brazil is a country with an extremely rich diversity and we still know little about it. Everyone is looking at the Amazon, but we want to investigate other biomes. In Cerrado, for example, we have already developed a sustainable and traceable supply chain,” says Damien Lamquet. Greentech has invested EUR 1 million to open their new factory. Despite a difficult economic context in Brazil, aggravated by the Covid-19 epidemic, the director of the Brazilian branch says potential return on this investment has been calculated on five to ten years. “Brazil is a country where one’s invests for the long term,” he emphasizes. Damien Lamquet is confident in Greentech’s growth potential in Brazil. “We want to be number one in botanical technology in Brazil and we are in line with the country’s bio-economy development plans. Any kind of investment is stressful, but I used to say that even with the pandemic and despite the pandemic, the time has come for Greentech Brasil.” Along with the inauguration of the factory, Greentech Brasil also launches a new active ingredient: Hidraskin Coco, a 100% green ingredient made from coconut water, vegetable glycerin and propandiol, designed to reduce skin dryness and its effects. Damien Lamquet also reveals that two ingredients from Greentech’s portfolio will be produced in Brazil later this year: Dandrilys, an anti-dandruff ingredient, and Aquasilolis, for soaps, shampoos and micellar waters."
Symrise: Three new creations very close to hemp’s smell,"As hemp (Cannabis Sativa) satisfies both wellness and naturalness criteria, it has become a flagship cosmetic plant and is now added to an increasing number of consumer goods. A study conducted by Symrise in the USA reveals that for 70% of respondents, beyond its medical and recreational properties, hemp is viewed as a natural, modern (37%) plant with health benefits (38%) and a holistic dimension (30%). “Today, hemp has a much more positive connotation. Its smell, which was still taboo a few years ago, is now much more acceptable. When a consumer chooses a product based on hemp, the olfactory experience is inherent to the concept,” explains Fabien Calvet, Sustainability Ambassador and Global Haircare, Skincare & Deodorant Category Leader at Symrise. The study conducted by Symrise showed that for 77% of respondents, it would be definitely acceptable to put forward a cosmetic product with the smell of cannabis. This smell should actually be viewed as natural, which highlights its herbaceous, aromatic, and medicinal qualities, and as being very close to marijuana’s smell. To meet this olfactory expectation, Symrise chose to use the capacities of the Vitessence technology. In practice, the idea is to capture the natural smell of a plant or a flower and reproduce it faithfully with a cocktail of molecules composed by the perfumer. “We use it to recreate natural smells which are hard to obtain with other transformative processes, but also for flowers which cannot be extracted, like lily of the valley, or which can be, but in too small quantities. It is really an authentic reproduction of the smell as it is in nature,” explains Fabien Calvet. The plant or flower is tightly isolated and unveils its volatile notes for half an hour, so they can be captured on a material. This capture is then analyzed by the laboratory to detect the concentration of all molecules. That is when the perfumer reproduces the natural smell with the palette of ingredients at hand. “Sometimes, the molecules we find are not available in the perfumer’s palette, or they are banned. But the Art of the perfumer consists in finding equivalents,” adds Fabien Calvet. Whether they are derived from fruit, vegetables, or rare plants, Symrise’s Vitessences help combine synthetic and natural materials, but also - thanks to a cost per kilogramme often lower than the absolute or essential oil - solve countless economic equations. Symrise eventually recreated a synthetic essence close to the dry plant with a green, balsamic, earthy, herbaceous, and woody olfactory profile. This hemp Vitessence contains neither tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) nor cannabidiol (CBD). And as “most customers who buy products based on hemp want natural products,” Symrise developed a 100% natural version [1] and a Cosmos-Natural-certified one. Created by Symrise’s Master Perfumer Dirk Braun, these three hemp Vitessences suit various categories and can be combined with other notes. They can be added to face care, body care, or hair care formulas, but also home products and Fine Fragrances."
"Seppic launches Lumipod, a natural active ingredient for tan boosting","For a nice glow without sun exposure, Wesource, Seppic’s brand for cosmetic active ingredients, has developed Lumipod, a melanin activator from natural origin. This new tan booster stimulates melanin synthesis and its transfer from melanocytes to keratinocytes, without UV. Lumipod is an esterified Aminovector. It is a defined molecule, 100% from natural origin, Cosmos approved, with stable and reproducible composition and strong performance. In vivo tests have shown that Lumipod at 1% provides a better efficacy than acetyl tyrosine (market reference), with significantly visible results from 4 days (6% of tanning variation measured by ITA - Individual Typology Angle - on volunteers) and long-lasting effect (15% of variation maintained 15 days after the last product application). “This new active ingredient is a nice example of innovation that illustrates Seppic expertise and ability to answer consumers’ need for naturality and efficacy. Seppic teams design, develop and create ingredients with the highest respect for people and the environment, advancing the science of ingredients for all,” said Anne-Sophie Dutailly, Wesource marketing product manager."
Givaudan Active Beauty bets on A.I. and epigenetics for skin radiance,"Created from Haberlea rhodopensis also known as the resurrection plant, Chronoglow is a natural skin care active ingredient designed to reverse the effects of ageing and improve skin radiance. ""Haberlea rhodopensis is an ice-age plant that has survived extreme climate conditions thanks to its unique epigenetic mechanisms of cellular survival. We are now able to mimic and reproduce what the plant does in its own cells in the skin. Chronoglow is therefore a 100% natural & sustainable powerful botanical ingredient, with exclusive benefits of well-ageing and radiance,"" said Mathias Fleury, Category Manager Active Beauty at Givaudan. According to Givaudan, Chronoglow rejuvenates the skin at different cellular levels, from epigenetics to proteins expression, and protects skin cells from senescence and oxidation, therefore reversing skin ageing to take back youth, but also enhancing skin firmness and radiance. To better represent the clinical results and demonstrate the visual benefits of their new active ingredient, the company’s researchers have used Artificial Intelligence and were able to represent the how it impacted the “three dimensions of glow” (i.e. elasticity, luminosity and radiance) on the face: – Elasticity. After two weeks of use, Chronoglow improved skin elasticity by up to 8.9% (more than three times better than the placebo). This positive impact on the skin elasticity is increasing during the whole duration of the clinical test, with an increase up to 15.3% after two months.
– Luminosity. After four weeks of use, this factor improved by up to 3.8% and up to 6.4% after two months (almost two times better than the placebo).
– Radiance. After two weeks of use, radiance was improved by up to 6.1% (more than four times better than the placebo) and up to 12.5% after two months. According to Givaudan, skin ageing is a major priority for consumers, who are looking for a smooth bright skin. According to the company, 80% of consumers globally said they would be upset to look older than their actual age [1]. “A radiant complexion is associated with living a healthy and balanced lifestyle. This is why the consumers’ desire to reveal the natural luminosity and maintain the firmness of their skin by using sustainable and botanical solutions is important,” explains Givaudan Active Beauty in a statement. To inspire beauty brands, Givaudan’s formulation experts have used Chronoglow to create a glowing veil with skin regeneration benefits. Dubbed Eau de Radiance, the skin care liquid needs to be applied on the skin. According to the company, a few drops will help “rejuvenate and illuminate” skin tone. “Also powered by Ocâline XP and Sophogreen plus, Eau de Radiance will soothe the skin, and offer a second skin protection thanks to Sens’Hyal powder,” added Givaudan."
Clariant launches new natural active ingredient to take on senescence,"Celyscence, Clariant Active Ingredients and Biospectrum research’s latest active ingredient, has been designed to prevent the decline in skin function and promote healthy aging skin. The extract draws on the therapeutic properties of milk thistle (Silybum marianum), using the flowers to achieve particularly wide activity in targeting and counteracting cellular senescence, a major contributor to the skin aging process. “Senescent fibroblasts can trigger an unhealthy state of the skin at any age,” explains Clariant. Indeed, chronological aging is associated with the accumulation of senescent fibroblasts and is exacerbated by the impact of regular exterior stressors like pollution and UV light. These fibroblasts alter and generate damage more quickly than their healthy counterparts. They are highly resistant to apoptosis (cell death), they impair biological regenerative and repair functions, and even secrete molecules that damage surrounding cells. This undermines the ability to maintain a healthy skin structure, causing a long list of age-related disorders, including dull, dehydrated skin, and loss of skin firmness from decreased collagen production. “Delaying the formation of senescent cells is key to maintaining healthy skin,” says Alexandre Lapeyre, Global Head of Marketing and Business Development, Clariant Active Ingredients. According to Clariant, Celyscence is proven in vitro to demonstrate a unique combination of senolytic and senomorphic effects: pushing senescent cells to apoptosis (senolytic effect) to maximize their elimination and prevent them from irreversibly inducing damage; and alleviating their side effects (senomorphic effect) by downregulating their secretion of molecules that cause additional harm. Further experimental evaluations also show the ability of Celyscence to even reprogram senescent cells and reverse their loss of functionality. For example, contributing to the return of a healthy metabolism by restoring functions like collagen production. “Celyscence reinstates the crucial ability of dermal fibroblasts to produce collagen, which shows its ability to reprogram senescent cells. This ultimately ensures aged tissue repair and remodeling efficacy,” says the manufacturer of cosmetic active ingredients. In addition, the potential of Celyscence has been assessed under real-life conditions. In-vivo testing focused on the lower face, throat and décolleté area, one of the less explored areas for skin care and generally the most neglected by consumers, to determine its suitability for mature skin care, healthy aging products and neck firming creams. A volunteer group of 30 women aged between 50 and 60, all presenting visible wrinkles on the neck and the décolleté, were enrolled. For 56 days, one half of the panel applied a product containing 3% Celyscence on the throat and chest, and the other half a placebo product. Clinical measurements were done after 14, 28 and 56 days. Twice daily for 14 days, all participants also applied either a cream containing 3% Celyscence or a placebo cream on one half of the face to enable specific and quick face observation. The evaluation took place in fall. According to Clariant, the ability of Celyscence to successfully hydrate skin, increase brightness and radiance, re-firm the chest and neck, address issues with sagging skin and redefine features, was confirmed. Celyscence is shown to support healthy skin by hydrating it. The skin hydration level on the décolleté, particularly susceptible to seasonal stresses, increased by 8.6% after 14 days and by 14% after 56 days of using Celyscence. In the placebo group, the skin hydration decreased by 12.6%, as was to be expected during fall season. After only 14 days, Celyscence significantly increased chest brightness, producing a more luminous and even appearance. The effect was even more marked after 28 days and 56 days, where the chest looks more radiant. There was a rapid decrease of melanin content on facial skin, decreasing by more than 5% after only 14 days. As a result, the face has a brighter and more luminous complexion. In a self-evaluation after 28 days and 56 days, 81% of volunteers thought their skin looked healthy. Volunteers agreed that Celyscence cream made the skin on their chest firmer and brighter. A visual evaluation showed that the throat is visibly firmer and the facial contours are remodeled. “Novel active ingredient Celyscence has strong capabilities to target and selectively clear out senescent cells, to successfully mitigate the impacts of senescence and repair damaged cells,” concludes Alexandre Lapeyre."
BASF taps into the emotional skincare trend with an algal extract,"BASF’s new skin care ingredient is based on sacran, a natural giant molecular polysaccharide extracted from Aphanothece sacrum, an algae living in clear spring waters in Japan. Sacran has long been known for its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. In order to take advantage of these exceptional properties and harness its potential, sacran has been integrated into a MicroPatch, consisting of the natural bio-polysaccharides pullulan, alginate, and hyaluronic acid, to form Sacred Patch. According to BASF, the new ingredient works in three ways: it offers an instantly perceptible uplift in mood once applied to the skin, helps to soothe sensitive skin, and provides strong moisturization properties. According to ISO 16128, Sacred Patch is 99.2% of natural origin. BASF scientists have discovered that the polysaccharide helps to stimulate the release of oxytocin, a neuropeptide and wellness mediator. The new active ingredient has been shown ex vivo to help stimulate the release of oxytocin in human skin explants by as much as 40%. Comprehensive in vivo testing confirmed that the molecular patch had a positive emotional effect immediately after application: 93% of the volunteers associated the use of Sacred Patch with tenderness, 90% with joy and happiness, and 61% with desire. One of the causes of skin sensitivity is an overreaction to external stimuli such as irritants or microorganisms. It can be exacerbated if unwanted invaders manage to penetrate the skin. Once inside, the irritants cause the epidermal cells to produce inflammatory messengers such as interleukin IL-8. In an in vitro test conducted on human keratinocytes infected by Staphylococcus aureus, Sacred Patch was shown to help significantly reduce inflammation by 93% compared to an untreated control. The active thus demonstrably helps to comfort irritated skin. Disruptions within the skin barrier can lead to dehydration, contributing to a variety of unwanted skin conditions including discomfort, fine lines and wrinkles, and dull, flaky skin. To fight this phenomenon, BASF’s MicroPatch product forms a protective, comforting mesh on the surface of sensitive skin to prevent water evaporation. Furthermore, thanks to Sacran water-attracting properties, Sacred Patch helps to increase the skin’s natural water retention capacity, keeping it hydrated. Tested ex vivo on human skin biopsies, Sacred Patch has been proven to offer immediate moisturization of the upper layers of the epidermis, lasting until at least 6 hours after application. Clinical tests confirmed this result: study participants rated the moisturizing and soothing effect of an emulsion containing Sacred Patch at 2% with a score of at least four out of five after eight hours and 14 days of application. The patch technology is a result of BASF’s dual expertise in natural macromolecules and the controlled release of active ingredients. It forms the basis for a range of products in the company’s active ingredients portfolio, including PatcH2O that offers immediate and long-lasting hydration for skin scalp, MicroPatch Caffeine that helps to improve cellulite and decrease dark circles under the eyes, and the moisturizing MicroPatch Serine. BASF plans to further expand its product range based on the MicroPatch technology in the future."
Gattefossé launches EleVastin to fight gravity-induced skin sagging,"Over time, gravity relentlessly takes its toll on the skin, with sagging skin being one of the most common manifestations of ageing. However, according to Gattefossé, gravity’s side effects on the skin might be prevented. The Lyon-headquartered company has designed EleVastin [1], a targeted solution to fight gravity-induced skin sagging. According to Gattefossé, the new ingredient boosts key proteins involved in the synthesis and maintenance of functional elastic fibers: elastin, fibrillin-1 and fibulin-5. It also protects elastic fibers against their degradation by elastases. “Through this mechanism of action, it ensures an increase of the density of elastic fibers coupled with an augmented skin elasticity. These last outcomes have been obtained using an advanced spheroid model developed in our cell culture laboratory,” explains the company in a statement. The efficacy of EleVastin has been assessed ex-vivo using a model of 3D dermal microtissue free from any exogenous matrix developed in partnership with BioMeca. The ingredient was also tested in vivo at a concentration of 1% only, on 37 volunteers using a novel and original method specifically developed in-house. According to Gattefossé, it proved its capacity to reduce drooping of the lower face. “Skin elasticity is significantly improved versus placebo. Facial contours are better defined, and deep vertical wrinkles are significantly reduced.” “The clear reproducibility of the results obtained with EleVastin on different types of skin models is a true assurance of the ingredient’s efficacy,"" explains Laurie Canel, Product Marketing Leader - Personal Care Actives. The ingredient is extracted from the leafy stems of the Murraya koenigii tree, which are manually harvested from fertilizer-free plots in the preserved environment of La Reunion island. The plant has been used for hundreds of years in ayurvedic medicine and in cuisine. A rich pool of synergistic phytomolecules is obtained using an innovative blend of solvents from plant origin and gentle extraction process. This results in a 100% natural origin content according to the norm ISO 16128 and a COSMOS approved ingredient. “The phytochemical content of Murraya koenigii is both very rich and well described, which has made it possible to adopt a methodical research strategy for plant extraction. By adjusting the polarity of the solvents, we have been able to target more specifically certain molecular families such as flavonoids, phenolic acids or alkaloids. In parallel, in our laboratories, and also in partnership with experts in proteomics and biomechanics, we have developed innovative in vitro evaluation models. They enabled us to achieve a very comprehensive demonstration of the biological efficacy,” says Boris Vogelgesang, R&D Director Cosmetic Actives."
Lubrizol launches new nature-derived rheology modifier for hair care,"Kelco-Care diutan gum is a naturally derived and readily biodegradable rheology modifier with thickening and suspending capabilities that can impart protection and repair benefits to hair fibers even at low use levels and boosted with added salt.

Givaudan Active Beauty upcycles wild bilberries to help repair the skin,"Traditionally used by the food industry for their juice and sugar, bilberries are also an amazing source of anthocyanidins extracted from the pulp and fruit skin for the supplement and pharma industries. “Furthermore, the tiny seeds of the berries contain up to 20% of linoleic acid (omega-6) and α-linolenic acid (omega-3) in an optimal ratio; these compounds being both known for their capabilities to improve hydration and skin barrier functionality,” explains Givaudan Active Beauty in a statement. Building on the growing interest of consumers for waste reduction and local supply chains, the supplier of cosmetic actives has produced this new ingredient through an upcycled process. Once the fruits have been squeezed the extract the juice, the seeds are separated from the pulp. Then, the active ingredient is crafted by a supercritical CO2 extraction procedure. According to Givaudan Active Beauty, as waste reduction is a new sustainable standard today, cosmetic products containing recycled or upcycled ingredients are appealing to 69% of consumers, mostly in Brazil (80%) and China (74%) [1]. “Consumers are ready to go forward, pushing upcycling beauty products as a top trend for the years to come, without compromising the main needs of their skin protection,” said the company. The efficacy of Omegablue has been shown in surfactant-induced depletion during clinical tests. According to Givaudan Active Beauty, the treated area has completely restored the skin barrier function after three days from the damage. Omegablue is also significantly performant on chronic inflammation challenged skin (psoriasis) as it significantly decreases erythema severity, down to 27%, and scales formation by 28% in four weeks. Even better results are shown on eczema challenged skin condition as erythema severity decreased by 37.5% and itch rating by 42.8%. Additionally, the PASI (Psoriasis Area Severity Score) and EASI (Eczema Area Severity Score) are markedly ameliorated by 27% and 35% respectively. “Omegablue was developed as a topical soothing agent for sensitive and damaged skin. It effectively calms skin discomfort in a transient or curative way and contains sebum-like essential fatty acids forming a protective barrier from external agents,” highlighted Giada Maramaldi, Personal Care Category Manager at Givaudan Active Beauty. To illustrate the potential of Omegablue in skin and body care applications, Givaudan Active Beauty has formulated a shower oil dubbed S.O. Smooth, with a light and silk texture. Enriched with chia oil, a natural ingredient that gently nourishes the skin, the product “restores and maintains the skin barrier to bring the skin back to its comfort zone.” Omegablue is part of the Givaudan Active Beauty’s upcycling collection launched in October 2020.

Furthermore, according to Seppic, Adipoless Eco maintains the silhouette and prevents the formation of new fat by regulating angiogenesis. Wesource has thus found in organic quinoa a double efficiency ally for the contour of the silhouette and the eyes."
Ashland launches new nature-derived styling polymer based on cassia seeds,"As consumers continue to demand natural ingredients in their beauty products, hair styling formulators seek ingredients derived from nature that could help them to address this trend. In styling, natural solutions can be challenging as they often do not provide the performance of their synthetic counterparts. To solve the equation, Ashland has bet on cassia seeds that are grown wild and naturally harvested in India. This natural material has been used in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine for over four thousand years. “Styleze CSP polymer addresses the need for naturally-positioned styling formulas where initial stiffness, strong hold and humidity resistance are desired,” said Denise Costrini, global marketing manager at Ashland. “It provides more stiffness and hold than traditional synthetic products such as PVP, while offering that all-important nature derived claim that consumers are seeking without the residue that other natural styling polymers can leave on the hair. Stylezse CSP has 69% natural origin content (according to ISO 16128) and delivers 24-hour humidity resistance that outperforms PVP.” According to Ashland, Styleze CSP delivers clear in-hand gels that are easy to remove from the hair. The versatility of Styleze CSP polymer enables its use in a variety of hair styling products, from styling gels and creams to waxes, mousses and serums.

Fragrances: Mane reinvents enfleurage to reveal new facets of floral essences,"Dubbed E-Pure Jungle Essence, Mane’s new range of floral extracts is obtained from a new and greener extraction method of fresh flowers. Dedicated to flowers that are too delicate to be transported, or to preserve all their facets during traditional treatments, the new technique is based on the principle of maceration in a fatty substance specific to the old enfleurage method, which has fallen into disuse due to its cost and low yields. To create the E-Pure Jungle Essence, the Mane teams let fresh flowers infuse in a neutral vegetable oil until saturation. Then, the olfactory components of the E-Oil thus obtained are extracted by supercritical fluid to obtain an essence offering “a perfect balance between top and heart notes”. This reinvented enfleurage only requires simple and relatively light equipment, easy to use next to the flower fields, for optimal freshness. The “enfleurage” step is performed with simple and light equipment using only natural vegetable oil a natural solvent to extract the aromatic molecules. This maceration process has a low energy consumption. The supercritical fluid extraction step that follows uses CO2, which collected from the outside air and returned to its gas form at the end of the process. The E-Pure Jungle Essence range obtained from this process are natural aromatic extracts, as defined by the ISO 9235 standard. Furthermore, they can be used in formulations with the organic COSMOS label, which is not the case for absolutes extracted with the use of petrochemical solvents, therefore opening up new creative perspectives for organic perfumes. “E-Pure Jungle Essence extracts highlight new floral facets, revealing unique olfactive opportunities. This environmentally friendly technique honours Nature’s beauty and refinement,” says Mane in a statement. According to Mane, E-Pure Jungle Essence extracts exhibit an extraordinary olfactive rendering. They unveil a flower’s natural and original note without the typical green and fatty undertones that are usually captured when using petrochemical solvents. Extracted at low temperature, the most delicate facets are preserved. E-Pure Jungle Essence extracts thus contain the most volatile molecules that reveal the flower’s freshness and the emotion it conveys. The debut E-Pure Jungle Essence range features three floral extracts: Red Champaca, Jasmine Grandiflorum and Jasmin Sambac. The Red Champaca E-Pure Jungle Essence offers an orange blossom scent, honeyed and indolent with a jasmine facet. It has a transparent, light yellow colour, a notable cosmetic advantage compared to the vivid blood red colour of the Red Champaca absolute, which is therefore difficult to integrate into a formula. The Jasmine Grandiflorum E-Pure Jungle Essence offers a very present indolent facet, but unlike an absolute, has less animality. The Sambac E-Pure Jasmine Jungle Essence makes us rediscover the flower in its natural state: it is much more jasmine, more orange blossom and, once again, much less animal than the absolute. According to Mane, this Sambac is airy, less indolent, less pharmaceutical, it brings an almost virginal femininity, a less heady seduction. ""Of course, the E-Pure Jungle Essence extracts are green ingredients, obtained without petrochemical solvents, at a very low environmental cost, but they are also extremely close to the flower’s natural scent. Compared to absolutes, their notes are less fatty, less vegetal, the quality of the extracts is exceptional, it is the flower exactly as we know it in nature"", comments Serge Majoullier, senior perfumer at Mane, who closely participated in the development of the new process."
Berkem expands its range of floral waters,"The plant extraction [1] subsidiary of the Berkem Group aims to address the growing demand for natural ingredients and botanical extracts in the cosmetics industry. “As part of what some see as a valuable marketing approach, more and more professionals in the cosmetic industry are introducing floral water into the composition of their products, sometimes even replacing pure water with floral water,” explains Berken SAS in a statement. Used for their fragrant properties and active ingredients, floral waters (also called herbal distillates or hydrolates) are recognised for their purifying, anti-inflammatory, regenerative, antiseptic, antioxidant and sebum control virtues. Extracted by distillation and comprising aromatic molecules, they constitute real “active waters” for formulas. Berkem SAS therefore added four new products to its floral water line: bamboo, peppermint, linden and everlast flower. They add up to the other floral waters already marketed by the company: Damask rose, orange blossom, cornflower, witch hazel, jasmine, lavender, grapefruit, grape, green tea, lemon balm, lemon and roman chamomile. The range is now composed of 16 floral waters. “Plants, exotic or traditional, have been carefully selected for their properties and their ancient uses, and bring essential natural benefits for face, body and hair care. The extraction processes developed limit their impact on the environment and preserve the integrity of the active molecules naturally found in plants,” highlights Jean-Louis Peron, General Director of the Plant Extraction division at Berkem SAS. In activity since 1964 in Gardonne, in the Southwest of France, with 55 employees, it increases its floral water production every year for its customers in France and abroad (Canada, China, United States, Korea and other countries). In 2020, Berkem teams produced 100 tons of floral waters."

"With MoodScentz, Givaudan carries on exploring positive emotions","In the wake of the launch of VivaScentz this summer, Givaudan continues their exploration of the links between perfumes and emotions with the launch of MoodScentz, a fragrance technologies platform intended to guide the group’s perfumers and creative teams in crafting mood enhancing fragrances. MoodScentz was launched with the aim to explore the potential of fragrances in increasing emotional wellbeing. Since then, it has significantly evolved under Givaudan’s Scentz platform as the latest neuroscience techniques allowed the company to better understand the underlying mechanisms that take place in the human brain in the presence of odours. Thus, going beyond the basic aromatherapy approach, it has been possible to develop fragrance design guidelines to create perfumes with scientifically proven mood enhancing benefits. Mixing blend psychological and neuroscientific measurement techniques with perfumery expertise, the MoodScentz patented technologies form a set of fragrance creation guidelines focusing on three mood effects: “Relaxing” (bringing peace of mind and serenity), “Invigorating” (making consumers feel uplifted and energised), and “Happy” (making consumers feel positive and delighted). While several studies have highlighted the role of scents in many emotions, the development of neurosciences and of new analytical methods now allow to scientifically demonstrate the emotional effects of specific scents. For instance, Givaudan scientists have been able to translate the connection between scents and sentiments thanks to the use of the art multi-dimensional statistical techniques. “To further measure the consumers’ response to different fragrances, our researchers have developed and used Mood Portraits to uncover deeper links between fragrance and emotion through images. This innovative technique involves asking volunteers to select the visuals that represent emotions evoked by a fragrance, avoiding the use of words - eliciting a more spontaneous and discriminatory response,” details Givaudan in a statement. While the threefold health, economic and ecological crisis that we are experiencing is more conducive to anxiety than to the feeling often associated with happiness, the demand for more well-being is skyrocketing and fragrance and beauty manufacturers are trying, in their own way, to provide news answers."
A rich bio-based oil sourced form chestnut tree sap for hair and scalp care,"AlgaPūr High Stability High Oleic (HSHO) algae oil [1] is a bio-based oil derived from a microalgae sourced from the sap of chestnut trees in Germany, and developed by Dutch-based food and biochemicals company Corbion. “For centuries people have used oils to care for their hair because of their conditioning and nourishing properties. AlgaPūr HSHO algae oil is the newest evolution in that tradition: It is a natural ingredient produced through fermentation, is readily biodegradable, and has a low environmental footprint in the water, carbon, and land use,” explains Lubrizol Life Science - Beauty (LLS Beauty), which is launching the substance in the beauty and personal care markets, as part of their global collaboration agreement with Corbion. During the fermentation process, the algae sourced from the chesnut trees efficiently convert simple sugars into triglyceride oils. This manufacturing process takes place in a controlled bio-reactor, far from fragile ecosystems, while ensuring rapid scalability and reproducibility. As a result, this natural ingredient (according to ISO 16128) has a minimal environmental impact. It is also free from palm-oil, petrochemicals and animal byproducts. According to LLS Beauty, AlgaPūr HSHO algae oil contains over 90% of beneficial Omega-9 Oleic Acid in a highly stable, liquid-based formula that protects the hair fiber from breakage, repairs split ends, provides shine, controls frizz, improves manageability and conditions. Tests on multiple types of hair showed, among other things, that hair breakage was 83% less likely to occur in hair treated with AlgaPūr HSHO algae oil than with untreated hair. It also repaired split ends 10% better than argan oil. AlgaPūr HSHO algae oil also demonstrated several benefits for the scalp, including an anti-aging and moisturizing effects, and the ability to repair photodamage. In vitro tests have shown an increase in type 1 collagen and elastin synthesis, and a decrease in signs of UV-induced cell damage. In vivo tests have demonstrated its immediate and long-lasting benefits on moisturization and improved skin barrier function. According to LLS Beauty, AlgaPūr HSHO algae oil is ideal for the formulation of a wide variety of hair and scalp products, including shampoos, conditioners, treatments, or styling products. “Throughout history, women have relied upon oils to protect and beautify their hair and scalps. AlgaPūr HSHO algae oil takes that beauty practice to the next level in delivering healthy hair fiber and scalp,” explains Juliana Mancini, Global Hair Care Marketing Manager, LLS Beauty."
Givaudan: A marine ingredient to correct dark spots on all skin complexions,"Created from Himanthalia elongata, a brown macro-alga sourced in Brittany, France, B-Lightyl addresses hyperpigmentation disorders in a preventive and curative way. The extract re-establishes the communication between fibroblasts and melanocytes, thereby reverting pigmentation disorders. According to Givaudan Active Beauty this natural ingredient is “the first gentle and powerful universal dark spot eraser crafted by Marine Biotechnology.” “On a daily basis, environmental stress such as UV exposure and pollution as well as chronological ageing generate a loss of control in the pigmentation process, which ends up in the appearance of brown and dark spots on the surface of the skin,” explains Givaudan Active Beauty. Hyperpigmentation, dark spots and brownish marks are therefore commonly found on sun-exposed areas of the body, face, hands and chest. As they are considering as “betraying one’s age”, these problems appear as a major concern among global urban consumers. According to Givaudan, over 70% of consumers worldwide are concerned. In parallel, shifting consumer preference toward natural and organic products is also expected to impact the category. According to a recent global online consumer study by Givaudan Active Beauty, algae extract is perceived as one of the most effective ingredients, with 45% of the Chinese beauty care users choosing it to reduce hyper pigmented spots. With B-Lightyl, Givaudan’s Marine Biotechnology and skin experts intend to build on consumers’ strong interest in clean and safe ingredients. Himanthalia elongata is a macro-algae, which is rich in marine polyphenols, and more specifically phlorotannins. “We discovered that these powerful marine molecules can reactivate the expression of SDF-1, a key target in hyperpigmentation disorders. It makes this alga one of the most sustainable resources to develop a cosmetic ingredient able to gain control of the skin pigmentation process,” says Anne Humeau, Marine Biotechnology Manager at Givaudan Active Beauty. To evaluate the consumers’ benefits of B-Lightyl against dark spots and pigmentation disorders, three clinical tests were conducted in double blind versus placebo, on more than 100 volunteers from various ethnic skin types (Caucasian, Asian and African). According to Givaudan Active Beauty, B-Lightyl induces a significant decrease of the melanin content in the dark spots of Caucasian volunteers (down to -12.6% in one month, more than twice better than placebo), a significant reduction of the number of visible spots on Asian skin (-156% in one month) and a significant decline of the melanin content in hyperpigmentation spots (-327% in 2 months) on African skin. As an example of the potential of B-Lightyl, Givaudan Active Beauty formulated a skin complexion boosting essence called S3D Oceanist. The formula combines B-Lightyl together with radiance booster, Eutectys Sea Fennel, and a water rich in sea minerals sourced from Brittany (Eau de Source Marine). “Its ‘fat water’ texture (a 2020 skincare trend) and its delicate smell makes S3D Oceanist the perfect beauty product to smooth the skin, erase dark spots and even out complexion,” claims Givaudan."
Gattefossé launches a highly sensorial natural emulsifier,"Emulium Dolcea MB, Gattefossé’s latest natural O/W emulsifier is derived from the wax butter technology patented by the French supplier. “The composition of Emulium Dolcea MB has been finely tuned to provide optimal performance alongside natural gelling agents and emollients. It builds exceptionally stable emulsions that present smooth white textures with immediate and long-lasting moisturizing power (up to 48 hours),” says Gattefossé. The result, according to the company, it is “the most advanced and robust” O/W emulsifier of their natural range. According to Gattefossé, formulations containing Emulium Dolcea MB possess a strong sensory signature characterised by extreme softness. To facilitate its use in the lab and in manufacturing, Emulium Dolcea MB is presented in an innovative form of hydrated pellet that can be added to the aqueous or oil phase. “The composition of Emulium Dolcea MB has been designed to make it easy to use in all situations. Every component of this emulsifier plays a critical role to ensure stability. In formulation, it immediately stabilises the oil-water interface but also deploys in the aqueous and oil phases to both bring support to the emulsion and give a recognisable sensory impact,” said Vincent Hubiche, Global Applications Manager at Gattefossé. In order to assess the performances of Emulium Dolcea MB, Gattefossé has formulated many different kinds of products, from light fluid lotion to high oil-content rich butter, in conditions known to challenge stability. “The textures obtained are not only robust, they also surprise by their extreme softness and by a moisturizing capacity that is immediately perceptible to the user,” highlighted Flora Bollon, Product Leader at Gattefossé. COSMOS approved, Emulium Dolcea MB can be used in organically certified, vegan and readily biodegradable formulations. “In cosmetics, we all know that naturalness and biodegradability are no longer just a trend, but a matter of responsibility. However, formulating fully natural emulsions is not that simple. Emulium Dolcea MB has been developed to make formulation of natural cosmetics effortless, with a composition carefully chosen to contribute towards biodegradability,” she added. Gattefossé’s Emulium Dolcea MB has been awarded bronze, ex-aequo with Clariant’s Velsan Flex, at the in-cosmetics Global Awards in the Best Functional Ingredient category, for its ability to create a wider range of textures, from fluid serum to thick butter in a wide range of applications, such as skincare, suncare, make up and haircare."
Symrise plants garden in perfumer’s palette,"The SymTrap technology holds its promises. After creating the first passionfruit note (maracuja), it has just given birth to new original extractions. Derived from the synergy between the Food and Fine Fragrance Symrise Divisions, this environmentally friendly creation is based on upcycled food by-products, which means the latter are valorised. For these new creations, Symrise selected vegetables from organic cultures in France, Germany, and Belgium used by the Dianafood plant, a recent Brittany-based purchase. The vegetables are grounded, cut, and then heated to be used as food ingredients. The SymTrap technology captures the odorous molecules in steam and residual waters, concentrates them, and then removes water to inject alcohol. The highly concentrated vegetable alcoholate is a clean ingredient, since it results from waste recycling requiring neither heat nor chemicals. Symrise has managed to develop “old” vegetable SymTraps with asparaguses, artichokes, onions, leeks, and cauliflower – a new playground for perfumers. These real new materials, whose olfactory result is as close to the natural smell as possible, also provide certain compositions with a new texture or give more classic ingredients a new dimension, working on different aspects. “As perfumers, we work with an evolutionary palette. We keep looking for new creations with no prejudice about the smells. It is a real milestone for us to get five new materials in our palette,” explains Alexandra Carlin, perfumer at Symrise. To illustrate the creative potential of these five new ingredients, Symrise perfumers shaped them and integrated them in original compositions. For example, Alexandra Carlin used artichoke from the Pyrenees to create a fern which enhances the choke, coumarin, tender and green accents of the vegetable. As for Aliénor Massenet, she worked with a white asparagus from Germany. She highlighted its green, crunchy qualities in a thrush note. Similarly to galbanum, asparagus exacerbates the herbaceous undertones of the flower, while offering iridescent, powdery, cereal facets. Leslie Gautier played with leek tones to enhance the saline, mineral dimensions of grey amber. The rather dense formula is endowed with the “violet leaf” greenness of this vegetable. Cauliflower is also a real surprise: its unctuous texture and roasted tones were staged by Aliénor Massenet in a sweet, truly vanillin, pyrazine, ethyl-maltol-like fragrance with a pop-corn effect. The “texture” aspect of this new ingredient is a stimulating advantage for perfumers. Lastly, onion’s sulphur notes were subverted by perfumer Alexandra Carlin to work on a spicy, woody perfume. She highlighted its skin, sensual characteristics, which she melted into the creamy, milky notes of sandalwood, “loosening it up”. This small revolution paves the way for new olfactory territories. And it has only just started, since Symrise is now working on other ingredients, like carrot in France and cashew nut in Brazil. Will brands highlight the presence of these new ingredients in their perfumes? Will this new palette be rather used to play with texture and undertones, without explicitly indicating it? The current craze for natural, organic, sustainable products cannot but play in favour of this innovation."
SYN-GLOW: A glow-boosting peptide can bring a sun-kissed holiday glow all year,"Beauty trends are constantly evolving, and what’s in-demand one moment may be a thing of the past the next. But one beauty concept that has stood the test of time is the fresh-from-holiday complexion: that bronze, sun-kissed skin tone that seems to radiate from the inside. Even more than a desirable color, this skin tone also seems to evoke a feeling that most would agree to be beneficial year-round, not just during the summer holidays. Recent consumer research suggests that when it comes to the face, beauty standards are moving away from a deep, dark tan and towards a more natural-looking glow that evokes healthfulness. In a 2017/2018 study, 45% of respondents reported wanting “some tan” in order to look healthy and not too pale. [1] This sentiment is reflected across all age groups but resonates particularly with those under 55: in this category, over 60% reported wanting “some tan” in order to look healthy and good. [2] The idea of having “some tan” is increasingly becoming associated with the concept of “glowing” skin, according to DSM’s Consumer Insights Hub, which captured these consumer statements: “I think that glowing skin means your skin has healthy color and shine, and it’s free of blemishes or any other issues. It’s just like looking sun-kissed but not sun damaged.” - Michelle, age 29. “To me glowing skin is synonymous with health, the skin looks fresh and alive, not covered in makeup, not pale and pallid, good color, good tone and not spotty.” - Stephanie, age 49. Even more than a concept, this idea of “glowing skin” is beginning to be reflected and demanded in the market. For example, product launches for face and neck care products with “glow” in the name doubled in the US and Europe from 2017 to 2018 [3]. And in 2019, the social media hashtag #glowingskin was used more than 3.5 million times [4]. Further leveraging its dedicated Consumer Insights Hub, paired with a global survey of over 6,000 respondents, DSM has been engaging with consumers to better understand the forces behind this trend. The findings and consumer sentiments indicate that having a natural glow triggers an emotional response that boosts youthfulness and confidence. “I definitely think having a tan makes me feel and look younger and more confident.” - Staci, age 35. What’s more, consumers who have a natural glow or tan feel a sense of empowerment and are even changing some of their beauty habits, moving away from make-up and artificial tanners. “ . . . When I’m more tanned I probably do wear less make up because I feel a bit more confident in my skin tone.” - Kirsten, age 34 It’s no surprise then that consumers also say that they’d like to have this “sun-kissed” glow all year round – not just after a summer holiday -. The quick fixes currently on the market - self-tanners and various make-up products - often generate mixed reviews. The search for a year-round healthy glow has also gained further momentum amid the events of 2020, when the opportunity to develop a sun-kissed skin tone from a much-anticipated holiday was forfeited by many consumers. This unexpected experience further revealed a gap in the market - but also an opportunity  for products that can deliver an iconic, natural-looking and glowing complexion and compliment a wide range of skin tones. As one of the leading companies in rational-design-inspired peptides for skincare applications, DSM is working to meet this opportunity with a glow-boosting pentapeptide. SYN-GLOW™ works with skin to reveal its natural, sun-kissed tone and, thanks to its unique mode of action, it can also strengthen skin defences from within. It is clinically proven that SYN-GLOW™ promotes a visible healthy glow in just five days, with long-lasting results and a natural personalized effect. In an in vivo study with 29 volunteers applying 3% SYN-GLOW™, a natural, healthy glow was visible in just five days and lasted up to two weeks. In addition to encouraging results, participant feedback was overwhelmingly positive: 100% noticed their skin looking fresher and more revitalized; over 90% noticed skin looking less dull and tired; over 80% noticed a facial healthy glow; and over 80% would use the product again. Beyond a desirable healthy glow, synthetic peptides can also appeal to modern, engaged consumers who are paying close attention to ingredients – including how they’re made and where they come from. Synthetic peptides can meet the demand for vegan and clean, sustainable and environmentally- friendly cosmetic alternatives that are backed by concrete scientific evidence. Most consumers would agree that everyday life, especially these days, can leave us feeling stressed and tired – and it can show on our faces with dull-looking skin. Having the right tools to develop that sun-kissed, back-from-holiday glow on the outside helps consumers to feel more youthful and confident on the inside. DSM’S range of ready-to-use peptide formulations can fulfill the opportunity to help people achieve - and maintain - a natural, healthy glow all year round, without ever leaving home."
DSM sets new standards with its microbiome-friendly PDO,"Earlier this year, DSM and METEX NØØVISTA, the industrial subsidiary of METABOLIC EXPLORER, a biological chemistry company that develops and industrializes competitive and sustainable fermentation processes, announced an exclusive, global strategic collaboration to deliver the first European-made cosmetic PDO to the market. TILAMAR® PDO with NØØVISTA™ is a multifunctional ingredient suitable for all cosmetic applications. It is produced at METEX NØØVISTA’s new, state-of-the-art production site in Carling Saint Avold, France and its benefits and performance as a sensory enhancer, solvent, humectant and preservative booster are proven in tests. An imbalanced skin microbiome can lead to conditions such as acne, atopic dermatitis (eczema), dry skin and dandruff. As the use of cosmetics has been shown to alter microbial composition and dynamics1, 2*, it is important to minimize the negative impact products exert on the skin microbiome, while also making sure that they comply with industry safety standards on microbiology. In a test performed by MyMicrobiome, an independent control body that checks products for their impact on the skin’s microbiome, TILAMAR® PDO with NØØVISTA™, which has a proven preservative boosting effect, was shown to respect the balance of the skin microbiome. Specifically, when tested at 2% in-vitro, the results confirmed that TILAMAR ® PDO with NØØVISTA™ has a minimal impact on the diversity of the skin microbiome, respects its sensitive balance and has a negligible influence on the growth or number of different key organisms. These results have earned it a positive 1.2 ranking. “We believe research into the skin microbiome has the potential to revolutionize how we approach skin care and possibly hair care” said Bruno Trinquart, Head of Global Marketing Technical and Performance Ingredients, DSM Personal Care & Aroma. “Today, we see a growing market need – both among our customers and consumers for microbiome-friendly products and we are delighted our product is not only sustainable and high-performing, but also microbiome-friendly .” To learn all about this new eco-friendly powerhouse for high-performing beauty products, visit our website: https://www.dsm.com/personal-care/en_US/products/polymers/tilamar-pdo-with-noovista.html"
Givaudan addresses demand for natural make-up with a botanical red colour,"Givaudan Active Beauty’s New Red 1805 [1] aims to offer a sustainable alternative to synthetic red pigments in make-up products, while creating new possibilities to answer the growing demand for a more natural and cleaner beauty. Extracted from the Chinese red radish (Raphanus Sativus L.), whose roots are naturally rich in coloured metabolites named anthocyanins, New Red 1805 has been crafted for natural makeup designers and especially for lipsticks creators looking for high content of natural-origin ingredients without compromising performance on shade, intensity and stability. “Most of the existing colour formulae rely on synthetic pigments. Crafted by Green fractionation, New Red 1805 enables brands to bring a premium vegan, cruelty-free and performant innovation in the most iconic category of colour cosmetics: the red lipstick. With a 100% natural origin, it doesn’t interfere with performance,” said Yohan Rolland, Global Category Manager at Givaudan Active Beauty. Indeed, according to Givaudan, New Red 1805 delivers a better chroma C and a better coverage (Contrast Ratio) in comparison to synthetic benchmark red pigment in products designed for lips. In recent years, several brands - such as All Tigers, Bo.Ho. Green or Le Rouge Français to name a few - have endeavoured to offer more natural make-up alternatives, in particular by avoiding synthetic pigments but also mineral raw materials (which might be complex to formulate and increase heavy metals contamination risks) and ingredients from animal origins (because they are deemed unethical). To address a maximum of concerns, Givaudan Active Beauty has secured a partnership agreement with a cooperative of farmers in the Yunnan province, in China. New Red 1805 is therefore fully traceable, for increased quality and sustainability credentials. In addition, according to Givaudan, New Red 1805 features antioxidant properties, protecting the fragile lip skin from free radicals. With such properties the ingredient is perfectly in line with the current quest for healthy and soothing beauty products. To illustrate the potential of the new pigment in beauty formulations, Givaudan Active Beauty has designed a luxurious red lips beautifier. Dubbed S3D® Désir, the product offers a “high covering and flamboyant satin texture.” Easy to formulate, New Red 1805 can be used alone in the formula or in association with other pigments. “Its intense natural red is wear-proof stable and offers the perfect shade on all ethnicities,” adds Givaudan."
Velberry: A new fruity-sweet fragrance ingredient by BASF,"Velberry [1] is the first of a series of new launches developed through a collaborative approach within the ""Virtual Innovation Ecosystem"", a network of perfumery and formulation experts formed by BASF to speed up the development of new fragrance ingredients. “Bringing innovative products to the market is time consuming, cost-intensive and involves complicated regulatory efforts and financial risks. Only a few companies in the market have the resources needed for the tedious research and development work involved,” explains BASF.  The chemistry giant has therefore join forces with perfumery and formulation partners to develop a series of new substances for the fragrance market. The experts search through the entire palette of BASF chemicals for molecules suitable for use as fragrances. The large number of potential candidates calls for a strict selection and prioritization process. ""We ask for feedback from perfumers, jointly evaluate the substances and then develop the most promising candidates,” explains Ralf Pelzer, head of the New Business Development Unit at BASF Aroma Ingredients. Velberry is described as a fresh, and fruity-sweet top note fragrance material with an ultimate blooming sensation. “The gourmand character combines soft and powdery notes with freshness and red fruits. It has an excellent blooming effect and can be used as a building block to round off formulations,” says BASF. According to the company, the new ingredient is readily biodegradable with a particularly good toxicological profile. It is not classified by the EC CLP Regulation 1272/2008. “With Velberry, we have succeeded not only in meeting our customers’ desire for new substances to differentiate their fragrances, but also in meeting the growing demand for sustainable alternatives - all at an attractive price,” says Steffen Götz, head of the BASF Aroma Ingredients division. BASF explains there is a high demand among perfumers for new fragrances in order to continuously provide consumers with new fragrance profiles for example in personal care products such as shampoos and body lotions. These new products have to give perfumers more freedom in terms of fragrance creations while meeting growing demands for sustainability, product safety and supply reliability at the same time. “Our pipeline is filled and additional innovations are already on the way,"" announces Ralf Pelzer."
Interest in upcycled ingredients expected to rise in the cosmetics industry,"Food side streams, or food byproducts, are already established as a source of natural ingredients. Some ingredients, such as palm kernel oil, are widely used in cosmetic and personal care products. According to Ecovia Intelligence, there is greater demand for such raw materials because of growing consumer demand for natural and organic personal care products. The quest for sustainability is another major driver, with cosmetic and ingredient firms making pledges to use more plant-based and natural ingredients in their formulations. According to the market research firm, there is heightened interest in upcycled ingredients this year. indeed, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the supply of natural ingredients. Indeed, the collection and processing of plant materials has been affected by emergency measures introduced by state and national governments. Ingredient buyers also experienced higher transportation costs and delays because of quarantine measures at ports. The pandemic is therefore leading many operators to consider regional, if not local, supply sources of natural ingredients. Food byproducts are increasingly viewed as a sustainable source of such materials. The last 12 months has seen the launch of some notable upcycled ingredients. The French company Laboratories Expanscience has developed an active eye care ingredient from discarded avocadoes. It has set up a sustainable supply chain for the raw material from Peru. More recently, Givaudan launched Koffee’Up. Marketed as an alternative to argan oil, the upcycled ingredient is made from spent coffee grounds. The ingredient has been developed in partnership with the Danish start-up Kaffe Bueno. Rahn AG is upcycling pumpkin seeds to make the active ingredient Reforcyl-Aion. Sourced from pumpkins in Styria (Austria), the skin care ingredient is marketed as conforming to the principles of a circular economy. Cargill Beauty has extracted pectin from leftover lemon peel to produce a new texturizer and emulsion stabiliser for skin care products. Based on this new generation of natural ingredients, cosmetic brands are creating dedicated lines. The Taiwanese company Hair O’ Right is a pioneer; it introduced natural hair care products made from spent coffee grounds in 2006. It is now creating products using other upcycled ingredients, such as goji berry roots and distiller grains. The use of such ingredients fits into the ethos of sustainable brands; Hair O’ Right is carbon neutral and a leading user of recycled packaging materials. Recognition of its green endeavours came last year when it received the Sustainability Leadership title at the 2019 Sustainable Beauty Awards. New brands are emerging that are positioned on their upcycled ingredients. Launched in the UK, the Dr. Craft brand, for instance, uses discarded blackcurrant pulp to make sustainable hair colours. Upcircle Beauty is another UK brand that upcycles waste materials for its skin care range. New York-based LOLI Beauty is also using upcycled ingredients. Its heroe product Plum Elixir is made from plum kernel oil that is sourced from organic farms. According to Ecovia Intelligence, cosmetic and personal care companies are now looking to make the transition to a circular economy. Large firms like Unilever and P&G are developing zero waste systems and moving to sustainable packaging materials. Since removing waste is one of the tenants of the circular economy, upcycling presents an opportunity to such companies. According to the market research firm, adoption rate of upcycled ingredients is expected to rise as such cosmetic firms re-formulate their products using ingredients from waste streams. Green materials, including the use of upcycled ingredients, will be discussed in upcoming editions of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit: – North American Virtual Edition: 28-30 September 2020
– European Virtual Edition: 2-5 November 2020"
"Driven by new consumer preferences, demand for cupuaçu butter is on the rise","From about USD 34 million in 2020, the global cupuaçu butter market is expected to grow to approximately USD 62 million by 2030 (compared to USD 3 billion for murumuru in 2030), at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 6.3% from 2020 to 2030, according to market intelligence company Transparency Market Research (TMR). The tectonic shift of consumer preferences toward natural, organic, free-from, safe, and healthy products has played an important role in influencing the choice of ingredients used in the cosmetics, foods and beverages and paved the way for novel products developed using unique ingredients. Murumuru butter, for instance, is being pervasively used in cosmetics products. It is a key ingredient in several products from Brazil’s cosmetics giant Natura and is also widely used in a wide array of 100% vegetarian and handmade facial and body care items from UK-based company Lush. California-based Physicians Formula recently increased its portfolio and raised awareness for their Murumuru Butter Blush by tying up with small-scale retailers. According to Transparency Market Research, cupuaçu butter benefits from the same market trends. “As consumers across the world continue to lean toward a vegan lifestyle, particularly in North America and Europe, the demand for cupuacu butter is on the rise. A significant rise in the number of beauty- or skin-conscious consumers is another major factor that is expected to propel the demand for cupuacu butter in the forthcoming decade,” says the company. As a consequence, cupuaçu butter is used in a growing variety of cosmetic and personal care applications, including skin and hair care products. Additionally, it is also significantly used in the food processing industry. ""Over the past few years, cupuacu butter is also increasingly being used as an alternative to shea butter to treat brittle and dry hair, as it offers improved hydration and a great degree of softness. Haircare companies, particularly in developed regions, including North America and Europe, are leaning toward the use of cupuacu butter to develop high-quality hair conditioners and other products,"" details TMR. However, the COVID-19 pandemic will certainly impact the growth of the cupuacu butter market in 2020 and 2021. In such a context, ""addressing supply chain challenges should remain a priority"" warns the firm. Key supliers of cupuaçu butter include Beraca Ingredientes Naturais SA., Hallstar, Henry Lamotte Oils GmbH, Jarchem Industries Inc. and Biobrazil Botanicals, among others."
"VivaScentz, Givaudan’s new creation tool to boost consumers’ wellbeing","The importance of the attitude people adopt in the face of the vagaries of life has long been highlighted by philosophers and psychologists. We know that positive emotions have an impact, both on our state of mind, our body and our moods. And the current success of books on personal development, on practices like yoga or meditation, show the importance f customer expectations in this area. Expectations that perfume, through its ability to trigger good emotions, could partly satisfy. On this premise, the Givaudan teams have developed a new technology, to help perfumers in creating more easily fragrances with real well-being benefits, but also hygiene, household and oral hygiene products. VivaScentz thus offers brands possibilities to foster a strong connection between fragrances and well-being. In a nutshell, consumers will have in one product, a quality fragrance along with beneficial powers. This new technology complements Givaudan’s already existing offers in terms of sensory innovation, such as DreamScentz, a technology that improves sleep. It is on this basis that the Unilever brand, Radox, has launched two shower gels, one with a lavender and Ylang Ylang scent, the other with a chamomile and white valerian scent, with the mention DreamScentz on the packaging. The technology was developed in Givaudan’s Health and Well-being Centre of Excellence in Ashford. This center focuses on three areas, namely, bad odours, neuroscience and oral hygiene. VivaScentz will have required more than 30 years of multidisciplinary research and innovation. This interconnection between fragrances and well-being is backed on scientific evidence and the Centre has been collaborating closely with a renowned research academic partner, to develop a metric that measures overall well-being, covering the psychological, physiological and social dimensions in a fragrance context. In addition, the centre’s team of neuroscientists works in a concerted manner with the team of perfumers during the creative process to trigger a feeling of well-being. In total, more than 2,000 consumer tests have demonstrated that fragrances created with the VivaScentz technology have a positive impact on the user’s overall state of well-being. It appears that 89% of consumers from the study, estimated that fragrances, flavours, oral hygiene products could improve their quality of life, and help them adopt a more positive attitude in their everyday lives. Could this be the opening of a new chapter in fragrance creation?"
TechnicoFlor deciphers post-crisis olfactory trends,"Premium Beauty News - What changes have you noticed in the olfactory world? Caroline Catherine - During this unprecedented crisis, people “took advantage” of lockdown to take care of themselves, using products they knew and had at home, or trying to create their own, taking inspiration from old recipes. It is both reassuring and creative to use old things to make something new – in marketing, we call it newstalgia. Pierre Flores - From an olfactory standpoint, current trends are mixing up with lockdown needs, so the idea would be to select soothing, comforting notes. There is actually a return to musky, powdery notes related to a renewed taste for delicacies. But in perfumery, this taste is gradually oriented towards savoury fragrances. We are developing notes based on salt flower, for example – and they can be combined with marine notes, or hazelnut. For the latest collection of 100% natural TechnicoFlor perfumes, Alter Eco, we worked on a savoury addiction: textured, white cashew milk which both offered the comfort of milk and this off-beat savoury aspect. Right now, everyone is looking for this – in line with the evolution of tastes. Premium Beauty News - Is the perception of natural perfumes changing as well, as a result of the context? Caroline Catherine - The relationship with authenticity and traceability is confirmed, and it will keep developing. As a committed Perfumer, TechnicoFlor has had a vivid history with naturalness for a long time. Today, we endeavour to make natural perfumes evolve, orienting them towards playful, sensorial, and responsible naturalness, thanks to new ingredients. It is actually the concept of our new perfume range, Alter Eco, which is inspired from “alternative” ingredients for more environmentally friendly consumption: it features our most beautiful FairTrade materials. We like provoking, so we often do with our new gourmand fragrances, because consumers are not used to these notes in natural perfumes. Pierre Flores - Today, biotechnologies make it possible to offer more and more original natural raw materials. For example, we managed to obtain natural heliotropin, although this ingredient is usually derived from organic chemistry. All this opens up new creative ways. In addition, we work on long-lasting Eaux de Toilette with a real signature. Many of our customers ask for this. Premium Beauty News - Are there new emerging codes? Pierre Flores - Unisex perfumes are booming: mixed perfumes count more launches than others right now. It is due to niche perfumes and it shows they have become democratic, but it is also due to the Middle East, where perfumes have never been gendered. Olfactory codes are changing, and societal factors have an impact on how fragrances are created. It encourages us to innovate and play on the existing palette, while searching for novelty."
Givaudan launches an upcycled Arabica coffee oil,"Dedicated to skin care, Koffee’Up is a coffee oil designed as an alternative to argan oil, thanks to its natural properties: hydration, protection, and anti-ageing. Upcycled using from spent coffee grounds using supercritical fluid extraction by CO2, the oil was developed in collaboration with Danish start-up company Kaffe Bueno, the winner of the 2019 edition of MassChallenge Switzerland, a start-up incubator co-founded by Givaudan. Kaffe Bueno focuses on upcycling spent coffee grounds, or coffee waste, into active and functional ingredients in particular for cosmetics. The strong sustainable mission of the biotech start-up is also in line with today’s trends related to sustainability. The launch of Koffee’Up follows the launch of Vetivyne, a fully natural and sustainable cosmetic active ingredient launched in 2018 that is crafted from upcycled vetiver roots from leftover fragrance raw materials. Most recently, for instance, Expanscience launched Number 6, their sixth ingredient derived from avocado upcycling. “We are thrilled of this unique collaboration with Kaffe Bueno and we’re eager to start using the new product in creative solutions for customers. The high quality, traceable and upcycled ingredients used in Koffee’Up showcases a prosperous new avenue for using sustainable coffee in the world of beauty. This is a big achievement and opportunity, and we’re looking forward to presenting this innovative beauty elixir to customers,” explains Laurent Bourdeau, Head of Active Beauty. To illustrate the benefits of this new premium and sustainable oil, Givaudan has developed Active Beauty Eye Shot Express, a fresh gel with immediate effect on the eye contour area. Koffee’Up has received the COSMOS seal from Ecocert. “The innovation surrounding upcycling in the cosmetics industry today is a crucial point for the evolution of sustainable business and we’re thrilled to partner with a young start-up company at MassChallenge Switzerland who values the same sustainable practices we do,” concludes Maurizio Volpi, President of Givaudan Fragrances. Givaudan will present the details regarding the new ingredient and its skin care benefits - from hydration to protection and anti-ageing - during on line sessions (click on the link to apply to the session that is most suitable to you): Wednesday, 8th July at 5pmCET

Wesource wants to put an end to dry skin conditions,"Characterized by tightness, itching, and lack of elasticity, a dry skin is the source of an overall discomfort, which makes skin hydration a key claim in cosmetics (60% of skin care launches). In case of prolonged dehydration, the altered barrier function leads to increased dehydration, impaired lipid production and creates an inflammation signalling cascade. Recent scientific progress has linked skin dryness to inflammation: this is the phenomenon that Seppic describes as Inflamm’dryness. To tackle this phenomenon, BiotechMarine (Seppic group) took an interest in the properties of the Marine Everlasting plant (Helichrysum stoechas), a plant subject to high salinity, sun rays and winds, and that developed a strong resistance to dehydration. This is how Hydrachrysum was born. The patented moisturizing active ingredient was designed to break the Inflamm’dryness vicious circle. “Hydrachrysum is the new natural ally of dry skin. Bio-inspired by Helichrysum stoechas, which adapts to its arid ecosystem. It offers a unique molecular richness made up of hydrophilic & lipophilic molecules derived from the dedifferentiated plant cells and specific ones secreted in the medium,” explains Seppic in a release. According to the supplier of cosmetic ingredients, Hydrachrysum induces a decrease of pro-inflammatory and an increase of pro-resolutive mediators to allow a return to homeostasis and improved barrier function. Furthermore, Hydrachrysum increases the number of lacunae, these markers of hydration acting as extracellular water tanks and representing up to 40% of the volume of the stratum corneum. It boosts skin moisturization after only 5 days by increasing significantly the number of lacunae +82% vs placebo. “Innovating in the Hydration field is a hard task. We are delighted to reveal Hydrachrysum, the first product in the market that breaks the Inflamm’dryness vicious circle by helping resolve the inflammation process, restoring the skin barrier function and boosting skin hydration on the long term. It meets the needs of consumer for effective moisturizing cosmetics,” Aude Le Grand, Wesource Product Manager. Hydrachrysum is Cosmos and NaTrue approved, Halal certified, and scientifically proven with in-vitro, ex-vivo and in-vivo data at 1%."
Natural cosmetic ingredients to gain popularity in post-Covid-19 era,"In the context of the current pandemic consumers try to improve their personal immunity and natural ingredients with antibacterial and antiviral qualities are the most sought after, according to Ecovia Intelligence. Australian companies, for instance, are reporting a surge in demand for lemon myrtle (Backhousia citriodora), which is used in hand sanitizers and cleaning products. Australian Native Products, the largest producer, is therefore planting 180,000 new lemon myrtle and anise myrtle (Syzygium anisatum) trees to ramp up production. Tea tree oil (Melaleuca alternifolia oil), well-known for its antibacterial and antiviral properties, is also experiencing a coronavirus boost. It is used in a wide range of personal care and home care products. Based in New South Wales, Gelair has developed a line of tea tree oil-based cleaning products for the maritime industry. Virus fears are leading commercial ships and cruise liners to use Gelair products to decontaminate ducted ventilation systems. Already well established in the personal care industry, aloe vera is also experiencing high demand. During the pandemic, the use of the ingredient has extended while  companies were massively producing hand sanitizers, and some consumers were doing the same at home, says Ecovia. Seeing the shift in purchasing behaviour, the American supplier Desert Harvest has started producing hand sanitizers for the first time. Amyris, a producer of sustainable ingredients, has also launched natural hand sanitizers under its Pipette brand. The natural essential oils company EO Products has increased production of its hand sanitizers 16-fold since the virus outbreak. Other natural ingredients in high demand include eucalyptus oil, propolis, and oregano. Asian ingredient suppliers are reporting a spike in demand for eucalyptus oil. In Indonesia, the Agriculture Ministry is actively using eucalyptus oil to help stop the transmission of the coronavirus. It has developed ointments, balms, inhalers and diffusers. Ecovia Intelligence also notes the popularity of cannabidiol (CBD) is continuing during the coronavirus crisis. “CBD is featured in many new product launches, including hand sanitizers, creams, lotions and balms. The UK online retailer Alphagreen is reporting a doubling of interest in CBD-based products since the virus outbreak. Consumers are buying CBD products to help give them relieve from anxiety, insomnia and pain.” As Covid-19 is changing the way we eat, meet and clean, the pandemic will impact a large array of markets, including cosmetic and personal care products. “Expect to see more natural ingredients in the products we use,” concludes Ecovia Intelligence."
Silab targets greying hair with a plant-based anti-free radical active ingredient,"After having investigated hair regrowth and launched Hairgenyl, last year, the French supplier of natural cosmetic active ingredients focused on the fight against natural processes of hair greying through an innovative approach. “Greying of hair is an unavoidable phenomenon, however, there is a strong consumer expectation to avoid it with natural solutions,” says Silab in a statement. In order to effectively address the issue of hair greying, the company launched an in-depth screening of natural raw materials, targeting the anti-free radical and pro-pigmenting effects. This work led to the identification of two botanical raw materials: black oat seeds (anti-oxidant and detoxifying) and spiny restharrow roots (pro-pigmenting). The use of green solvents combined with enzymatic bioengineering enabled the optimized extraction of molecules of interest. The repigmenting effect of Agreynist [1] was demonstrated in vivo on a panel of Caucasian and Asian, male and female volunteers. Indeed, a visual scoring by experts on photos highlighted that after four months of daily application, Agreynist formulated at 2.5% in a lotion significantly decreases the stage of greying by 20% (P < 0.001) on Caucasian volunteers, corresponding to an average decrease of one stage of greying (result visible in 91% of volunteers). A subjective evaluation confirmed these data, as after six months of use, 91% of the volunteers reported that they have fewer grey hairs and 88% of them considered that it is an anti-grey hair product. “With its protective, detoxifying and repigmenting action, Agreynist offers a natural solution for grey hair care,” concludes Silab. Composed of biopeptides and polyphenols, this patented active is available in aqueous solution (recommended amount: 0.5 to 2.5%) and compliant with international cosmetic regulations (Europe, United States, Japan, China, etc.). An overview of the cosmetic ingredient launches is available in our special issue: Happy Cosmetics issue - cosmetic ingredients, May 2020. Available online for free, here."
Expanscience upcycles avocado by-products to fight under-eye puffiness,"Number 6 is therefore the sixth ingredient to be derived from avocado upcycling in the Expanscience catalogue. A B Corp certified company, Expanscience uses downgraded avocados (non-exportable, non-sellable) and transforms them into active cosmetic molecules. Number 6 is the culmination of this upcycling policy it completes a portfolio of sixteen cosmetic active ingredients and seven sensorial ingredients of natural origin dedicated to the cosmetics industry. Thanks to its polyphenols, Number 6 awakens the eyes by reducing the appearance of dark circles and puffiness. It acts on the microcirculation, regulates pigmentation, reduces fatty deposits. It is an eco-designed product coming from an upcycling process with zero waste. The sourcing from Latin America is sustainable. In vivo and in vitro tests are available. The clinical studies demonstrated: – A 10% reduction in the number of dark spots under the eye and a 21% reduction in their surface area.
– A 12.5% reduction in the volume of puffiness.
– A dark circle ITA° (Individual Typology Angle): +40% after 28 days’ application (1 shade lighter) / a complexion ITA°: +8% after 28 days. Number 6 is certified ERI 360° (Eco Responsible Ingredient). This label provides the first analysis grid capable of defining the level of ecoresponsibility of an ingredient. It is also COSMOS-approved (COSMetic Organic Standard) by Ecocert Greenlife. “Our new cosmetic active ingredient Number 6, is the culmination of our zero waste approach. Thanks to the expertise of researchers from our Innovation, Research and Development Department, we succeeded in reusing avocado by-products. In keeping with our CSR policy and our B Corp certification, we thus contribute to further minimizing our impact on the planet and to protecting natural resources,” explains Armelle Le Peniec, Cosmetic Active Ingredients Director at Expanscience. To illustrate the different possibilities offered by its avocado-based ingredients, Expanscience has devised four illustration formulas: – Green Revival (DIY exfoliation powder + avocado oil)
– Oils 4 Nails (nail solution with avocado oil)
– Avocadabra (solid shampoo with 5α-Avocuta®)
– Wake-Up! (solid eye elixir with Number 6) An overview of the cosmetic ingredient launches is available in our special issue: Happy Cosmetics issue - cosmetic ingredients, May 2020. Available online for free, here."
Happy Cosmetics: The trend that reconnects beauty to life?,"According to Euromonitor, for 51% of respondents beauty is first synonymous with ""looking healthy""; followed by ""feeling good about yourself"" and then ""to be self-confident"". The perception of health, according to this same study, is linked to enjoying fine mental health but also of feeling good. Hence beauty would come from within, far away from aesthetic pleasure, which is also another aspect of beauty. We therefore understand why cosmetics seeks to go beyond the surface of things - skin, hair and nails, in this case - to take interest in the inner well-being of customers! Some companies have started to explore the emotions aroused by the application of a cosmetic product or ingredient. Significant advances made by neuroscience and the technologies available, in particular with brain imaging tools, have led to new discoveries. LMR Naturals by IFF has for instance carried out a major study on the emotional effects of a hundred natural aromatic ingredients. Eight emotional dimensions emerged: energy, relaxation, seduction, joy, the alternative, learning, self-esteem, mindfulness. The study highlighted in particular, that immortelle oil with an energy score of 125%, triggers the brain areas associated with motor activation, it stimulates the urge to move, the planning of things, control, and the execution of voluntary movements. Actually, in aromacology, this oil is traditionally used to combat fatigue, encourage action. Givaudan, for its part, used the method of Mood Portraits, following a method which consists in exposing panellists to series of images and then asking them to choose the ones which were the most evocative of their feelings. The Company compared the results obtained before the application of a cream enriched with its Sensityl® active and after 28 days of application. In addition, an expert analysed the facial expression of panellists who had applied the product. The measurements showed that the number of positive emotions aroused, had increased. At Sequens, the teams chose the in-depth analysis of the physical parameters of the voice (prosody) and the lexical field used (verbatim), to objectify the emotional impact of the active Glycuron 2.78™ and show vs. placebo that a cream enriched with this active, reduces the emotional charge triggered by the confrontation with one’s own image. Cosmetics is making progress in the analysis of what it arouses in its customers even if, not surprisingly, it knows perfectly well that providing happiness to users is its raison d’être. In North America, the trend for cannabis products is in full swing. According to the research company BDS Analytics, the market for CBD is expected to exceed $ 20 billion by 2024.  The molecule extracted from hemp indeed has a taste of forbidden fruit and is associated with the well-being effects provided by cannabis. However, cannabidiol or CBD, generally the only active derived from cannabis to be authorized in cosmetics, does not contain THC, which is psychoactive. On the supplier side, Mibelle Biochemistry proposes Lipobelle Pino C a comforting complex composed of CBD encapsulated in a nanoemulsion based on organic hemp seed oil and pine extract from the Swiss Alps. Grolman, through its Austrian supplier Hanfama, offers Canokos CBD, cannabidiol originating from crops with no herbicides or pesticides, and where the picking and cutting of the plant material is handmade, for a rigorous selection of stems and leaves and thus avoiding flowers containing THC. The Hanfama Company has also carried out a very extensive bibliographic study on the potential properties of CBD in cosmetics. An alternative solution put forward by Mibelle Biochemistry is to activate, via the neurotransmitter, cannabinoid receptors present in skin cells, thanks to its active, NanoCacao, rich in anandamide, and thus induce a feeling of well-being and relaxation. At a time when consumers are worried and left with unanswered questions, the Pinterest social network notes a surge in queries related to ""well-being at home"". Far from being offbeat, the search for happiness and well-being via cosmetics more in line with the values of existence, deemed essential, could be in tune with the new expectations of the post-Covid-19 period… This article is an extract of a full version available in our special issue: Happy Cosmetics issue - cosmetic ingredients, May 2020.

The perfume plant sector post-Covid-19,"Premium Beauty News - How is the field of noble materials doing in perfumery? Rémi Pulvérail - Agricultural activities are still going on in most countries, but the number of orders for fine perfumery natural extracts dropped all of a sudden, which will further weaken a number of producers: they will end up with their harvests on their hands… in countries already struggling, from a structural standpoint. Producers have launched an operation to ask their historical customers, perfume houses, for help, as can be seen in Africa, where there is still no clear vision of the impact of the pandemic, and where sanitary equipment is sadly lacking. Premium Beauty News - Can this put the different networks involved in danger? Rémi Pulvérail - Of course, there are additional tensions, but they already existed before the pandemic, due to climate disruption, for example. Natural material producers expect at least some visibility and contractual commitments from buyers, but unfortunately, it hardly ever works that way. Buyers have two objectives: minimize their stock levels with orders placed only when they need the materials, and purchase the latter for the lowest price possible. As a matter of fact, farming involves long, unchanging cycles with harvesting periods at the same fixed date every year. An initial investment is required to launch the culture, get the first harvest a few years later, transform the plant to obtain the extract, and eventually export the material. The payment comes later. And in periods like these, things get even more unbalanced. The unprecedented duration of the vanilla crisis in Madagascar just shows aroma and perfume houses cannot restore the balance, despite the many “ethical sourcing” projects launched. Premium Beauty News -  What do you recommend? Rémi Pulvérail - For these producers, which still represent micro-sectors in the global agricultural landscape, the only solution would be to implement truly responsible purchase policies with contractual commitments over several years and a systematic pre-financing policy. Of course, it comes at a cost, but it is still significantly less important than the cost of a major crisis. Also, to me, producing countries should better control their local networks with more interventionist policies regarding both the volumes produced and the price levels. Today, the market on its own cannot regulate and guarantee the sustainability of all sectors. Premium Beauty News - Should activities be relocated to guarantee the sourcing? Rémi Pulvérail - Definitely not. In a number of countries, it would be a catastrophe without this plant perfume production. For example, Haiti has become the first global producer of vetiver essence – it is the second export resource in this country and a product with a high added value. This sector provides dozens of thousands of families with a decent life. The same goes for the production of Ylang Ylang essence in the Comoro Islands. Premium Beauty News - Can green chemistry be a solution for the future? Rémi Pulvérail - Of course, whether it be in the field of bioconversion, biosynthesis, or enzymatic catalyses, today, many synthetic molecules derived from ‘dirty’ chemistry - let’s face it - can be replaced with the same molecules in their natural version. It is a major challenge. In France, we have new players at the forefront of these future, environmentally friendly technologies, like AFYREN, who work on fermentation based on French sugar beet."
Ashland uses lavender to help sleep-deprived skin,"Dubbed Nightessence biofunctional [1], Ashland’s new active is derived from lavender flowers sustainably grown and harvested on the mountain slopes in Provence, France, 140 kilometers from the Ashland biofunctional facility. It is extracted using the patented and proprietary plant small RNA (PSR) technology, developed to catch some specific nutrient compounds, including small RNAs. According to Ashland, the new ingredient helps restore skin overnight, so it looks “rested, renewed and illuminated by morning.” As consumers are increasingly aware of the link between sleep and lifestyle factors with skin appearance, mental and physical health, the ’beauty sleep’ or ’clean sleep’ concept becomes extremely trendy. “A recent Mintel study reports that 80 percent of women in France, Germany, Italy and Spain all agree that getting enough sleep is an important part of looking after their skin,” said Justine Cotton, global marketing manager and new business development, Ashland. In this context the ’clean sleep’ trend is on the rise, focusing on habits and behaviours that can improve the quality of sleep and help one feel better rested. “Based on scientific research, Ashland has defined the biology of the skin at night as noctology, which describes the needs of skin through essential nocturnal processes and molecules for night repair of daily damage,” explains Joël Mantelin, vice president marketing and business development, Ashland. “Ashland’s Nightessence biofunctional enhances skin’s naturally occurring nocturnal process, dysregulated by hectic lifestyles, visible light and sun, and helps skin boost essential nighttime molecules such as timezyme and melatonin.” Nightessence biofunctional was clinically tested on a group of 36 Asian volunteers who worked the night shift or who stayed up very late. According to Ashland, after using the product for a month, the volunteers showed a more rested skin with fewer dark circles."
Symrise brings the treasures of Madagascar to perfumers,"Among the major ingredients that Symrise grows in Madagascar are spices such as the emblematic vanilla and cinnamon, as well as geranium, red lemongrass, pink pepper leaf and ylang-ylang. More recently, newer raw materials have been added to the portfolio of ingredients the group produces there, including ginger, vetiver, black pepper and mandarin. ""There is a great diversity of climates on the island with very rich soils, lots of spices and fragrant plants. To diversify our palette of natural ingredients, we proposed to our network of farmers to diversify their production when the vanilla season is over,” explains Suzy Le Helley, perfumer at Symrise. Indeed, the German company has forged special links with several hundred farmers, mainly from the Sava region, Diego-Suarez around the city of Sambava, in the province of Antsiranana (formerly known as Diego-Suarez), the heart of the vanilla culture, in the Northeast of the island. Symrise provides them with a regular income and a health insurance. The program also provides them with training on tropical forest certification, reforestation and good agricultural practices. Farmers therefore enjoy short and long-term sources of income and can also sustainably improve land productivity. Four new Malagasy natural materials have recently joined Symrise’s palette: – Ginger Oil. Cultivated under the most suitable climate conditions in the Sava region, Malagasy ginger is recognized for its exceptional quality. Symrise actually offers two varieties, a fresh ginger, distilled locally, and a dried ginger undergoing a CO2 extraction in Germany, as part of a zero-waste program where the by-products are upcycled for skincare purposes. “Ginger CO2 is a warmer, deeper version of ginger. Its earthy and woody facets make it more complex and richer,” highlights Suzy Le Helley. – Mandarin Oil. Symrise has taken advantage of the large number of mandarin trees in Madagascar and the possibility to work manually in the country to reproduce there the ancestral Sicilian manual method known as ""sponge"" and produce a very high quality of mandarin oil. The fresh mandarin is cut in half and hollowed out of its fruit and pulp in a basin of water. The peel is then pressed several times with a rotating movement against a funnel to bring out the essence drop by drop. After the pressing, a very fine essence is recovered in a glass bottle that serves as the container. There is therefore no alteration of the mandarin’s natural scent, as can be the case with mechanical harvesting. – Vetiver Heart. In the wake of the launch of a vetiver essential oil in 2019, Symrise now proposes a more complex product A vetiver essence is extracted in Madagascar using ethanol then sent to Symrise’s plant in Holzminden, Germany, to purify and preserve only the ""heart"", the noblest part of the ingredient. – Fresh Black Pepper Oil. Instead of using the usual dried berries, this fresh black pepper oil is obtained by direct distillation of the fruit from a three-year-old vine. Still green, the ripe berries are freshly crushed and distilled on the spot. The result is a new note: greener and crispier than traditional black pepper, which is usually close to that of pepper used in cooking. For Suzy Le Helley, these new materials illustrate both the richness of the Malagasy terroir and the long-standing cooperation between Symrise and local farmers. “These new crops are a way to diversify sources of income, beyond vanilla. We have set up nurseries to provide perfume plants and spices, when asked we provide advice for cultivation, some farmers will test certain plants, some will prefer another, extolling the merits to those around them, and testing new ones. culture associations. It’s a dynamic process, we are very happy with the results,"" she concludes."
BASF targets scalp health and microbial diversity with new detox ritual,"The specialty ingredients supplier has created a new hair care active designed to restore the scalp’s beauty and health.  Dubbed Scalposine [1] it targets excessive sebum production in hair follicles and the diversity of the scalp microbiome. According to BASF: “Today’s hectic lifestyle as well as environmental influences, such as dust and pollution, negatively modify the physiological parameters of the scalp, making hair and scalp concerns more prevalent around the world. An unhealthy scalp is often oily, covered with dandruff and can become sensitive.” In a series of in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro tests, BASF has demonstrated the ability of the new active ingredient to soothe and purify the scalp by decreasing the production of sebum and replenishing its microbiota. The scalp shelters several types of micro-organisms living in harmony with human cells. While being virtually unexplored until now, this ecosystem plays a key role in maintaining the scalp in healthy conditions. In a metagenomic study, BASF explored the disruptive influence of sebum on this fragile microbiotic balance. The analysis confirmed that the diversity of the microbiota is lower on an oily scalp than on a normal scalp. Products able to reduce this excessive sebum production are therefore useful to enhance scalp health. After one month of in vivo application of a product with 1 percent of Scalposine, the diversity of the scalp’s microbiota significantly increased - with the number of taxa increasing by 36 percent as compared to the placebo. Moreover, the active ingredient exhibited a prebiotic effect, boosting recolonization with six strains of bacteria previously identified by BASF researchers as being beneficial for a healthy scalp overall. In vitro trials showed that Scalposine at a dose of 0.7 percent effectively reduces the gene expression of 5α-reductase 1, the enzyme initiating the process of sebum production, by as much as 77 percent. In addition, a one-month placebo-controlled clinical study confirmed the active ingredient’s ability to lower the level of scalp sebum. Furthermore, 82 percent of study participants reported an immediate soothing effect on the scalp, while some even saw flakiness decrease after 28 days of application. “With Scalposine, BASF has developed a holistic approach based on Sarcosine, an amino acid derivative found naturally in the human body. It is a precursor of glycine, an amino acid essential for building major skin macromolecules such as elastin and collagen,” concludes the company."
"“We are opening the age of ethical perfumes”, Juliette Sicot-Crevet, Firmenich","Premium Beauty News - Why “reinvent” perfume creation? Juliette Sicot-Crevet - We used a study of 5,000 representative consumers in Brazil, France, the US, and China, conducted in partnership with the aroma department to determine expectations in terms of naturalness and sustainability, measure the importance of these issues, and identify the most interesting claims, but also the dilemmas related to conscious consumption – it is not that clear, after all. We also wanted to know how natural perfumes were perceived, among natural perfumes, but also compared to others, from an olfactory, sensorial standpoint. And we realized that a majority of people have now adopted these natural-oriented consumption habits, although not always for the same reasons. Based on these observations, we decided to adapt the development process. Premium Beauty News - Why was the “traditional” process no longer adapted? Juliette Sicot-Crevet - A traditional process involves working on a brief with parameters mostly based on the olfactory performance, on the perfume’s hedonic aspect. Today, this dimension, which still corresponds to the main role of perfume and our core business, is no longer enough. Consumers expect more as soon as the design phase - more upstream. Premium Beauty News - What expectations were revealed by the study? Juliette Sicot-Crevet - As regards perfumes, people mainly want to know what they contain, what the ingredients are, and in particular whether they are natural or not. Then come the environmental impact, the human and ethical dimensions, the origin, and the design. We also discovered perfume plays a key role for the product and the brand to be perceived as natural and sustainable. It is obvious for perfumes, but the same goes for shampoos, shower gels and skincare. Premium Beauty News - What does the CreateForGood approach consist in? Juliette Sicot-Crevet - It is a five-step process. The first step is focused on our knowledge of the brand that will embody the perfume. We definitely need to know how it is positioned on the market, based on its products, ingredients, and packs. We also need to understand what it aims for in terms of naturalness and sustainability. The second step is based on our consumer study. It helps us advise and guide brands into choosing the best perfume strategy. Once the strategy has been defined, step three involves creation, in particular ingredient choices. Depending on the strategy, some ingredients will be possible, while others will not. For the perfumer, it becomes an exercise involving much more than hedonics. There is a need to comply with accurate specifications. Now, there was no step four in standard creation. Here, it involves the EcoScent Compass tool launched two years ago to measure a perfume’s sustainability from a holistic standpoint, based on three complementary scores. The first measures the green properties of the ingredients depending on their content in renewable carbon, their biodegradability, the use of green chemistry, etc. The second score is focused on the environmental impact, and the third has to do with the social aspect and compliance with good practices as regards the labour, health, and safety rights of both our employees and suppliers. We rely on the life cycle analysis data related to our ingredients, our suppliers’ data, and Ecovadis data. Today, this EcoScent Compass score is already calculated for every new creation. Lastly, step five corresponds to finalization. It requires total control over natural creation processes to be able to meet all criteria: the olfactory relevance, in line with the claims wanted, a stable formula, and an adapted price. Premium Beauty News - What are the constraints? Juliette Sicot-Crevet - We try to be as objective and to provide as much information as possible. There are still a lot of misunderstandings and clichés. If a company wants to go all natural, they need to know what it involves. You do not get to win all the time. Today, consumers know what sustainable packaging is, but they still do not really know what a sustainable product or perfume is. In particular, they do not know that naturalness does not always rhyme with sustainability. There is a lot to be done with brands, and EcoScent Compass helps with it. Generally speaking, the 100% natural perfumes analyzed by this tool are not those that get the best environmental score, given their high energy and water consumption and the presence of allergens. EcoScent Compass takes into account educational and communication parameters: it provides both transparency and objectivity. For example, it involves a score for green chemistry. Consumers do not know what green chemistry is. Our study actually confirmed that younger generations, in particular, are eager to understand these notions and practices to reconcile naturalness with environmental protection. Thanks to a tool like EcoScent, we get the means to measure and explain these concepts and vulgarize them with objectivity. Premium Beauty News - What are Firmenich’s aspirations within this context? Juliette Sicot-Crevet - We aim to support brands in adapting to this movement. There are as many combinations as there are brands. We intend to provide solutions that help each brand discover what suits them, what is most relevant given their strategies and targets. Since the company was founded, 125 years ago, Firmenich has been a key player in modern perfumery. Today, we are opening a new age I call ethical perfumery: it consists in offering sensorial, environmentally friendly, safe perfumes trusted by consumers. Firmenich aims to be a leader in this new era."
Mibelle calls on the Alpine rose to fight cellular senescence,"Eliminating senescent cells has emerged as a promising anti-aging therapy in the medical field in the past few years. With Alpine Rose Active [1], Mibelle Biochemistry is pioneering the novel “senolytics” concept in the cosmetics field. When fibroblasts responsible for the production of collagen either age or encounter too many harmful oxidative stresses (such as UV light and pollution), they become senescent. Senescent cells are also called “zombie cells” because they no longer divide, but are also far from being dead. These cells continue to secrete signalling molecules that promote inflammation and can influence surrounding cells into also becoming senescent. In younger tissue, senescent cells are usually cleared by the immune system. In aged skin and skin that has been exposed to consistent stress, senescent cells accumulate. The resulting chronic inflammation exacerbates the aging process by promoting collagen degradation, which leads to a lack of skin elasticity. Studies in medicine have shown that so-called senolytic molecules can eliminate these ""old"" cells and prevent disease. In order to adapt this concept in the cosmetic field, Mibelle called on the Alpine rose (Rhododendron ferrugineum), one of the most typical and prominent Swiss alpine plants. “Alpine Rose Active was shown to specifically clean-up misdirected, age-promoting senescent cells and in clinical studies to significantly reduce skin redness, increase skin elasticity and protect from UVA induced photo-aging,” explains the Swiss-based expert in botanical actives. To assess the properties of this new active ingredient, Mibelle Biochemistry carried out an in vitro study and two clinical studies. In vitro, a treatment with 1% Alpine Rose Active significantly reduced the number of senescent fibroblasts in a mixture of senescent and healthy fibroblasts, while not affecting the number of healthy cells. In vivo, the application of a cream with 2% Alpine Rose Active twice daily on volunteers showed that redness was significantly reduced after 14 days by 8.4%, while skin elasticity significantly increased after 28 days by 16.1% compared to placebo. In a second in vivo study, using a cream with 2% Alpine Rose Active allowed to completely prevent the oxidation of skin proteins after UVA-irradiation compared to placebo. Alpine Rose Active is a purified extract of organic alpine rose leaves. This robust and hardy plant grows in the high Alpine regions of Switzerland and is carefully harvested by sustainable wildcrafting. The extract is COSMOS approved and organically certified by EcoCert."
Givaudan: A natural active ingredient to protect the skin from digital stress,"Dubbed Synchronight, this new active ingredient comes from an extract of dried fruit of gardenia, sourced in the Guangxi region, in China. Designed to protect the skin, it acts as a shield against digital stress, in particular the blue light emitted by electronic devices. Thus protecting the skin against external aggressions linked to today’s digital lifestyles, it allows melatonin to play its natural role in regulating the sleep-wake cycle. “Synchronight, which is activated by the microbiome, stimulates skin rejuvenation and preserves the natural skin melatonin release cycle, resulting in younger skin and better sleep,” explains Givaudan in a statement. Developed at Givaudan’s Green Fractionation Centre of Excellence in Avignon, France, this new active ingredient is obtained using the NaDES technology [1] patented by Naturex (a company which is now part of Givaudan) that allows the extraction of some phytochemicals that are not always fully soluble in lipid or water phases. “Our accomplished scientific team in skin research and microbiomics identified a unique opportunity to bring this ingredient to life. Creating a natural ingredient with the strength to fight the effects of digital stress and improve sleep quality is a turning point for innovation in the beauty space today. We look forward to collaborating with our customers to create new meaningful beauty products that bring moments of delight throughout the day and night,” says Laurent Bourdeau, Head of Givaudan Active Beauty. To illustrate the formulation possibilities linked to Synchronight, Givaudan has designed a night cream named, “My Blue Guard High Performance” also featuring DreamScentz, a fragrance technology aimed to enhance everyone’s sleep experience."
Gattefossé highlights the benefits of its iconic natural emulsifier for the human microbiome,"Emulium Mellifera MB a natural, PEG-free, O/W emulsifier made from beeswax and jojoba wax. Flexible and multifunctional, it allows the formulation of a wide range of textures suitable - from sprayable lotions to thick butters - and applications, such as skin care, sun care or make-up for all skin types and climates. It creates natural emulsions with white and luxurious appearance, while leaving a light and smooth feeling after the application. Furthermore, according to Gattefossé, it is also an active ingredients, thanks to “its moisturizing and anti-pollution properties, its capacity to visibly improve skin texture and its high tolerance even for sensitive and hyper reactive skin.” In a clinical study, Gattefossé assessed the microbiome-friendly effects of Emulium Mellifera MB. The purpose of the research was to test the effect of an emulsion formulated with 4% of Emulium Mellifera MB on parameters including skin moisturi­zation, skin barrier function and to understand its impact on cutaneous microbiota. Several evaluation techniques were used: – Study of cutaneous microbiota by amplification and sequencing of ribosomal 16S DNA
– Biometrological measures: corneometry, TEWL
– Self-assessment by the volunteers on various criteria
– Questionnaire to understand what volunteers know about cutaneous microbiota
– Overall satisfaction questionnaire According to Gattefossé, results showed an increase of moisturization, a reduction of TEWL reflecting a better barrier function and an improvement of the skin quality of volunteers. More importantly, regarding the main focus of the research, the study of cutaneous microbiota after application of an emulsion containing Emulium Mellifera MB revealed that the taxonomic diversity and richness of the skin flora have been at least maintained or even improved for 81% of volunteers. These parameters are directly linked to a healthy skin, able to defend itself against external aggressions. A specialist in lipid chemistry and plant extraction, Gattefossé products Emulium Mellifera MB through a patented technology of transformation and functionalization of natural waxes. “From beeswax and jojoba wax, the wax butter obtained by esterification and interesterification brings a unique sensoriality and moisturizing properties to this emulsifier,” highlights the French company."
Beraca taps in Amazon oils to develop an alternative to CBD,"To address this trend, Beraca is launching Beracare CBA (Cannabinoid Active System), a new active compound designed to reduce inflammatory activity and promote the production of β-endorphin, one of the hormones responsible for providing a feeling of well-being. According to the Brazilian company, Beracare CBA is also is a safe natural alternative to CBD (Cannabidiol), which is not allowed for use in cosmetics in all countries. Beracare CBA is a complex of Amazon oils with high levels of terpenes and unsaturated fatty acids - especially linoleic acid.  It does not contain any cannabis derivatives. “Beraca is always concerned to develop products in a way which is sustainable and ethical while measuring its direct impact on nature and society. Beracare CBA, in addition to being developed within these guidelines, is an avant-garde active compound because it aims to answer the current consumers’ demand, who increasingly seeks beauty products for mindfulness. Beracare CBA has well-being and stress-relieving properties, promoting several benefits to the skin, such as a feeling of relaxation, improvement in healing activity and overall comfort,” explains Daniel Sabará - CEO of Beraca. According to Beraca, laboratory tests show multiple benefits of Beracare CBA: anti-inflammatory action, aid in tissue repair and feeling of relaxation - including for the most sensitive skin. When placed in an inflamed microenvironment, human skin cultures show a reduction of 55% in interleukine IL-1β and also a significant decrease (-25.2%) in the interleukin IL-6 levels under the action of Beracare CBA. As these interleukins are related to the triggering of inflammatory signals, the company explains that such results imply that the ingredient acts as an anti-inflammatory agent and has protective effect on the skin. Another test was performed to evaluate the action of the active ingredient on skin well-being. When having a skin culture stressed by LTA (lipoteic acid, an inflammatory agent which stresses the skin tissue), there was a 39.6% reduction of β-endorphin. On the other hand, the use of Beracare CBA was able to avoid the decrease of B-endorphin besides stimulating its production by 92.2% - proving the product’s efficacy when it also comes to skin healing, according to Beraca. “Beracare CBA has an action similar to CBD, but without containing hemp (Cannabis sativa). In addition, it contains linoleic acid, which facilitates absorption by all layers of the skin and is a powerful active ingredient in phase with the mindfulness trend in products for the skin, the scalp, as well as tonics, gels, serums, creams, soaps and lotions”, explains Tiago Cordeiro, head of Beraca’s Research, Development and Innovation department."
Clariant develops a sustainably-sourced mulberry root active ingredient for well-aging skincare,"Prenylium, the first product unveiled thanks to Clariant’s new partnership with Plant Advanced Technologies (PAT), is a Morus alba tree root extract designed to protect the skin matrisome [1] from degradation that occurs with time and UV exposure. According to Clariant, it also helps prevent signs of aging by visibly reducing the appearance of existing wrinkles and smoothing skin. Unveiled at Cosmetagora, the B2B event dedicated to the formulation of cosmetic products which took place in Paris last week, the new ingredient is produced by PAT’s patented Plant Milking Technology, which explores generally inaccessible plant parts - the roots - without killing the tree and allows for the production of rare compounds at an industrial scale. The process is based on aeroponic, soilless system that stimulates roots to produce targeted molecules in higher quantities than those found in their natural environment. Roots are cut and collected several times a year from the same plant to harvest the molecules without destroying the plant culture; the roots can regrow multiple times. In the case of Prenylium, the technology allowed to obtain a higher concentration in prenylated flavonoids (more than 2,000% higher than the content found in traditional Morus alba, white mulberry, root extracts, according to Clariant). “This class of bioactive compounds has a higher affinity with cellular membranes and better interaction with biological targets of interest when compared to the non-prenylated flavonoids more commonly present at a high level in nature. As a result, biological efficacy is higher,” said the ingredient manufacturer. Tested in vitro, Prenylium was able to modulate expression of CCN1, thus rebalancing the equilibrium between collagen synthesis and degradation. According to Clariant, all the active compounds of Prenylium were also shown to inhibit the collagenase enzyme activity, the enzyme inducing collagen damage. In addition, quick and noticeable results were seen at the clinical level, in particular regarding the reduction in the appearance of wrinkles, improvement in skin smoothness and plumping effect. A group of 22 females with wrinkles, aged from 45 to 70 years old, applied a product twice a day containing 1% of Prenylium versus a placebo in a double-blind randomized study. Results were analysed after four and eight weeks of application and demonstrated time-dependent wrinkle reduction: deepest wrinkles were reduced by -12.7% after 4 weeks and by -16.6% after 8 weeks. Data also revealed good improvements in smoothness and skin plumping. “Prenylium’s variety of benefits make it suitable for a wide range of applications, including anti-aging creams, plumping serums, dermal matrix prevention care, rejuvenation night creams, and smoothing products,” said Clariant."
BASF shows commitment on ethical mica in new video,"Colors & Effects - BASF’s brand focused on pigments - has chosen to demonstrate its commitment to sustainably sourced natural mica flakes in a video tour providing visual insights on how the material is sourced. Given the increased awareness of unethical mica mining operations in India, Pakistan and other parts of the world, involving child labor in conditions sometimes compared to slavery, the pigments specialist has chosen to provide customers with full transparency about its in-house sourcing from its wholly owned mine located in Hartwell, Georgia, U.S.A. According to a March 2018 report from the Switzerland-based nongovernmental organization Terre des Hommes (TDH), an estimated 22,000 children work in mica mines in India, where about a quarter of the world’s supply is extracted. Mica is used to make products like cosmetics and paints shimmer. But its qualities - including perfect cleavage, flexibility, elasticity, chemical inertness, infusibility, low thermal and electrical conductivity, and high dielectric strength - explain the wide use of the mineral across many sectors, including the electronics industry. However, India’s mica belt - mainly the states of Jharkhand and Bihar - is among the poorest regions in the country and has high rates of illiteracy and unemployment. BASF’s Colors & Effects claims to source 100% of its natural mica flake used for the production of effects pigments for the coatings, plastics, printing and cosmetic industries from their own mine in the U.S.A. “The controlled, North American based supply chain that tracks mica from source to supply, enables the guarantee for zero child labor and a deep focus on preserving the environment,” explains Colors & Effects. A video tour of the mine is therefore available on the Colors & Effects website to provide insights about mining practices in Hartwell and the people behind. “Compliance with internationally agreed labor standards, including the abolition of child labor, is a fundamental cornerstone of the Colors & Effects operations. As one of the leading pigments suppliers globally, Colors & Effects takes responsibility to drive important discussions in key industry networks fostering sustainable solutions,” claims the BASF division. According toTDH, the cosmetics industry buys 18 per cent of the world’s mica production, ranking 5th behind the electronics industry (26 per cent), paints and coatings (24 per cent), and construction (20 per cent)."
Lessonia adapts to the cannabis trend with a new range of CBD ingredients,"Contrary to the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) also found in hemp (cannabis sativa L.), the cannabidiol molecule (CBD), which is not a psychoactive substance, is authorized in cosmetics under French regulations, provided it is extracted from the stem, seeds, or leaves, and not from the flower itself - which American regulations do allow. There should not be any trace of THC in the finished product. Based on these restrictive conditions, Lessonia has just developed a range of ingredients to complete their line of finished products unveiled last September, in an attempt to reassure brands about how to integrate this new “super” ingredient to their formulas. “CBD is mainly concentrated in the flower, not much in the other parts, so there are two options: either you use synthetic CBD, which is prohibited on the American market, or you extract it from the stem. We decided to work on this solution using authorized cannabis sativa varieties,” explains Charles-Henri Morrice, Innovation Director of Lessonia. Free from THC, the Hemp Ingredients range by Lessonia is composed of six natural ingredients, some of which are organic: stem-extracted CBD molecules, of course, but also a 1% titrated CBD oil, organic hemp oil obtained from cold-pressed cannabis sativa seeds, a 99.4% natural and organic floral water derived from hemp stems and leaves, and a natural exfoliating agent. Thanks to these ingredients, the seven natural references of the soothing skincare range cover all body and face needs. According to multiple publications, cannabidiol offers several cosmetic interests. “We have cannabinoid receptors in our skin cells which create anti-inflammatory, i.e. anti-ageing effects. This ingredient also reduces sebum secretion in acne-prone skins,” adds Charles-Henri Morrice. Often associated with transgression, but also related to the notions of naturalness and wellness, cannabis can take on different forms to seduce a young, urban target eager for novelty and surprises. “For our skincare range, we went as far as choosing a cannabis smell for our fragrance,” explains Lessonia’s Communication Director Marion Lagadec."
Givaudan Active Beauty targets Gen-z with a combination of botanicals and biotech,"In order to address the demand for a perfect “Instagrammable” skin while responding to the concomitant quest for natural ingredients and high sensory features, Givaudan’s Active Beauty division has launched a new skincare concept at the in-cosmetics Asia trade show on 5 -7 November 2019 in Bangkok, Thailand.  Based on botanicals, the product is formulated with 95% of natural origin ingredients and is marketed as a day cream and morning ritual to ensure perfect skin to young consumers. Designed to protect young consumers’ skin against daily aggressions, in particular from blue light, My Blue Guard HD “represents an ideal balance between natural ingredients and biotechnology,” claims Givaudan Active Beauty. “As soon as applied, consumers will have an immediate feeling of hydration - ready to face their frenetic and digital life,” adds the company. According to Givaudan’s the new concept is consistent with findings of their Clean and Natural Study 2019 demonstrating that 92% of people are interested in the concept of ‘clean beauty’ and that 75% of them are even more interested in products powered by biotechnology. “My Blue Guard HD was a great challenge for our formulation team to create a concept dedicated to Generation Z. It allowed us to go beyond what we did before by creating a refined skin care product that offers a perfect ‘Instagrammable’ skin while bringing sensoriality thanks to its specific velvety texture, soft touch and fine floral scent. Simple and pure, this is the perfect incarnation of efficiency to take care of their specific skin types,” said Caroline Reverte, Formulation Project Manager at Givaudan Active Beauty. The “My Blue Guard HD” concept is infused by four active ingredients for several benefits: – Hydration: Hydranellys, a by-product of ‘Selaginella Pulvinata’ inspired from Traditional Chinese Medicine that helps to increase skin moisture and strengthen the barrier function. It also restores water and lipid balance.
– Radiance: Eliorelys, an active ingredient extracted from fresh cherry blossoms that improves the quality of the skin showing signs of photo ageing. According to Givaudan, measures of visible aspects and texture of the skin demonstrate it can protect against blue-light and repair photo-induced skin damages.
– Gentle exfoliation, through the action of hibiscus acids, a series of botanical extracts traditionally used topically to soothe the skin.
– Skin defence, thanks to CristalHyal MW+, a high molecular weight hyaluronic acid crafted by white biotechnology. The biomimetic active ingredient acts as a film generator which protects the skin from external aggressions and ensures its hydration."
GREENette a natural and highly sensorial range by ABC Texture,"Dubbed GREENette, ABC Texture’s new range of natural or organic certifiable products represents a straight continuation of the company’s history of nature-based innovations. The range features foundations, lipsticks, face care and sun care formulations offering between 95 and 100% of natural ingredients.  “The variety of textures and shades created offers many possibilities, and allows everyone to find the most suitable for his skin type and the desired result” said the company in statement. The foundations, for instance, offer textures with a matte or glow finish, with over 97% ingredients of natural origin, including natural active ingredients suitable for both oily and dry skin types. The coverage is more or less intense, depending on the expected result. The formulas of the entire GREENette lip range reach more than 99% natural and organic origin ingredients, both for the creamy lipsticks and for the liquid matte or shiny lipsticks that are available in bright or soft colours depending on the user’s choice. As far as face care is concerned, the GREENette range is based on ABC Texture’s Bubbles innovative texture that combines an oily phase and aqueous phase to deliver specific active ingredients and leave a protective film on the skin. The formulas are free from surfactants and alcohol and are composed of a minimum of 98% natural and organic origin ingredients. A concealer completes the range with a formulation reaching more than 99% of natural and organic origin ingredients. While consumers are looking for more natural products, they have absolutely not given up on the quality of textures and want always be surprised. Within the GREENette range, ABC Texture therefore developed the Bouncy sub-line with products having a soft, gummy-like texture that transforms into a fluid when applied on skin. The Bouncy textures can be used for both make-up products and skin care formulations. As far as make-up is concerned, ABC Texture showcased All-Over Bouncy Vegan, a 3-in-1 formulation that can be used as an eyeshadow, a blush and a lipstick. It creates a natural but sophisticated monochromatic effect and contains almost 99 percent of natural ingredients. The Bouncy highlighter combines this innovative texture with 94% of natural and organic ingredients for a pleasant application and a glowy finish. Eventually, a Bouncy sunscreen based on nano-free mineral filters top the whole range. It offers a SPF30 sun protection and leaves no white mark when applied on the skin with a formula containing 97% of natural ingredients. ABC Texture thus achieved a rare combination of naturalness, innovation and sensorial features."
SymTrap: A new generation of ingredients with a low carbon footprint,"In an effort to reduce their raw materials’ carbon footprint, Symrise developed SymTrap, a technique which consists in capturing the fragrant molecules contained in aqueous solutions, like rinse water or residual juices produced by extracting, distilling or lyophilizing plants and fruit. The process results in a resin, which is washed with alcohol to become a “SymTrap”, a new ingredient which differs from an essential oil, an absolute or a synthetic molecule by its low environmental impact. Derived from the valorization of by-products based on a technique requiring neither heat nor chemicals, SymTrap ingredients offer an extremely low carbon footprint. Symrise first tested this 2008-patented process in Ecuador. The fragrance house retrieved residues from the production of maracuja juice to make SymTrap passionfruit - a natural, juicy, authentic material. Until then, fruity notes could only be obtained by synthesis, except for blackcurrant bud. SymTrap also highlights standard ingredients in a new way, beautifying unexplored facets of them, as can be seen with a clove with smoky, almost peated notes, and cocoa with a surprisingly carnal, animal trail – these two materials from Brazil were showcased at WPC 2018. Beyond environmental protection, SymTrap paves the way for revolutionary ingredients. Indeed, Symrise tested this process on residues of baby food products from the Diana brand: in 2019, onion, artichoke, garlic, asparagus, and cauliflower SymTraps were obtained from this waste. Symrise perfumers have only just started to explore these new materials. “Artichoke offers similarities with the green notes of Rose Centifolia, which can help highlight its presence in a composition,” explains Suzy Le Helley, Fine Fragrance perfumer at Symrise. If onion does not sound very sexy, it does possess sulphurous notes similar to those of exotic fruit. The same goes for leek, whose green, milky tones evoke pandanus, an Asian fruit. “These are interesting prospects from a creative standpoint,” adds Suzy Le Helley. “We are gradually discovering these new plant-derived, sustainable materials. One can imagine this process will eventually be applied to other original materials. It is a real technological advancement,” she says. Other than a low carbon footprint, the SymTrap technology boldly renews the perfumer palette. Let’s hope new perfumed notes will soon be released and breathe new life into the genre. We will see how perfumers will seize this opportunity! The latest trends and innovations in fragrance will be presented on November 7, 2019 at the Fragrance Innovation Summit in Paris.

Strand Cosmetics Europe increases the power of pigments,"Strand Cosmetics Europe has developed five Maestracolors+, pigments and fillers on which are grafted or coated molecules of interest, in favor of the formulation and application mainly for makeup products but also for care. The main benefits are hydrophobicity, coverage and homogeneity of colour at application, long-lasting or biologicla properties of grafted molecules. Among this offer of five treatments, four hydrophobic treatments and one hydrophilic treatment provides various benefits: – The two silicone treatments, MaestraColors+ Creamy and MaestraColors+ Classic, improve the fluidity of foundation formulas to which they are integrated while increasing the pigment load and thus the coverage at the application, the stability of the color and the long-lasting of the makeup. – The MaestraColors+ Green treatment allows more naturalness in the formulas thanks to a natural and vegan molecule. – The MaestraColors+ Safe treatment provides antimicrobial efficacy that boosts the preservation of anhydrous products such as complexion powders. – Finally, the MaestraColors + Hydro treatment, with hyaluronic acid, is specific because it is hydrophilic. It thus makes it possible to improve the stability of the oil-in-water emulsions, to bring a particular sensoriality with a richer and more rolling touch, while providing a moisturizing efficacy. It also allows the integration of this hydrophilic active in waxy textures such as concealers or lipsticks. The interest of these functionalized pigments on wellness has also been proven by a clinical study made on a foundation including C8‐silk lipoamino acid functionalized pigments.  The study showed a decrease of stress indicators after five days of application [1].  The application also allowed to generate positive emotions and improve the self-esteem of users.  “Maestracolors+ technologies combine with the fundamental and historical expertise of Strand Cosmetics Europe: the formulation of cosmetics combining sensoriality and colour, recognized by international makeup brands,” concludes the company in a release."
Silab unveils new findings on hair regrowth,"For the first time, Silab and the team of Prof. Aberdam have shown that exosomal communication between the dermis and the hair follicle was an interesting biological pathway for the growth of hair. This work has just been published in the highly-respected journal Stem Cells [1], following a peer-review process by experts in the field. As powerful vectors of intercellular communication with a direct impact on the metabolism and behaviour of target cells. Exosomes extracellular vesicles are at the heart of major biological processes and are of great interest in the areas of basic biology, health and therapeutic technologies, in particular regenerative medicine. In spite of this, there has been relatively little work on the role of exosomes on hair growth. However, the original results obtained in joint work with the team of Prof. Aberdam has demonstrated intercellular communication between dermal fibroblasts and the dermal papilla, the “nerve center” of the hair follicle. “Indeed, exosomes from fibroblasts stimulate the secretion of Norrin, a ligand that activates the ß-catenin pathway that is involved in hair growth,” said the company in a statement. Using biological models in vitro and ex vivo mimicking androgenetic alopecia, Silab has developed Hairgenyl, a natural active ingredient on the market capable of acting on this newly discovered exosomal communication system between the dermis and the hair follicle to stimulate the regrowth of hair. Hairgenyl was widely rewarded during its presentation in 2017 at the Latin America in-cosmetics show winning two innovation awards. These new data on the mechanism of action extend the findings from numerous tests already conducted on this natural ingredient."

A 100 percent natural ingredient for the beauty of African skins,"African skins have the reputation to produce more sebum and therefore to require skincare products adapted to their specific needs. Indeed, the overproduction of sebum and resulting shininess are a common concern when it comes to African skin. “This skin also has a different composition of sebum and skin lipids, and shininess can be more pronounced,” explains BASF Care Chemicals in a release.  According to the Germany-based supplier of personal and home care ingredients, “while 35 percent of people worldwide grapple with oily skin, the topical solutions available are often not suitable for African type of skin.” Oily skin is a result of hyperactive glands that produce sebum.  The causes of this hyperactivity are manifold, ranging from hormonal changes, to environmental factors (e.g. weather or air pollution) and lifestyle (e.g. consumption of alcohol, a diet rich in dairy products and sugar). Launched at the beginning of this year, Bix’Activ [1] reduces sebum production by restraining the proliferation of sebocytes in sebaceous glands. In addition, it blocks the signal that induces hyper-keratinization and helps to refine pores as a result. Because it also keeps microbiome virulence at bay, the agent also helps in reducing skin blemishes, BASF claims. A placebo-controlled clinical study demonstrated the capacity of Bix’Activ to decrease the number of active sebaceous glands by more than 50 percent, and the follicular sebum excretion rate to fall by more than 70 percent. Lately, BASF has also checked the efficacy of Bix’Activ on oily African skins. An in-vivo study performed in 2018, had already demonstrated the ability of Bix’Activ to decrease sebaceous gland activity, pore size and skin imperfection in an Asian population. A new placebo-controlled clinical study conducted in Mauritius has now confirmed the efficacy of Bix’Activ for the unique characteristics of the African skin type, too. “The study showed a decrease in sebum excretion to the skin surface by 44 percent and an 11 percent reduction in shininess compared to the first day of the study (D0),” BASF claims. Furthermore, in a self-assessment, a significant majority of volunteers reported an improvement in their skin’s appearance. For instance, 93 percent perceived their skin to be less oily, while 90 percent felt their skin looked healthier.  An extract of Red Lip Tree (Bixa Orellana) seeds, the active ingredient conforms to the COSMOS standard for natural and organic cosmetics and is suitable for use in NATRUE-certified formulations. The development of customized personal care products for African type skins is part of BASF’s overall strategy to develop consumer-oriented solutions for the sub-Saharan African beauty market. Earlier this year, the supplier of personal care ingredients opened a R&D centre in Nigeria to better address the skin and hair care needs of African consumers."
Givaudan Active Beauty launches a natural alternative to cationic guar for hair conditioning,"Hair care is no exception to the general green trend impacting the personal care market.  According to Givaudan Active Beauty, 91% of consumers are interested in the concept of clean beauty for hair care and seek products that are free from synthetics, preferring those made from natural ingredients [1]. To address this demand, researchers of Givaudan Active Beauty have developed Naturein Wheat Peptides [2], a new natural detangling active for hair care products obtained from wheat and crafted by green fractionation. Locally sourced in the region surrounding Givaudan Active Beauty’s industrial facilities in France, the new ingredient is 100% natural. It has been developed to be used as a conditioner to smooth and detangle the hair. As such, it is an alternative to cationic guar, one of the most used chemical ingredients in the hair care market. It is mainly used as a conditioning agent in shampoos, hair conditioners and hair styling products. Actually, cationic molecules are obtained by chemical modifications to give them a positive charge. These molecules include among other the polyquaternium family, and hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride - modified guar or starch polymers. They are mostly non-biodegradable and considered as bringing extra pollution to aquatic environments. Replacing modified guar polymers by clean and natural solutions would therefore bring important benefits to the shampoos and conditioners markets. Clinical tests have been performed to evaluate the impact of Naturein Wheat Peptides on wet and dry hair. Two double blind and placebo-controlled studies were carried out, each of them on 40 volunteers. In each study, 20 volunteers applied placebo and 20 volunteers applied shampoo with Naturein Wheat Peptides at 3% or Hydroxylpropyl Guar Hydroxylpropyltrimonium chloride at 0.3%. The results, as unveiled by Givaudan, show that the wheat peptides extract significantly improved (+20%) the detangling on wet hair (versus +15% with 0.3% cationic guar). In addition, it significantly improves (+22%) the combing and smoothness of dry hair (versus 5% with 0.3% cationic guar). Two additional effective results have also been perceived by the panel: after applying the active product, 80% of the participants said their hair did feel good (versus 40% of those who used the placebo) and 70% said that their hair was easier to untangle (versus 45% of those who used the placebo). “To prove the effectiveness of our natural active ingredient, we opted for tests that put Naturein Wheat Peptides in competition with cationic guar. Results prove that it is more effective in record time. All clinical tests carried out on a hundred people demonstrate the excellence of Naturein Wheat Peptides,” said Amandine Scandolera, Ph.D, Head of Biological Evaluation. To illustrate how this new ingredient can be used, Givaudan has formulated a leave-in conditioning spray using Naturein Wheat Peptides and ResistHyal, a hair beauty enhancer containing an optimised ratio of low and high molecular weight hyaluronic acids. These two hair care actives have been mixed with Buruti and Moringa oils for repair and Saffron flower and guarana extract to strengthen the hair. Givaudan will present the illustrative formulation and the new ingredient at their booth during in-cosmetics Latin America in Sấo Paulo from 18-19 September."
New Generation skin care active ingredients adapted to modern lifestyles,"What are the functions of the skin? Edith Filaire - The skin is our largest organ, and provides our organism integrity and identity. It allows exchange with our environment, while simultaneously mediating protection from it. The skin balances body temperature and moisture, protects from UV light, transmits sensations, and represents a tight barrier against myriad microbes, toxins, and other dangers. Historically, the skin was seen as an organ comprising an outermost layer, the epidermis, and a subjacent connective tissue, the dermis. Whereas the epidermis comprises different stages of differentiated keratinocytes building up a layer of cornified cells, the stratum corneum (SC), which creates a mechanical barrier against potentially harmful invaders. The dermis is a rich collection of collagen fibres, fibroblasts, and nerve endings. While these distinct anatomical layers are critical to our understanding of the organization of the skin, they accomplish many disparate functions. Currently, researchers divide the skin into four, carefully orchestrated, functional levels of the cutaneous barrier: the microbiome barrier, the chemical barrier, the physical barrier, and the immune barrier. These developed during evolution and function to both stabilize and restore cutaneous homeostasis and to mount measures of defense when needed. Alterations in each component of the skin barrier can cause pathogenic conditions, such as skin infections, skin inflammation, allergic sensitization. Consequently, the best possible understanding of the functioning of the different parts of the cutaneous barrier is a prerequisite to develop strategies to conserve the integrity of the skin and to support the recovery of disturbed barriers. What is the skin exposed to nowadays? Edith Filaire - The skin receives a lot of stressors named Exposome. Exposome is the totality of specific and nonspecific external environmental exposures to which a subject is exposed and their consequences at the organ and cell levels. Among the best-studied environmental factors of the specific external exposome, indoor and outdoor aeroallergens and air pollutants play a key role in the etiopathogenesis of the inflammatory response to allergens and in clinical manifestations of allergic disease. Climate change, urbanization, and loss of biodiversity affect sources, emissions, and concentrations of main aeroallergens and air pollutants and are among the most critical challenges facing the health and quality of life of the still increasing number of allergy and skin diseases such as acne. How to prevent these aggressions? Edith Filaire - Environmental insults such as ultraviolet (UV) rays from sun, cigarette smoke exposure and pollutants, and the natural process of aging contribute to the generation of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that stimulate the inflammatory process in the skin, playing an important role in the intrinsic and photoaging of human skin in vivo. Strategies to prevent photodamage caused by this cascade of reactions initiated by these stressors include among another, prevention of UV penetration into skin by physical and chemical sunscreens, prevention/reduction of inflammation using anti‐inflammatory compounds (e.g. cyclooxygenase inhibitors, inhibitors of cytokine generation), scavenging and quenching of ROS by antioxidants, inhibition of neutrophil elastase activity to prevent extracellular matrix damage and inhibition of MMP expression and activity. What is Greentech developing in this area? Edith Filaire - In this field, Greentech is at the forefront! For many years, we have developed active ingredients allowing a global protection of the skin against pollution. Urbalys® protects against biological attacks from daily urban pollution in all its forms, by activating skin’s own lines of defense and cell detoxification. Urbalys® permits an effective global action, triggered when there is contact or penetration by pollutants: a double defence mechanism fights both free radical stress and inflammation, and strengthens the cutaneous barrier. Alerted and mobilised against all daily pollutants, the skin breathes again. It recovers balance and radiance, a smooth texture and a glowing complexion. Aware of the deleterious effects of Exposome, Greentech developed an alga-based active ingredient to fight against reactive and sensitive skin: Expozen®. The skin is the organ that protects the body from the outside environment, but it’s also the mirror of our way of life. It is therefore directly impacted by the Exposome, including environmental stressors (UV, pollution, cold…). Expozen® limits neurogenic inflammation, strengthens skin barrier and reduces sensitive skin symptoms such as itching, pain and flushes. It also shows a soothing effect on agressed, reactive and intolerant skin, calming feelings of discomfort and redness. It also maintains bacterial diversity, reduces species involved in inflammation and redness and promotes strains known to be beneficial for skin as Staphylococcus epidermidis. At the same time, Expozen® decreases levels of Corynebacterium Kroppenstedtii, a novel target for the control of skin redness. The skin is less flushed, more comfortable and more radiant. In this same area, Greentech developed Soliberine®. It acts against all damages induced by solar rays, including blue light, thanks to a dual power of protection and stimulation. Soliberine® limits acute and chronic inflammation by decreasing the release of inflammatory mediators and inhibiting erythema formation. It also reduces hyperpigmentation and appearance of sunburn cells. The youthful appearance of the skin is preserved by preventing irritation, dryness, occurrence of dark spots and premature wrinkling of the skin. Finally, one of our latest actives, Hebelys®, is based on a new concept in cosmetics related to a psychobiological and systemic approach: the Positive Aging. We focused on the population above 60 years old, which in 2050 will represent 33.5% of the world’s population. Today’s population expects to live longer but in good health. The trend is all about living a good life, in good shape and the most of all : living happily. The Well and Happy Aging will be the must in the cosmetic field of tomorrow, and it starts now! Hebelys® boosts the cutaneous architecture and maintains skin’s beauty after 60 years old. Acting on the key markers of senescence, it limits the deleterious of senescent and maintain the biomechanical properties of skin. Moreover, Hebelys has emotional benefits, increasing self-esteem (Rosenberg test, 1965) and improvement of global mood state (Profile of Mood State, McNair and al., 1971). Greentech is a pioneer in Positive Aging and at the forefront of the innovation in this field. About Edith Filaire Edith Filaire obtained her PhD from the University of Clermont-Ferrand in 1997.  She has worked in major French universities (Lyon 1). From 2006 to 2018, she was full Professor and -co director of a Research laboratory at Orleans-Paris Saclay.

A strong innovation strategy drives Chemyunion’s international growth,"Founded in 1992, Chemyunion was initially dedicated to the production of emulsifying waxes. In 2002, the company initiated an open innovation strategy to address the needs of other markets. The first active skin care ingredients were launched in 2005. Today, the company’s portfolio offers more than 250 skin and hair care ingredients. In 2010, Chemyunion entered a new era by investing in supercritical extraction technology in order to develop innovative plant-based ingredients in line with the clean beauty criteria. ""Supercritical extraction provides us a great competitive advantage. We have been focusing on this clean technology for over ten years, with investments worth US $ 2 million. We are currently the only company in Brazil, and probably in South America, to have this technology"", stresses Sérgio C. Gonçalves, the group’s Marketing Director. To continue growing, Chemyunion has expanded their activities to other markets such as the United States, where they opened an office in 2015, and Colombia, where it created, in 2017, Chemyunion Andina SAS. At the same time, the Group has gradually established itself as a leading partner on the international scene, thanks to its technical-commercial team and distributor network. ""About 30% of our revenues come from exports to China, Colombia, the United States, Europe, India, Mexico, among others. Our goal for the next two years is that exports will correspond to 40%"", completes Sérgio C. Goncalves. With the objective of establishing a business base in Europe, the company has currently opened an office in Portugal and, in the medium term, will also open another one in Spain. In Brazil, Chemyunion is a partner of leading players of the cosmetics industry, particularly hair care manufacturers, as this is the country’s largest category. ""As far as exports are concerned, the most important category for Chemyunion is skin care, but we also have a great development potential in the hair care market,"" says Sérgio C. Gonçalves. Innovation is an integral part of the company’s strategy. ""It is the key to success,"" says the marketing director. Over the past three years, Chemyunion has invested BRL 13 million (about EUR 2.8 million or USD 3.15 million) in their Sorocaba factory, located one hour from the city of São Paulo. Out of about 130 employees, 20% work in the company’s R&D department. ""We want to be recognized as an innovative company that works with cutting-edge technology, a company that can accept challenges and meet market needs, positioned as the main reference for its customers,"" continues Sérgio C. Gonçalves. Currently, 17% of Chemyunion’s net sales are invested in innovation and 7% in research and development. An excellent illustration is the investment the company made in the supercritical CO2 extractor, the only one in Brazil to date, and in botanical research for the development of natural ingredients. The company cultivates its own plants on the outskirts of the factory and owns 5 hectares of farmland where more than 100 plant species are grown. The next steps involve the development of probiotics and prebiotics as well as recombinant peptides - but this requires new facilities and hiring more professionals. The dermocosmetics sector, which is recording significant growth in Brazil, is also one of Chemyunion’s research and development priorities. Eventually, the company has projected to invest USD 3 million in the expansion of its factory in São Paulo."
Lavender back in fashion with French farmers,"Working its way across a purple-green field in southern France, a claw-fitted tractor harvests plants of lavender destined to become essential oil as a traditional sector stages a modest comeback. ""They are slightly grey because they are starting to wilt, it is the best point for the quantity and quality of essential oils,"" explains Vincent Jamonet who runs the operation in the Drôme region of southeastern France. The plants are fed into a hopper and taken to a nearby distillery. Also nearby, fields of lavandin, a hybrid variety that provides greater quantity and resists bacteria, soak up the sun against a muted backdrop of the Vercors mountain range. The scent of Lavandin resembles that of camphor, which is not a sweet-smelling as lavender. The Jamonet family have planted 100 hectares (250 acres) of aromatic plants, one-fifth of which are organic. They hope to extend their crop surface to 150 hectares in the future. One motivation is to improve regional biodiversity, another is that ""revenues are a little better than with crops like corn, wheat or barley,"" Jamonet says. Thanks to the increasing popularity of aromatherapies, French lavender is staging a comeback from years of decline brought on by bacterial infestations. Perfume plants that can also be used in cosmetics, medicines and household products ""are the only crop in France whose surface is increasing,"" notes Laurent Quadrio of the regional Drôme agriculture organisation. They still represent a tiny fraction of the country’s millions of hectares of cultivated land, but have expanded from 2010 to 2016 by around 40 percent to 53,000 hectares (130,000 acres), while cropland in general is being nibbled away by spreading urban areas. The number of producers has grown from 1,000 to around 1,400 and France now also has 120 distilleries. ""It’s a sector where you can earn a living, and where young farmers can get started,"" says Alain Aubanel, head of the Cihef federation that follows essential oil production. Oil from lavender destined for perfumes, aromatherapy and cosmetics sells for around 100 to 150 euros ($110-$170) a kilo, while lavandin, used in detergents and soaps, sold last year for 28-40 euros, which was nonetheless a rise of 20 percent from the previous year and 30 percent over the past five years, Aubanel says. However, France now has to contend with Bulgaria, which became the world leader in traditional lavender production last year and is aiming for a record crop in 2019, he notes. With Bulgaria aiming to produce 600 tonnes this year, double its output in 2018, it will surpass French production by five times. Instead of trying to compete on volume or cast, French farmers are aiming to produce a higher quality product. ""A modest wine from the Ardeche region is not the same as a great Bordeaux,"" Aubenal says by way of analogy. ""The big French companies, Dior, Chanel, Guerlain, L’Occitane, L’Oreal, Yves Rocher all buy French lavender,"" he adds. Latest innovation in fragrances, including the increasing use of natural and locally sourced ingredients, will be discussed at the next edition of the Fragrance Innovation Summit in Paris on November 7th, 2019. Program and registration: Fragrance Innovation Summit 2019"
Imerys’ mineral exfoliating pearls move on to colour,"At this year’s in-cosmetics Global, Imerys showcased a full range of spherical, coloured perlites developed using patented technology with the aim to provide new aesthetic effects in exfoliating products. The new ImerScrub range is currently available in five different shades: jade, coral, gold, amber and plum. According to Imerys, high colour stability is one of the main interests of the new range, as it prevents any migration to the formula. Coloured beads facilitate the creation of colourful aesthetic effects that are highly appreciated by consumers. However, the need to be combined with white pearls to maintain the exfoliating effect. “This new coloured range is a huge step forward for the replacement of plastic beads in cosmetics with natural ingredients. It opens new horizons for our customers through minerals in cosmetics and rounds out the current white scrub range perfectly,” says Thierry Casteran, Global Business Development Director - Personal Care at Imerys. Imerys’ perlite products are made from a volcanic rock which contains 2-6% water in its inner structure. When heated to around 900°C, the water trapped within the structure is vaporized, causing the material to expand and form a spherical structure. The white ImerCare P-Scrub range and new coloured ImerScrub range have been developed using patented engineered technology which combines the natural hardness of the volcanic rock with the softness of these spherical particles to provide a gentle, physical exfoliation effect."
Clariant rethinks anti-aging skin care with a superfood of the sea,"On the occasion of in-cosmetics Global 2019, the Germany-headquartered specialty chemical company debuted a new seaweed active ingredient pioneering a new cellular target to improve the appearance of the skin. Derived from Laminaria japonica (Kelp or Kombu), Epseama targets long non-coding RNA nc886 to improve signs of rejuvenate skin and reinvigorate its self-defense abilities. “Commonly known causes of aging are the genetically-determined factors (chronoaging), extrinsic factors like UV exposure (photoaging), and chronic inflammation,” explains Clariant. Epseama does not address these factors separately but goes down to the root cause they trigger. It does so by targeting the long non-coding RNA, called “nc886”, recently recognized as a key regulator of PKR, a protein known for inducing premature aging. A research by Clariant Active Ingredients, demonstrated the correlation between aging and the decrease of nc886 expression. Thus, when properly expressed nc886 is a fundamental player in the rejuvenation of skin. The new seaweed active ingredient targets chronoaging, photoaging and inflammaging at once and gets to the heart of these problems by addressing the real cause of aging by reverting the natural increases of nc886 production in order to prevent damage to the dermal-epidermal junction. In vitro and ex vivo tests have confirmed that Epseama improves the skin appearance by reducing wrinkles, skin roughness and skin dehydration. “It prevents collagen IV degradation through direct inhibition of MMP-9, and boosts it so that the junction between the epidermis and dermis is strengthened. Epseama heightens keratinocytes proliferation by improving the synthesis of CD44 hyaluronic acid receptors. It also enhances epidermis thickness, and inhibits the inflammasome pathway,” claims Clariant. The ingredient’s performance is confirmed in clinical trials on 19 women over 50 after only four weeks. Difficult to remove nasolabial wrinkles are smoothed - reduced by 19% in volume and 10% in roughness after only four weeks. Spots decreased by 10% and skin moisture levels increased by 14.2%. “By 2050, the over-60s are projected to make up over 21% of the global population [1]. This, together with the increasing middle-aged population, presents a big opportunity for Personal Care to contribute new approaches to aging and wellness. Understanding the biological processes that influence skin aging processes makes us better placed to focus our innovation on advanced ingredients to delay it. By uniquely targeting nc886, Epseama offers formulators a new source of rejuvenation erasing age-related and photo-related signs, tackling the true causes of skin aging with an ingredient derived from the sea,” said Julie Droux, Senior Technical Marketing Specialist, Clariant Active Ingredients. According to Technavio, the global anti-aging products market size will grow by USD 17.2 billion during 2019-2023 [2], with the increasing older population between the ages of 30-45 and motivation to look younger among the key drivers for this expansion."
Chemyunion launches a new plant-derived deodorant active and targets global markets,"Hebeatol Plus DEO is a xylitol ester with an antimicrobial activity and deodorant function. According to Chemyunion, this new active can be used as a safe substitute to triclosan or farnesol in traditional deodorant formulations. This ingredient of vegetable origin is obtained from xylitol and caprylic acid. Xylitol is a pentol sugar, which main industrial source is the reuse of grain by-products (i.e. corncobs), while caprylic acid, is obtained from plant-based oils extracted in a sustainable way and certified by RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil). “In addition to being obtained from renewable sources, the synthetic route of Hebeatol Plus DEO has been developed to meet most of the requirements of an ecologically-friendly process, generating a 100% biodegradable molecule,” claims Chemyunion. The inhibition of the skin’s bacterial and fungal flora is one of the main ways to control the body’s unpleasant odours.  However, health concerns linked to anti-microbial actives have sparkle intensive researches for a broader range of efficient actives from natural origin. According to Chemyunion, Hebeatol Plus DEO eliminates 99.9% of odour causing microorganisms. The non-ionic surfactant molecule reduces surface tension of liquids and increases solubility of materials thus reducing the adherence of microorganisms on the skin. Already a huge player in Brazil, Chemynunion has been expanding fast into international markets recently. Recently, the company has strengthened its commercial team in the North America with two new appointments: Marisol Bello has joined the company as Senior Account Manager, responsible for the Chemyunion Inc. business in the Northeast United States, and Melanie Joink was appointed as Account Manager Western Region."
Seqens uses blockchain register to guarantee traceability of organic actives,"The platform developed by Seqens, called ACT4S, for Active Cosmetic Trust for Seqens, makes it possible to track the journey of the company’s organic-certified cosmetic actives, from the receipt of the raw materials down to the release of the product to be delivered to the customer. Technically, a blockchain stores and transfers information sent by different users to a database, whose internal links are verified and clustered in blocks at regular time intervals, forming a chain - the whole is secured by cryptography. The idea is to protect data from any falsification or modification. As part of a manufacturing process, every step is recorded in a digital register whose transparency and distributed management prevents any unilateral modification. “The blockchain technology makes it possible for us to guarantee compliance with our internal processes and organic certification processes in real time, for every single batch. It provides additional assurance, because the Ecocert certification is only focused on the quality system. Thanks to the blockchain, we can validate all our operations in real time,” explains Marie-Alex Premier, VP Cosmetic Division at Seqens. In practice, Seqens’s customers only need to enter their batch number on the ACT4S.com website to track the journey of the organic active they purchased. This way, they can check the validity of the raw material’s Cosmos/Ecocert certificate and trace the history of the ingredient within the company, from the storage of raw materials to the issuance of the final active’s Cosmos/Ecocert certificate, including the manufacturing process and storage, in order to verify compliance with the Cosmos/Ecocert requirements. “The blockchain follows the product throughout our internal process, so it guarantees compliance with the organic standard throughout the manufacturing and storage process,” adds Marie-Alex Premier. “It guarantees the organic origin of the raw materials and the compliance of the final active.” And for even more transparency, Seqens has planned to give Ecocert access to the platform in real time, so that the quality system control becomes almost instantaneous. Thanks to this system, the company has full control over the quality chain. “If there is an error within the chain, the blockchain systematically prevents the product from being marketed,” explains the company. Right now, the use of the platform is limited to the group’s internal value chain, but it is to be deployed more widely. And if the practical obstacles are obvious, from a technical standpoint, nothing prevents the company from going farther, by integrating everything upstream and downstream. For example, anyone could trace the active up to the supplier, and even the field, or down to the final product. In the long run, the blockchain technology could make it possible for consumers to find out by which farmers and in which fields the botanical actives contained in their cosmetics were produced. A future revolution!"
Mibelle launches superfruits and honey derived skin care actives,"Swiss-based Mibelle Biochemistry builds on their expertise in biotechnology and biochemistry with the launch of two new cosmetic actives: PhytoCellTec Goji, which scooped a bronze award in the category ""Cosmetic actives and naturals - anti-ageing"" at in-cosmetics Global, and Black BeeOme, which was awarded Gold, in the ""Natural products: ingredients"" category. Derived from stem cells of the goji berries, a super-fruit native to south east Europe and Asia, PhytoCellTec Goji encourages fibroblasts to produce more collagen and elastin via a new mechanism of action:
– By revitalizing mesenchymal stem cells “MSCs"" (notably found in the hypodermis and involved in regeneration processes).
– By increasing their release of exosomes, the transport vesicles allowing cell-to-cell communication. In vitro studies showed that PhytoCellTec Goji revitalizes aged mesenchymal stem cells and boosts their exosome production, thus resulting in an improved production of collagen and elastin by fibroblasts. In placebo-controlled clinical studies, treatment with PhytoCellTec Goji increased skin density, reduced wrinkle depth and visibly improved the oval face shape. According to Mibelle, PhytoCellTec Goji thus allows a visible oval face rejuvenation in just 1 month. Black BeeOme, Mibelle’s second launch at in-cosmetics, takes advantage of two strong beauty trends: bee beauty and skin microbiome.  The active is an extract of honey produced by the Swiss Black Bee (Apis mellifera mellifera nigra) - a sub-species of European honey bee - fermented by the bacterium Zymomonas mobilis, which ferments only simple sugars and leaves complex sugars intact. BlackBeeOme was tested in vivo and in vitro. According to Mibelle it restores the skin microbiota and like so, makes the skin more resistant and more radiant (the skin is less oily, better hydrated and more uniform)."
Cosmetics enter the age of emotion,"Happiness and well-being molecules are the latest trend in cosmetic and skin care products. The craze for cannabidiol-based (CBD) cosmetics is certainly one the clearest signs of how the “happy skin” trend is growing. However, regulatory hurdles linked to the use of this substance encourage cosmetic actives manufacturers to turn to other molecules. At the in-cosmetics Global tradeshow, which was held in Paris at the beginning of the month, Givaudan launched Sensityl, an active cosmetic ingredient developed from microalgae with powerful soothing effects and the ability to positively influence consumers’ mood. ""Consumers have fewer and fewer problems accepting their wrinkles,"" said Pauline Martin, Global Communications & Events Manager at Givaudan.  “However, they want to feel well with their age.” To demonstrate the effects of their ingredient on the consumer’s mood, Givaudan used test protocols developed within its fragrance division. ""The main mission of the beauty industry is to bring emotion to consumers. Now we are able to demonstrate this effect scientifically,"" added Pauline Martin. In the same vein, Seqens tested the emotional impact of Glycuron 2.78, a biotech active promoting hydration and skin regeneration which was launched at in-cosmetics 2019 in Paris.  Evaluated in a placebo-controlled study according to a protocol developed by Spincontrol, Glycuron 2.78 has demonstrated its ability to significantly enhance self-image perception. ""Self-image perception is a key element within the well-aging trend, which is a major change in the way women perceive their age,"" says Aïna Queiroz, Innovation and Scientific Communication Manager at Seqens. This point of view is also shared by Solabia. According to the French supplier, ""today, consumers do no longer want to hide their wrinkles by any possible means, first of all they want to be in harmony with their body and image."" Solabia thus launched 3Dermilyn at in-cosmetics, a new active ingredient obtained from plantain (Plantago lanceolate) seeds, organically and sustainably grown in France and offering a high content mucilage. 3Dermilyn is a polysaccharide that has the ability to retain large amounts of water. According to Solabia, the active has three types of action on the skin: a structural action by strengthening the -deep architecture, sensorial action thanks to a unique touch, and an emotional action, by regenerating natural soothing abilities and limiting the consequences of stress. In an in vitro placebo-controlled study, 3Dermilyn showed its capacity to increase the release of dopamine (+19%) and serotonin (+12%), two molecules known for their positive effects on mood. Can consumers expect to reach unrivalled levels of happiness and wellbeing thanks to soon-to-be-launched revolutionary creams? Some suppliers call for more caution as some claims might be seen as exaggerated. ""The links between physiological and psychological well-being have been known for a long time,"" highlighted Edith Filaire, Scientific Director at Greentech.  “We know that aging is linked to a decrease in self-esteem. These psychological changes can also be related to changes in hormonal levels. The application of a skincare cream can improve wellness, but the effect must be quantified using scientifically validated tests.” With this in mind, Greentech presented at in-cosmetics the results of new studies for Hebelys, a cosmetic active dedicated to mature skin launched in 2018 in partnership with biotech company Deinove.  Tested on a panel of 24 volunteers of 60-70 years, Hebelys has demonstrated a positive impact on self-esteem (+10.5%) and on the general mood (+9%). The emotional approach undoubtedly offers new innovation opportunities for the cosmetics industry. However, brands and suppliers will have to take care to strongly substantiate their claims as part of a more holistic conception of beauty."
"Algaenia, a new natural cosmetic active ingredient for sensitive skins by Expanscience","Endowed with very beneficial qualities, microalgae and the infinite variety of molecules they produce are the new favourite in the cosmetics industry.  Expanscience Laboratories were no exception this year, with the launch of Algaenia at the in-cosmetics show. Originating from the acid lakes of Patagonian volcanoes, the microalga used for Algaenia is able to survive in a hostile environment. The alga is cultivated of 5,000-liter tubular photobioreactors, using an innovative technological process that has been patented by Microphyt, a French biotech company and Expanscience partner. This cellular culture gives rise to a biomass from which the microalga peptides used by Expanscience are extracted. Algaenia stands out for its ability to protect sensitive skin. The microalga’s peptides act on the different layers of the human epidermis. They protect sensitive skin from inflammation and allergens through a softening, moisturizing and soothing action. Two clinical studies have validated these results.  The first, carried out on 20 subjects, showed a significant decrease in an erythema caused by a chemical agent on skin protected by Algaenia compared to a placebo. The second confirmed the soothing and moisturizing potential of the active ingredient. Thirty-six women with “sensitive” skin noted a marked improvement in their cutaneous barrier (less inflammation, improved hydration, noticeably soothed) after 28 days of use, and 85% of these women responded in a positively to the satisfaction survey made after the study. In order to meet new demands from consumers, the extraction industry has begun a “green revolution” by carrying out a technological mutation toward eco-design. With this in mind, the ERI 360° (Eco Responsible Ingredient) label - which was launched in 2018 - provides an analytical grid featuring 100 SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Recognized and Transparent) indicators to assess the sustainability of cosmetic ingredients. Like seven other cosmetic actives from the Expanscience portfolio, Algaenia has been awarded the ERI 360 ° label. “This recognition highlights our involvement and our demands with respect to the eco-responsibility of our active ingredients, which is in line with our CSR approach,” states Armelle le Peniec, Director of Cosmetic Active Ingredients for Expanscience Laboratories. Skinhairgium Bio wins the Green Ingredient Silver Award This eco-socio-designed hair care active is derived from the maca plant, which is grown organically in Peru and sourced by Expanscience via a responsible supply-chain under the control of UEBT (Union for Ethical BioTrade).  Certified ERI 360, this active won the ""Green Ingredient"" Silver Award at the in-cosmetics show 2019."
Gattefossé: A natural emulsifier for silicon-free make-up and sun care products,"With the aim to meet an increasing consumer demand for natural colour cosmetics and sunscreens, Gattefossé has been working for six years to find a composition that provides a concrete solution to natural water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion issues. “We have carefully selected three raw materials that are reacted together by esterification and interesterification. The association of a low freeglycerol grade of polyglycerol-6, 12-hydroxystearic acid and ricinoleic acid allow us to obtain a supple structure that stabilizes without need for a co-emulsifier. The insaturated chain brings fluidity to the final emulsion and gives textures that present easy spreading capacity,” explains Maxime Nollet, research scientist specialized in lipid chemistry at Gattefossé. Dubbed Emulium Illustro, an innovative W/O emulsifier of natural origin, designed principally for pigmented formulations and sing a patented technology based upon polyglycerol esters. According to Gattefossé, Emulium Illustro demonstrates superior performance and stability compared to other W/O emulsifiers on the market.  “Flexible, easy to use and suitable for cold processing, this new ingredient enables the formulation of fluid textures that are comfortable to wear and bring a soft and hydrated feel to the skin,” highlights the French supplier of cosmetic ingredients, a renown specialist in lipid chemistry and plant extraction. Of particular interest in colour and sunscreen formulations, Emulium Illustro can also be used to formulate innovative textures for skincare. “Guided by colour formulation experts, we have placed pigments at the heart of the research from day one. The emulsions were constructed around pigments, taking into consideration different types of coating as well as uncoated materials. We have performed many tests with Emulium Illustro to explore it from every angle: compatibility with cosmetic ingredients, stability, sensoriality and clinical evaluation. We have also developed many formulations to demonstrate its interest in make-up, sun care and skincare. Our fully natural foundation was evaluated in a consumer test on a panel composed of habitual users of silicone foundations. The panellists were thrilled by both the performance of the natural foundation and the appearance of their skin after use. This is the best reward we could have hoped for,” concludes Malorie Duvent, formulation scientist at Gattefossé. Emulium Illustro receives the Gold Innovation Award at in-cosmetics Global Emulium Illustro scooped the Gold Innovation Award in the Functional Ingredient category at in-cosmetics Global last week in Paris.  “Gattefossé truly believes that natural alternatives can meet or surpass the performance of conventional cosmetics ingredients. The great feedback received from the panellists who tested Emulium Illustro was a reward in itself. This in-cosmetics Gold innovation award is a fantastic recompense for all our teams who have contributed to the conception and development of this new launch and I am confident in its future success,” commented Paula Lennon, Gattefossé Group Director for Personal care."
The in-cosmetics trade show to unveil the latest cosmetics trends in Paris ,"Estimated at US$ 21.4 million in 2018, the global market for cosmetic ingredients is expected to reach US$ 26.8 billion in 2020.  This rapid growth in value is boosted by the development of emerging markets, particularly in Asia, but also by a higher valuation of ingredients whose properties are substantiated by stronger scientific background and whose origin is more and more natural. Due to the strong demand from consumers and to new regulations, sustainability and naturalness should once again top discussions and trends at the show. Among the sustainable solutions, upcyling seems to be on the rise.  Biolie, for instance, has built its image on this principle: it offers a complete enzymatic cracking of the plant material originating from the waste of other industries such as off-sized vegetables or seeds which have lost their ability to germinate. In line with this upcycling principle, the Italian company Akott offers the Italine range from co-products of the food industry, the BioNap exploits co-products from Mediterranean agriculture and Expanscience boasts 64% of upcycled products in its catalogue of actives. Polymer manufacturers are also following suit by improving the biodegradability of their materials. Initially originating from organic synthesis, polymers tend to become bio-sourced. “We strive to meet customer demand. For the past 10 years, Covestro has been focusing on the issue, resulting in the launch of Baycusan Eco E 1000 which contains 58% bio-based carbon and whose hair care performances are similar to traditional film-formers”, explained Mélanie Dick, Marketing Manager, Cosmetics at Covestro. For its part, Roelmi HPC proposes alternatives to plastic microbeads with its Tselus-Bi Feel range based on corn starch and polyvinyl alcohol. Seppic has invested in the Ecovia start-up, specialised in fermented biopolymers.

Givaudan: A soothing marine active with dual benefits on beauty and well-being,"Sensityl is a patent-pending active cosmetic ingredient developed from microalgae in Givaudan’s Marine Biotechnology Centre of Excellence based in Brittany, France, which fuses nature and scientific expertise to offer consumers dual benefits on beauty and well-being. According to Givaudan, Sensityl is the first of its kind ingredient to positively influence consumers’ mood after just one month of use, owing to its powerful soothing benefits. Exploiting new neuroscience protocols, researchers have shown that volunteers using Sensityl expressed a real positive change in how they felt about their facial skin moving from negative feelings to positive ones, due to the ingredient’s soothing benefits compared to a placebo. “Capitalising on our leading understanding of the effect of fragrances on the brain in our state-of-the-art Sensory Centre of Excellence in Ashford, Givaudan expands its research in cosmetics and well-being with the launch of Sensityl. It will revolutionise the beauty market by developing products acting on people’s mood thanks to its exceptional soothing benefits,” highlighted Laurent Bourdeau, Head of Givaudan Active Beauty. In line with Givaudan’s sustainability approach, Sensityl also innovates responsibly thanks to state-of-the-art biotechnological processes that preserve resources. “We are very proud of this unique cosmetic breakthrough originating from our research on marine biotechnology, one of the most innovative sustainability pillars of Active Beauty. It reflects our deep willingness to offer our customers not only new, but also natural and sustainable products that meet consumers’ needs,” said Maurizio Volpi, President of Givaudan’s Fragrance Division."
Seqens enhances self-image perception with new biotech ingredient,"Capitalizing on their expertise in biotechnology, Seqens has developed a high molecular weight polysaccharide rich in uronic acid.  Produced by Alteromonas sp strain, Glycuron 2.78 is an exopolysaccharide able to interact with DC-sign lectin [1] and Rhamnose receptor, respectively involved in inflammation and dermo-epidermal regeneration.  Clinical tests run on a 1% Glycuron 2.78 cream versus placebo showed statistically significant results after 28 days, on hydration and a trend in favour of the Glycuron 2.78 cream regarding skin evenness and texture. Furthermore, Seqens has evaluate the emotional impact of Glycuron 2.78 versus placebo.  The company used Spincontrol’s patented technique Emospin, which is based on prosody (voice loudness and frequency) measurement and verbatim analysis. The study shows that Glycuron 2.78 cream is able to significantly enhance self-image perception (what would you say of yourself), and projected halo perception (what do you think others think about yourself). Placebo did not generate any significant change in prosody or verbatim. At in-cosmetics Global, Seqens will also launch Megabiotic-44 a Pre and Postbiotics complex derived from Lactobacillus bulgaricus GLB44, a microorganism already used in the food industry. In the cosmetic version developed for topical use, micro-organisms have been inactivated while keeping their probiotically produced bactericide peptides. In vitro tests have shown the ability of Megabiotic-44 to modulate both the skin microbiome and the strains targeted in the field of product preservation (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes). In addition, clinical tests have demonstrated that Megabiotic-44 introduced at 1% in a formulation is able to significantly reduce the number of visible pores together with pore size versus placebo after 28 days. Last but not least, Seqens is also adding ChemoxyCare 6 to their portfolio of functional ingrdients. ChemoxyCare 6 is a humectant and emollient which, according to Seqens, also shows very good preservative boosting properties while being odourless, colourless. Non-sensitizing, with light feel, ChemoxyCare 6 is especially adapted to Asian skins."
SEPPIC’s poetic imagination serving their polymers,"Why did you decide to communicate about polymers? Corinne Stoltz - Our expertise in polymer science dates back nearly 30 years. We wanted to remind the young generation of formulators that SEPPIC was a pioneer in ""Hydro-Swelling Droplets"" polymers with the launch of SEPIGEL 305™ in 1990. Just a few magical drops can stabilize, thicken and texture emulsions with a cold process under the most extreme pH conditions, in the presence of electrolytes, etc. It was a real revolution back then! And we also wanted to remind everyone that our family of polymers is constantly evolving. Today, our innovations bring together technical and sensory performances with increasingly natural and sustainable sourcing, along with higher awareness of biodegradability. For example, our latest emulsifying polymer, SEPILIFE™ Nude, is part of an eco-designed generation. We started with polymers but, in the future, we will no doubt have the opportunity to communicate on other families of functional ingredients! SEPPIC’s communication is original, both in its style and in its content… Corinne Stoltz - Indeed, we wanted to stand out with communication that is sincere, close to who we really are, but with a strong impact. I think you can see that in the style and in the content of our approach. The main video, the real cornerstone of the campaign, is an allegory full of grace and moisture. The storytelling created by MAKE IT BLOOM! makes an esthetic parallel between the polymer molecules dispersed in a liquid phase and the members of a artistic swimming team performing in a pool, which turns into a lake at the end of the film. A natural environment symbolizing our desire for an approach that is more environmentally friendly. Formulation and synchronized swimming both have an artistic dimension. They are esthetic, sensory and emotional while requiring the real technical expertise. The different networks formed by swimmers look like that of polymers in water. Thanks to these networks, our polymers address different technical challenges in formulation. These configurations symbolize also the link. On both a molecular and human level, this link provides stability to the formulas, relational solidity and success to projects. We greatly value the human contact between the sales, marketing and technical teams at SEPPIC and our customers. If it was not so important to us, we would no doubt not be the world leader in polymers for skin care. Why did you mainly want to communicate by video? Corinne Stoltz - Given the main media we use - social networks and trade shows - we wanted a simple, visual way of expressing ourselves. What could be better than a film to illustrate the grace and beauty of the swimmers’ movements? Videos are the best way to reach our target audience: formulators, marketers and buyers! Alongside the main film, we have also made a collection of five short video clips running about two minutes each. They are in the form of interviews with various personalities in the SEPPIC network. Each one sheds light on a particular quality of our polymers. For example, Chantal Amalric, Beauty Care Strategic Marketing Manager & RSPO Coordinator, explains eco-design, while Sébastien Duprat de Paule talks about innovation since he’s the Innovation Director. International managers also speak, such as Lillian Han, Asia Pacific Director, who points out the sensory advantages of our polymers and the specificities of her region. So even though SEPPIC designs and produces polymers in a French spirit, we wanted to point out the international scope of our markets. And to accompany these video tools, we also wanted to use this kind of interview so they could be relayed by the print and digital press for a 360° communication, faithful to our strategic choices in terms of messaging and our values, reflecting our spirit."
BASF opens a laboratory in Nigeria to better address the skin and hair care needs of African consumers,"BASF’s Care Creations has officially opened its new Application Technology Laboratory for personal care and cosmetic products in Lagos, Nigeria. Part of BASF’s global application technology network in 21 countries, the new laboratory is part of BASF’s new regional headquarter for West Africa which was commissioned in Lagos in October last year and is at the pulse of one of the main sub-Saharan African personal care markets.  BASF thus intends to offer a local technical service for African hair and skin care applications throughout sub-Saharan Africa. At the same time, the company strengthens its regional marketing and sales network. Beyond formulation support, this new laboratory will allow BASF to expand and develop consumer-relevant claim support for the needs of consumers in sub-Saharan Africa. “Customized solutions meeting the specific requirements of consumers in different markets are key for business growth. With our broadened presence and the investment in a new Application Laboratory in sub-Saharan Africa, we can provide on-site technical expertise and market insights to our customers and support the local development of tailor-made products for the specific needs of African hair and skin,” said Dirk Mampe, Vice President Business Management Personal Care Solutions Europe. Nigeria is one of the fastest-growing beauty markets in sub-Saharan Africa. However, local hair and skin and thus consumers’ personal care regimens are widely different from many other regions, necessitating tailored cosmetic products. “The unique African hair is typified by kinks and coils along the hair shaft, an elliptical cross-section, and fewer cuticle layers than other hair types. These characteristics make natural African hair more difficult to comb through and prone to breakage, necessitating a tailored care regimen to maintain healthy hair. Popular styles such as natural afro hair, chemically-relaxed hair, dreadlocked hair and the usage of styling tools, e.g. flat irons, also call for specialty products,” said BASF. As with hair, African skin types have distinct characteristics. According to BASF, differences include a relatively high amount of protective melanin, skin lipids and sebum secretion, and a comparatively large pore area. “An intensive and gentle cleansing combined with suitable skin care products can improve the skin texture by supporting the balance between moisture and sebum production,” adds the company. The opening of this laboratory is therefore an important step in the creation of both hair and skin care applications to answer specific needs and trends of African consumers."
Silab: A new sensorial active ingredient for mature skins,"For the development of this new patented natural active, Silab took inspiration from recent studies showing the expression of epidermal receptors of smell and taste, whose stimulation enhances cutaneous regeneration (cell proliferation, migration, differentiation). Through new in vitro models, Silab has shown the expression and functioning of these receptors is disrupted in the course of aging. According to Silab, Sensorialine [1] thus allows to activate the epidermal olfactory and taste receptors and to favour epidermal renewal. In a clinical study, Sensorialine significantly reduces transepidermal water loss on both Caucasian and Asian volunteers after 14 days of twice daily treatment at 2.5% and compared to the placebo. In addition, a consumer test conducted on a panel with mature skin highlighted the moisturizing effect of Sensorialine. According to Silab, 85% of the panellists assessed their skin more moisturized from the first application, a statement also confirmed at 77% after 14 days of application. Moreover, almost half of them reported that the moisturizing effect lasted more than three hours after the first application. Sensorialine is derived from coconut (cocos nucifera) flour, a co-product obtained from cold-pressing the white flesh of the fruit. As part of their commitment in terms of eco-responsibility, Silab is sourcing its raw material in Sri Lanka, a country renowned for its traditional use of coconuts. The company, has selected its suppliers by favouring certified organic chains and production sites with good manufacturing practices label. “Managing these supplies of coconut flour is the assurance of working with a traceable, secure and high quality raw material,” highlights Silab. Sensorialine is available in aqueous solution (recommended amount: 0.5 to 2.5%) and is compliant with international cosmetic regulations (Europe, United Sates, Japan, China). Silab recognized for its approach in combating climate change Silab obtained an A- rating from CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project), a non-profit organization for climate change, water security and forests. “Compared to the average score in the sector which is D, this rating recognizes the effectiveness of the company’s ambitious actions to reduce carbon emissions,” explains the company in a statement. One of the actions carried out in 2018 to protect the planet was the creation of an internal carbon fund."
BASF wants a simpler and faster formulation of cosmetics,"Presented the latest Cosmet’Agora trade show in Paris, BASF’s “Innovative Skincare Journey” concept features one basic multi-purpose formulation which is adjusted in a second production phase. Various formulas can be created by carefully selecting additional ingredients (e.g. active ingredients) depending on the textures, senses and functions that want to be achieved. The aim is to help brands to address more easily the latest beauty trends. According to BASF, by allowing manufacturers to focus on only few ingredients, this technique helps them to easily ensure high transparency levels to consumers. Like other suppliers of cosmetic ingredients, BASF has made the shift towards more natural cosmetic products. Naturalness is the leading growth driver of the cosmetics industry today.  About 130 ingredients developed by BASF for personal care applications have already been registered with COSMOS and more than 50 of the products are evaluated according to the NATRUE criteria. “That makes BASF the largest provider of raw materials that are suitable for natural and organic cosmetic,” said the company in a statement. Furthermore, BASF has reviewed its complete personal care portfolio according to the ISO 16128 standard criteria and calculating rules, providing manufacturers of cosmetic products with guidance and information on the degree of natural origin of the ingredients. [More than 250 of BASF’s personal care ingredients meet the ISO definition as natural or derived natural->http://www.premiumbeautynews.com/en/basf-personal-care-expands-its,14103] with a share of at least 50 percent natural carbon atoms. In line with this trend, BASF presented four new products on the occasion of Cosmet’Agora: –  Euperlan® OP White, a wax-based, readily-biodegradable and cold-processable white opacifier dispersion for surfactant formulations.
– Cegesoft® Peel, an environmentally-friendly alternative to sharp-edged abrasives and non-degradable beads (often referred to as microplastic beads) consisting of spherically shaped wax beads that provide a gentle and mild exfoliation.
– Emulgade® Sucro Plus and Eumulgin® VL 75, two new emulsifiers both completely natural-based and approved by COSMOS. “The personal care market has become increasingly complex, evolving at an ever-faster pace. At the same time, consumers seek more transparency, particularly on the composition of a product and the details of the production chain. We support our customers in developing winning products that provide all the transparency consumers wish for,” said Marine Belthé, Marketing Manager at BASF Personal Care Europe."
"Geotrends, new Seppic cosmetic formulations inspired by beauty trends","Taking inspiration from five global beauty trends - Personalized Beauty, Well-Being, Ethics, Inspiration from nature and Digitization - Seppic is showcasing a series of cosmetic formulations developed, with the help of its laboratory, to suit different lifestyles. Personalized Beauty, Do-It-Yourself  is back among global trends. A Modisumer (= Modification + Consumer) personalizes their cosmetic product to use a formula: – ’Home-made’ with known ingredients,
– Unique and matched to their skin needs and their desire for texture,
– Enhanced efficacy. Hence the need for a sound base, whatever the cocktail of active ingredients. To stabilize the DIY Dermocosmetic Skeleton after adding dermocosmetic actives such as urea, glycolic acid, Seppic therefore used Sepimax Zen a next-generation thickening, stabilizing and texturizing powder polymer. Minimalism, from Europe and Japan, is part of the Well-being  trend. The consumer uses simple and transparent formulations containing ingredients essential for well-being. To address this trend, Seppic presents Adipo’Stop, a transparent minimalist slimming formulation containing a combination of two active ingredients - caffeine and Adipoless - that helps to beautify legs. Increasing consumer interest in labels and biodegradability is the main factor increasing demand in the global Ethical trend and Natural Products. To address this trend, Ethik’Biote Daily Care presents a natural body fluid for easily hydrated skin and a balanced microbiota with the active ingredient Equibiome derived from Burdock roots. It has been developed with a combo of natural and easily biodegradable ingredients: Fluidifeel Easy emulsifier, Emogreen L15 emollient and Solagum AX polymer. “A light formulation with a nude skin feeling, ultra-soft on the body,” highlights Seppic. Coming from Asia and the United States, ’Dirt Beauty’ is inspired by nature (products based on seaweeds, clays, ashes, wood charcoal, probiotics...) and brings numerous benefits for the skin. The Trash Slime face mask uses the powers of red seaweed extract and of Contacticel, an active developed by Seppic to fight pollution due to PM2.5 particles. The ’slime’ texture looks like as the children’s ’slime’ game and is inspired by tree sap. The combination of natural Solagum AX gum. Sepimax Zen stabilises the original elastic texture of the face mask and suspends the matcha tea, the only colour and perfume in the skincare product. A biomimetic mask from sap for anti-pollution effect! To be ready for a photo, a selfie at any moment, is part of the global Digitization trend with Instantaneous Effect. To keep photo-ready all along the day, Seppic therefore developed Insta-Aging fluid serum, a comprehensive anti-aging skincare, combining Sesaflash, an immediate tightener, and Aspar’Age, which protects young cells from contagious aging due to SMS (Senescence-Messaging Secretome)."
Givaudan aims to protect hair from free radical-induced whitening,"The loss of pigmentation in the hair shaft (hair greying) is one of the most obvious signs of ageing, and one of the main beauty concerns of ageing. Indeed, between 45 and 65 years old, 74% of the worldwide population is affected by greying hair. According to Givaudan Active Beauty, 59% of consumers are worried about hair ageing. Asians, especially Japanese and Chinese, are particularly concerned about hair whitening. While genes can play a large role in hair whitening, “it is now well-known that free radicals are directly inducing the premature greying of hair for both men and women,” explains the manufacturer of active cosmetic ingredients. To tackle this phenomenon, Givaudan’s scientists have designed Darkenyl, an active cosmetic ingredient combining two synergistic molecules: the taxifolin glucoside (a stabilised plant polyphenol) and N-acetyl-tyrosine (a soluble precursor of melanin). According to Givaudan Active Beauty, Darkenyl fights against white hair through three main mechanisms: – Protection of hair follicles from oxidation.
– Stimulation of hair follicle stem cells to create new melanocytes.
– Melanogenesis activation to increase melanin production “This mode of action is completely independent from gender, hair type or hair colour, making Darkenyl an ideal solution to universally target hair greying,” says Givaudan. The ability of Darkenyl to stimulate hair follicle stem cells and the melanogenesis has been demonstrated by various in vitro tests. A clinical study versus placebo using white hair proportion scoring on hairlines and white hair density quantifying on a shaved scalp area have demonstrated the significant consumers’ benefits of Darkenyl: in 4 months, volunteers had more than 3 times less white hair/cm2, with up to -56% reduction of white hair. Darkenyl was presented at the in-cosmetics Asia tradeshow, which was held in Bangkok, Thailand, from October 30 to November 01, 2018. To inspire beauty brands while showcasing the high potential of this new hair technology, Givaudan’s experts crafted S3D Colourback, a repigmenting and conditioning serum to beautify and rejuvenate the hair. S3D Colourback features Darkenyl and ResistHyal, a hair conditionning active. The serum quickly penetrates into the scalp and spreads on the hair thanks to an innovative comb placed on the tube to facilitate a precise and effective application, directly on the roots. S3D Colourback was awarded in the haircare actives category at the show’s Spotlight-On-Formulation Award competition. ""It is part of our corporate DNA to inspire our customers, by providing them with not only the most performant ingredients, but also by crafting disruptive product concepts leveraging consumers insights and market trends to help them move faster on their market,” said Laurent Bourdeau, Head of Givaudan’s Active Beauty."
Indie brands and new markets to take center stage at in-cosmetics North America show,"With a revenue reaching US$82,492m in 2018 [1] and sales forecasted to grow by 2.2% (CAGR) annually on 2018-2021, North America remains the world’s largest personal care market. The skincare segment is leading the charge and is expected to hold 13-14% market share (US$20,116m) in 2018.  The upcoming edition of in-cosmetics North America will therefore focus on the main innovations and trends that are impacting this key market, in particular the impact and need of indie brands that are taking the US by storm. The buzz surrounding indie brands in the cosmetics space in the US is further compounded by e-commerce giant Amazon recently announcing the advent of an Indie Beauty Shop within its Marketplace.  With this in mind, in-cosmetics North America is dedicating a full session of its conference program to the biggest challenges facing this emerging group, such as distribution difficulties, entering consumer consciousness and keeping up with fast-moving trends. The program also features speed networking sessions, with suppliers given the opportunity to meet with brand owners and representatives. Beyond North America, there are several key regions that contribute break-through innovations and own considerable market share. The show reflects this trend with a key focus on exhibitors from across the world’s biggest cosmetics markets including Asia - one of the world’s top 10 markets worth an estimated US$13 billion [2] - and Brazil, which accounts for 9.4% of the global industry [3]. There will also be significant European representation from countries including Belgium, Germany, France and the Netherlands. The 2018 edition of in-cosmetics North America will see a host of new companies to the show, accounting for 30% of exhibitors.

Gattefossé launches a natural substitute for silicones in hair care products,"Gattefosé researchers have built on their knowledge in lipochemistry to develop an ingredient that mimics the beneficial conditioning and protective properties of hair sebum without the greasiness. Central to the composition are high molecular weight esters found in the hull of the sunflower seed and in jojoba seeds. These esters are reacted with polyglycerol to improve spreading on the hair surface and to ensure a homogeneous film. According to Gattefossé, tests show that hair regains hydrophobicity and is protected from humidity and frizz. The hair becomes easier to manage and is smooth to the touch, also style is maintained for longer. “We have been working for several years to find a composition that can substitute silicones in hair treatment products. We discovered that naturally occurring sebum really is the best conditioner for hair. With over-washing, thermal aggression and pollution, sebum cannot always play the role it is designed for and hair becomes damaged and exposed,” explains Vincent Hubiche, in charge of the applications’ development for the Gattefossé Group. This is why the company has designed an ingredient with a chemical structure close to sebum.  However, Definicire has slightly higher carbon chain lengths than sebum to optimize performance while avoiding greasiness. “The sensory properties of the hair after treatment were key in this development. We fine-tuned the composition to avoid oiliness in appearance or on touch. Our teams in Singapore and in Brazil tested the formulations to evaluate the effectiveness of the humidity barrier. We are very satisfied with the results,” added Hubiche."

Symrise is enhancing its fragrance palette,"With the strategic objective to grow faster than the market, while consolidating its sustainability, Symrise has implemented new channels for the sourcing of natural ingredients originating from sustainable agricultural cultivations and compliant with fair trade standards. In Madagascar, the Company has developed a fine quality of Vanille Bourbon absolute, where alternately leathery, animal and spicy hints reveal its sensual intensity. Symrise has also sourced from the ""red island"" a round and gourmand vanilla extract, which highlights the addictive sweetness of the pod. This unique terroir has also enabled to revisit other species: cinnamon, only produced from the bark of the tree, to offer more potency; a fine grade of ginger, pure and sparkling with lemony hints, but also ylang-ylang, lemon grass and geranium. To note also, a variety of pink pepper, based on the cultivation of the leaf. The Company also introduced the first ingredients extracted from its Brazilian factory and originating from Amazonian biodiversity. If flowers are not that common in the Amazon, fruits are on the contrary found everywhere and Symrise was able to make the very most of them in perfumery thanks to its SymTrap technology. Originating from aromatic processes and patented in 2008, this technique, which requires neither heat nor chemicals, rely instead on the recovery of fragrant molecules in aqueous solutions (rinse water, residual juice from extraction or distillation processes). Hence, many by-products are recycled to create new ingredients from cocoa, clove, orange or passion fruit (which until now only originated from pure synthesis). Symrise also made quite a statement this year with the launch of new De Laire bases from novel captives. Originally designed at the turn of the 20th century to support emerging new synthetic molecules, the former bases created by the De Laire Company have played a part in many masterpieces, like the Mousse de Saxe for Molinard’s Habanita. The ""De Laire"" project has remained unchanged: create new qualitative bases to structure compositions. Among these novelties, the Poivre Pique DL base, built around Belanis, a captive with aniseed notes that bypasses IFRA restrictions on anethole. A spicy and pungent bouquet combining at once freshness and potency. Another flagship product, Tabac Bourbon DL, which reveals tobacco in an addictive and intoxicating way. The almond-like roundness of Tonkalactone, the sensuality of Vanille Bourbon absolute and the spiciness of cinnamon mingle with the dried leaf side of the Tabanone captive, the whole of it shrouded in a dash of liquor. Tubéliane DL puts forward Lilybelle with its hints of muguet, (but without its lyral and lilial molecules in the IFRA cross-hairs). This captive imparts luminous freshness to a former base, tubériane that gave pride of place to a tuberose with a carnal inspiration. Finally, the Noir Prunol DL, supports the roundness of the iconic plum note, preserved in the chocolate accents of the Tiramisone captive, the whole of it enhanced by a dark and spicy veil. With such projects, no doubt we will be hearing more about the fragrance house, Symrise."
Beraca wants to facilitate access to ingredients sourced from the Brazilian biodiversity,"Specializing in the sourcing and development of ingredients from the Brazilian biodiversity to the cosmetics, pharmaceutical and personal care industries, the company aims to improve all stages of the process regarding the use of Brazil’s natural resources. Beraca’s new Integrated Service solution offers full support to clients; from developing tailored socio-environmental projects to ensuring they comply with Brazil’s Biodiversity Law 13.123/15. Beraca will also offer an additional service to assist its clients in the changes they will need to make by November 6, 2018 (as per the deadline established by the Brazilian government) in order to comply with the current legislation. ""We have acquired vast knowledge in this field through years of investment. Our goal is to support clients who already work or intend to work with ingredients sourced from the Brazilian biodiversity but are struggling throughout the process, especially in matters relating to regulation and access to serious, ethical benefit-sharing projects that add real value to the supply chain,” says Érica Pereira, Sustainability Coordinator at Beraca. To assess matters related to benefit sharing, Beraca has the support of the Beraca Institute, a non-profit organization created to offer transparency, governance and efficiency to its clients. Through a platform created by the Beraca Institute, clients can select the social or environmental projects that best suit their interests and goals and the local communities they wish to support. This program guarantees profits will be given back to the community as well as encouraging socio-economic development and local environmental preservation activities. ""The current legislation relating to the sustainable use of the Brazilian biodiversity is much clearer and more coherent in its objectives and guidelines if compared to the previous legislation, which was in effect until the end of 2015,” says Pereira. “By offering this service to our clients, we encourage them to take advantage of this opportunity to not only comply with the legislation but also to create added value for the end consumer. This can be achieved through the support of benefit-sharing projects, positive impact measurement, traceability and marketing appeals.”"
Mane adds a new flower and a new fruit to the perfumer’s palette,"Among the various innovations that Mane showcased at the 2018 edition of the World Perfumery Congress, we spotted Gnidia Flower Absolute a floral extract from Madagascar’s Gnidia Daphnifoliar. “These wild orange flowers attracted Mr Jean Mane’s attention in 2005 when travelling through Madagascar. We eventually started testing different extractions which gave surprising results leading to this unique absolute,” explained Véronique Nyberg, Vice President Creation, Fine Fragrances at Mane. To make this new scent available, Mane spent several years overcoming the legislative and sanitary hurdles that have to be passed prior to placing a product on the market. The multifaceted scent of the flowers unveils notes of narcissus, violet, cucumber, tea, and tuberose. The extract contains natural maltol, which brings a note of delicious sweetness. ""A new ingredient of this type is a strong vector of innovation,"" added Véronique Nyberg, ""That’s what can make the difference when responding to a marketing brief."" Locally called Mandriakiaka, the fibre of the plant is used to make ropes or Antaimoro paper from the name of the communities which produce it. Today, the Gnidia flowers are harvested by hand by two associations of women living in a village where Mane also sources its vetiver. Mane also presented in Nice another new botanic in perfumery: Four Corners Alcoholic Resinoid, an extract of the fruit of Tetraptera Tetraptera or Aidan tree.  Also called Quatre Côtés or Esesè locally, this wild fruit from the tropical forest of Cameroon is a loved spice of local family used for jams, cookies and sweets.  It provides very powerful notes of rum and banana flambée that combine very well with leathery notes. Among the other innovations are: – Lavandin Pure Jungle Essence, a Lavandin extract sourced in Southern France with fresh feminine top notes resulting from an extraction of the flowers only with Mane’s Jungle Essence supercritical technology.
– Geranium Bourbon Essential Oil, extracted from specific variety, from an original cultivar of Madagascar, hat has been meticulously chosen for its superior quality.
– Forest Pepper Pure Jungle Essence, derived from spicy-citrusy berries from Thailand it unveils a new kind of citrus note with orange, pink pepper tonalities and aldehydic facets.
– Bigaflower, a specialty created with a selection of Mane’s captive molecules including a high level of Bigarane for its interesting soft green notes of petitgrain.
– Driftwood, a speciality offering ambery-woody tonalities and created with Ambramone, a Mane captive molecule, with is a nice radiant ambery scent with elegant facets reminiscent of white woods"
ERI 360 °: A label to assess the sustainability of cosmetic ingredients,"The ERI 360° (Eco Responsible Ingredient) Label is a comprehensive method to measure the level of social and environmental responsibility of cosmetic ingredients based on 100 SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Recognized and Transparent) indicators. The specifications of this labelling scheme have been designed by France Eco Extraction - a French association focusing on the eco-extraction of natural ingredients - in co-operation with the PASS [1] competitiveness cluster and 13 French suppliers of aromas and cosmetic ingredients. The ERI 360° Label therefore enables companies to evaluate their extracts’ processes in the supply chain as well as their sustainable and responsible practices. The ERI 360° Label is an internal tool for companies to guide them and measure their performance, it also offers the possibility to obtain a certification via an external audit. The ERI 360° Label provides an evaluation grid established on 100 SMART [2] indicators to measure the level of eco-responsibility of an ingredient. It is based on a transversal evaluation to measure the traceability of the ingredients built on three main criteria: an assessment of the raw material, the bio-processes and the processes. The labelling is processed through an electronic application presented on a web platform, supported by a training course to help users carry out the evaluation. There are three levels of labelling (gold, silver, bronze) which result from the level of success obtained during the evaluation. The evaluation is accompanied by recommendations aimed at the continuous improvement of the company for the production of responsible ingredients. The ERI 360° Label is exclusively intended for ingredients’ suppliers in the aromatic, cosmetic and agro-food sectors taking into account the environmental and societal impacts of the ingredients’ production in a perspective of continuous improvement. Companies wishing to commit in the implementation of sustainable production methods respectful of people and environment can apply for certification with France Eco Extraction or PASS Cluster. The implementation of the labelling can be done individually, by extract and / or family of extracts, or it can take the shape of a subscription to use the evaluation tool for a portfolio of ingredients. ""The ERI 360° Label has been created in a real proactive synergy with other partners and we are personally proud of this reliable and robust reference tool which is based on a transversal evaluation"", explains Sandrine Lopis-Presle, Research Engineer - R&D Plants Sourcing at Gattefossé, one of the companies participating in the consortium that created the labelling scheme.

"""The use of natural cosmetic ingredients requires new traceability tools,"" Nicole Giraud, DNA Gensee","Premium Beauty News - The authentication of raw materials and ingredients used in cosmetics seems to have become a crucial matter. How do you explain this assay frenzy? Nicole Giraud - Demand is indeed strong on the market for the authentication of cosmetic substances. To explain this growing phenomenon, a number of factors come into play: the increasing use of natural ingredients, traceability and safety requirements and the search for increased sustainability. All this generates new needs for visibility and transparency throughout the supply chain. The regulatory background also plays an important role. The requirements of the Nagoya Protocol on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization thus imply a precise identification of the genetic signature of plants and organisms concerned. In this context, DNA Gensee offers DNA-based analysis to ensure quality and safety of supplies. This allows players in the cosmetics industry to have some factual data on the authenticity of what they have bought. In cosmetics, it enables to ensure that what was supplied is in line with the R&D specifications and to control the presence or absence of contaminating or adulterating plants. As part of regular supplies, especially in the perfume sector where people work with high added value ingredients, it is also an important means of quality control. We provide unequivocal scientific evidence and this is what companies ask. The need for control is no longer limited to R&D and Q&A departments. As part of CSR, Marketing or Purchasing departments can express a need to control their supplies. Even distributors and traders do checks! Premium Beauty News - On what types of products do you work? Nicole Giraud - On all natural raw materials, mainly plants or algae. But we don’t limit ourselves to raw materials; we can also analyze derived products such as oils, for example. Genetic analysis enables to check the origin of oils, to control possible adulterations. For honey, we can even identify all the plants on which the bees went foraging. We can even work on highly ""processed"" finished products, like shampoos. Premium Beauty News - But analyzes are not strictly limited to conformity controls? Nicole Giraud - No, of course not. In many cases, it has more to do with a product valorisation approach. This can help a Company obtain a certification or improve a rating. The activity of DNA Gensee is based on a logic of proofs. The DNA guarantee also allows going upmarket and prove to customers the reality of what is claimed. Premium Beauty News - What are the limits of these analyzes? Nicole Giraud - The only limit are when you have to work on products where some DNA originating from the initial plants still remains. In cases where the manufacturing process destroys the entire DNA present, no analysis is possible except by analyzing less processed products. It is also possible to work on samples coming from the upstream stages of the process and thus see where the DNA was retained or degraded. DNA trackers make it possible to characterize processes which are gentle and friendly to the selected raw materials. The question of costs is less and less a obstacle because these decrease very quickly. Over the past six years, they have been divided by three thanks to technological advances and market development. We have chosen to invest in a next-generation sequencer (NGS) and we can analyze simultaneously nearly 350 million genetic sequences."
2018 in-cosmetics Global show: major trends,"With 773 suppliers displaying their latest ingredients, the 2018 edition of the event attracted 9,392 unique visitors, 7% more than last year’s show in London. The microbiota was far ahead the subjects most discussed by ingredient suppliers, with research for a better-balanced and enriched microbiota as the main theme. Silab took inspiration from the microbiota of flower nectar to help regulate that of aged skins with Ecobiotys. With Fensebiome, Lipotec stimulates the synthesis of good skin nutrients and increases microbial diversity. With Equilibiome, Seppic focused on two particular stem cells to regulate them. Evonik, Greentech, Phenbiox, and Rahn also offer new data on the microbiota, either to enhance the barrier function, regulate the sebum, or act on complexion radiance. The impact of screens and blue light on the skin is another major concern for cosmetics professionals. Gattefossé specifically characterized screen light, which is mainly composed of three wavelengths (blue, red, green): they developed EnergiNius to fight this additional environmental stress. Solabia, with Blueshield, and Lipotec, with Lumicease, also took interest in the disturbance of opsins triggered by blue light exposure. Sustainable development is still a priority for cosmetics manufacturers, and the co-valorization of other industries’ by-products inspires new product ranges, as can be seen with Biolie, BioNap, Cosun, and Boréaline. In addition, the development of sustainable sourcing is still one of the main concerns, just like the will to make chemical ingredients more and more biodegradable. Seppic launched Sepilife Nude, a polymer functional ingredient with 45% biodegradability in 28 days – another step toward more environmentally friendly products. in-cosmetics is also meant to introduce formulation concepts. Gattefossé targets XYZ generations with three different products: an anti-dark spot cream, a night cream, and a cheekbone stick. As for Seppic, they drew inspiration from research on skincare adapted to physical exercise to create a six-product range. IFF Lucas Meyer went to formulation extremes with products with extreme oil, perfume, and alcohol rates. Next year, the show will be held in Paris on April 2-4, 2019."
Clariant: A botanical answer to the impact of modern life on the skin’s appearance,"Presented during the latest in-cosmetics Global tradeshow in Amsterdam, B-Circadin is a new active skin care ingredient designed to fight the damages caused by disruption to circadian rhythm, frequently altered by stressors in daily life.  According to Clariant Active Ingredients, the new ingredient “maintains the vital synchronization of the skin’s circadian cycle, rapidly improving the complexion while decreasing puffiness and dark circles.” The importance of the circadian rhythm - also coined “24-hour biological clock” - in the regulation of the human body metabolism is now well-know.  According to day and night cycles, it controls our physiological behaviour and metabolism, synthesizes molecules and hormones, and regulates our sleep patterns and appetite. While primarily regulated by the brain, skin cells also possess their own circadian rhythm governing major biological responses which are known to follow this 24-hour clock. Such responses include aquaporin-3, which allows the transportation of water and glycerol involved in the maintenance of epidermal hydration. Skin cells also have an efficient detoxification mechanism called the Nrf2 pathway to eliminate free radicals. It is one of the most important detoxification pathways in the body and is also regulated by the circadian rhythm. When the cells’ circadian rhythm is desynchronized and under too much stress, the detoxification pathway becomes less efficient. According to Clariant, stress, jetlag, shift working hours, intense lifestyles and even exposure to blue light emissions from ubiquitous electronic devices such as laptops, tablets and mobile phones, disrupt the body’s circadian clock, which leads to the deregulation of the skin’s circadian rhythm. Skin shows signs of fatigue and is more prone to aggressions. “B-Circadin is major leap forward in the development of innovative ingredients to protect skin from the stressors of modern living”, explained Alexandre Lapeyre, Global Technical Marketing Manager, Clariant Active Ingredients Business. “With the increasing usage of digital devices showing no signs of abating and the demands of the working environment meaning extended or unusual working hours, we believe B-Circadin will issue a real breakthrough in the treatment of dull, tired skin, improving its overall well-being.” B-Circadin is extracted from the Lespedeza Capitata plant, grown and harvested in South Korea where it is used for its medicinal properties. “Containing two key glycosylated flavonoids directly involved in circadian clock maintenance - carlinoside and isoschaftoside - B-Circadin emulates the ability to resynchronize the circadian cycle within the skin cells, to regulate rhythm-dependent biological functions such as aquaporin-3 and Nrf2 pathway detoxification efficacy,” detailed Clariant in a release. Tested on a skin model exposed to blue light as a stressor to deregulate the circadian rhythm, B-Circadin improved essential biological functions and also “blocked the direct oxidative stress induced by blue light radiating from digital screens.” In two double blind clinical studies, Clariant Active Ingredients studied the impact of a deregulated circadian cycle on skin properties. With volunteers working at night, so having their biological rhythms disrupted, a cream containing 3% B-Circadin was applied to one half of the face and a placebo to the other half, for 28 days. After only a week, volunteers saw their complexion visibly upgraded by over 17% compared to the placebo - and by 4 weeks, upwards of 35%. In another study over a much shorter 4-day period, volunteers applied a cream along with a placebo every day. During this study, they were exposed nightly to the blue light effect from a tablet in order to induce sleep perturbation. After the 4 days, eye contour was noticeably improved and puffiness decreased. A new active that seems perfectly in line with the evolution of lifestyles!"
Wesource targets skin microbiota balance with a burdock extract,"As scientific discoveries highlight the role of the human microbiota (the numerous bacterial, viral, fungal and other communities of microorganisms living in symbiosis with our organism), consumers become increasingly aware of the importance to adopt new skincare habits. Actually, Seppic explains, the skin is the place of delicate and balanced cell-microbe interactions. “Any disturbance of this homeostasis (dysbiosis) may lead to skin disorders such as barrier function disruption or excessive inflammation, increasing skin reactivity and discomfort.” Developed by Wesource - Seppic’s brand dedicated to cosmetic active ingredients - Equibiome is sourced from the core of the roots of Greater Burdock (Arctium lappa) with a non-destructive process using aeroponic culture performed by Plant Advanced Technologies (PAT). Great Burdock has been used for over 3,000 years to improve overall health. Most active compounds present in the roots have been noted for their activity on bacteria and inflammation. Thus, Equibiome offers a unique composition with a higher content of rare root metabolites than usually found in many root extracts. According to Wesource, Equibiome deliver new benefits on skin protection and microbiota equilibrium: – Support of skin-microbiota interactions,
– Control of the microbiota biodiversity,
– Protection of the skin integrity. In vivo tests on volunteers with very dry and/or sensitive skin have shown that Equibiome improves the skin’s tolerance threshold to environmental stresses by reducing both skin redness (-60%) and stinging/burning sensations (-20%) after 14 days vs placebo. For a better and long-lasting skin comfort, Equibiome also promotes skin moisturization (+56%) after 21 days vs placebo. “Inspired by the well-known Great Burdock, we used our active science to develop Equibiome, a sustainable root extract designed to bring comfort to reactive skin by balancing skin microbiota. Wesource commits to deliver active ingredients with science and vibrant stories,” says Céline Blanchard, Product Manager at Seppic. Equibiome is Cosmos approved and China compliant."
Mibelle Biochemistry bets on a moss-derived active to enhance skin cells’ resilience,"Mibelle Biochemistry scooped the gold innovation award for the best active ingredient at in-cosmetics Global for MossCellTec No.1 [1], an active ingredient based on two main innovations: – A novel anti-aging concept, the cell nucleus health.
– A new ingredient source, a biotechnologically produced botanical moss. MossCellTec No 1 is based on the protonema culture of the moss Physcomitrella patens, a common moss in the Northern Hemisphere that can mainly be found in open fields. “Mosses were the first plants to conquer the land about 470 million years ago. They used their extraordinary adaptation abilities to survive from the prehistoric age until today,” explains Mibelle in a release. “Mosses are able to trap excess water and nutrients from the soil, air and rain by acting like a sponge. They are able to tolerate long periods of desiccation where they stop their metabolism. Since mosses filter all of the necessary nutrients from the air and rain they also accumulate air pollution particles such as heavy metals. In order not to poison themselves, mosses have a large set of antioxidants to mitigate the effects of accumulating toxic compounds.” These properties may explain why more that forty species of mosses are used in traditional medicine, in particular for reducing inflammation or the pain linked to insect bites. However, mosses being difficult to collect in a sustainable way in the natural environment, Mibelle has developed a technology that enables the large scale cultivation of moss cells in sterile conditions. Cells from Physcomitrella patens were harvested and cultivated in the protenoma stage (germinating spore). Finally, in order to obtain the MossCellTec No.1 cosmetic ingredient, the resulting extract was carefully sprayed on a powder based on isomalt. The process only requires a small quantity of plant material. According to Mibelle Biochemistry, the active enhances the cell nucleus function to fortify the skin.  Extensive studies showed that MossCellTec No. 1 activates the lamin A gene responsible for the nuclear envelope structure and the nuclear transport gene RanBP17. Both genes are down-regulated in aged keratinocytes. As a consequence, according to Mibelle, “MossCellTec No. 1 supports the skin’s adaptation to climatic stresses in vitro and in vivo.” Furthermore, adds Mibelle, “MossCellTec No.1 strengthens skin against urban aggressors and climatic changes and improves the hydration, barrier and homogeneity of the skin after just two weeks.” This new anti-aging concept based on an innovative and sustainable cell culture seems to perfectly matches current’s demand for powerful natural ingredients. Mintel recently stressed that biotechnologies would become one of the main sources of innovation for sustainable natural ingredients in the cosmetics industry."
Cosmetics composition scanning: an impacting trend!,"The QuelCosmetic application is claimed to help consumers spot undesirable substances in over 6,000 listed cosmetics by scanning the product bar code. Financed by UFC-Que Choisir - a French consumer association - with their endowment fund and through user crowdfunding, this new source of information seems to meet consumer expectations, just like its competitors. “We are living in a society where people question everything, tests, public authorities, and companies. Consumers want trustworthy third parties that can help them really understand formulas and products,” explains Gildas Bonnel, President of responsible communication agency Sidièse. Still, this approach has sparked debate about the objectivity and scientificalness of the information provided. Although they are aware and concerned about the need to give consumers information, FEBEA, the French Federation of Beauty Companies, has pointed out flaws in these applications. “These applications make judgments that are not based on scientific data. It can be disparaging, and above all, it can make consumers believe products are not safe, when they actually are,” explains Anne Dux, Scientific and Regulatory Affairs Director. This point of view is shared by Céline Couteau, PhD in Pharmacy at the Nantes University and author of the blog ‘Regard sur les Cosmétiques’, who endeavours to analyze cosmetic products from a global and scientific standpoint. “We should not let ourselves be destabilized by the noise we can hear here or there. We do our best to guide you and give you a clear idea of the compared interests of such or such cosmetics category,” she explains on her website. To this scientist, the information provided by these applications is not based on any scientific evidence, it does not take into account individual specificities, and above all, it plays on irrational fears. “There is a lack of knowledge on this issue, there is this unreasonable angst about certain ingredients which are completely harmless to us chemists. In addition, what suits certain people does not suit others, and the problem is that the application does not make this distinction. Denigrating conventional cosmetics without evidence is not a good solution. When you try and make people scared, they end up being scared of everything,” she comments. Starting from the principle that ignorance is at the core of all evils and fears, the need to inform consumers to reassure them is the main conclusion to draw from this phenomenon. FEBEA and European authorities have already anticipated it. “We are partly responsible for this,” Anne Dux admits. “The cosmetics industry thought that labelling the product composition before all sectors provided a satisfactory answer to consumers’ need for transparency. But this list is there for products to travel the world, and it can actually contain names likely to leave users puzzled. The industry should take into account this legitimate need for information and meet this expectation differently.” After tests in France, the Federation is now working with Cosmetics Europe, its European counterpart, on systems that can provide consumers with better information using packaging scanning. Launched on a large scale in five European countries, the experimentation consists in dematerializing objective, thorough information on cosmetic product compositions. Although shopping based on test applications still only concerns a small part of the population, the need for reassurance cannot be ignored given the current deconsumerism trend. “No one can estimate to what extent brands are impacted, but what is for sure is that the current climate is favourable to organic products, which definitely partly explains the market contraction,” Anne Dux analyzed. Indeed, according to the latest Kantar Worldpannel study, the beauty hygiene sector is declining in France. Volumes are now in the red, with -1.5%, and there has recently been a reduction in value (-0.9%), although this figure is better than in 2016, due to the price rise (+0.6%). “People buy less, but better, and their choices are more qualitative,” comments Business Development Manager Anaïs Dupuy. This can be partly explained by the search for more natural products, which involves being vigilant as regards the ingredients used, among others. “The decline of beauty hygiene is 78% related to the naturalness target, meaning people search for more natural products and are willing to take action to preserve the environment. They have next to no impulses to buy and pay attention to ingredients,” adds Anaïs Dupuy. Here is another way for consumers to express their need for confidence!"
Lessonia addresses the pro-age trend with a new marine active,"Well-known for its ranges of natural exfoliators, its algae extracts and decorative particles, Lessonia is strengthening its offering of active ingredients by addressing the healthy-aging trend.  At the in-cosmetics Global tradeshow (which was held on 18-19 April 2018 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands), the French company showcased Healthyskin, a cosmetic active ingredient designed to improve the skin’s hydration and barrier function. “We answer to the needs of the cosmetic industry’s big names by offering an active ingredient with metabolic and innovative paths. This active is a concrete and scientific transposition of the health & well-ageing trend as it aims to restore the physiological mechanisms of the skin health,” explains Charles-Henri Morice innovation manager at Lessonia. According to Lessonia, Healthyskin restores healthy epidermal physiological mechanisms for a visibly younger and healthier appearance. A clinical test against placebo showed that the hydration and the barrier function are improved (+16,50 % after 28 days (p<0,001). Healthyskin also boosts all processes essential to proper epidermal reconstruction: differentiation, cornification and desquamation. A clinical test conducted on 20 volunteers shows that 1% Healthyskin improves the skin renewal, that is more than doubled in just 4 days (p<0,01). Eventually, a third clinical test shows that 1% Healthyskin decreases the skin micro-relief, up to - 42,9% after 28 days(p<0,02) thus improving the skin texture. Healthyskin derives from a marine microorganism called Pseudoalteromonas carrageenovora that lives in symbiosis with some gigartina seaweeds. It is involved in the digestion of a polysaccharide by secreting an enzyme called carraghenase. The microorganism synthesizes an important quantity of enzymes thus releasing oligo-carrageenans which activate the defence and the repair system of the seaweed. To develop Healthyskin, Lessonia worked in cooperation with the the marine glycobiology research branch of the CNRS [1], which highlighted this mechanism. The patent pending active is produced in two steps: culture of the micro-organism in a bioreactor to obtain the enzyme, then enzymatic hydrolysis of the marine carrageenan. Healthyskin is the third marine active developed by Lessonia (after Fucowhite, an anti-ageing active ingredient for sensitive skin, and Fucoreverse, an organic certified whitening active ingredient). “Lately, we observe a shift in the conception of the ageing. The time is to the acceptance of our age and of its signs on the skin. Customers do not necessary look for appearing younger anymore, but want to be in harmony with their age. Healthyskin is a scientific translation of this trendy concept. Furthermore, this ‘green’ biotechnology answers to the requirements of cosmetic groups for sustainable development with a new way to manufacture bioactive molecules,” concluded Charles-Henri Morice.

"“Each year, in-cosmetics is awash with new trends, products and innovations and this year is no different,” Roziani Zulkifli","Premium Beauty News - What are some of the 2018 personal care trends that will be explored at in-cosmetics Global in Amsterdam? Roziani Zulkifli - The personal care sector is one of the most dynamic industries in the world, it is constantly changing and evolving. Each year, it is awash with new trends, products and innovations and this year is no different. The big four tends in the industry this year, according to Mintel, are biotechnology in response to environment stressors on skin and hair; definitions of beauty; brands with personality; and customisation driven by digital technology. All of these trends and many more will be explored in detail during the educational programme at in-cosmetics Global 2018. Premium Beauty News - What will the new R&D tours offer participants? Roziani Zulkifli - The R&D tours that are being launched at this year’s show are designed to shine a spotlight on some of the newest ingredients and technologies that will be launching at the exhibition in a quick, convenient and relevant format. The tours will be based on one of two topics - Biotechnology Actives (sponsored by Mibelle Biochemistry) or The Future of Anti-Ageing (sponsored by Novacap). Ms Rouah Al-Wakeel, a prominent technical consultant and cosmetic chemist, will lead the tours, with participants being guided through wireless headphones to hear about relevant ingredients and technologies being launched at the show. Premium Beauty News - The Formulation Challenge will take place at in-cosmetics Global for the first time this year. Roziani Zulkifli - The Formulation Challenge is a fascinating, exciting competition that has run to great success at a number of other in-cosmetics events around the world. It will see cosmetics giants go head-to-head in a bid to create the most innovative formulation from a box of mystery raw materials in just 90 minutes. The resulting products will be judged by a panel of market specialists who will present the winning team with the highly-coveted trophy. Colgate-Palmolive scooped victory at in-cosmetics North America 2017 and we can’t wait to see who will steal the title this April. Premium Beauty News - What are the must-attend educational sessions at this year’s event? Roziani Zulkifli - Every year, in-cosmetics Global offers an extremely thorough and in-depth educational programme that takes place over the three days of the exhibition. The programme will help visitors stay up to date with the latest industry trends and ingredient applications. Our aim is to help them leave the event and return to their day job as the best-informed formulator in the lab, or the most forward-thinking executive in the office. Regarding workshops, the session on the microbiome is definitely not to be missed. This topic continues to inspire discussion following the 2017 Formulation Summit and we are delighted to explore it further at in-cosmetics Global. Additionally, our workshops on natural ingredients (Beyond natural - New frontiers in green formulation) and sun protection (Suncare protection - The skin and the electromagnetic spectrum) are proving extremely popular. For those interested specifically in industry trends, the Marketing Trends Theatre is a must-attend. With more than 100 hours of free content, the sessions – led by some of the sector’s best-known beauty experts – will share facts, figures, market analysis and research data, as well as the latest regulatory changes in personal care manufacturing. Premium Beauty News - What are some of the key suppliers that cosmetics professionals should see first-hand? Roziani Zulkifli - There are several not to be missed suppliers at the show this year. Clarion will be showcasing their revolutions in haircare, specifically conditioning ingredients and innovative active ingredient, whilst Cargill Beauty will bring its range of natural derivatives and sustainable ingredients. This year there will also be a Peru pavilion at the show, with 8 local companies showcasing their innovations over the three days. Premium Beauty News - What, in your opinion, are the top three reasons to visit in-cosmetics Global? Roziani Zulkifli - In addition to the exciting new additions to the show, there are many other features that are exceptionally popular with visitors and draw in the crowds year after year. Particular highlights for me include the Innovation Zone, which is an area of the show dedicated to showcasing more than 100 state-of-the-art concepts. It enables time-poor R&D scouts to find the latest ingredients all in one place, mitigating the need to scour the show floor. Mintel will also host a series of live demonstrations, presenting market-leading finished products alongside key insights into the trends that inspired them. I would also highly recommend the Make-Up and Sensory Bars as well as the Sustainability Corner as must-visit areas of the show. The Make-Up Bar will demonstrate the latest innovations in pigments and technology, with visitors able to touch and experiment with the ingredients on display. Meanwhile, the Sensory Bar is aimed at product developers, formulation experts and marketing professionals, and gives them the opportunity to experience unusual textures and sensations first-hand, including transforming and hybrid textures; heating and cooling jellies, butters and powders in the ‘try-out’ area. Textural effects remain a key focus for manufacturers and that will be reflected at the event. Finally, with environmentally-friendly practices currently extremely high on the cosmetic industry’s agenda, it would be remiss of me not to mention the ever-popular Sustainability Corner. This area of the show is dedicated to environmental and social initiatives, as well as highlighting how the beauty industry is moving beyond compliance and paving the way towards a more sustainable business model. Cosmetic ingredients 2018 in-cosmetics Global is taking place at RAI Amsterdam from 17-19 April 2018.  On this occasion, Premium Beauty News has published a special issue on Cosmetic Ingredients and the ""ageing well"" & ""pro age"" trends that are shaking the beauty industry.

BASF: The 4 elements of personal care,"“Today’s health-conscious and responsible-minded consumers want cosmetics that support their lifestyle and sense of wellbeing. Demand for sustainably sourced products that help protect and beautify skin and hair is increasing steadily.”
 
Dirk Mampe, Vice President Business Management Personal Care Specialties Europe, BASF. We see huge potential for products that support natural beauty from within and a healthy sense of self-esteem. To serve the personal care industry in addressing these needs, BASF delivers solutions that perform in the four Personal Care Elements: Protect, Cleanse, Beautify, Maintain. Protect: Considering that protection is a basic human need, it’s not surprising that stressful urban lifestyles are driving demand for products with protective functions. People want protection from pollutants, the sun’s rays and irritants. Demand is also growing for skin- and hair-care products with trustworthy protective performance. Cleanse: Hygiene is another basic human need, and cleansing products with mild, natural ingredients have a special consumer appeal. People want solutions that gently cleanse and replenish the skin and hair. Beautify: When we talk about beautifying, we want to define it as more than just outward appearance. Cosmetics and beauty treatments that enhance the individual’s natural good looks and provide a beautiful sensory experience open up new dimensions. Especially sought after are solutions that enhance natural beauty and support self-esteem. Maintain: Personal care products that help maintain healthy skin and hair also provide a sense of nurturing. Products that moisturize and nourish the skin and hair fulfill this need.  Fast-paced modern lifestyles leave consumers stressed and seeking comfort, making solutions with pleasing and pampering sensory profiles especially appealing. The four Personal Care Elements are not only the theme of the BASF booth (E40) at in-cosmetics, but also the topic of special events and exhibits during the tradeshow. The Innovation Zone (booth E60) invites visitors to explore new launches and draw inspiration for their formulations. Here, more than 100 products are showcased, including the anti-aging active ingredient for hair, DN-Age®. At the Formulation Lab®, BASF offers hands-on interactive training for R&D laboratory staff. In a special training session, experts demonstrate how to formulate a gentle shampoo with excellent foaming properties and wet and dry conditioning qualities. The formulation highlighted uses mild alternative surfactants and a natural conditioning polymer combined with a conditioning booster, a synergistic thickener and an APG®-based pearlescent concentrate. BASF is also hosting two technical seminars, one focusing on our new galenic-based skincare solution and another looking at the UV filter solution Tinosorb® S Lite Aqua. The first topic is especially relevant due to the effects of pollution on skin health. The galenic-based solution helps reduce the adhesion of particulate matter, creating a first line of defense. The second seminar offers insights into the advantages of the UV filter Tinosorb® S Lite Aqua, a solution based on a unique water-encapsulating technology that brings broad-band UV protection to the water phase. The responsible lifestyle trend continues to influence the personal care market, driving consumers demand for natural cosmetic brands. BASF focuses on increasing sustainability and providing solutions to serve this growing market. The approach is reflected in the Palm Dialog, which BASF is hosting for the third time. The panel discussion offers personal care ingredients suppliers, cosmetic manufacturers, retailers and NGOs a platform to discuss recent developments in the palm-based oleo-chemical industry."
Seppic and Ecovia Renewables partner to create and market biopolymers,"Seppic, a subsidiary of Air Liquide Healthcare specialising in the development and marketing of specialty ingredients for health and beauty, is partnering with Ecovia Renewables, a US company focusing on the research and development of high-performing biobased chemicals.  In practice, the two companies have signed a joint development agreement and Seppic has taken an equity stake in Ecovia Renewables. The aim of this partnership is to develop and market high-performance and environmental-friendly ingredients to manufacturers of beauty and healthcare products. “Due to growing environmental awareness and increasing focus on health and wellness, consumers are looking more and more for natural and sustainable products,” says the company in a release. Ecovia Renewables has developed a ground-breaking platform technology to produce biobased ingredients through a proprietary fermentation process using renewable biomass.

Eventually, XYLISHINE adds hydrating properties to the product: this botanical inspired active ingredient is made of an association of natural sugars derived mainly from wood and the brown algae Pelvetia canaliculata. This minimalist formula offers a high naturality content and a good biodegradability. It is produced at room temperature and is easily sprayable"
Beraca to launch natural alternative to silicones,"Recognized globally as a leading supplier of raw materials sourced from the Brazilian biodiversity Beraca will launch the Tucumã Butter, “a 100% natural, clean and efficient alternative to silicones in skin care formulations.” What sets this ingredient apart from others on the market is that it is non-hydrogenated (and therefore free of harmful compounds, according to Beraca) and highly stable. The Tucumã Butter is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and has a unique skin feel, providing good spreadability, light texture and a dry, non-oily feel. “The Tucumã Butter is in line with Beraca’s vision to develop active ingredients suitable for plant-based formulations and to replace chemical compounds with natural and sustainable solutions,” says Juliana Checon, P&D Manager at Beraca. The efficacy of this active ingredient has been proven by independent laboratory tests. In addition to the cosmetic benefits of the Tucumã Butter, Beraca also highlights the socio-environmental aspect of its manufacturing process. The collection of the tucumã fruit provides an extra source of income for more than 90 families and directly impacts the lives of approximately 600 people. The sustainable sourcing of tucumã is part of Beraca’s Socio-Biodiversity Enhancement Program, created in 2000 to serve as a bridge between farming communities spread across Brazil and some of the world’s leading beauty brands. “This project enables Beraca to connect the Brazilian biodiversity to thousands of customers through a relationship of transparency, full traceability and innovation,” says Beraca’s Marketing Manager, Marianna Cyrillo. At the next in-cosmetics tradeshow, Beraca will also launch Capilus PRO 22, a new hair conditioning agent developed in partnership with Clariant. Capillus PRO 22 is a secondary surfactant designed to restructure the hair fibre, seal the hair cuticle and control hair volume. The ingredient smoothens the hair surface, reduces hair porosity and protects the hair against external aggressors as well as increasing hair shine in over 100%, according to laboratory tests. The ingredient is obtained from the junction of a non-ionic surfactant (that carries a cationic charge in acid environment and whose pH is suitable for hair care formulations) and of the natural oil of pracaxi (whose main active component is the behenic acid, a natural hair conditioning agent). “Capillus PRO 22 is the first amido-amine created from the pracaxi oil to suit the market needs. It has a fully traceable production chain and fosters the social and economic development of the local communities involved in its production,” says Checon."
Greentech announces the launch of its new active for problem skin,"Beyond the imbalances of adolescence, adult skins suffer more and more from these imperfections. Indeed, acne affects up to 85% of 12-24 year olds and 12% of women and 8% of men over 25 years. The shape, appearance and location of acne can be different: presence of more pronounced inflammatory lesions more on the upper face or back for men and in the lower face for women. Depending on the intensity and severity of the pathology, the person can be touched and impacted psychologically. This pathology is aggravated by various factors: the hormonal environment, but also stress, sun, nutrition (rich in carbohydrates in particular), or pollution. Acne is an inflammatory disease of the pilo-sebaceous follicle. Four associated factors are responsible: – Hyperseborrhea (which corresponds to an overproduction of sebum resulting from hormonal activity) and dysseborrhea (qualitative alteration of sebum, modification of its composition and in particular oxidation of squalene which then becomes acnegenic and comedogenic)
– Increased microbial proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes (now named Cutibacterium acnes)
– Hyperkeratinization (excessive multiplication of the cells of the follicular canal wall which causes a plug, prevents sebum from evacuating and leads to the formation of comedones)
– Inflammation and associated hyperpigmentation In addition, these components are linked. In fact, oxidized sebum constitutes an ideal nutrient medium for certain bacteria and in particular P. acnes causing its multiplication. However, P. acnes itself has deleterious effects inducing overproduction of sebum, hyperkeratinization and inflammation. Thus the acne phenomenon behaves like a vicious circle, each component increasing the other one. Pioneer in plant biotechnology, Greentech has drawn on its knowledge in terms of botany, plant molecules and skin biology to develop its new active.
Resulting from a wide screening of plants, selected from the literature, on the different components of acne, ACNILYS® was born. Extracted from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa berries, it contains different molecules of interest. Acnilys® has been tested in vitro thanks to innovative tests. An in vivo study completed the results and showed the effectiveness of our new active from 28 days. Discover the incredible effects of Acnilys® on the different components of acne at in-cosmetics, booth A10."
Seppic brings together its range of active ingredients under one single brand: Wesource,"The brand’s mission is to embody the richness and diversity of Seppic’s natural cosmetic actives.

Givaudan strengthens research efforts on skin microbiome,"Givaudan continues to invest in its Active Beauty business unit and its metagenomics platform to boost its pioneering position in the microbiome market. Givaudan, which claims to be the only fragrance company with in-house microbiome research capabilities, says these new strategic investments will help the company to remain one of the leaders in the development of new actives focusing on the skin microbiome. The company recently equipped its Applied Microbiomics Centre of Excellence in Toulouse, France, with a state-of-the-art automation equipment allowing high throughput screenings (HTS).  This should accelerate the development of more disruptive solutions to activate, protect or balance the skin microbiota. ""Our astonishing advancements in microbiomics allow us to bring ground-breaking cosmetic concepts to new and existing customers. As the microbiome trend continues to grow, our teams will be at the forefront of this exciting area of scientific research,"" said Laurent Bourdeau, Head of Active Beauty. Givaudan’s first discoveries in this field - such as microbiome activated’ ingredients as well as ’microbiome protecting’ agents - have resulted in the development of two award-winning active cosmetic ingredients, Brightenyl and Revivyl. Brightenyl, the first microbiome activated skin brightener, won a Gold and Bronze Innovation Award in 2015 at in-cosmetics Global and in-cosmetics Latin America, respectively. The first holistic skin renewal accelerator, Revivyl, won Gold for Best Innovation Award at in-cosmetics Latin America and in-cosmetics Asia in 2017. ""It’s incredibly fascinating for a fragrance house to lead the creation of new active cosmetic ingredients in microbiomics. I’m very proud of the team in our Applied Microbiomics Centre of Excellence which is constantly pioneering the ingredients of tomorrow. This also includes our teams around the world working alongside our customers to create inventive new products for their markets,"" concluded Maurizio Volpi, President of Givaudan’s Fragrance Division."
"Microbiota, this infinitely small protector, for our health and beauty…","A taboo is being defeated: the one that states bacteria is our enemy, these invaders that occupy our body and our skin weakening them and causing much damage. Thus, thanks to gradual popularization, which started in the worlds of health, food supplements and functional foods, the cosmetics industry has logically found itself at the crossroads due to a cross-sector approach. It is now a matter of an individualized, microbial balance, useful for our protection and our well-being. Thus the notion of cutaneous ecology takes on its full meaning by applying it to the world of the infinitely small, that of the microorganisms forming the Stratum microbium or cutaneous microbiota. In the case of a ""skin-microbiota"" imbalance, much skin damage and even more severe disturbances may appear and the factors of aggression are unfortunately lacking in the hygienics society in which we live. It is now recognized that ""too much hygiene kills hygiene"" and from that we need to understand that it is not necessary to wash too frequently or to use harsh products because in close proximity to us, there are unwanted microorganisms, ready to take the place of the microbiota and destabilize it. Cutaneous Microbiota cannot be defined in a specific way and generalized for all individuals. We have our own microbiotic identity card that has developed over time.  Microbiota forms a true interactive ecological community, a balanced ecosystem that is essential to maintain or restore, but which is very complex. Indeed, since the launch of the National Institute of Health’s ""Human Microbiome Project"" (HMP) in 2007, the researchers were able to observe great topographic variations of human microbiota [1] as well as great differences according to each individual [2]. When you become aware that each cm2 of skin contains 1 million microorganisms with hundreds of specific species, you can measure the importance of this ecosystem better. Bacteria can be commensal when living in contact with a host’s cutaneous-mucus membrane surface without causing damage. An equilibrium is then established between the individual and the various commensal flora of the skin and mucous membranes, depending on age, diet and living conditions, but this equilibrium is constantly threatened by the physical or chemical attacks they are subjected to (pollution, temperature, UV rays, intensive use of surfactants, antibiotics, stress, etc ).  Commensal or resident bacteria are considered beneficial in the common discourse delivered to consumers. Facing them are transient, undesirable and/or pathogenic bacteria. These notions are much more sensitive insofar as the same bacteria may or may not be associated with undesirable effects. This will depend on the individual as well, in addition to the stability of his or her microbiota. Opportunistic bacteria, another way of characterizing them, can become harmful or induce disorders when the host’s defenses are weakened. They await the opportunity to come and settle on the cutaneous area. The skin can also contain pathogenic bacteria, for example Staphylococcus aureus, which is part of their commensal flora without developing damage; it is worth noting that according to the Institut Pasteur, 30 to 50% of the population is healthy and that the breakdown of the skin barrier (in the case of an injury for example) can induce a pathogenic effect.  Other examples: What is the status of Propionibacterium acnes and that of Corynebacterium xerosis, bacteria that are involved respectively in problems of oily skin or the development of bad odors? These microorganisms are not considered to be pathogenic per se, but their harmful action or the unpleasant problems they cause are related to the composition of the microbiota that surrounds them, but it also depends on skin function and its intrinsic imbalances.  Last but not least, Staphylococcus epidermidis, which you often hear about in cosmetics: depending on the case, it can induce significant skin infections and is found in acne prone skin [3], while a study in 2015 by a Japanese team demonstrated its benefits on maintaining hydration [4]. We are only at the beginning of the investigations and many questions remain to be clarified before penetrating all the mysteries of microbiota and better understanding how it acts on the cutaneous ecosystem. In addition to the microbiota that blocks the development of opportunistic bacteria, the skin has other defense mechanisms, in particular its physical, chemical and biological barriers (Fig 1). When this barrier is impaired or broken, leading to the entry of opportunistic microbial agents, the skin uses various biological defense mechanisms. Its innate immune system induces responses such as phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages or the induction, in particular by the keratinocytes, of the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides ( [5], [6]) or AMP (the β-defensins, in particular hBD2 & hBD3, cathelicidins LL37) in addition to constitutive AMP peptides (Rnase 7, psoriasin, lactoferrin, dermcidin). Important points: pathogenic bacteria do not seem to be able to develop resistance to these AMPs. These peptides act, for example, by breaking the membrane of the targeted microorganisms or by penetrating the microbial cell to interfere with its intracellular functions. Convinced of the interactions between the body and microorganisms, Solabia became interested in skin flora and maintaining its balance on the surface of the skin almost 20 years ago. Specialized in enzymatic biocatalysis, Solabia thus developed an original method consisting first of all in producing a specific enzyme by fermentation (Glucosyl-transferase) and then in activating the latter on substrates of plant origin in order to obtain prebiotics. – Maintaining the integrity of the microbiota or promoting its development. Prebiotics are oligosaccharides having bioselectivity with respect to the microbiota. In the present case, these are gluco-oligosaccharides (Fig. 2, Bioecolia®) acting as selective substrates to promote the development of the microbiota to the detriment of that of opportunistic or undesirable microorganisms associated with skin disorders (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylooccus aureus, Corynebacterium xerosis, Malassezia furfur, Gardnarella vaginalis, Candida albicans, etc.). The selectivity of Bioecolia® is linked to the presence of specific bonds of types α-(1-6) and α-(1-2) between the constituent glucose units, metabolizable more quickly and efficiently by the commensal resident flora, which by competitive inhibition, is reinforced or develops better on the cutaneous surface than the opportunistic flora. A signature active ingredient of the Solabia Group, Bioecolia® is the guarantor of a sustainable ecology and is formulated in many skin care, hair care and personal and intimate hygiene products. – Stimulating the synthesis of antimicrobial defense mechanisms. With consumer interest in probiotics, better known than prebiotics, Solabia has continued its research and developed a symbiotic active ingredient, combining two prebiotics and two probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei) but in an inactivated form to obtain Ecoskin®. In addition to the ability of the complex to interact on microbiota bioselectivity, the gluco-oligosaccharides and fructo-oligosaccharides (obtained after pressing the yacón tubers, Polymnia sonchifolia), have demonstrated stimulatory properties of the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides (Fig. 3) of type β-defensin 2 and β-defensin 3 (+71% vs. placebo). The presence of lactobacilli also enhances the immune protection of the skin. Evaluated against placebo, on a panel of volunteers with very dry skin, Ecoskin® enhances the skin’s radiance by reducing the average depth of the micro-furrows, restructuring the skin via its microdepression network, while nourishing it and reducing feelings of discomfort. Thus brighter, the skin can display an ecologically controlled ""happy-look"". – Acting against microbial adhesion. The colonization of the cutaneous area but also of the mucous membranes uses adhesion factors associated with specialized structures present on the surface of the bacteria with the ability to bind to specific receptors of the skin cells. Fighting against the microbial adhesion of opportunistic bacteria is an additional means of defense to limit the proliferation of undesirable or even pathogenic bacteria, and to maintain the cutaneous microbiota. The adhesion factors are different according to the bacteria. Among them, the bacterial lectins, glycoproteins found on the surface of bacteria and capable of binding to receptors of epidermal cell membranes. Moreover, the adhesion process can also come from the lectins of the epidermal cells having a specific affinity for sugars, the latter then being on the surface of the bacteria and at the origin of the formation of biofilms [7]. It was from this observation that Solabia Research, specialized in Glycobiology, developed a polysaccharide, Teflose®, with a high concentration of rhamnose (Fig. 4), a sugar having specific affinity for epidermal cell receptors. This molecule then plays the role of a coating on the surface of the skin to limit the adhesion of opportunistic bacteria, like an anti-microbial shield, and reduce the resulting reaction of discomfort. Tested on reconstructed epidermis after topical application, Teflose® confirmed its affinity for the skin by decreasing the adhesion of Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Other studies, undergoing more in-depth study, have also emphasized its ability to reduce the biofilm formed by certain bacteria. But the rhamnose composition of Teflose® is not limited to anti-microbial adhesion; in fact, with 60% of this rare sugar, the polysaccharide also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties by regulating the release of specific mediators, in particular bacterial attacks (e.g.: Interleukin-8).  Ubiquitous by its applications (soothing care, deodorants, care of sensitive skin / atopic dermatitis, care of oily skin, personal hygiene, etc.), Teflose® can also be combined with prebiotics, the latter promoting maintenance of the microbiota while this anti-adhesion shield prevents the establishment of opportunist bacteria on the skin, and even more so if the skin’s ecosystem is weakened. Since the start of the HMP project in 2007, many discoveries have been made regarding the role of the human microbiota. While only yesterday microorganisms were perceived negatively because they were considered as the cause of many diseases, today mentalities have changed and the evolution of knowledge has led us to consider the microbiota as one of our sentinels commanded by the skin’s defense system. Many promising avenues remain to be explored, and will undoubtedly change our approach to the skin and the ingredients we use to provide protection and well-being to it."
BASF tackles the signs of skin and hair aging,"“Consumers are leading ever-busier lives. As the pace of life remains fast, products that calm, sooth and rejuvenate the skin are in high demand,” explains BASF in a release. Inspired by the vogue of yoga and meditation and by the natural trend, the designer and manufacturer of ingredients for personal care and hygiene products therefore has developed a series of new active ingredients for skin and hair care products aiming at strengthen them to cope with everyday stresses. In a BASF survey of 100 volunteers, 90 percent reported that stress had a negative effect on their skin, causing it to turn dull and dry. According to the company, “daily stresses are known to translate into cutaneous stress, with cortisol as its main mediator.” As an anti-stress ingredient, Hyalurosmooth mimics the benefits of a mindful way of life. Hyalurosmooth represses the cortisol’s damaging impact on skin, restoring collagen type I and hyaluronic acid that are affected. “Bringing the positive effect of a mindful lifestyle - rested from the inside - Hyalurosmooth helps the skin recover its hydration and radiance”, claims BASF. Extracted from the Indian Cassia angustifolia, Hyalurosmooth is IECIC [1] listed. As it ages, the skin loses its firmness and begins to sag, causing the face to lose its youthful contours. Based on the latest findings of BASF’s epigenetics platform, the new active RNAge rebalances Let-7b - the microRNA that downregulates the production of proteins which are key to building dermal architecture. “In doing so, the active helps the dermis to stay dense, rebuilding it from deep within and finally firming facial shape,” states the company. Extracted from sea buckthorn, RNAge is COSMOS approved and IECIC listed. The third anti-aging active showcased by BASF at Cosmetagora, DN-Age slows down the hair greying process and reduces hair loss. “The active ingredient acts on the scalp by preventing UV induced DNA damage. As assessed by in-vitro tests, it also protects hair follicle cells to prevent hair greying and hair ageing. DN-Age leads to greater hair density: 80 percent of panellists perceived their hair to be stronger, fuller, and thicker,” claims BASF. Extracted from Cassia alata leaves and titrated in flavonoids, DN-Age is also COSMOS approved and IECIC listed. DN-Age is available as a concentrated powder and a hydro-glycerin solution. "
Naturex to unveil new efficacy results and new actives at Cosmetagora 2018,"Naturex continues innovating with new ingredients inspired by food and beverage products and new efficacy results to be presented at the next edition of the Cosmetagora tradeshow in Paris. Awarded last year at the in-cosmetics tradeshow in London, Eliorelys is a cherry blossom active produced through Naturex’s Eutectys technology and designed to delivers effective protection against damage caused by ‘blue light’ from mobile phones, tablets and computers. In a comet assay conducted by the Group, Naturex found that human keratinocytes incubated with Eliorelys demonstrated a significant decrease in DNA damage (up to 75%) compared with cells that had not been treated. The results indicate that Eliorelys exerts a protective effect against blue light-induced DNA lesions. The full findings are to be unveiled at the Cosmetagora trade show. “Recently published studies, confirmed by Naturex’s own internal testing, have concluded that blue light can in fact lead to damage in cultured human keratinocytes and live skin, causing levels of skin ageing similar to that triggered by UVA radiation. On average, people spend five hours a day in front of a screen, and 90% of 20-65 years olds use electronic devices every day. This means there is a risk that blue light pollution could cause skin damage on a widespread scale,” highlights Naturex. Also set for launch at Cosmetagora is Fortify - the fourth and final part of Naturex’s Beautyfood collection of natural skin care solutions made with ingredients derived from plants found in the food chain. The new range comprises five nutrient-rich ingredients inspired by food and beverage products: ginseng, oat, bamboo, nettle and ginger. All are renowned for their ability to deliver regeneration and stimulation benefits. The Fortify collection’s ingredients are produced and supplied in accordance with Naturex’s standards of traceability and transparency. Fortify Ginseng, for example, is grown on small and medium sized farms in northeast China using sustainable agricultural practices that place a high priority on preserving the land and the environment. Working in collaboration with Naturex, ginseng farmers in the region implement an on-going program of environmental stewardship, under which biodiversity is encouraged, weeding is conducted manually to minimize pesticide use, and trees are planted to offset carbon emissions. “Our approach at Cosmetagora will be to unlock nature’s beauty secrets and showcase some of the most exciting natural actives available today. Consumers love to be inspired by innovative beauty products that deliver effective benefits. In tune with this, both Eliorelys™ and the new Fortify range deliver high performance and a wow-factor that shoppers will love,” said Stéphanie Puel, Personal Care Director for Naturex."
French study demonstrates the skin whitening properties of the dyer’s weed,"After having dried and collected the leaves and seeds of Reseda luteola L. to extract dying agents, the researchers have used various methods to isolate individual molecules to test their effect on the inhibition of tyrosinase, the most commonly method used to lower the level of melanogenesis. A bioguided purification procedure employing centrifugal partition chromatography, Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was developed to isolate and identify the whitening agents (i.e., luteolin and apigenin) from aerial parts of Reseda luteola.  The procedure also enabled the characterization of acetylated luteolin- and apigenin-O-glycosides, which occurrence is reported for the first time in Reseda luteola. The in vitro biological tests carried out made it possible to highlight the promising whitening activity of Reseda luteola L. extract, and to isolate the flavones responsible for this mechanism.  Collected data show that, beyond its traditional use as a dyestuff, Reseda luteola is potentially of great interest in the development of a natural whitening ingredient in cosmetic, cosmeceuticals, and eventually pharmaceutical products, once its safety and tolerability are assessed. Used to treat various skin pigmentation disorders, or simply to obtain a lighter skin tone, skin whitening agents occupy an important part of the global dermo-cosmetic market nowadays.  These active agents may act at various levels of melanogenesis, however tyrosinase inhibitors are currently the most commonly used. Due to the current boom of the natural beauty market, exploring new botanical sources of whitening products appears crucial nowadays, in particular given the fact that ancient skin whitening ingredients - such as hydroquinone, retinoic acids, corticoids, or mercury salts - are of safety concern as they display several severe side effects, resulting in their interdiction or restricted use under the European Cosmetic Regulation 1223/2009 and several other international regulations."
"Polyphenols extracted from berry seeds can have a selected antimicrobial effect, finds Finnish research centre","When manufacturing fruit juice, the food industry produces large amounts of press cakes [1] containing a range of useful compounds for the skin, such as polyphenols known for their antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Until now, the industry has largely confined itself to extracting seed oil from press cakes. Despite the potential for new product concepts, no other high-value-added products are currently made from these press cakes.  This is why VTT has been searching the best way to extract actives from fruit by-products, and more particularly from Nordic berry seeds. Actually, VTT has developed various methods to extract and enrich these actives. For berries with large seeds and various fruits, a specific sanding method can be used.  For example, 20% of a cloudberry seed’s weight can be sanded using this method to recover the husk. “One kilogramme of berries yields 10 grammes of seed husk fractions, but a small amount suffices for cosmetics products,” explains the centre. Then, active substances from seed husk fractions are extracted using the so-called hydrothermal extraction technology.  “The whole process is free from no toxic agents or solvents,” claims VTT. The final product tends to be light-coloured, powdery, water-soluble, food-grade fractions. After sanding, seed oil can be extracted from the remaining seeds.  VTT has optimised and patented the process for a variety of berry seeds. As far as small-seed berries such as blueberries are concerned, their useful compounds can be extracted using a wet milling method developed by VTT. One of the most interesting properties of the substances extracted from the husks of berry seeds is their ability to prevent the growth of harmful microbes.  Indeed, research conducted by VTT show the new actives may have selected effects on the numerous microbes inhabiting the human skin. “Berry seed husks contain large amounts of antimicrobial compounds which can help to maintain a natural microbial balance in the skin, by suppressing the growth of harmful microbes while beneficial ones flourish. This is based on nature’s way of protecting seeds from threats such as fungi,"" explains Riitta Puupponen-Pimiä, Principal Scientist at VTT. ""We have investigated how the microbes typically found in human skin and those that hide in cosmetic products react to polyphenols contained in berries. At a general level, you could say that seed husk fractions and the resulting extracts prevent harmful microbial growth in the skin, but do not suppress the growth of good microbes,"" she adds. These findings could be of high interest for the cosmetics industry which is looking for natural alternatives to synthetic preservatives as well as for innovative methods to protect the skin’s microbiota. ""The maintenance of healthy skin and the replacement of synthetic preservatives by natural compounds is one of the major trends in the cosmetics market,” confirms Riitta Puupponen-Pimiä. VTT investigated the properties of a large array of Finnish and Nordic berries and found cloudberries and Arctic brambles to produce the most efficient seed fraction extracts to inhibit the growth of harmful microbes.  These berries, which belong to the Rubus genus, contain high levels of polyphenols called ellagitannins, which are known for their anti-microbial effects. Extract from sea buckthorn seed fractions has also proven effective. Sea buckthorn seed husks are also rich in polyphenols known as procyanidins, a kind of tannin. VTT’s research has shown that, in addition to polyphenols, seed press cakes contain many other health-promoting compounds making them a very interesting and sustainable source of active ingredients for the food and cosmetic markets.  “Most of the thousands of kilogrammes of seed cake produced could be used for purposes other than feed,” concludes the research centre."
in-cosmetics Latin America to offer a new array of experiential marketing initiatives,"A brand-new Make-Up Bar will join the event’s range of interactive areas, alongside the popular Formulation Lab, Innovation Zone and Sensory Bar.

Capsum: A new interpretation of cosmetic oil,"Over the past few years, oil made a comeback on centre stage and progressively entered various segments (face care, body care, hair care, nail care...) to provide a large area of benefits (massage, nutrition, slimming, cleanser…). To reinvent this millennial product, Capsum has combined its different microfluidic technologies: ReoBulle (oil droplets with a light gel consistency), SoftDrop (invisible microcapsules stabilized without surfactants that allow to create non-greasy and non-sticky oils), NeoPearl (capsules of 2 or 4 mm in diameter, with and oil core protected under a fine alginate membrane). To illustrate the potential of these technologies, the young Marseille-headquartered company showcased five new formulations based on hibiscus oil last week in its show-room in Paris: – Huile fraîche infusion (oil in serum),
– Huile fraîche extrait (oil in bubbles),
– Huile fraîche gelée (oil in gel),
– Huile fraîche concentré (oil in Pearls),
– et Huile fraîche baume (oil in cream). “By showcasing oil through unexpected shapes, microfluidic technologiess reinvent its sensory,” explains Capsum in a release.  According to the company, these new textures will help to challenge common beliefs about oils. For instance, the encapsulation of oil into hundreds of pearls or thousands of droplets allows keeping it “trapped” until the moment of application for a drop-by-drop release on skin, thus avoiding the mass effect responsible for oil’s greasy reputation. Capsum’s Huile Fraîche collection also demonstrates that oils can be both elegant and sophisticated."
Perfumes: Symrise innovates with a lily of the valley note from sustainable sources,"While lily of the valley can be cultivated easily, its delicate flowers offer too low yields and their scents are very difficult to capture efficiently, either through steam distillation or volatile solvent extraction. For fragrance house, the only solution for providing this fresh and delicate scent is to recreate it using synthetic ingredients. Unfortunately, for the lovers of fresh floral fragrances, the existing synthetic molecules - such as Lyral [1] or Lillial [2] - have been dropped out due to public health concerns. In recent years, perfume houses have therefore invested heavily to find alternatives to these substances. In such a context, Symrise hits hard with the launch of Lilybelle, a molecule offering fresh, green and wet notes and very close to the scent of the lily of the valley flower.  The new molecule also stands out from the mass with its responsible and sustainable sourcing based on the re-use of D-limonene derived from orange peels and other by-products of the fruit juice industry. In order to produce Lilybelle, Symrise has designed and developed a synthetic process that complies with the twelve principles of green chemistry, including the use of catalysts at each stage of the process, the recovery and recycling of solvents within the manufacturing process, and the restriction of waste production. Furthermore, states Symrise, environmental decomposition studies have shown that the Lilybelle molecule is biodegradable. According to David Apel, Senior Perfumer at Symrise, ""Lilybelle is a molecule with an extremely fresh, green and wet smell.  A touch of aldehydes raises its luxuriant floral touch, thus capturing the sparkling freshness of spring."" In a context marked by the increasing use of floral notes in male fragrances, David Apel considers that Lilybelle opens new opportunities to create innovative male fragrances and is an ""incredible source of inspiration""."
Seppic: A natural active ingredient for acne-prone skins,"An estimated 80 percent of all people between the ages of 11 and 30 have acne outbreaks at some point in their lives [1].  Despite the strong demand for natural solutions, there are hardly any effective responses to date. Based on new studies showing that an increased cutaneous and systemic oxidative stress is often involved [2] as a cause of acne, searchers from Serdex, a subsidiary of Seppic since January 2017, have screened various molecules from the Malagasy flora, a biodiversity reservoir that the company has been studying for several years. As a result of this research, Serdex has developed Subligana, a titrated extract of Harungana madagascariensis, a tree originated from the centre and East of Madagascar and renowned for its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant benefits. Subligana was especially designed to address skins with imperfections and spots and for those looking for a flawless complexion.  “On the basis of scientific results, we have developed an original mechanism of action focusing on soothing and anti-oxidant effect to address acne-prone skins,” explains Virginie Anchartéchahar, R&D Manager for Serdex. Also known as the dragon’s blood tree, orange-milk tree or haronga, Harungana madagascariensis is traditionally used in Madagascar and in the numerous African countries where it was introduced for its medicinal properties.  Leaf decoctions are used against asthma and skin disorders and leaf juice is used for wound healing. Subligana mechanism of action combines soothing effect (lipase inhibition, IL-10 and IL-12 regulation), antioxidant effect (protection against lipid peroxidation) and efficacy against Propionibacterium acnes. An in-use test on teenagers presenting acne-prone skin showed a significant whiteheads reduction versus placebo after 28 days. In line with Serdex previous actions in Madagascar, the entire supply chain has been sustainably designed.  Harungana madagascariensis leaves are collected under good collecting practices in the high plateaus area in Madagascar to ensure a repeatable and reliable phytochemical composition. Furthermore, Serdex has implemented a fair and equitable sharing of benefits under Nagoya Protocol. Eventually, Subligana is listed in the Inventory of Existing Cosmetic Ingredients in China (IECIC) and is compliant to the Cosmos standard for natural and organic cosmetics."
Naturex expands its portfolio of cosmetic active ingredients,"In order to add a hair care active to its Eutectys range of botanical extracts, Naturex turned to Tillandsia, a plant also known as Angel’s Hair that grows on other plants, often taking root on the limbs of trees, creating large structures that hang from the branches. It obtains moisture from run-off water that falls onto its stems and leaves. This is subsequently stored in its plump tissues, where it stays until required during dry periods. Naturex has harnessed these properties to benefit human hair in the form of a new active - Tillandsia Eutectys - which has been proven to enhance hair suppleness, increasing its manageability by reducing friction and making it easier to comb. Like every other ingredient in the Eutectys collection, this new active is produced using Eutectigenesis, a patented extraction process that involves Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents (NaDES). Furthermore, Naturex has released the results of two double-blind clinical trials involving its Cherry Blossom Eutectys active, which has been rebranded as Eliorelys.  The ingredient, was shown in the studies to improve significantly the appearance of the skin of subjects aged 40-50 and 51-60 years old who were already showing signs of photo-ageing. According to Naturex, tests have also demonstrated that the topical application of Eliorelys delivers skin repair benefits, too, with levels of carbonylated proteins and MDA (markers of lipids oxidation) significantly reduced versus a placebo. The researchers observed a reduction in photo-induced skin damage after 28 days of applying a cosmetic formulation containing Eliorelys, while skin texture was also improved after 56 days. Eliorelys awarded Eliorelys was awarded the Gold Green Ingredient Award at in-cosmetics Global 2017.  This award is given to an ingredient that makes a significant environmental difference in the area of sustainability. Naturex’s Eliorelys is sustainably sourced in the heart of Provence, less than 50 miles from Naturex’s processing facility. The fresh flowers, a by-product of cherry fruit cultivation, are carefully handpicked and follow a dedicated supply chain that insures full respect of sustainability recommendations, especially regarding the avoidance of chemical treatments. Naturex also showcased Chakah Honey, a new addition to its Super Honeys collection - a line of ready-to-use cosmetic honeys first unveiled in January 2017. Chakah Honey has never been used in the modern cosmetics market, and was only recently rediscovered by Naturex sourcing experts working in the Yucatan region of Mexico, the cradle of the ancient Mayan civilization.  The Maya used the bark or leaves of the Chakah tree as a basis for their traditional medicine. “Chakah Flower Honey is a treasure-trove of health benefits. It delivers a moisturizing activity that, although traditionally well known, had not previously been scientifically demonstrated. But more importantly, in vitro research has shown it to stimulate and protect the mitochondria, the energy reservoir of human cells, making Chakah a super-active energizing cosmetic honey,” explains Naturex."
Hallstar launches an innovative UV filter to halt skin ageing process,"“Micah’s breakthrough chemistry represents a whole new category of sun care protection and anti-aging because it halts the photo-aging process before it starts,” explains Robert Hu, Vice President of Research & Development at Hallstar. “Independent clinical research shows that Micah, unlike sunscreens or antioxidants, prevents 100% of free radicals, ROS, inflammation, and DNA damage from UVA and Visible Light, at a use level of only 0.2%.” An ex vivo study on human skin explants has that Micah effectively prevented UVA-induced ROS [1] at a use level of 0.20%. Hallstar’s Micah scooped the silver prize at the in-cosmetics Global Innovation Ingredient Awards in London. “Hearing Hallstar announced from the stage affirmed our confidence in Micah’s potential. Whether it be a serum, sunscreen or moisturizer, Micah could be an integral part of any anti-aging solution,"" said Varun Mathur, Hallstar’s Beauty & Personal Care General Manager."

"“Photoprotection has applications in many cosmetics claims,” Christophe Paillet, Exsymol","Premium Beauty News - You have launched a new photoprotection active ingredient at the last edition of in-cosmetics. Skin protection against external aggressions was one of the main trends of the event. How is photoprotection positioned within this context? Christophe Paillet - It is a cross-disciplinary theme which offers applications in many cosmetics claims like anti-aging, sun protection, or anti-pollution. All these claims are in high demand. As we were in search of something inspired from naturalness, we eventually developed and patented a premium bio-molecule: SOLEXYL®. It is a conjugate derivative of thiomethylpropenoic acid, an isomer of Entadamide A found in tropical lianas. This active is both able to play a photoprotective role, like natural chromophores (melanin, tryptophan, urocanic acid…), and prevent any adverse effect such as premature aging, inflammation, immunosuppression… which are often generated by these natural chromophores. Among others, our tests showed its remarkable photoprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory virtues, so this new active can be positioned on the anti-immunosuppression niche. Premium Beauty News - We have noticed that this edition of in-cosmetics paid particular attention to all sources of aggressions, whether external or internal. Christophe Paillet - It is more and more widely recognized that the skin’s appearance mainly depends on external, but also internal aggressions, which all generate more or less chronic stress. That is why we have been strengthening our involvement in the field of the impact of psychological stress on the skin. A new study on Epidermosil®, a silanol (organic silicon stabilized by hyaluronic acid with low molecular weight), showed its efficacy against the effects of psychological stress on the epidermis, for example atrophy and dermatoporosis. This active can act thanks to an original mechanism: an action on hyalurosome, a real hyaluronic acid production machine and a regulator of cell growth. Premium Beauty News - What were the other key points to your participation in in-cosmetics 2017? Christophe Paillet - We had chosen to highlight our expertise in body issues with a review of our concepts and slimming and firming actives, and by providing details on the last results obtained with a red algae extract with a lipolytic and anti-adipogenesis effect particularly involved in anti-yo-yo phenomena. We also emphasized our offering in dermocosmetics, another segment that is showing strong growth, with new data in the field of healing – in particular results obtained with a scratch test on keratinocyte and fibroblast models - on actives like Glistin® or Epidermosil®, which were previously used for a more traditional cosmetics positioning. In the field of anti-aging, we presented the results of a recent clinical study targeting global anti-aging, eye contour and anti-wrinkle effects. This study demonstrated the synergic benefits provided by the combination of MeiYanoL® and Algisium®. MeiYanoL®, a common elder flower extract which acts thanks to an original mechanism on dark circles and bags, was introduced for the first time in 2015. MeiYanol was actually one of the themes presented on our Sustainability Corner dedicated to CSR policies. As regards Algisium®, it has been an essential for several decades in terms of restructuring and firming activity. Lastly, we also introduced a new element to our anti-aging offering with OLEOSTERINES® HOUBLON, an unsaponifiable fraction of hop which reshapes the oval of the face through a “V-reshaping” effect mainly due to an adipogenic mechanism that prevents the “gaunting” phenomenon typical of facial aging."
The main trends of in-cosmetics 2017,"Pollution was once again one of the main targets of new the launches by ingredient suppliers. However, this issue, which concerns all geographical areas, has been addressed more comprehensively. Some companies, such as Greentech with Urbalys presented a 360° anti-pollution active thanks to its protective effect on cellular channels.  On the other hand, Clariant with Eosidin specifically targeted indoor pollution. The concept of exposome, which encompasses the totality of environmental stresses that a person receives during its lifespan, has been the focus of ID bio’s attention with the launches of Cell’intact and Osmo’city but also of Symrise with Symbright.  Lipoid with HerbaShield URB has combined anti-pollution and detoxification. The offer was wide and varied. Some innovations might very well also be suitable as anti-aging or anti-inflammatory. The replacement of raw materials that went under fire was also a source of innovation. This was especially true with polyethylene beads, with the launch of new series of alternatives. Lamotte, for instance, launched an alternative based on hydrogenated castor marketed under the name Rizipearl. The product is distributed by Lavollée.  Also noteworthy are Ronald Britton’s bio-glitters, made from a biodegradable compostable film. Once again, exhibitors demonstrated the great creativity of their marketing teams regarding formulation concepts. From one stand to another, visitors were able to travel across various universes, with formulations often marked by sensorial and pleasure. Seppic, for instance, took inspiration from pictorial arts and put the different artistic movements and mixtures of colours and textures in parallel with innovative cosmetic formulas. DSM with ""Dare to change your hair"" proposed to let hair loops move freely with adapted products and without styling them. Naturex has presented a series of gourmet skin care formulas based on ingredients derived from the food business. Aldivia launched a 3-in-1 kit where it is possible to customize a mist with triggering actives responding to the demand of the moment. Univar broke boundaries with multifunctional products, such as lip-glosses that can also be used as eye-shadows. Eventually, men have not been forgotten since Thor created a new routine of daily beauty specifically for them. The next edition of in-cosmetics Global will take place in Amsterdam on 17-19 April 2018.

"Sustainability, Brexit and Artificial Intelligence to head up the debate at in-cosmetics Global 2017","“We are very proud to be bringing in-cosmetics Global to London in 2017. It is a dynamic, vibrant and well-connected city which is accessible from around the world and we wanted to capitalise on this for our international audience. It is 15 years since we were last in the UK and so much has changed since then – there is a huge local visitor group which we will be tapping into, delivering new, exciting and inspiring visitors throughout the event,” said Cathy Laporte, Exhibition Director. This year, R&D professionals and formulators participating in the show will be invited to put new make-up formulations to the test. The new Make-Up Bar area has been designed for exhibitors to demonstrate their expertise, enabling visitors to identify innovative pigments and technologies that will deliver the next generation of trend-setting colour cosmetics products. The other addition to the event, the Sustainability Corner, an open theatre, will help visitors explore the latest developments and initiatives in personal care sustainability. As for the previous years, novel ingredients launched within six months of the show opening will be presented in the Innovation Zone, where cosmetic professionals are invited to touch, smell and feel the products during a series of live demonstrations. This year’s show will also see the return of the Formulation Lab with sessions designed to provide R&D and lab professionals with hands-on experience from the industry’s leading experts into how to formulate the latest ingredients.  Evonik, Lonza, Nikko, Dr. Straetmans and Symrise AG are among 14 suppliers already confirmed to take to the stage. In addition, the education programme will cover the latest market trends and issues including changes in the way consumers shop for beauty, Brexit, the sustainability debate and ethical developments, such as halal’s influence across fragrances and cosmetic ingredients alike.

Consolidation among cosmetic ingredients producers to continue,"ThinkingLinking has analysed fifty acquisitions in cosmetic ingredients businesses during the five-year period from 2012 to 2016.  In total, 45 acquirers were involved for an estimated amount of more than EUR 3 billion (GBP 2.5 billion).  “2012 and 2013 were slightly more active years in number of deals. Since then the picture has been stable, with around 10 deals a year and shows no signs of abating,” said the company. The investors came from 16 countries and went into 20. Approximately half of the deals (28) were cross-border. Not surprisingly given the origin of the sector, Europe saw the greatest focus - both as the source of the investor and for the location of the target. However, emerging investors have appeared from the Middle East and increasingly from Asia. According to ThinkingLinking, the 45 investors include many new faces not seen before on the M&A market. “They had previously been happy with organic growth but have now joined in the consolidation game,” said the company. Although ‘usual suspects’ were behind many of the EUR 100m deals, the investors in the EUR 10-100m deal range were mostly well-funded mid-sized businesses making their first acquisition. “Ingredients are being concentrated into fewer hands by companies with the confidence and commitment to pay high prices to play in a fast-changing world,” commented Mark Dixon, the firm’s Chief Thinking Officer. The investors fall into three main groups: financial investors, ‘core’ buyers from the cosmetic ingredients sector, and horizontal moves such as by food, beverages or pharmaceuticals ingredients producers entering cosmetic ingredients for the first time. The core investors are by far the most active. They are in effect rationalising a sector that has traditionally been restricted by ingredient and geography. The full report can be viewed at thinkinglinking.com"
Deinove and Greentech want to market new cosmetic actives derived from bacteria,"Greentech has chosen Deinove to develop new active substances from its panel of extremophile bacteria.  Deinove had already screened its strains to identify activities sought after in the cosmetics industry. The Greentech and Deinove R&D teams will continue testing and working on the production, purification, and formulation of several compounds with the goal of bringing a first ingredient to market by the end of 2018.  ""In our developments we aim to leverage the extraordinary ability of microorganisms to build mechanisms of adaptation and resistance in extreme environments: hot, cold, hypersaline, radioactive, acid, basic, etc.  Deinove’s bacteria are unique and can bring real added value to our portfolio of ingredients intended to protect and beautify the skin,” commented Jean-Yves Berthon, CEO of Greentech. Deinove undertook in 2016 an extensive screening program of its bacterial collection to identify strains with properties that could be useful in cosmetic applications, mainly in skin care. A selection of 430 wild-type strains was screened by the Fluofarma laboratory, specializing in cell-based assays, to assess the effect of compounds in various applications and especially in cosmetics. In vitro screening tests helped to identify successfully dozens of strains with sought-after properties in cosmetics, nutrition, and health: – Antioxidant properties, for anti-aging, firmness or anti-UV, for example;
– Anti-inflammatory, especially for a soothing effect (for sensitive or irritated skin, or for post-operative skin care);
– Healing properties for damaged or photo-damaged skin, post-operative applications, repair, anti-aging;
– Activity on lipolysis for slimming, anti-cellulite;
– Action on lipid storage that can be exploited for a plumping and moisturizing effect, etc. ""These results are a solid foundation for the development of our activities, initially in cosmetics, skin and hair.  As we foresaw, our strain bank has exceptional potential. This is now fully confirmed and we have a catalog of strains with various and identified properties,"" said Emmanuel Petiot, CEO of Deinove. Based in Montpellier, Deinove employs approximately 50 employees and has nearly 160 international patent applications.  The company is specialised in the discovery, development and production of compounds with industrial value from rare microorganisms, for the healthcare, nutrition and cosmetics markets. Deinove relies on two key assets: a unique strain bank with 6,000 rare bacteria that have not yet been exploited, mainly of the Deinococcus genus; and a genetic, metabolic and fermentation engineering platform that enables them to customize these natural micro-factories, transforming them into new industry standards. Also note that Greentech will speak on issues related to microbiota and cosmetics in a conference organized by Premium Beauty News at in-cosmetics London next week. More information here."
TechnicoFlor invests in a new production site,"The construction of the new production site is scheduled to start at the end of 2017 in Allauch, Provence, Southern France.  The new facility will feature two industrial buildings: one dedicated to the production of perfumes and the other to the production of raw materials. The new site will replace the current production unit which employs 70 people on an area of 2000 m2. With a total area of 3,000-3,500 m2 on a land area of 20,000 m2, the new production tool is expected to be operational at the end of 2018. It will enable TechnicoFlor to double its production capacity. All production, mixing, packaging, quality control and shipments will be carried out in the new buildings. The company - which already uses 5 automated weighing and mixing machines that can produce 0.05 g. to 50 kg. of compounds, 24 hours a day under software supervision - has designed fully robotised lines for its new units. They will feature several new generation robots, including a powder weighing machine, allowing ultra-precise dosages, regardless the particles size. The production and packaging will be carried out by gravity in order to avoid using pumps.  Eventually, the construction of an unloading dock featuring three special doors adapted to trailers will facilitate deliveries. This investment should allow the French designer of aromatic composition to address the challenges linked to its growth and to better serve its customers in particular with shortened delivery lead times, which are expected to drop down to 4 or 5 days of processing - irrespective of product type and volumes ordered. ""We needed a new production unit to anticipate our growth and support our development. Our future production centre and its state-of-the-art equipment is designed to optimize the delivery lead time. It will meet stringent environmental quality standards, in line with our environmental policy,"" explains François-Patrick Sabater, President of TechnicoFlor. Indeed, the company has been involved for many years in a demanding eco-environmental approach.  In the Valley of Nepal, for instance, TechnicoFlor supports Man & Nature, a non-profit organisation that helps farmers from the Bardia National Park and their families. This initiative allows the company to collect an ultra-premium quality of essential oils (Chamomile, Ginger, Curcuma, Lemongrass, Coriander, Mint, Lemongrass, Eucalyptus, Lantana, Calamus, Basil ...) while helping local populations and contributing to the protection of the fauna. The new building will thus meet France’s HQE (High Environmental Quality) standards, and will feature a rainwater collecting system and a green roof. TechnicoFlor is a family-owned group created in 1982by François-Patrick Sabater. The company has been supplying many major perfumery and cosmetics brands for nearly 30 years. With offices in Miami, Dubai, Singapore, Jarkarta, Bangkok and Shanghai, TechnicoFlor distributes its products in more than 60 countries in the Middle East, Asia, Western Europe and Central Europe. With a total of 200 employees and a team of eight perfumers, the Group has consolidated sales of nearly 50 million Euros, 30% in France and 70% in international markets.  It sales grew by 14% in 2016, while revenues grew by 12%."
Gattefossé: A new organic active for the eye contour area,"The new addition to the Gatuline range is obtained from organic horse chestnut flowers.  Gattefossé’s Gatuline Link n Lift has been specifically developed to lift the eye contour area. Indeed, the fragility of the eye contour and its permanent motion favour the formation of wrinkles. “Gatuline Link n Lift restores fibroblast dynamism and acts on the dermal-epidermal junction to firmly reconnect the epidermis to the dermis.  Wrinkles around the eyes are visibly erased and a positive expression is restored,” claims Gattefossé. The efficacy of Gatuline Link n Lift was evaluated through in vitro tests.  According to Gattefossé, the tests have demonstrated the active’s impact on the dermis, in particular on fibroblast dynamism and mobility to help the skin fight matrix degradation.  The ingredients manufacturer also claims that Gatuline Link n Lift “reinforces the dermal-epidermal junction integrity and functionality by stimulating the synthesis of all major components involved in the epidermis-dermis cohesion and communication”. The efficacy of Gatuline Link n Lift was also tested in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. According to Gattefossé, used at 2% in formulation, Gatuline Link n Lift “visibly acts on all eye contour wrinkles (crow’s feet, under-eye and tear trough (also called valley of tears), with the first effects visible in just 2 weeks.” Gatuline Link n Lift is Gattefossé’s first active obtained using the NaDES (Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents) technology.  It contains active molecules found only in the horse chestnut flower. “The NaDES technology allows the creation of active compositions unattainable with conventional solvents. Natural, non-toxic and efficient at low temperatures, this technology is perfectly aligned with Gattefossé’s strategy to provide high-performance sustainable ingredients,” highlights the company. The horse chestnut flowers are selectively and manually picked in Ardèche (South of France). Gattefossé has set up a responsible sourcing procedure and the ingredient is certified organic."
"“The acquisition of Serdex will help us gain new CSR skills”, Caroline Drouart, Seppic","Premium Beauty News - Seppic announced the acquisition of the Bayer group’s Serdex division in early January. Now, that is quite useful to enrich your portfolio of natural ingredients! Caroline Drouart - Obviously, this acquisition helps widen our product offering for the booming market of natural actives designed for the cosmetics industry. It corresponds to a basic strategy for our group, but we also intend to add a new technological bedrock to our know-how. We are experts in bio-based chemistry, and since the acquisition of BiotechMarine, we have developed new ingredients derived from marine biotechnology. The acquisition of Serdex gives us access to highly pure plant extraction technologies. As an example, Serdex produces very accurately titrated extracts for the pharmaceutical industry and boasts an exceptional expertise in extraction techniques. Just like BiotechMarine, Serdex becomes a Seppic subsidiary. It will still be based in Pau, France. As a result, Seppic has three industrial sites in France: our historical site in Castres, in the south of France, dedicated to bio-based chemistry for cosmetics, the site of Pontrieux in Brittany for marine biotechnologies, and now the site of Serdex in Pau, for plant extraction. The acquisition of Serdex also helps develop our position on the dermo-cosmetics market, which is their historic market and represents a strong growth driver for the next few years. Premium Beauty News - Seppic and Serdex also seem very complementary on the geographic level. Caroline Drouart - As a matter of fact, Serdex helps us strengthen our presence for certain key accounts in France, for whom the company very regularly works as a unique supplier on tailor-made development projects. In addition, Serdex has a huge potential on the global scale: the company generates most of its turnover (8 million euros in 2015) in France, while 75% of Seppic’s turnover comes from international activities. This way, Serdex will be able to benefit from our strong commercial network around the world. Premium Beauty News - Serdex was also famous for their commitment in CSR. Will their policy be pursued? Caroline Drouart - Not only Serdex’s CSR commitment will be continued, but we intend to draw inspiration from their remarkable experience for everyone at Seppic to acquire new skills in this area. Serdex has been a member of the UEBT [1] since 2008, and got a 9.5/10 mark at the 2014 audit, so we are eager to benefit from their know-how. Serdex is recognized for its ability to set up environmentally friendly supply chains for exotic plants, while enhancing the quality and skills of local suppliers, as well as the social and economic development of local communities. For example, the company has an excellent base in Madagascar. Premium Beauty News - Are other acquisitions considered? Caroline Drouart - Indeed, Seppic aims to pursue its external growth strategy, maybe on the global level."
Three top trends in cosmetics formulation to look for in 2017,"“Consumers want product to suit them, matching their lifestyle, their skin, their tone, their look. When it comes to developments in 2017, think about how you can customise, or provide a customisation option, for your consumer,” recommends the Institute of Personal Care Science. Customisation options for cosmetic formulations include: – Customisable bases with optional actives.  A base serum, cream or crème-gel formulated to suit a target market can be complemented with concentrated ‘active’ serums to add to the base to suite specific skin needs at any given moment. For example, when their skin is feeling dry, customers can add drops of a ‘hydrating serum’ to the base. “Make sure your base addresses key concerns in general such as anti-pollution but provide active concentrates with easy dispensing units and clear instructions for true customisation and a happy consumer,” says the Institute of Personal Care Science.
– Colour cosmetics should also become customisable in 2017. For instance, cosmetics makers can provide a multi-colour palette with instructional on-line videos on how to make lipstick pinks and reds ‘hotter’ or more ‘muted’. They can also create foundations (liquid and/or powder) that can be adjusted to be slightly lighter or darker depending on consumers’ skin tone depending on the season.
– Scents will not be left aside the customisation trend this year.  For instance, scents can be modified by the consumer with small additions of concentrates to adapt a base to their daily moods.
– Eventually, the Institute of Personal Care Science, an Australia-based organisation dedicated to the education of the personal care industry around the world, has identified the 3 top trends in cosmetics formulation for 2017.] forecasts an explosion of apps that will enable customers to ‘try before they buy’ in a virtual reality space, and will be tailored to help self-selection of the best actives, colour and scent. This trend has been growing in recent years and will become a mainstay this year.  So cosmetics makers need to incorporate their sustainability message into their general marketing and company philosophies. “Using sustainably sourced materials is a must moving forward; but adding to this message are other environmentally and/or community focussed messages. From greening up your carbon footprint, using materials that ‘give back’ and even making a point of your recycled packaging, make sure your marketing provides the sustainability message of your brand as a mainstay from 2017 on,” says the Institute of Personal Care Science, an Australia-based organisation dedicated to the education of the personal care industry around the world, has identified the 3 top trends in cosmetics formulation for 2017.]. The use of film formers to enable make-up to withstand exercise and be selfie-ready at a moments’ notice is really taking off. This trend is especially prevalent in the major growth area of colour cosmetics: Asian trend setting women from 20 right through to 35 who also have the highest social media use and exploration of colour cosmetics. Cosmetics makers should provide them with fantastic sweat/wear proof make-up to take them from the gym through the day and into the night with interesting YouTube footage (and even an app!) to really capture their attention."
Naturex to showcase new Eutectys haircare actives and superhoneys at Cosmetagora,"“A few years ago, terms like eco-friendly, sustainability, and traceability, were not part of consumer vocabulary when it came to cosmetics. These now familiar concepts are the driving forces behind the growth of the natural cosmetics market,” explains Naturex in a release.  In line with this growing market demand, the French company specialising in botanical ingredients will showcase several innovative natural actives at the Cosmetagora show. Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents (NaDES) are a type of natural solvent that reproduce the plants’ intracellular environment. Leading the way in the development of this cutting-edge technology, last year Naturex launched a patented extraction process called Eutectigenesis, which consists of extracting the active compounds of the plant through the formation of NaDES. The obtained “Eutectys™” compounds show augmented phytoactive profiles and improved performance. Naturex has expanding the Eutectys technology to haircare, and will be showcasing two brand new actives this year: – Horsetail: The Eutectigenesis-obtained extract is rich in phenolic compounds and demonstrates impressive anti-frizz and radiance activities. Tested on curly human hair, Horsetail Eutectys BLA demonstrates the ability to reduce frizziness by 458%. – Saffron flower: This well-known spice also has recognized cosmetic benefits, thanks to its beautiful flowers. Eutectigenesis gives this extract a wider and richer spectrum of actives. Saffron flower Eutectys™ BLA is the perfect active to increase hair manageability and suppleness. By reducing friction, it ensures easy-to-tame hair and eases combing. Naturex will also showcase its ready-to-use cosmetic honeys selection, boasting six different honey varieties, from all around the world. French-lavender, Romanian acacia, Spanish orange blossom or New Zealand Manuka, every Naturex honey is highly traceable, carefully selected and designed for perfect formulability. “An incredible natural ingredient with moisturizing, dermo-purifying, healing and soothing powers, honey has been used for centuries. Each honey or honey extract is in itself a unique natural formulation, perfumed and enriched by its floral origin and geography,” said the company. Three applications will be unveiled at the show, including a purifying honey powder, and a gentle honey face scrub. “As an ever-increasing number of potent natural-based beauty formulations are launched, consumers are now convinced that these types of products can benefit them personally while protecting the environment. Increasing the efficacy of natural personal care products is a sure way to attract new customers,” highlights Stéphanie Puel, director of Naturex Personal Care Business Unit."
Lipotec aims to reprogram the skin through epigenetics,"Among the biological processes regulated by means of epigenetics Lipotec chose to focus on the control of the fate of progenitor cells located in the basal layer of the epidermis. “The epidermis is one of the most active tissues in terms of regeneration thanks to the ability of the stem cells from the basal layer to divide and renew themselves.  With age, this regenerative potential and the overall function of epidermis are reduced resulting in the development of aging signs, such as appearance of wrinkles and loss of radiance,” explains the company. To address this problem, Lipotec has developed Reproage, a new peptide that may induce cellular reprogramming in the epidermal basal layer through the modulation of epigenetic elements, thus helping to reactivate basal cells and their regenerative abilities, leading to an improved appearance of mature skin. The new peptide specifically targets the microRNA-145, an epigenetic regulator known to repress the activity of the stem cell transcription factors, restraining the stemness properties of the basal cells. According to Lipotec, “Reproage reduces the levels of microRNA-145 and increases the level of the stem cell factors related to stemness, contributing to an improvement in the skin properties.” Lipotec performed two in vivo assays, using 2% peptide solution twice a day during 56 days.  The tests showed a general improvement in skin complexion and more radiance with 1.5% increase in luminance as well as a rejuvenated skin with epidermal self-renewal activity increased to the level of a skin 17 years younger in the 50-55 years old volunteers and up to 41.3% decrease in skin roughness. “Reproage peptide assists in obtaining a smoother, more radiant and visually rejuvenated complexion and can be incorporated into any anti-aging formulation to cope with the slowdown in skin regeneration that takes place with age or in products designed to rejuvenate the skin,” concludes the company."
Seppic launches a new anti-pollution active derived from macro-algae cell culture,"To protect the skin from the ravages of pollution, Contacticel is an extract from a little known red algae, Acro chaetium moniliforme, which lives in contact with other algae. In association with other micro-organisms, it helps to protect its host against outside aggressions. Drawing inspiration from the properties of this algae, Seppic’s new active ingredient offers the skin protection against pollution. “In two months, it effectively reduces the sebum of skin exposed to a polluted atmosphere with a visible and lasting result,” claims the cosmetics ingredients supplier. According to Seppic, Contacticel is an exceptional skin-purifying agent that works against several pollutants (ozone, microparticles, heavy metals) through its combined properties. “92% of the world’s population lives in an environment that is too polluted, which causes numerous adverse impacts on the skin, such as early aging, cutaneous malfunctions or over-production of sebum,” highlights the company. After Ephemer, Contacticel is the second active ingredient that Seppic has developed with the Celebrity technology, which makes it possible here to produce large quantities of biomass from an algae that could not be cultivated or harvested in its natural setting. “This innovative technology enables us once again to enhance a rare marine species and draw inspiration to create an original active ingredient that promotes healthy skin. It’s a great example of bio-inspiration,” confirms Erwan Le Gélébart, R&D project manager for BiotechMarine."
Huntsman launches new TiO2 pigment for premium cosmetic formulations,"Global chemical company Huntsman has developed a brand new, super pure grade of titanium dioxide (TiO2) that can be used to improve the opacity of premium cosmetic products that need to provide excellent uniform coverage. The Hombitan AFDC 101 pigment is a unique, high purity, uncoated anatase grade of TiO2 with a very narrow particle size distribution. “Delivering better opacity performance than standard white pigment grades, Hombitan AFDC 101 pigment is ideally suited for use in high-end cosmetic formulations including foundations, eye shadows, face powders and lipsticks,” said the company. The Hombitan AFDC 101 pigment, which is of mineral origin, is created using a special process technology devised by Huntsman, which gives it greater control over crystal size and particle distribution. Using its enhanced crystal size control technology, Huntsman is able to produce crystal size distributions that are optimized to reflect selected wavelengths of light. In the case of Hombitan AFDC 101 pigment, the result is a product that combines the softness of an anatase pigment with the opacity of a rutile pigment. “The launch of Hombitan AFDC101 pigment represents a major breakthrough in our TiO2 offering to the premium cosmetics industry. It is the first product made using our enhanced crystal size control technology, which gives us the ability to fine-tune both particle size and distribution to suit specific applications. Hombitan AFDC 101 pigment has consistently fine particles over a consistently narrow distribution. There is no other product that offers the same properties,” said Reiner Mertscheit, Sales and Marketing Director at Huntsman. Used as a white, natural, identical colour additive, Hombitan AFDC 101 pigment can work on its own or in combination with colour pigments. According to Huntsman, it disperses rapidly into formulations and is ideal for use in aqueous systems such as creams, which use water as a wetting agent. Hombitan AFDC 101 pigment is compliant with relevant regulations including ISO 9001 (quality); ISO 14001 (environment); ISO 18001 (health and safety); ISO 22000 / FSSC 22000 (food); and Ecocert / Cosmos. It is also satisfies kosher and halal requirements."
Symrise widens its range of antipollution actives,"Despite the introduction of threshold limits and driving restrictions, air pollution continues to increase in cities around the globe. “This extreme situation is very detrimental to skin,” explains Symrise.  According to the cosmetics ingredients supplier, consumers are increasingly aware of this and their demand for product solutions and formulations that restore skin’s balance is constantly growing. Indeed, studies show that urban dwellers develop 20 percent more pigmentation spots and show a more stressed complexion than rural residents. Professor Jean Krutmann and his research team at the Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine (IUF) in Düsseldorf have revealed the harmful effects of Particulate Matter on skin. “Thanks to the studies from the Leibnitz Institute for Environmental Medicine, we now know exactly how these tiny particles attack and damage skin,” says Dr. William Johncock, Senior Vice President Cosmetic Ingredients Business Unit Sun Protection and Functionals at Symrise. According to Symrise, until recently, skincare solutions to fight pollution were limited to antioxidant strategies and protective skin-coating polymers. Neither offered complete protection against the effects of Particulate Matter and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). “Since we now understand precisely how particulate matter affect the skin, we were able to design an evaluation protocol involving standardized particles and specific markers. This provides us with an objective and reliable framework for assessing the efficacy of anti-pollution actives,” continues Johncock. Originally launched at in-cosmetics 2016 in Paris, SymUrban can “protect skin from the harmful effects of Particulate Matter - including collagen degradation, overproduction of melanin and inflammatory processes.” SymUrban adds to a portfolio of active ingredients allowing the formulation of complete product lines to defend the skin against environmental aggressions: – Dragosine helps protect the skin against infrared-induced damages and can support the global protection against sun rays beyond the UV spectrum.
– The natural raw materials SymVital AR and SymFinity 1298 reduce the effect of diesel exhaust particles, which exist in cities at extremely high concentrations. They can thus help to significantly reduce the risk of inflammation and pigmentation resulting in a more even skin tone.
– SymRepair 100 uses a special formula that reinforces the natural skin barrier while the Neo Heliopan range comprises diverse filters that protect the skin from UV light."
Silab takes care of compromised skin with a new active and a new division,"AD-RESYL, Silab’s new patented natural active ingredient dedicated to the comfort and resilience of atopic skin.  The molecule was specifically developed to prevent the clinical signs of atopic dermatitis by prolonging remission periods following treatment with corticosteroid therapy. ""With the launch of AD-RESYL, Silab offers a dermo-cosmetic approach of atopic dermatitis,"" says Brigitte Closs-Gonthier, Deputy Managing Director for Research.  “Our goal was to decrease the frequency of inflammatory periods, with a molecule meeting our criteria: efficacy, naturality, and safety.” Silab screened no less than 57 raw materials to launch this new active.  The French laboratory eventually chose an extract of Ophiopogon japonicas (dwarf lilyturf), a plant with tuberous roots known for their resistance to drought and native to China and South Korea. The efficacy of AD-RESYL was demonstrated by a series of in vitro and in vivo assessments. Silab used a 3D model reproducing a skin affected by atopic dermatitis.  Tests were also on cohorts of Caucasian and Asian children and/or adults. “AD-RESYL meets the many expectations of patients on the lookout for care and comfort to restore health to their skin: it benefits from clinically demonstrated efficacy, optimum skin tolerance, and a controlled natural raw material,” said Silab. The launch of AD-RESYL is the result of over 5 years of research by multidisciplinary teams made up of molecular biologists, bioinformaticians, clinical experts and process engineers. In the wake of this innovation, Silab intends to invest in the long term to address the markets of dermo-cosmetics and dermatology.  ""Our conviction is that the skin care market is moving towards an increased medicalization,"" explains Xavier Gaillard, Silab’s Deputy General Manager.  “It is less about beauty and more about well-being.” In order to extend its knowledge of healthy skin to the problems of compromised skin, Silab has created the Silab softcare division, which is dedicated to the research, production and marketing of innovative natural active ingredients specifically designed to care for dermatological disorders by restoring the homeostasis of healthy skin.  “Silab softcare relies on Silab’s expertise, capacity for innovation and responsive organization to broaden acquired knowledge of healthy skin to the problems of compromised skin,” adds the company. According to company executives, Silab softcare should strongly contribute to help the group to reach its target to double size  within 5 years.  In 2015, Silab’s achieved a turnover of EUR 40 million, 60% on export markets."
"in-cosmetics: More than 2,000 visitors at first event in North America","The future of the personal care industry will be based on specialty ingredients, announced Nikola Matic from Kline at the opening of the two-day event which took place at Pier 36 on September 07-08 in  New York City.  He is certainly right, considering the numbers of members of the industry who visited the event where 160-plus exhibitors were showcasing their latest ingredients.  A total visitor attendance of more than 2,000, including senior scientists and R&D representatives from 23 of the top 25 US manufacturers. “in-cosmetics North America stands out as a truly international event.

Anti-pollution and halal among hot topics at in-cosmetics Asia 2016,"According to Euromonitor International, the Asia Pacific (APAC) beauty and personal care market is set to grow by almost 25% over the next four years, reaching a value of US$167bn [1].  This will be fuelled by increasing demand for products in China and India, which will contribute three-quarters of the absolute growth by 2020. While China and India will be the driving forces behind the region’s growth, Japan remains a key player, with sales of beauty and personal care products accounting for a fifth of the marketplace. Indonesia, which has seen its market double in size since 2010, will continue to thrive, with growth of 7.5% expected per annum, as will South Korea - where the male grooming sector continues to play a major role. From a global perspective, APAC currently represents 31% of the market. Come 2020, that figure is expected to reach 34%. Asia is now seen as a leading source of innovation, which is helping create new demand for cosmetic products, not only in the region but across the world. Asia-led trends, like eye-raising snail cream, and functional cosmetics have taken the industry by storm and are becoming increasingly popular in the West. Taking place in Bangkok from 8-10 November [2], in-cosmetics Asia will feature more than 300 suppliers and over 50 hours of educational sessions, all of which are free-to-attend. “Our ambition is that finished product manufactures and R&D professionals leave in-cosmetics Asia with a clear idea of how they will create the next generation of products. The 2016 event will present the latest ingredients, raw materials and formulations, from across the globe, alongside a programme of seminars that will deliver invaluable technical information, regulatory advice and marketing trends,” commented Sarah Gibson, Exhibition Director of in-cosmetics Asia. New local suppliers as well as international businesses - around a third of the companies on the show floor will have travelled from outside of the Asia Pacific region and 89% from outside Thailand - already confirmed to exhibit at the event including Evonik Nutrition & Care, Innospec, Mibelle AG Biochemistry, Natura Tec, Silab and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. The popular Innovation Zone will showcase the latest ground-breaking ingredients and technologies that will have launched within eight months of the show, or are set to be revealed there. What’s more, on 9 November, a panel of international experts will announce the winners of this year’s Best New Active Ingredient and Best New Functional Ingredient awards. In parallel to the exhibition, the educational programme will present the latest trends, market analysis and research that will shape the future of the APAC cosmetic market. R&D professionals will also be able to attend practical sessions that provide hands-on formulation training, while a series of seminars will highlight unique ingredients, claims and formulation techniques. Asian consumer trends will be explored in detail during a presentation by Joanna Chan, Research Analyst at Euromonitor International. She will advise visitors that the Asian beauty market has yet to reach maturity and that there is significant room for growth, which could be realised by tapping into the region’s diverse markets and evolving ingredients ranges. Chan will also discuss key trends, focusing on customisation, wellness and digital retailing. Tommy Kong, General Manager of the Cosmetic Division in the REACH24H Consulting Group, will provide the latest updates on Chinese cosmetic regulation and the potential impacts. Since last year, the Chinese cosmetic regulatory environment has seen much change following the revision of Cosmetic Safety and Technical Standards, the issuing of Cosmetic Safety Assessment Guidance and the adjustment on the new plant ingredient registration. This session will provide an overview of China’s cosmetic regulatory system and the recent changes, providing attendees with essential information. In addition, Belinda Carli, Director of the Institute of Personal Care Science, will deliver a session designed to help manufacturers rapidly create new bases, as well as exploring how to test the stability of formulations and ensure good quality delivery and efficacy. “With increasing consumer demands and the pressures of launching innovative new products, developing disruptive formulations quickly is paramount. The standard development time of 12-18 months is no longer acceptable to brands or conducive to consumer trends.” Also, given the global focus on anti-pollution products, Personal Care magazine will give visitors an overview of the concept of skin protection, as well as considering the reasons behind this sector’s growth in popularity. Editor Richard Scott will take attendees through ingredients that can help protect against pollution, HEV light and the sun, as well as discussing the skin microbiome. Eventually, 2016 sees the launch of the new in-cosmetics Asia Spotlight On… product areas, which will focus on the key trends of Halal, anti-pollution and France. As well as showcasing products in each area, the three themes will be discussed in detail during the event’s Marketing Trends programme. “The event is all about inspiring businesses to create new products and we believe this year’s programme will enable attendees to confidently plan for a successful future. We look forward to welcoming the industry to the event in November,” concluded Sarah Gibson."
Univar continues repositioning its businesses with the opening of a new laboratory in France,"Located in Versailles, in the western part of Paris greater urban area, on the campus of ISIPCA (Institut Supérieur International du Parfum de la Cosmétique et de l’Aromatique), a leading institution for post-graduate studies in perfume, cosmetics, and food flavour formulation, Univar’s new technical excellence centre is dedicated to servicing the personal care industry - mainly hair care, skin care, sun care, and personal hygiene products producers - across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). Furthermore, according to Univar, the new technical centre will enhance the company’s ability to provide formulation expertise and innovative solutions to its customers. ""We are delighted to expand our presence and capabilities in the market with a new technical centre strategically located at the centre of personal care innovation on the ISIPCA campus,” said Matthew Ottaway, Industry Director, Personal Care, Univar EMEA. “Today, Univar’s Personal Care team is uniquely positioned to offer customers the best in cosmetic innovation, in addition to unique, upscale service in terms of formulation assistance and technical support.

French perfumers smell success in crusade for UN recognition,"When Joseph Mul walks through his field of sweet-smelling Provence roses, the raw ingredients of Chanel N°5, he follows in the footsteps of his great grandfather who began growing flowers for perfume in 1840. Mul, 77, is continuing the tradition of one generation instructing the next in the secrets of floral cultivation by preparing to hand over his livelihood to son-in-law, Fabrice Bianchi.  ""He was converted the day he married my daughter,"" said Mul. ""The apprenticeship is done ’in situ’ in the fields, it’s a permanent exchange between our two generations, a transfer of know-how that allows us to manage the plants,"" said Bianchi as he picked a Provence rose, also known as a May rose.  ""This rose was designed to appeal to the nostrils. Its smell is very balanced and velvety."" It is this rich heritage that the flower growers in the southeast French town of Grasse, including Mul, a well-known figure in the industry, are now pushing to have recognised by the UN’s cultural agency, UNESCO.  They have been joined in their crusade by France’s perfume makers as well as the companies responsible for processing their raw materials. Grasse, a town of around 50,000 people, has been associated with perfume since the 17th century under Louis XIV when the area’s leather makers — there since the Middle Ages — began to create scented oil to fragrance their wares, particularly gloves. The sun king is rumoured to have used so much that the scent made him ill. As a result of the demand for floral oils, fields of flowers began to speckle the region. But a property boom in the 1970s coupled with strong competition from cheaper overseas producers threatened the viability of Grasse’s perfume industry. Despite the headwinds, Grasse has since reasserted its position at the forefront of global perfume manufacturing, hosting famous names like Robertet and Fragonard and employing as many as 3,000
people. Today perfumes are heavily associated with fashion and celebrities, a trend started by Coco Chanel’s N°5 in 1921. Since then perfumes have become a core part of a designer’s franchise, with the world’s leading luxury company LVMH opening a perfume testing laboratory in Grasse in September. The base will develop the next generation of scents for Dior and Louis Vuitton, helping to secure Grasse’s position as a global hub for perfume. Several other renowned perfumes come directly from factories in and around Grasse using both natural and synthetic ingredients from across the world. ""Such a concentration of know-how doesn’t exist anywhere else in the world. It’s here that you have to come to perfect a natural product,"" said Jacques Cavallier-Belletrud, the son and grandson of Grasse perfume makers and now a designer and ""nose"" for Louis Vuitton. He has joined the chorus calling for Grasse’s centuries of perfume expertise to be added to UNESCO’s list of ""intangible cultural heritage"" following France’s application in March 2015. While France officially recognised the region’s valuable perfume heritage in 2014, it could take years for the United Nations to do the same. It is hoped that Grasse’s bid will promote traditional oral teaching of perfume making techniques. ""A very colourful language, unique to perfumers, allows us to communicate emotion very quickly. With my father I understand instantly,"" said Cavallier-Belletrud. ""A perfume is an idea and a collection of emotions that can be shared."" Carole Biancalana, a fourth generation grower of flowers for perfume, said that it is vital that Grasse’s heritage be recognised to celebrate its history and secure its future. ""It is important to help label our heritage, to attract young people into the profession, and to pay tribute to past generations,"" she said."
Cosmetic ingredients: Global demand for aloe vera continues growing,"According to a recent report by FMI, aloe vera extract is becoming an essential ingredient in food, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, with global volume in 2016 set to surpass 60,720.4 tonnes, representing revenues worth US$ 1.6 billion. And the trend is predicted to continue for some time, with global revenues tipped to surpass US$ 3.3 billion by 2026. [1] Cosmetics, the largest sector when it comes to aloe vera extracts, will account for over 45 percent of global demand in 2016, seeing a 6 percent increase from 2015, the report predicts. Why is aloe vera so popular?  The trend reflects a wider adoption of natural and organic beauty products and techniques. The growth of the ’Slow Cosmetic’ movement in Europe, which focuses on products made from 100 percent natural ingredients and formulas, and, more generally, the strong growth of the natural and organic cosmetic segment, and good illustration of the trend.  Furthermore, most fashion and beauty brands are turning to more sustainable attitudes and eco-friendly methods. Demand is also driven by the geographical diversification of consumption.  Today, Germany is the largest consumer of aloe vera extract (more than 3,139 tonnes in 2015).  The country should further its lead as the largest market in 2016, witnessing a year-to-year volume increase of 5.3%.  However, demand is growing at healthy rate in the Asia Pacific region where rising incomes of the middle class allow it to turn to natural and organic cosmetics. Aloe vera is one of the most studied plants worldwide. There is hardly any plant that can display such a great variety of scientifically-proven active ingredients.  Actually, it is one of the highest-performing natural beauty ingredients. Its natural clear gel has long been used medicinally as a skin cure for wounds and infections, but it is increasingly being incorporated into cosmetic treatments for conditions such as eczema, dandruff and psoriasis. Its anti-inflammatory properties also make it a useful ingredient for fighting acne and other skin imbalances. The plant provides anti-oxidants, and vitamin C and E, said to firm and hydrate the skin, improving its elasticity with regular application.  As a natural moisturizer, it brings oxygen to the skin, strengthening it from within.  As if that wasn’t enough, aloe vera is also thought to soothe arthritis, rheumatism and digestion - and we all know that beauty starts from within. As far as suppliers are concerned, the global aloe vera extracts market is highly fragmented, with the top eight players (including Lily of the Desert Organic Aloeceuticals, Aloe Farms Inc., Terry Laboratories Inc., Foodchem International Corporation, Natural Aloe Costa Rica S.A., Pharmachem Laboratories Inc., Aloecorp Inc., and Aloe Laboratories Inc.) accounting for around 6-7% revenue share of the global market in 2015. According to FMI, leading companies are looking to expand their production capacity and launch new product offerings in a bid to increase market share, expand customer base and achieve a competitive edge."
Gatuline Renew: A new botanical active to address skin texture problems,"While it is widely known that skin texture degradation is one of the key signs that betray age, it is also one of the most difficult to correct.  ""Under the action of age and environment (pollution, UV) skin becomes thinner, with a drier and rougher surface and dead cells are more difficult to eliminate,"" explains Gattefossé. “Contrary to wrinkles and sagging, skin texture cannot be corrected by injections or surgical procedures, nor fully hidden by make-up.” Gatuline Renew has been designed to address specifically the problem of skin texture.  According to Gattefossé, the active relaunches the cell renewal mechanism, restoring the capacity of the skin to regenerate and defend itself, thus restoring a perfect, smooth skin, both to the eye and to touch. “Used at only 1% in formulation, it rebuilds the epidermis and restores efficient skin barrier function. In a blind study versus placebo, panelists showed significantly higher appraisal levels for the half-face treated with the active cream - it is smoother, more radiant and look healthier. A use-test demonstrates suitability for sensitive skins,” highlights the French company. The active’s action throughout the epidermis was demonstrated in vitro and ex vivo on advanced skin models. “Tested on 3D cellular models and skin biopsies, the biological mechanism is fully understood and documented,” claims Gattefossé. The company thus demonstrated that Gatuline Renew increases keratinocyte energy and boosts all processes essential to proper epidermal reconstruction: proliferation, differentiation, cornification and desquamation. It increases the biosynthesis of key ceramides, improving corneocyte cohesion.  As a result, the thickness of the healthy living epidermal layers is visibly increased. “The skin fully recovers its barrier function ensuring optimal preservation of water content and improved auto-regulation.” Gatuline Renew is an extract of buds of Cryptomeria japonica, a Japanese cedar tree which grows in the clean air environment of the French Reunion Island. The buds, harvested by hand from the lower parts of the trees, are air dried and sent to Gattefossé’s French production site near Lyon for extraction. These buds contain a high amount of skin-stimulating molecules including a specific diterpenoid named isopimaric acid which is a signature molecule of the plant species and the main contributor to the skin renewal efficacy. They also contain high levels of polyphenols, peptides, sugars and lipidic compounds. Obtained using vegetable-derived solvents, this ECOCERT/ COSMOS approved and NPA certified ingredient can be used in natural and organic cosmetic lines. Gattefossé also says that Gatuline Renew is fully traced from plant to pack. In order to illustrate the formulation possibilities offered by its active, Gattefossé has showcased several skin care formulations during in-cosmetics: a skin rejuvenation elixir, a daily revitalizer, a powdery blur reinvented, a night regenerator, a reviving body cocoon."
Are ingredients derived from food wastes the ultimate sustainability advance?,"About a third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted in the supply chain indicate Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates.  With food companies and retailers under pressure to become more efficient and reduce losses, many are re-directing food waste from landfill.  According to market research firm Organic Monitor, a transition is occurring whereby waste previously going to low-end applications - such as animal feed and biogas - is making its way into new ingredients.  “Novel ingredients are being created from food waste as new technologies improve extraction and processing methods,” highlights Organic Monitor.  For instance, the Swiss company FoodSolutionsTeam is using green chemistry to extract active materials from food side streams. Made from carrot pulp, its KaroPRO ingredient has water binding applications in processed foods. The Swiss company has similar food ingredients made from organic linseed, peas and rice. Phytonext is another company using new extraction techniques to produce ingredients from citrus peel and tomato waste. The European Union is also funding research to create new ingredients from food waste. The BIORICE project involves extracting starch from rice waste to make ingredients for functional foods, nutraceuticals and cosmetics. Another project, APROPOS, involves taking proteins from salmon and rapeseed waste for cosmetic applications. A Spanish cosmetics firm plans to use the novel extract as a foundation for a new cream product. Such ingredients have already made headway in natural personal care products.  The Marks & Spencer department store is using resveratrol from grape waste in its Super Grape skin care products. The grape waste is coming from the production of the retailer’s own label wines. The French company Caudalie has built its entire range of natural personal care products from grapevine-based and grapeseed ingredients, such as resveratrol and polyphenols. Organic Monitor research finds the brand leads the French natural cosmetics market; its products are now present in over 30 countries. With the global population projected to reach 9 billion by 2050 and agricultural land becoming increasingly scarce, more investment is expected in creating new ingredients from food waste. “A recurring theme in the Sustainable Foods Summit and Sustainable Cosmetics Summit  [two events organised by Organic Monitor] is ‘closing loops’ whereby waste materials find a new life in fresh applications. Organisations like TerraCycle have been successful in closing the packaging loop for consumer products; it remains to be seen how soon waste from food streams will find better lives,” concludes Organic Monitor."
"Blue light, a new target for anti-aging products?","In most markets, the search for anti-aging formulas that can protect the skin against the harmful effects of the exposome remains one of the main focuses.  While anti-pollution innovation was recently put under the spotlights, protections against the light spectrum rays (UV rays included) remain the market’s main sellers, with over 800 new anti photo-ageing products launched over 12 last months. In addition to UVA, UVB and infrared, the blue light is now viewed as new inflammation factor from which the skin needs to be protected. ""Excessive blue light accelerates the oxidation process, it stimulates the keratinocytes and acts on melatonin causing the apparition of spots,"" explains Gérard Redziniak, PhD, scientific consultant and formulator of dermo-cosmetic products. During the latest edition of the in-cosmetics tradeshow, Greentech, a specialist in biotechnology, was addressing directly this new concern with the launch of Soliberine, a new daily global photoprotective active. According to Greentech, Soliberine is an antioxidant and free radical-scavenger, which stimulates cellular detoxification systems, protects from inflammation, and prevents photoaging.  It is derived from Buddleja officinalis flowers, or butterflybush, coming from the Chinese province of Sichuan.  Soliberine is reduces the production of free radicals induced by blue light rays (from LED, smartphones, screens ...) and therefore fights premature aging.  It also acts on UV-induced lipid peroxidation and inhibits the synthesis of MMP-1 (which degrades the fibres of the dermal matrix) caused by infrared rays. A real booster of natural filters, Soliberine is a real antioxidant and anti-inflammatory solution for sensitive skins. An appropriate response to photo-ageing for ""enlightened"" consumers."
Univar accelerates the pace of innovation,"At the latest edition of the in-cosmetics tradeshow, which was held in Paris from April 12-14, 2016, Univar unveiled an edgy mix of personal care prototypes inspired from urban trends and from the energy of high-fashion looks. The Savage Glamour collection features 15 innovative skin care, sun care, hair care, body care, and make-up formulations designed using Univar’s broad portfolio of specialty ingredients from leading global producers, including Dow Corning, Dow Personal Care, Kao, and Naturex. “We refocused on a smaller number of key global suppliers. With their support we are accelerating the pace of innovation with the aim to provide our customers with innovative solutions every four months,” explains Matthew Ottaway, Personal Care Industry Director EMEA chez Univar. In practice, all of the proposed formulas were designed using the ingredients provided by no more that 15 manufacturers and available at a global scale.  Univar nevertheless succeeded in offering bold and non-traditional products. “The Savage Glamour trend speaks to the high-energy, beauty-conscious, and glamorous city-dwelling shopper,” said Arnita Wofford, Head of Marketing, EMEA, Univar Personal Care. The formulations were gathered into two sub-trends: – Savage - Urban Safari, defined by a distinctive, bold, and assertive look with formulas that are feminine and fierce, as well as fun (including: shimmering jelly-jiggle texture to liven up everyday eye shadow; revitalizing LOHAS shampoo; fast-dry air-drying hair conditioner; savagely hot protector spray; biomimetic antipollution skin cream; gel cream formula to nourish city-worn skin; hair-care gel to tame even the wildest curls). – Glamour - Embellished Sugar, with sensual formulations boasting fruity and colourful flavours (including: honey drizzle body oil; raspberry smooth-N-shine syrup leave-in hair serum; pastel marshmallow coloured eye shadow base; cherry bomb lip tint-in oil; butter cream shower frosting; passion fruit exfoliating marmalade; hard candy cuticle barrier; pink sun protection cream). To keep pace with these innovations and meet the needs of its customers worldwide, Univar invests heavily in creating new development and application labs.  Two new centres of excellence will open in Brussels and Paris next June, and will be followed by openings in Dubai, Cairo and Milan, in the fourth quarter 2016."
SEPPIC combines eco-design and innovative textures,"SEPPIC’s five Beauty Care laboratories throughout the world (USA, Brazil, France, China) have created eight new green formulas. This collaborative initiative has been built around three of the company’s CSR [1] policy commitments: decreasing environmental impact, innovating sustainably, making the company socially responsible.  “Indeed, CSR performance is not only linked to naturally derived ingredients,” explains Nathalie Chevrot, Beauty Care Market Manager at SEPPIC. In order to limit water use in the packaging process and to reduce the carbon footprint, SEPPIC has launched a series of water-free highly concentrated formulas.  Water is added by consumers when using the products: – Featherweight. So Concentrated! So Nice! is a concentrated slimming cream that can easily be reconstituted by adding an equal amount of water. The formula contains the slimming active ingredient Rhodysterol S and the polymer SEPIPLUS S to thicken the water-free formula.
– Concentrated Foaming Power, a reconstituted and easily biodegradable concentrated formula, rich in active matter (27%), which is a cost-effective solution with the foaming ingredients PROTEOL APL, ORAMIX CG 110 and ORAMIX GB 10 with ideal foaming qualities (very stable, dense, abundant foam). By adding water at the last minute, you can make different foaming products: cleanser, shampoo, and more. Developed by SEPPIC in Brazil, the Jugaad (an Indian term regarding the capacity to do more with less) concept features three minimalist detox body care products made from the same six ingredients (including two active ingredients) to which a new ingredient was added with a cold application process to obtain various sensory textures. Two formulas illustrating the company’s commitment to community projects were showcased: – Responsibly Sourced Palm - AntiPollution Cream, formulated with MONTANOV 68 MB and active ingredients with Book&Claim RSPO certification.
– Purifying and Hydrating Cream - Inspired in France. Formulated with a “locavore” approach with ingredients sourced as near as possible to the company’s research laboratory in Castres, in southwest France. The cream is composed of AQUAXYL, a hydrating, sugar derived active ingredient developed by our green chemistry experts; FLUIDIPURE 8G, a biomimetic, purifying active ingredient; the biosourced emulsifier MONTANOV 202; and SEPIPLUS, an inverse latex polymer that provides high stability. SEPPIC also showcased Algae Spaghetti Make Up Remover, a biphasic gel with a green spaghetti shape, formulated with Royal Sugar Kelp (PHLOROGINETM BG PF) a brown alga sourced in Brittany, JUVENESSENCE AD, an extract from brown seaweed, and a SOLAGUM TARA - Agar association to obtain the solid, elastic and stable jellified spaghetti, among other ingredients. Last but not least, the Ecofriendly Deodorant, formulated as a sprayable white emulsion for a deo less polluting than an aerosol. With these illustrative formulas, SEPPIC evidenced the wide array of opportunities now available to formulators to combine ethics and innovation! Two new emollients ranges At in-cosmetics 2016, SEPPIC also unveiled EMOSMART and EMOGREEN, two emollient ranges for cosmetic applications, produced by Total Special Fluids using a patented distillation and purification process, and commercialized by SEPPIC. The two oil ranges (alkanes) are readily biodegradable. “The inert chemical structure of EMOSMART, from synthetic origin, and EMOGREEN, from plant origin, make them suitable for versatile applications in skin and hair care, make-up, sun care, cleansing. They can be formulated in extreme conditions, for example in formulations with high or low pH, or which are rich in stressful molecules. Compatible with any kind of oils, easy-to-use, EMOSMART and EMOGREEN sweep a broad sensory palette in term of textures,” says Sabrina Mizaël, Emollients & Emulsifiers Product Manager at SEPPIC. Beyond its full biodegradability, the EMOGREEN range is 100% bio-sourced.  It is therefore an alternative to silicone oils for consumers looking for naturalness and environmental respect. For SEPPIC, the development of this new range of ingredients complies with a responsible approach on the long term and meets the requirements of its customers and consumers."
Berkem launches a new range of botanical extracts and floral waters,"At the in-cosmetics tradeshow, held in Paris from April 12th to 14th 2016, Berkem unveiled its new botanical extracts and floral waters range: Botanykem.  For the French plant extraction expert, the aim was to places the power of the botanical world at the service of beauty through a wide range of exotic and traditional French plants carefully selected for their reputation or ancestral use, and compatible with any water-based cosmetic formulas. The botanical extracts are obtained from an eco-friendly low temperature extraction process with a short kinetic that extracts maximum molecules while maintaining efficiency.  Preservative-free and based on a glycerin and water form, they are a natural source of active molecules (flavonoids, tannins, vitamins, AHA, saponins, carotenoids, and so on). As for floral waters, extracted by distillation and source of aromatic molecules, they will boost formulas by bringing ‘active water’. On the occasion of the in-cosmetics tradeshow, these ingredients have been showcased through the French Beauty Routine formulation concept.  “The French woman embodies an inspiring ideal of femininity. She also represents elegance and beauty,” explained the company. Four formulas were developed. Each one includes two botanical extracts and one floral water: – Waking-up! Toning shower gel. To stimulate the body and the senses thanks to an invigorating scent and a yellowish flashy colour. 
– Preparing! Soothing serum. To regenerate and calm the skin. 
– Nourishing! Moisturizing gel cream. To nourish the skin, even complexion and bring a fresh effect. 
– Protecting! Protective hand cream. Its butter-like texture moisturizes and protects the skin against environmental aggressions. ""The variety of these formulas demonstrates our new range is suitable for hygiene and care products both for the body and the face,"" highlighted Julie Droux, marketing manager, Berkem. Berkemyol potentilla awarded by BSB Berkem’s anti-aging Berkemyol potentilla active ingredient scooped the third prize during the BSB Innovation Awards ceremony that took place during this year In-cosmetics in Paris. Since 2003, the consulting company BSB, created by Dr. Jan-H. Riedel, awards every year the best cosmetic product and raw material innovations alongside the In-cosmetics tradeshow.  Berkemyol potentilla active ingredient, took third place in the category « Natural products - most innovative raw material ». Obtained by a patented technology, Berkemyol potentilla is a highly purified active ingredient extracted from potentilla rhizomes, rich in stabilized polyphenols. With anti-aging and antioxidant properties, it also has anti-glycation activity clinically proven. In 2015, Berkemyol potentilla already won the Advanced Ingredient Award."
in-cosmetics celebrates record-breaking 2016 edition as global cosmetic ingredients market surges,"The last edition of the in-cosmetics show was the largest edition in its 26-year history. Over three days, 9,726 unique visitors attended the event - a 14 per cent increase on the 2015 event.  Visitors hailed from 131 countries, with 63 per cent travelling to France from other European countries, as well as Asia, North America and South America. Covering 16,236sqm (1508 m2), the 2016 show’s footprint also increased by 11 per cent, while exhibitor numbers rose from 708 to 784. “This year’s in-cosmetics was busy from the first minute,” said Valérie Lavallée, Product Manager at Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Hundreds of visitors joined this year’s Marketing Trends presentations over the three days. Particularly well-attended were seminars presented by Jamie Mills of Canadean who discussed the opportunities in anti-ageing, and a session on US trends and their local and global impact given by David Tyrrell of Mintel. Delegates were also keen to hear the latest views on green, natural and organic products, dermocosmetology and the use of 3D printing in the cosmetic industry. During the event, the in-cosmetics Group announced a rebrand of its shows. Boasting a new logo, the Europe-based event will now be known as in-cosmetics Global, reflecting its international audience. The organiser also revealed that the 2017 event will take place in London for the first time in over 15 years. Strong market growth Fuelled by the strong demand for good quality and effective cosmetic products, the global cosmetic ingredients market is forecasted to grow at high rates between 2016 and 2026.  Changing lifestyle in developing regions of Asia Pacific and Latin America, increase in per capita income, rising awareness about beautification and increasingly urbanized population, as well as ageing population in developed countries, will bring a sea of opportunities to cosmetic ingredients manufacturers and suppliers. According to Kline, performance-oriented multifunctional personal care ingredients have grown the fastest in 2015.  “As formulators are increasingly selecting specialty ingredients to improve the performance of their formulations, the share for such personal care ingredients has increased from 40% to 45% over the past several years,” explains the market research firm in a recently published Personal Care Ingredients: Global Market Analysis. For example, consumption of preservative boosters, such as caprylyl glycol, glyceryl caprylate, and ethylhexylglycerin, is growing at the expense of traditional preservatives as they also deliver emolliency to formulations. Similarly, PEG derivatives that act as a rheology modifier and also have emulsifying properties have increased over the past few years and are expected to grow further in the future. According to Kline, synthetic ingredients are dominating the personal care ingredient industry, but natural ingredients are increasing their share as consumers are looking for products with such ingredients. The next edition of in-cosmetics Global will take place at London’s ExCeL from 4-6 April 2017."
Naturex fights photo-ageing with cherry blossom,"Although sunshine is an essential source of wellbeing and health, especially for vitamin D and endorphin production, it’s no secret that repeated sun exposure often results in premature skin aging.  Eager to protect their skin against UV ray damages, consumers are increasingly looking for products that deliver performance for a long-lasting youthful look. The human body has developed a group of natural mechanisms to minimize damage to the skin caused by UV radiation. But as time goes by (and with repeated exposure), these repair mechanisms wear down.  “UV-induced inflammation and disorganization of collagen fibrils can occur along with dramatic effects on skin barrier function,” explains Naturex. To protect the skin against the harmful effects of sunlight, Naturex has used its new generation a patented extraction process - the so called Eutectigenesis [1] - to extract precious botanical actives from cherry blossoms sourced in the heart of Provence, less than 50 miles from the company’s French processing facility.  The fresh flowers, a by-product of cherry fruit cultivation, are carefully handpicked within the usual cultivation process.  These fragile and short-lived flowers can deliver powerful cosmetic benefits especially when they are carefully grown and harvested. Indeed, tests conducted by Naturex shows that Cherry Blossom Eutectys has anti-inflammatory effects, by inhibition of TNF-α release.  “Its anti-oxidant benefits also prevent oxidative stress and avoid any triggering of the DJ1-Nrf2 pathway,” says the company. Cherry Blossom also has firming and regenerating effects as “it increases collagen synthesis and inhibits MMP-1 release, which contributes to the repair of the Extra Cellular Matrix.” Last but not least, according to Naturex, the new botanical active helps to improve the skin barrier function by increasing cell-to-cell adhesion and cornification. To showcase the benefits of this new botanical active, Naturex has developed three new applications, which were presented at the in-cosmetic tradeshow: a face fluid, and hydrating face oil and a rejuvenating mask."
Skincare: What strategies against pollution?,"On the eve of the opening of the in-cosmetics tradeshow in Paris (12-14 April 2016), Premium Beauty News is offering its readers a special issue dedicated to cosmetic ingredients.  This year again, ingredients suppliers will showcase a wide portfolio of anti-pollution actives among their innovations. According to Mintel, between 2011 and 2013, there was a 40% increase in the number of cosmetics marketed which displayed an anti-pollution claim, in particular in the Asian-Pacific region. Cosmetic ingredient suppliers have adopted different types of strategies, for instance, by isolating the skin from the external environment with a non-occlusive film, or, by banking on powerful antioxidants, anti-lipoperoxidants, anti-glycation agents, or anti-free radical ingredients. Certain companies go even farther by developing turnkey concepts. Furthermore, the development of these new actives requires developing in vivo, in vitro, and ex vivo biological tests adapted to this new anti-pollution trend.

Brazil promotes the Amazonian forest’s bio-economy to the cosmetics industry,"The Amazonian forest covers about 4 million km2 throughout the Brazilian territory. As the lungs of the Earth, it shelters the greatest biodiversity, natural resources, and traditional knowledge in the world, and represents a unique potential for identifying new cosmetic actives. Today, Brazil intends to develop a real bio-economy with this heritage. “We don’t just aim to be a source of raw materials, but rather to develop partnerships and knowledge and become the leading supplier of authentic, quality products derived from biodiversity,” explains Maria Beatriz Martins da Costa, CEO of Planeta Orgânico / Green Rio, a platform that promotes sustainable initiatives and a partner of the project. The SEBRAE project, named “Cosméticos de base florestal da Amazonia”, gathers Brazilian state representatives of the Amazonian region: Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima, Maranhão, Mato Grosso, and Tocantins. Each of them coordinates the project for the promotion and competitiveness of local and independent ingredient producers, who are real guardians of Brazil’s biodiversity. “About sixty microbusinesses are involved right now, but we estimate they only represent 2% of the potential. So, there still remains 98% to be explored in order to develop,” declares Aécio Flavio Ferreira da Silva, Director of SEBRAE – State of Amazonas. The project is based on a coordinated policy and the creation of partnerships with institutions and universities. It aims at activating performance levers like the access to knowledge in technologies and innovation, in particular with the validation of extraction techniques, the distribution and the study of production chains, profit distribution, regulatory issues, and the opening to cosmetics markets. During their visit in France, the SEBRAE representatives of the different Brazilian States concerned met their Cosmetic Valley counterparts to discuss a partnership."
Naturex is launching an open innovation program,"Naturex wants to give a boost to the pace of its innovations, with the aim to shape the future of the ingredient industry and to generate 10% sales through new product developments by 2020.  The French headquartered supplier of speciality plant-based natural ingredients wants to go beyond traditional partnerships with academic and scientific authorities or simple licensing agreements. “In a climate of constant change, collaboration and open-mindedness are essential,” explains Naturex. As part of this open innovation initiative, Naturex intends to partner with new start-up companies whose promising business ideas and technologies may be valuable to the company’s development. Partnerships will include extensive advice and mentoring on various levels, (regulatory, legal, logistics, marketing etc.) and Naturex will also make its facilities - for example the analytical or application labs- available to the chosen candidates. Naturex is also planning to establish a Technology Advisory Group (TAG), which will include highly respected technology business actors and/or key academic opinion leaders. Privileged research areas shall include biotechnologies, new extraction and cultivation processes, identification of new botanicals or digital marketing technologies. Doug Klaiber, CEO of Naturex-DBS division, has been asked to set up this Open Innovation Initiative.  “Doug’s background as an entrepreneur in innovative ingredients at Decas Botanical Synergies (DBS), a company acquired by Naturex in 2012, make him the ideal candidate for this mission,” explains the company. Naturex and Mazza Innovation partner for the production cranberry extracts Canadian company Mazza Innovation will use its patented pressurized low-polarity water (PLPW) extraction technology to produce cranberry extracts exclusively for Naturex. The PhytoClean Method is an earth-friendly way to extract bioactives from plants using only water and produces clean, non-solvent-derived ingredients. The green technology efficiently extracts bioactive compounds, including polyphenols, alkaloids, glycosides and specialty carbohydrates that can be used as ingredients for functional foods, dietary supplements and beauty products. “This open innovation partnership with Mazza Ltd is a great opportunity to bring the global market new natural clean-label ingredients using environmental friendly technologies. As one of the foremost companies in the field of natural healthcare solutions, Naturex is fully aware of the importance of supporting innovative ideas and processes from various sources. The collaboration with Mazza Ltd is one of the first steps in our recently-launched global open innovation program,” said Olivier Rigaud, CEO of Naturex."
"Exsymol, cosmetics innovation in the heart of Monaco","When it was founded in 1972, Exsymol, an independent family-run company specialized in the design and manufacturing of cosmetic actives, settled in an eight-storey industrial plant located in the heart of Monaco’s Fontvieille quarter. It now spreads across a surface of 5,300 square metres divided into four levels, right by the Mediterranean sea, where it produces almost 400 tons of cosmetic actives every year. Enough to make several hundreds of millions of beauty product units! And the site has just been certified to the EFfCI GMP guidelines. This exceptional situation does have advantages, but also a few drawbacks, in particular as regards logistics. “Settling right in the city centre meant we had to meet stringent anti-pollution standards,” Christophe Paillet emphasizes. “As a result, we almost immediately used non-polluting extraction and synthesis processes and green chemistry. And today, we are perfectly in line with the market demand.” Last November, the company actually won the Monaco Eco Club Sustainable Development Trophy, beating 800 other companies. Among others, Exsymol was rewarded for the development of a new active based on the natural by-products made by the neighbouring Grasse perfumery industry. “Customer expectations have considerably changed,” explains Christophe Paillet. “Efficacy requirements have strengthened and are now reinforced by strong environmental requirements. In addition, marketing needs actives to tell a special story.” In order to meet these demands, almost a quarter of the company’s employees have been working on research and development. As a result, Exsymol has registered hundreds of patents all around the world, covering over 40 molecules! “Most of them are new molecules or active families, and not mere composition patents,” Christophe Paillet specifies. Innovation and scientific requirements lie at the core of the company’s DNA, as it started its business in the field of pharmaceutics. In the early 1980s, the discovery of a new family of organic silicon derivatives, silanols, helped Exsymol develop their expertise in glycation processes and intercellular communication. Then, the development of peptoids permanently confirmed their focus on the production of cosmetic actives, which managers had considered very early as a decisive factor in the development of the beauty industry. Today, the company still mainly produces two categories of actives: silicon derivatives, skin structuring elements that normalize its metabolism, and peptide derivatives obtained after conducting in-depth research on the oxidation processes within the cells, which play a role in particular in the fight against glycation, and pave the way for innovations like neurocosmetics. If its culture is definitely scientific-based, with a very strong focus on efficacy, the company knows how to take advantage of its environment by collaborating more and more with local players such as Grasse perfumers. Indeed, Exsymol has been developing an increasing number of natural actives for its core markets in skincare cosmetics: dermocosmetics and cosmeceutics."
Cosmetagora 2016: Natural ingredients make a clean sweep,"BASF stayed focused on anti-ageing products with Neurobiox, a 100 per cent natural-based active that stimulates cell renewal and increases epidermis thickness, while effectively blurring the imperfections of aging skin. Containing extracts of yarrow (achillea millefolium), Neurobiox reduces pores and wrinkles and makes the skin look and feel significantly softer. The ingredients supplier also showcased Speci’Men - the first active ingredient specifically developed for men’s high collagen density skin. A 100 per cent natural-based and ECOCERT-approved Baobab leaf extract Speci’Men targets versican, a proteoglycan which is key to the skin’s viscoelastic properties and specifically to the health of men’s skin, but which accumulates with age, and loses its functionality in men’s. Expanscience highlighted two new eco-designed actives from botanical origin: – Macaline, is the company’s first active dedicated to body care and body fitting. Derived from maca (Lepidium Meyenii) extracts, the ingredient was designed as an alternative to caffeine in slimming and anti-cellulite body care products.
– Pixalia, a ""smart sebum regulator"" derived from an African plant (Gynandropsis gynandra or Cleome gynandra, which is grown in Burkina Faso in compliance with organic farming rules. Monaco’s Exsymol presented new clinical data confirming the effectiveness of MeiYanol, an anti-dark circles and anti-puffiness active. This eco-responsible elderflower extract fights against inflammation around the eye, an area which extremely sensitive to the effects of stress, UV, pollution, fatigue and aging. Gattefossé chose to put under the spotlights ingredients awarded in Asia, such as Gatuline Spot-Light, or based on Asian plants (Whu Zhu Yu, Sophora Flavescens, lotus, ginger or bamboo extracts), through a series of formulations inspired from Asian beauty routines.  The list of showcased formulas includes: a revitalizing and oxygenating Cloud Mask with an ultra soft texture, for a hydrated and radiant skin, and a Detox oxygen mask with a trendy black appearance and anti-blemish and conditioners actives. For his part, ID bio has presented three illustrative formulations dedicated to detoxification: – D-tox my hair, a protective hair gel formulated with Cell’Intact, an anti-oxidant and anti-pollution active derived from buckwheat, macerated açaí oil (antioxidant and anti-aging effect) and a moringa extract (purifying and depolluting action),
– Intense Night Detox, a regenerating sleeping pack formulated with Mag’inTense, a moisturizing active derived from mango, a blueberry extract (anti-aging, toning and revitalizing action) and a titrated extract of Rose Hip (regenerating and energizing action),
– Bye bye makeup Detox, a cleansing oil presented as a D phase gel (oil to cream) which emulsifies with water to remove makeup and impurities (Marigold macerated oil, goji extract macerated in oil, orange blossom extract). Imerys Minerals, the world’s leading supplier of mineral-based specialties, launched ImerCare Velluto, its latest development for superior coverage in pressed powder foundations. Sourced in the French Pyrenees, ImerCare Velluto derives from natural magnesium silicate. It has been engineered using patented technology to obtain an innovative structure which enhances cohesion and imparts multiple optical and sensory properties to make-up powders. Moreover, “unlike many mineral powders on the market, ImerCare Velluto can easily be used in wet processes and prevents cracking,” claims Imerys. Naturex also detailed its six new extracts derived from its innovative Eutectigenesis extraction process that we presented last week. With the concept ""Treasure oils"", Soliance illustrated the potentialities of the various oils and actives of its portfolio through a series of formulas building on the success of oil-like formulations. Among the four formulas presented during the show, the ""Gradual tanning miracle oil, BB oil FPS 20"" featured Soliance’s brand new Vegetan Gold, the first 00% oil soluble self-tanner. Last but not least, Silab took an interest in anti-pollution and launched Mitokinyl an active - once again from natural origin - highly concentrated in glucomanates. It restores the synthesis of mitokines, that are negatively impacted by pollution, enhances the stratification and functionality of the skin’s external layers and boosts the recovery capacity of the skin barrier."
Naturex extracts plants’ most precious molecules,"The new Eutectys collection will be launched at the Cosmetagora tradeshow, which will be held on 12-13 January 2016 in Paris.  This new generation of botanical extracts is based on a patented extraction process called Eutectigenesis.  This new technology allows extracting active compounds synthesized at the very core of the plant cell.  These metabolites, which are not always fully soluble in water or in lipid phases, are stored and transported by plants in a third type of liquid phase, the so-called natural deep eutectic solvents (NaDES). According to Naturex, “this breakthrough eco-extraction technology offers a natural alternative to conventional solvents and makes it possible to capture the plant cell’s most precious metabolites, in order to obtain biomimetic extracts with augmented phytoactive profiles and improved performance.” The Eutectys collection is composed of six high-definition extracts including, among others, olive leaf, saffron flower, and horsetail, all well-known for their restoring and anti-ageing properties, and available for skin and hair formulations. “Nature-inspired products have been setting the trend over the last few years as cosmetic formulators are constantly looking to expand the category in a sustainable way. NaDES are an innovative way to answer market demand,” explains Naturex. For this world premiere, Naturex has signed a partnership with Scionix, a company responsible for marketing the new solvent systems developed by Professor Andrew Abbott and his research group from the University of Leicester, United Kingdom, who pioneering research on deep eutectic solvents. In addition to this licensing agreement on the patents granted to Professor Abbott and his team, Naturex and Scionix will join forces on fundamental and applied research in the field. “The use of deep eutectic solvents holds huge potential for the cosmetic category as well as numerous other industries. We are convinced that this technology is a game-changing innovation, and these joint research efforts in collaboration with the team that discovered NaDES technology will ensure rapid and successful results,” says Antoine Bily, Naturex’s Head of Research & Development."
Croda unveils new data on conditioning efficacy for a broad range of hair types,"Variations in hair morphology can cause performance differences in ingredients used in hair care products, making testing on different ethnic hair types to show efficacy very important. Croda’s new data reveals its Crodazoquat MCC [1] conditioning active restores hydrophobicity to hair, improves hair aesthetics and delivers a consumer-perceivable feel improvement on both natural and relaxed African hair.  Crodazoquat MCC had already been proven to be effective on Caucasian, Asian and Brazilian hair types. Croda’s ingredient should therefore help the company’s customers overcome the challenges formulating for different ethnic hair types that have unique hair characteristics. “ A need for multicultural solutions has arisen globally , including in developed markets, such as the US, that are becoming increasingly diverse.  Crodazoquat MCC is designed to be effective across multiple ethnic hair types- a truly multicultural conditioner for a diverse world that is progressively connected,” said Denise Costrini, Marketing Manager – Hair Care, Croda North America. In order to best assess performance on African hair, a conditioner containing Crodazoquat MCC was salon tested on consumers with natural African hair and relaxed African hair.  Attributes that are particularly important to address African hair needs were added to the standard list of attributes used to evaluate other hair types: Breakage, Density, and Ease of Styling. The conditioner containing Crodazoquat MCC outperformed the commercial African hair conditioner benchmark on dry aesthetics for both the natural and relaxed hair, satisfying the consumer needs for anti-breakage, desired density, and ease of styling."
Chronobiology: Which actives to get the skin back into the right rhythm?,"The skin goes through different phases in 24 hours. During the day, it defends itself against external aggressions like the wind, the sun, the cold, or pollution. At night, it regenerates. It was evidenced that the highest number of cell divisions occurs between midnight and 1am, and the lowest between 12pm and 1pm. The skin’s blood flow is at its maximum between 11pm and 4am, which makes it possible to provide nutrients and remove toxins. And it is between 7pm and 11pm that desquamation on the superficial stratum corneum is the most important. In addition, the skin has receptors for melatonin which, on top of their role as circadian synchronizers, are excellent at trapping free radicals. In the late 1990s, researchers highlighted the existence of the ‘Clock’ gene as a central regulator for monitoring the circadian clock. According to Neil Astles, Marketing Manager for biofunctional actives at Ashland Specialty Ingredients, “more than 20% of the expression of a tissue’s genes depends on circadian regulation”. Given these observations, cosmetic active suppliers have been developing various types of molecules. Some of them target circadian genes and help them resynchronize, like Chronocyclin®, by Exsymol, which can partially reproduce the effect of sun radiation in relation to the expression of circadian genes. The chrono-peptide studied on reconstructed epidermises kept in the dark shows an activation of the Clock and Period1 genes according to a circadian rhythm similar to the activation initiated by UV radiation. The Chronocyclin® product is an anti-aging active that stimulates defence and cell regeneration physiological activities. As for Nocturshape™, by Lipotec, it focuses on circadian genes Clock and Bmal1 and on the regulation of the production of nocturnin, a protein that acts at night and enhances both the accumulation of lipids in the cells and lipogenesis. Nocturshape™ has firming and slimming properties. Silab’s Circagenyl® is rich in lindera oligo-alpha-glucans and helps fight against the desynchronization of the human fibroblasts circadian clock by acting on the expression of the Clock circadian gene. The effects measured are comparable to those obtained with a light therapy treatment and boosted if the two routes of administration are combined: application of a topical product with 3% of Circagenyl® associated with light therapy sessions. The results show increased skin hydration, tone and elasticity, smoother microrelief, and a more radiant complexion. Another way to tackle chronocosmetology is to act on the synthesis of melatonin. With Prodizia®, Sederma manages to rebalance the synthesis of this hormone by glycation-stressed fibroblasts. Prodizia® contributes to visibly reducing the signs of fatigue by repairing and protecting the skin from the damages caused by glycation, leaving the skin rested, just like after a good night’s sleep. Lastly, another method consists in helping the cells keep their energy so they can better resist against daily aggressions. Active molecules mainly act on mitochondria. Seppic’s Sepitonic M3 is a combination of minerals essential for the balance of cells and organic anions, for a chrono-energizing, anti-free radical, intercellular communication-boosting effect. The will to develop chronocosmetology is gaining more and more importance, especially with the emergence of Sleeping packs. These products from Korea offer the perfect solution to counter the effects of lack of sleep on the skin, and promise to reproduce the virtues of a good night’s sleep, even if it only lasted a few hours. “In Asia, it is said that the first three hours of sleep, called ‘Golden Time’, are the most important for the skin. In Korea, there is also an expression, meaning ‘well-slept face’, to refer to a beautiful face. It is conveyed by the face of a sleeping woman”, explains Florence Bernardin, expert in Asian cosmetics trends and founder of the Information & Inspiration marketing intelligence firm. Vichy and Garnier have developed sleeping packs, respectively with Idealia Skin Sleep and Miracle Sleeping Cream. But other sectors like the slimming segment are also targeting the sleeping body, more sensitive to fat storage, as can be seen in particular with Phytocéane’s Chrono Night Express Contouring Bi-Gel. With these products, no one will ever worry about the consequences of the legal time change on the skin, and even less about short nights!"
Berkem wants to help skin to face its daily environment,"As a barrier between the environment and our body, skin is constantly exposed to many aggressions (UV, cold, pollution, etc.) that weaken it.  All day long, the environment put a severe strain on skin, which has to permanently adapt itself. Thus the day skin faces and protects against various stresses and the night it recovers and regenerates. “Constituting the first defence line of our body, skin requires special attention and appropriate care,” explains Berkem. To help the skin in this mission, Berkem leverages its expertise in plant extraction and its wide portfolio of polyphenol-rich actives.  “These powerful antioxidants are important for protecting the skin, especially against external stress, as well as for enhancing its regeneration.” In order to exemplify how it is possible to help the skin to protect itself, Berkem has presented a new concept called Global 24h at the latest Beyond Beauty Paris tradeshow. The concept combines two skin cares: one for a day protection phase and one for a night repair phase. The two products have opposite textures but complementary functions for an uninterrupted defence: – Protect’day care: an airy and light day cream which contains the “Berkemyol Potentille” active ingredient. These stabilized potentilla polyphenols provide the skin with necessary elements to effectively fight against oxidative stress and defend itself. – Repair’night cream: a night cream with a rich and creamy texture.  “Ko’zen active ingredient is a quince leaf extract that soothes damaged skin, decreases inflammatory reactions and calms irritation. The skin is regenerated and revitalized,” claims Berkem. The Advanced Ingredient Award honours Berkem
 Berkemyol Potentille, a highly purified active ingredient rich in stabilized polyphenols (> 95%) extracted from potentilla rhizomes, scooped the Advanced Ingredient Award, which was given to the most innovative skincare ingredient at Beyond Beauty Paris 2015 [1].

Polyphenol molecules are known as being unstable, especially OPCs when highly concentrated. Berkem has patented a method for stabilizing polyphenols which consists to protect phenolic functions thanks to ester functions. The active form of stabilized polyphenols is released at the heart of the epidermis due to the action of esterase enzyme naturally found in the skin. “With this unique technology, active molecules are protected until application on the skin,” highlights Berkem."
Symrise brings the freshness and benefits of plant juices to cosmetics,"Some years ago, fruit smoothies became a trend, with people appreciating the quick and convenient vitamin boost they offered. Now, the trend has evolved to green smoothies, which offer alternatives to the standard fruity options, chock-full of green leafy components and vegetables. This “green smoothie” trend originated in the US and the UK and is now spreading around the globe. Consumers associate green smoothies with fresh, natural and healthy benefits provided in an easy-to-consume format. Tapping into this trend, Symrise’s Cosmetic Ingredient Division is launching a range of freshly pressed plant juice varieties that can be incorporated into cosmetic applications.  Gentle manual pressing directly after harvesting ensures the preservation of the plant’s valuable ingredients. Their properties have been tested in-vitro.  For instance, state-of-the-art in-vitro screening has confirmed that fresh plant juices have especially strong antioxidant capacities as well as soothing and moisturizing properties. For ginger, additional skin-brightening properties were confirmed. “Customers will benefit from a unique and natural product range, backed-up by substantiated data from efficacy studies and supported by market insight and formulation concepts. The plant juice varieties are suitable for a vast number of cosmetic applications and beyond, e.g. hair, face and body care,” claims the company. An additional plus is the local and organic farming that meets the increasing consumer demand for natural sourcing. The plants are harvested near their production site to obtain the freshest, most unadulterated and most natural juice possible.  Dandelion, horsetail, melissa, ribwort and stinging nettles are grown and harvested in Germany.  A ginger juice from Sri Lanka rounds out the portfolio. Also most of the plants for Symrise plant juice varieties are grown organic and fully traceable back to the field; the Ecocert certification is underway."
Bulgaria relies on geographical indication to protect its rose oil,"The ""Bulgarian rose oil"" is an essential oil obtained by distillation of rose petals from Rosa Damascena.  The specific distinctive qualities of the Bulgarian rose oil are its rich and lasting aroma, pale yellow-green colour, as well as a balanced composition of volatiles and hydrocarbons. Since October 2014, the protected geographical indication (PGI) acknowledges the fact that these characteristics are closely related to the geography of the area and differentiate it from rose oil produced in other parts of the world. Furthermore, the quality of the Bulgarian rose oil is guaranteed by specific requirements for processing of the rose petals within 10-12 hours after being picked. In addition, the flower picking has to be done very early in the morning and only open buds shall be picked. ""We go out very early as the roses must be picked while there’s still dew on them. Then the yield is highest,"" says Totka Hristova, one of an army of workers on the foot of the Balkan Mountains in the damp cool of the early morning.  ""We only pick the fully open roses that are most oil-giving, the others we leave for tomorrow,"" she adds.  About 3,500 kg of rose flowers are required to produce 1 kg of rose oil. Bulgaria and neighbouring Turkey are the world’s largest producers, before Iran, Morocco, India and China.  The temperate climate and alluvial soils at the South of the Balkan mountain provide the ideal conditions for growing the best plant, the Damascus Rose, which is originally from Persia. The delicate extraction process is almost unchanged since the days of the Ottoman empire in the 17th century.  The petals are taken immediately to distilleries, where they are mixed with water and boiled in vast metal vats.  The vapours are then condensed and redistilled to separate the oil. But the process requires vast volumes of petals. Bulgaria’s annual production of about 1,500 kilograms of rose oil requires 5.25 tonnes of petals, grown on 3,800 hectares (9,390 acres) of plantations, mostly in the valley around the central Bulgaria town of Kazanlak. The buyers — from Europe, the United States and, increasingly, Asia — are generally firms that make intermediary fragrance products which they then sell to fragrance brands.  Surprisingly, the oil — which contains over 370 components and has no synthetic alternative. Because of its high price, rose oil has often been faked. But savvy Bulgarian producers have now found a way to guarantee its authenticity.  Last October, after a nine-year application process, producers managed to get the name ""Bulgarian Rose Oil"" registered on the list of EU products of protected geographical indication and designation of origin. To be granted the certification, producers must prove their flowers come from a traditional rose-growing region in Bulgaria, that they observe strictly the distillation process and that their product has the essential chemical and physical characteristics specific only to Bulgarian rose oil. ""This is a huge success for the whole sector,"" Bulgarian distillery owner and one of the people behind the registration, Filip Lissicharov, told AFP.  ""The quality of the rose petals is good and we expect that the quality of the rose oil this year will be equally high,"" Lissicharov said. Distillers expect a good year even if not a repeat of the bumper harvest from last year, which was the best in the past 20 years."
"Naturex launches Sapnov, a natural and soothing surfactant","A few months after having entirely rebuilt its plant in Chile (the former production of Chile Botanics, acquired in January 2014) and increased its production capabilities by 10, Naturex is launching Sapnov, a 100% water-extracted natural surfactant derived from quillaia  (Quillaja saponaria), an evergreen tree native from Chile. “This ingredient meets the demand for both sulphate-free, mild surfactants and biodegradable ingredients in finished products,” explains Stéphanie Puel, Business Unit Director for Personal Care. A non-ionic and water-soluble surfactant, Sapnov performs well versus synthetic surfactants such as sodium laureth sulphate (SLS), claims Naturex.  Sapnov is miscible with classical solvents, works in a wide range of pH and shows good stability even at high salt concentrations. Besides the fact that this foaming agent is 100% natural, the extract has other proven benefits that cannot be found in common surfactants. Indeed, various studies have shown that quillaia extracts have soothing and dermo-purifying properties. Tested in ex-vivo oral epithelium, Sapnov decreased the expression of interleukin 8 by 52% (interleukin 8 is a well-known marker of inflammation). To showcase the various possibilities of Sapnov, the company has developed several applications that were presented at Naturex’s booth atin-cosmetics 2015: cleaning products for blemish-prone and sensitive skins, sulfate-free soothing shower gel and scalp soothing shampoo, baby wipes and natural toothpaste. Since the acquisition of Chile Botanics, Naturex has been working with the local team to upgrade the quillaia extraction and purification facilities, which are based close to quillaia harvesting areas in the south of Chile. This enables the group to offer consistently high quality, COSMOS approved extracts every time, produced sustainably from an abundant source. Indeed, the quillaia is sourced from a 8,000 km2 forest, which is sustainably managed.  The resource is strictly controlled by the Chilean National Forest Corporation (Corporación Nacional Forestal, CONAF), which regulates the quillaia harvest. A key asset for the future if we consider that according to Euromonitor International, non-ionic surfactants are expected to enjoy one of the strongest CAGRs in shampoos between 2013 and 20181."
in-cosmetics celebrates 25th anniversary with record-breaking attendance in Barcelona,"The latest edition of the in-cosmetics trade show, which was held on 14-16 April 2015 at the Gran Fira exhibition centre in Barcelona, Spain, hosted 710 exhibitors from around the world with 105 companies exhibiting for the first time. “This large number of first time exhibitors not only points to a thriving sector, but also the expanding influence of in-cosmetics, as the show cements its position as the place to be seen in the cosmetics ingredients industry,” the organisers explain. The show also welcomed a record 8,578 unique visitors, the highest number for any event outside of Paris, in the exhibition’s history.  This also represented an increase of 18 per cent on last year’s show in Hamburg.  There were a large number of international visitors, but the show successfully tapped into the local market with domestic Spanish visitors accounting for 27 per cent of the total visitors. The show also saw the return of the popular Innovation Zone, which allows visitors to get up close and discover the latest product launches and formulations. Alongside the Innovation Zone were free-to-attend ""Live Demonstrations"" providing in-depth knowledge about innovations on offer from manufacturers exhibiting at the show. The in-cosmetics Awards Ceremony took on an even greater significance this year with the introduction of a special award as part of the shows 25th anniversary celebrations. The 25 Years of Innovation Award was presented to Sederma, recognising its Matrixyl ingredient as the ingredient which has had the greatest impact on the personal care ingredients industry over the past quarter century. For the first time, the show’s Innovation Zone Best Ingredient Award was split in to two categories, with Induchem receiving gold in the Active category for its Brightenyl product, a first generation active ingredient designed to be activated, upon application, by the skin microbiote. Dow Corning was awarded gold in the Functional category for 3901 Liquid Satin Blend, a skincare fluid which creates a long-lasting feel of lubricity while delivering a stringy yet novel structure. The Green Ingredient award, in association with Organic Monitor, was given to Laboratoires Expanscience for Aqualicia, a natural ’3-in-1’ active ingredient which entraps, distributes and limits water loss of the skin. ""I’m very pleased that our 25th anniversary show has been such a success. We have had such great feedback from both exhibitors and visitors and I’m sure in-cosmetics Paris 2016 will prove to be the most successful show in the exhibition’s history,"" said Cathy Laporte, in-cosmetics Exhibition Manager.  The 2016 edition of in-cosmetics will take place in Paris from the 12-14 April 2016.

Production of ylang ylang flowers under threat in Comoros?,"It is a tropical yellow-flowered tree, which is highly sought after for essential oil used in prestige perfumery.  ""It (the oil) is a complex chemical, violent and strong"" that ""enhances the high quality ingredients"", said Jean Kerléo a former perfumer at Jean Patou and creator of the world’s largest scent archive - the Osmotheque at Versailles, France.  “It pairs well with jasmine and is complementary. It’s used a lot in floral perfumes, where it is the base product in the bouquet. I myself used it in ’Sublime’ for Patou which I created in 1992 and which still exists,” he adds. The French introduced the tree on the island of Reunion in the 1700s and in the early 1900s its cultivation spread to the nearby islands of Comoros and Madagascar. ""If I had to describe the smell, it’s jasmine, but more heightened, and stronger.  It’s almost fruity. You get a whiff of pear and coconut to start with, accompanied all the while by a floral scent. As the fragrance settles, there’s a hint of carnation, a hint of clove,"" said Christopher Sheldrake, Chanel’s director for perfume research and development. The ylang ylang oil, along with vanilla and cloves, brings precious foreign exchange to Comoros, boosting its frail economy.  Each year, the archipelago of three islands produces between 30 and 40 tonnes of this essential oil - ahead of Madagascar - mainly on the island of Anjouan, home to 350 distilleries. Exports of ylan ylang essential oil amounted to about 1.5 million euros (US $1.6 million) in 2013 and 2014, which represents 11 per cent of Comoros’ revenue. Ibrahim Ahamada, an economist at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said the flower remains ""a potential source of income and significant currency for the country"" provided there is ""serious reorganisation of the sector"".  Actually, to increase production, farms need to improve the quality of the plants, investment is needed in infrastructure and measures to tackle deforestation must be put in place. A revamping of the sector begun last year with international funds. For several years, governmental authorities and agronomists are raising the alarm bell over threats on the ylang ylang flower. This tree is grown somewhat like a vine and requires constant maintenance. Without regular pruning, the trunk grows too high for farmers to access the flowers.  However, Comorian plantations of this tree now have over a hundred years of age.  ""Despite the economic importance of the ylang ylang essential oil, there is surprising no plant breeding program,"" said agronomist Céline Benini of the University of Liège, Belgium. Deforestation is also a major problem: forest cover has shrunk by 25 per cent in 20 years.  Given the patchy electricity supply, even the distillation of the ylang ylang essential oil in old alembics requires a lot of wood. There are also few people willing to take on the backbreaking tasks of pruning the plants and picking between 25 to 40 kilogrammes of flowers a day in high season.  A job paying about 50 euros a month. As a consequence, farmers sometimes encourage their children to try their luck in cities, where basic salaries ranges between 50 and 90 euros per month, but the lack of jobs available in the country often lead them to migrate overseas. Perfumers are well aware of the difficulties and threats on the production of this strategic plant, in particular because the case is also not isolated. “Today, there are about a hundred critical raw materials in perfumery, for which a minimum of stability in terms of price and quality must be ensured. Many of these materials come from countries plagued by rural depopulation, where plantations are being abandoned for good as people flow towards large cities. In India, Laos, Uganda, Haiti… we have been investing in programmes to support rural populations and help them grow their cultures, while ensuring them stable incomes and prospects in the long term. We make sure these people get a stable income so they can plant, invest, and innovate. This is designed to be a long-lasting organization,” said Olivier de Lisle, who is in charge of the Fine Fragrance Department at Firmenich, in a recent interview to Premium Beauty News. As far as Comorian ylang ylang is concerned, Chanel says it is trying to get its suppliers to plant their own trees for firewood in order to meet the needs of the essential oil extraction. The French perfumer also says it is committed to providing better conditions and fair wages for the workers on these plantations."
in-cosmetics 2015 opens its doors today in Barcelona,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, the in-cosmetics tradeshow is opening its doors today at the Gran Via Exhibition Centre in Barcelona, Spain - the fourth largest cosmetic and toiletries market in Europe.  The show will host more than 680 manufacturers from over 40 countries and the organisers are expecting more than 8,000 visitors for the personal care industry. In a market driven by constant innovation and increasing demand for added-value products, suppliers of cosmetic ingredients simultaneously address consumers’ search for more sustainable and more natural ingredients and highly efficient actives, in particular when it comes to counteracting the effects of ageing and pollution - two of the biggest global trends currently. “For the past 25 years, scientific advances, whether they concern a better understanding of skin physiology, biological mechanisms, fundamental discoveries such as the ones on stem cells, genetics and epigenetics have drained most of the innovations among brands of finished products and ingredient suppliers,” explained Karl Lintner founder of Kal’idées, a consulting firm to the cosmetic industry, and teacher of cosmetic chemistry at the ISIPCA school of Versailles. Following the success of last year’s focus on Brazil, in-cosmetics 2015 will emphasises Turkey and the Middle East.  A special pavilion will play host to ingredients manufacturers from Turkey and bordering regions with manufacturers such as Surya Kimya - one of the biggest makers and suppliers of cosmetic ingredients in Turkey. Euromonitor International will examine the region’s key trends and statistics, while Mintel focuses on Middle Eastern Beauty Rituals and products from the region. Furthermore, a Turkey & Middle East Product Trail will highlight unique products and projects from or inspired by the region. The event will also put a special highlight on the global Halal cosmetics and personal care market, which is expected to grow by at a CAGR of 13.43% over the period 2013-2018, according to Research company TechNavio.  This strong growth can be attributed to both the rise in the world’s Muslim population and continued strong demand from Malaysia and Indonesia - the two largest Halal beauty markets in the world. In 2014, the three in-cosmetics events welcomed over 16,000 visitors in Germany (in-cosmetics 2014), Brazil (in-cosmetics Brasil) and Thailand (in-cosmetics Asia). This looks set to grow by up to 20% this year in part due to the launch of in-cosmetics Korea, being held in Seoul between 15-16 June 2015, and the growth of in-cosmetics Brasil (in Sao Paulo between 30 September - 1 October 2015), which held its founding show in 2014. “Korea is an exciting development,” said Lucy Gillam, Director, in-cosmetics Group.  “Alongside our Brazilian show, it is part of our vision to expand in-cosmetics into recognised but growing local markets.  In Brazil and Korea, in-cosmetics is the only event to exclusively target the personal care industry, offering a focused and unrivalled opportunity for companies to connect with the global marketplace.  We are confident that our 2015 exhibitions will break visitor and attendance records.”

Ashland takes advantage of circadian rhythms to beautify the skin,"In vivo tests have revealed that certain biophysical and physiological parameters of human skin change in accordance with circadian rhythms, the biological processes based on about 24-hour rhythms.  Thus, skin temperature, sebum production, pH, electrical charge potential (capacitance) and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) appear to follow the circadian clock. [1] Recently, researchers from Beiersdorf also highlighted the importance of the skin cells’ internal clock. Based on these findings, Ashland has developped Chronogen YST, a new extract derived from yeast protein that may help to maintain skin’s cellular rhythm and guard against UV damage. ""Over the past 10 years, research has shown that skin cells are partly regulated by the 24-hour rhythm,"" said Neil Astles, marketing manager for biofunctionals, Ashland Specialty Ingredients. ""More than 20 percent of gene expression in a given tissue falls under circadian regulation. [2]  This regulatory function within skin cells, however, may be disrupted by external factors. Chronogen YST promotes expression within clock gene proteins in vitro to resynchronize optimal skin function."" Actually Ashland explains that clock genes are now recognized as key regulators that play a vital role in the expression of many genes, including some that reside in skin cells. Modulating clock gene expression for beneficial effects on skin would therefore represent a major breakthrough in cosmetic science. A case in point can be seen in the area of UV exposure. At night, cells undergo DNA repair and replication procedures based partly on the expression of clock genes within a closed loop system. In contrast, at the beginning of the day, DNA needs to prepare for UV exposure with antioxidant enzymes. This 24-hour cycle can be disrupted by UV exposure and, accordingly, impede cell regeneration. [3] Ashland clinically tested Chronogen YST [4] at 1 percent. For instance, a small double blind study against a placebo cream with 10 volunteers ranging in age from 23 to 38 years indicated a measurable improvement in skin turnover in vivo after 21 days (two applications per day) with topical cream containing 1 percent active Chronogen YST. ""Using a small concentration of the Chronogen YST in skin creams and serums may help to resynchronize the skin’s circadian clock,"" concluded Neil Astles. Ashland recommends using Chronogen YST in day-time formulations to help skin boost its natural defenses against UV-induced damage; night-time formulations to boost the skin’s own processes in skin regeneration; anti-aging formulations with claims on circadian rythms and formulations to help maintain the skin’s ""synchronized"" internal clock. Ashland demonstrated the technical merits of Chronogen YST, which is compliant with China’s cosmetic rules, at the Personal Care and Homecare Ingredients (PCHi) exhibition held on 12-14 March in Guangzhou, China. Other suppliers such as Silab or Lipotec have also recently proposed new ingredients based on circadian cycles."
SEPPIC launches an antioxidant derived from macroalgal cell culture,"The first cosmetic active derived from the new technology developed by BiotechMarine, a SEPPIC subsidiary specialising in bioactive natural substances, extracted from seaweeds and marine plants, to cultivate macro-algal cells in the laboratory, Ephemer is a gametophyte extract from Undaria Pinnatifida, a brown seaweed known as wakame in Japan and harvested in Brittany by the company.  The interest of gametophytes is that they accumulate anti-oxidant cells, but their availability in the ocean is very limited as they constitute an ephemeral stage in the life cycle of the seaweed. The in-vitro cultivation of macroalgae cells allows to stabilise the gametophytes and to multiply them in order to use their properties for cosmetic purposes. According to SEPPIC, the extract thus obtained showed its antioxidant efficacy in both the short- and long-term uses.  “Ephemer protects the skin, after 24 hours by acting on the mitochondria, causing momentaneous reduction of free radicals. After 8 days, Ephemer preserves mitochondrial DNA, which is essential for proper mitochondrial function,” claims SEPPIC. This property has been confirmed through in-vivo testing. “After 28 days, the skin shows a better ability to fight free radicals, versus placebo, a cause of skin aging. After 56 days, the skin’s micro-relief has markedly improved compared to placebo,” adds SEPPIC. SEPPIC’s in vitro macro-algal cells culture technology is offering a new marine source of active ingredients.  Indeed, ""Macroalgae cells have the amazing ability to transform light and minerals into organic molecules,” explains Erwan Le Gélébart, R&D Project Manager at BiotechMarine. Actually, since the rich marine biodiversity contains thousands of macro-algae species - for instance, the sea surrounding France’s Bréhat archipelago, in front of BiotechMarine’s headquarters, contains hundreds of species - the new technology is now making it possible to create a bank of macro-algal cells from the many species whose compositions and effects on skin have yet to be explored."
Naturex: a new collection of natural extracts for a perfect complexion,"The collection is based on three converging formulation axes: treating exfoliation, skin colour disorders and inflammatory reactions. The first action is intended to renew the surface of the skin with a high concentration in AHAs, which Naturex draws from African hibiscus and cranberry extracts. The tests performed on these flower and fruit acids show better efficacy results than the usual glycolic and lactic acids. The hibiscus extract is available as a colourless powder or in a liquid version, with a concentration in actives reaching 55%. The inhibition action of tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for dark spots and other imperfections, results from the extracts of balm, rhodiola, and liquorice, which act directly on the melanin synthesis mechanisms. Ultimately, soothing liquorice and schizandra extracts are used against the chronic inflammation that causes redness. The brightening effect is also ensured by the escin molecule, which was showcased at the last Cosmetagora show. Escin is a new element in the NAT purity range, and 95% of this pure molecule is extracted from horse-chestnut. It acts on the skin’s venous tonicity, and provides both radiance and an antioxidant action as a face treatment, and an anti-cellulite and anti-heavy legs action as a body care product. “We have noticed consumers increasingly seek natural and pure, plant-derived molecules. This type of ingredients guarantees the cosmetic product’s efficacy on the skin,” comments Yohan Rolland, Personal Care Market Manager. Naturex has incorporated its ingredients into a standard formula to highlight their properties. The company has chosen to ride on the lightly-textured night products wave from Korea with Brightening Night Jelly, a gel-cream with a fluid texture to be applied at night which provides a high quantity of actives, while allowing the skin to breathe for a radiant complexion in the morning. This formulation should appeal to Asian markets and prepare for the arrival of this new trend on the European market."
BASF develops new customized anti-aging solutions,"Presented on the occasion of the latest edition of the Cosmetagora tradeshow, which was held on 13-14 January 2015 in Paris, BASF’s new anti-ageing formulation concept targets the specific needs of French beauty products consumers, which were identified in a large sample of beauty products users. Actually, BASF has conceived a series of formulas adapted to six consumer archetypes derived from the results of a study carried out with TNS Infratest on 1,223 French women aged 25 to 75.  All of them were regular users of anti-aging face care products, applying them at least once a week, and were also decision-makers or co-decision-makers when it came to brand purchases. The women were put into one of six groups based on their personality, emotional needs and purchase motivations, as opposed to external factors. Each group (“Energetic”, “Perfect”, “Professional”, “Protected”, “Authentic”, and “Creative”) therefore reflects the predominant needs of women. The “Authentic” consumer, for example, places special emphasis on products that employ natural ingredients and are environmentally friendly. She strives for natural-based, effortless beauty.  “As a result, her anti-aging face care products need to be straightforward - with no need to fuss or spend a lot of time in front of the mirror,” the ingredients supplier explains In order to illustrate the solutions that can be offered to these women who favour likable, trustworthy brands offering good value for money, BASF has tailored the “Authentic Boost” formulation a dry yet nourishing anti-aging oil containing natural-based ingredients and combining easy skin hydration with non-greasy, velvety smoothness. Another illustration of this typology, the “Professional” consumer is described as disciplined, conservative, down-to-earth. She sees beauty as a science. “Accordingly, she is drawn to technically advanced products that live up to high scientific standards and to brands associated with innovation.” In response to this consumer’s personality profile, BASF has developed the formulation “Beauty Manager”, a repairing anti-aging night cream. According to the company, the soft gel cream helps accelerate the skin’s natural regeneration by means of biological and enzymatic exfoliation during sleep. Two active ingredients boost its efficacy: Neurobiox™, an achillea millefolium (commonly known as yarrow) extract that resynchronizes cellular neuro-dialogue and X-Pressin™ C, an advanced exfoliating system. The contained combinations of emollients and emulsifiers give the gel cream a fluffy texture and provide a cooling and luxurious feeling."
Evonik launches new conditioning agent with improved sustainability profile,"In order to address new consumers demands, Evonik is launching a new premium hair conditioning agent.  The new active ingredient is an esterquat [1] developed to provide superior manageability, lubricity and softness to the hair,  and to help to balance the consumers’ desire for a beautiful appearance with the necessity to improve the sustainability profile of the hair care industry Indeed, Varisoft®EQ 100 [2] has been conceived to match new requests from consumers.  Actually, Evonik found that most consumers around the world are looking for effective hair conditioning as a tool to maintain attractive and healthy hair and request excellent performance. However, at the same time, consumers are increasingly health and environment conscious. As far as efficiency is concerned, according to the cosmetic ingredients supplier, the new Varisoft®EQ 100 “outperforms leading market standards in both sensorial evaluations and technical measurements.” In addition to efficiency, Evonik also claims the new Varisoft®EQ 100 has a very good sustainability profile, including: – ready biodegradability, 
– lower eco-toxicity compared to common benchmark,
– cold-processability,
– and its primarily renewable, none palm-based feedstock. This new conditioning agent therefore supports “a more environmentally conscious approach in the cosmetic industry.” Furthermore, Varisoft® EQ 100 is a solvent-free and non-flammable liquid with reduced risk during transport or production, and, increased flexibility during processing. Eventually, Evonik explains Varisoft ® EQ 100 is suitable for a broad range of application formats in the hair care market, including conditioning rinses, hair conditioning sprays and treatments, conditioning shampoos, styling products as well as hair dyes."
Cosmetic ingredients: The latest anti-aging launches,"With two new actives, Epigenist ™ and Lox-Age ™, BASF focuses on the epidermis.  The first one is presented as an epidermal rejuvenator, which stimulates the epidermal innervation (neuritogenesis) to help the skin regain the quality of its youth.  According to BASF, when applied on the skin, Epigenist™, which is extracted from bambara pea (voandzeia subterranea), can reverse the natural decrease of epidermal innervation.  Nerves grow again and, “the epidermis is thicker and better organised and the proliferation of cells is increased,” claims the supplier of cosmetic ingredients. Regarding Lox-Age™, an extract of chicory (cichorium intybus) leaves, it is a skin relief perfector.  According to BASF, the active is capable of restoring the expression of LOX (lysyl oxidase), a key protein that decreases with age, to a similar level as in young skin.  Lox-Age™ contributes to the restoration of youthful skin appearance “with a clinical efficacy similar to retinol”. With Optim Hyal™, Sederma aims at an optimal of renewal of the hyaluronic acid synthesis. This active contains Glycokines™, specific signaling oligosaccharides that structurally and functionally mimic the hyaluronic fragments found in the skin.  According to Sederma, these Glycokines™ have been demonstrated to stimulate the hyaluronic acid synthesis on both keratinocytes and fibroblasts for a visible improvement in skin smoothness, moisture and suppleness in just one month. Silab’s Nutripeptides® is a comprehensive anti-aging active ingredient designed to provide a youthful and radiant skin.  This active is rich in rice di- and tripeptides that can be rapidly assimilated to offset the skin’s nutritional imbalances, boosts its cellular metabolism and increases its defence mechanisms.  Tested in vitro in drastic conditions of nutritional deficiency, the active stimulates defence mechanisms in response to stress, strengthens the barrier function, and increases protein synthesis in the dermal-epidermal junction and extracellular matrix. “The skin is better nourished, toned and radiantly youthful,” claims Silab. The company is also making a foray in epigenetics, the study of cellular and physiological traits that are heritable by daughter cells and not caused by changes in the DNA sequence.  Derived from the calendula flower (Calendula officinalis), Epigenomyl® is a new active that limits modification to the epigenome resulting from the passing of time and external factors.  According to Silab, the active allows cutaneous cells to better respond to stress and live longer. To fight time and environmentally induced ageing, Mibelle is launching PerfectionPeptide P7, a biogically active hepta-peptide that stimulates the skin’s own self-defence mechanisms against oxidative stress at the cellular level.  The active is a competitive inhibitor of the Keap1 repression.  Consequently, the transcription factor Nrf2 is constantly present in its active form and arms the skin cells for challenges from any stress caused by oxidants or other reactive chemical species. Clinical and cell culture assays have shown the active ability to reduce DNA damage, UV-induced formation of sunburn cells, and the depletion of Langerhans.  In order to ensure its stability, the peptide has been encapsulated into a novel soft sphere carrier system that is based on shea butter."
Cosmetic ingredients: Eco-design at the heart of recent launches,"With GlucoTain®, Clariant offers a range of four new non-ionic surfactants (GlucoTain® Clear, GlucoTain® Clean, GlucoTain® Flex, GlucoTain® Care). These sugar-based surfactants have been functionalized with fatty acids, including RSPO certified palm oil. ""We had been working for four years to develop these high performance products that show great sensorial results in particular in terms of softness and skin tolerance, as well as regarding foaming and conditioning properties and ease of use. Eco-design was also at the heart of development,” said Boris Segalowitch, sales manager.  The products are Ethylene Oxyde (EO)-free, PEG-free and boast a low carbon footprint. Developed both for skin and hair care, GlucoTain® are, according to Clariant, intended to replace betaines, which are widely used in personal care products, which have a low eco-toxicity profile but are questioned as potential sensitizers. The GlucoTain® range also allows the formulation of sulfate-free shampoos and fragrance solubilisation in PEG-free formulas. After seven years of research and two patents filed, Seppic builds on its expertise on lipoamino acids with the launch of Sepisun Flash™, the first pro-pigmenting agent which increases, without sun, the production of melanin by the skin. The active provides a naturally tanned complexion within 15 days with a durable effect.  In comparison, a sunless tanner, acts in a few hours, but with a more temporary effect. “Sepisun Flash™ meets market expectations by combining well-being with effectiveness. It’s easy ti use and enables our clients to swiftly adapt to consumer requests for products that give a ‘healthy ook’ all year round,” says Carla Perez, Seppic’s Functional Active Ingredients Product Manager. The active is made from vegetable raw materials and complies with the twelve principles of green chemistry. With ReGeniStem™ Brightening, a lightening active, Lonza is expanding its range of cosmetic ingredients obtained from plant stem cells. The active inhibits tyrosinase in a manner comparable to the market benchmarks - namely kojic acid, arbutin and hydroquinone - and also presents a collagen boosting effect.  According to Lonza, the technology allows to obtain more concentrated molecules of active ingredients while respecting sustainable development, without using solvents and without using a significant amount of raw botanical material, namely licorice."
Skin complexion: Naturex launches natural extracts with high AHA concentrations,"The quest for a radiant, perfect skin complexion, for youthful skin, even without makeup, is shared across all continents, with the Asian market leading the category.  The number of new skin care products launched with a radiance claim has been multiplied by six over the last ten years in Asia.  Moreover, more than half of the product launches targeting perfect skin complexion carried a “natural” claim in 2013. To address this growing demand, Naturex has added a line of alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) to its ‘New Radiance’ collection of ingredients. AHAs are well-known for their skin smoothing properties. Their exfoliating action removes dead cells, stimulates cell renewal and improves skin hydration. They also act as antioxidant scavengers and protect the skin from oxidative damage. “Most natural AHAs are only available at relatively low concentrations,” explains Naturex.  However, the French supplier of plant-based natural ingredients has designed extracts of hibiscus (rich in specific hibiscus acids) and cranberry (rich in citric, quinic and malic acids) with concentrations in AHAs reaching up to 45-65%. Special attention has been paid to facilitate the use of AHAs in different formulations. Indeed, derived from anthocyanin-rich hibiscus flowers or cranberry fruits, the organic acids were originally coloured in vivid red. Naturex has worked to separate the anthocyanin from the organic acids in order to adapt them for cosmetic use. The powder and liquid versions of the cranberry and hibiscus AHAs have no impact on the colour of the finished product. “Moreover, natural organic acids are easily soluble in water. This property presents a significant advantage in terms of formulation, avoiding any crystallization or precipitation in the formula. Thanks to their high solubility, natural organic acids have superior activity and improved bioavailability on the skin,” claims Naturex."
Croda taps into superfoods for skin and hair care,"Ingredients derived from ‘superfood’ sources have become increasingly popular and the number of personal care products with claims focused on superfood connotations have more than doubled in the last few years [1].  Capitalizing on this trend, Croda has developed Hydroastivum P and Crodasone P, two new biopolymers that provide functional benefits to final products.  Both ingredients are derived from pisum sativum  or ‘pea’ which is popular for its high protein content, unique assortment of phyto-nutrients and antioxidant properties. “In personal care applications, Pisum sativum provides a rich source of amino acids,” says the company.  In particular, Hydrosativum P and Crodasone P contain high levels of glutamic acid, aspartic acid, argenine and lysine. Proteins adsorb readily onto the surface of skin and hair and are generally hygroscopic, meaning they attract water molecules from the air to act as humectants. Traditionally, hydrolysed proteins such as wheat and silk have been used to impart moisture and conditioning properties to the hair and skin. Hydrosativum P is a new generation highly moisture retentive biopolymer. According to Croda, it exhibits “powerful moisturisation properties in hair and skin care formulations.”  Hydrosativum P has additional anti-irritancy properties ideal for skin and scalp care. Crodasone P is a copolymer designed to defend hair cuticles from heat and styling damage.  Due to its complex polymeric structure, Crodasone P cross-links on drying to form a conditioning and protective network.  “Studies have shown that Crodasone P can reduce thermal cracking by 49% in an aqueous spray and 38% in a conditioner system,” Croda claims. Crodasone P is ideally suited to leave-on styling products or conditioners claiming heat defence but Croda says it can also be used in rinse-off applications to defend the cuticles from damage caused during styling. To illustrate how these ingredients can meet the market needs, Croda has developed a range of formulations packed full of superfoods, such as the “Super Satin Cooling Lotion”, a cooling skin moisturiser that contains Hydrosativum P and blueberry extract, or the “Scoopable Hair Souffle”, a nourishing hair mask with a novel texture that contains Crodasone P for cuticle protection, Hydrosativum P to lavish the hair and scalp with moisture and is packed full of superfoods including pomegranate, apple and blueberry."
"“Both the environment and populations must be respected when using Amazonian actives”, Aïna Queiroz, ID bio","Premium Beauty News - What are your ambitions in terms of new developments? Aïna Queiroz - My first mission will be to expand the group’s offer in cosmetic actives. I have already worked in research on natural active substances, with new organic targets, and this perfectly matches what the ID bio company is willing to do as a plant extraction specialist: playing a greater role on the natural actives market, thanks to a more diversified offer, and plants with a rich history. Our approach will consist in identifying a plant’s potential for skin applications according to its origin, traditional use and phytochemical content. We also intend to go further with our research on the use of plant-derived co-products. Premium Beauty News - Can you already talk about your next launches, the new developments you will present at the In-Cosmetics Brasil show in São Paulo? Aïna Queiroz -  Our presence at São Paulo’s In-Cosmetics will enable the ID bio group to reinforce its knowledge of this large market. Some extracts have already been developed, and are based on annatto (“urucum” in Portuguese), a plant that South American Indians used as a sun protection thanks to its bixin, a molecule that is close to beta-carotene. The red-orange colour of its seeds explains why indigenous populations were sometimes called “red skins”. Likewise, camu camu has caught our research teams’ attention for its strong content in vitamin C, one of the most important known to this day. Furthermore, we will also make the most of our presence at the show (G09 stand) by presenting our botanical actives and titrated extracts of the TitrExtract® range, which have already seduced companies in other geographical areas. Premium Beauty News - Thanks to your professional background, you now possess excellent knowledge of the natural actives in South America, especially Amazonia. These are increasingly present and popular in cosmetic products. How do you view this trend? Aïna Queiroz - The South-American biodiversity is so rich, and its ethnobotanical history so fascinating that the cosmetics industry just naturally turned towards it. Now, if this is great news for the economic boom in this geographical area, I am still sensitive to the action taken to limit the depletion of these precious resources and protect the populations that have traditionally been using these plants. Even though it may make a scientist or manufacturer’s approach more complex when attempting to decipher their mystery. I definitely back up the use of Amazonian plants in our cosmetic products, provided a certain framework is respected. This is what a few South American countries, such as Peru, are gradually implementing to fight against the extinction of particular species and biopiracy."
Beiersdorf’s Eucerin targets sensitive skins with Symrise actives,"“My team studied sensitive skin very carefully in recent years and discovered notable differences from normal skin,” explains Dr. Gitta Neufang, Head of R&D Medical Management at Beiersdorf.  “Sensitive skin reacts much stronger to irritants,” she adds. Skin irritation mechanism Beiersdorf’s team of researchers thus used capsaicin, the pungent component of black pepper to mimic skin irritation and study its mechanism. The R&D team discovered that when capsaicin is applied to the skin surface it activates a protein on sensory nerve fibre endings, the TRPV1 channel.  After bonding, the channel becomes permeable to calcium ions that then flow into the nerve fibres, transferring the irritation further along the fibres until it can be felt. The company then conducted a series of tests to select the active ingredients to best counteract this mechanism.  According to Beiersdorf, the best results were achieved with SymSitive, a generation of active ingredients developed by German supplier Symrise. “We have tested a series of ingredients to see if they can prevent this calcium stream caused by capsaicin and the irritation that results from it,” Neufang explains. “SymSitive was clearly the best. When used nerve fibres hardly reacted at all and the irritation was not transferred further.” Further studies conducted by the firm on test subjects confirm that SymSitive has a calming effect on very sensitive skin.  “The prickling or burning sensation of the skin from the irritant capsaicin is soothed just minutes after using SymSitive-containing products or doesn’t even occur when SysmSitive is used beforehand,” Beiersdorf says. Beiersdorf used the result of the research to develop the new Eucerin UltraSENSITIVE and AntiREDNESS lines, which hit store shelves this summer.  “The skin’s irritation threshold is increased and skin discomfort disappears permanently,” the company claims."
Kao finds a natural enzyme to produce sustainable surfactants,"Algae are one of the major fields of investigation of Kao’s research program on advanced sustainable use biomass, conducted at the company’s Eco Technology Research Centre in Wakayama, Japan.  The Japanese cosmetics maker recently announced to have found how some algae can produce a large number of C12 to 14 medium chain fatty acids and to have identified the enzyme that plays a key role within the process.  These fatty acids are the main components of natural fats and oils, such as palm kernel oils and coconut oils, which are raw materials for surfactants in detergents or shampoos. Additionally, as a first in the field of algae, the company identified a novel acyl-ACP thioesterase with high specificity to medium chain fatty acids from the genus Nannochloropsis. The Japanese company expects that these findings will dramatically accelerate the breeding development of algae for large-scale production of medium chain fatty acids thus providing a large source of fats and oils that are “natural and not consumed as food”. Kao therefore intends to pursue technological development in this field, with the aim to achieve industrial production.  According to the company, algae would be potentially more than ten times more productive than the most efficient alternative natural sources of fats and oils, such as oil palms. These results will be presented at the 1st Asian Conference on Oleo Science, which will be held on September 8 to 10, 2014 in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan."
Induchem brings visual spheres into a new dimension,"The Unispheres® XS range is an extension of Induchem’s line of 3D visual carriers, which consists in spherical beads from cellulose and sugars and already includes: – Unispheres Original. Spheres that have the property of transforming to a soft and crushable bead in the finished product that disappears with a gentle rub without leaving any shell residue on skin or hair.
– Unispheres Natural. The Ecocert certified range.
– Unispheres Luxury. Containing gemstones and precious metal.
– Unispheres Bicolor. Beads composed of a thick white coating that completely covers the colour of the core which is released upon application and transforms a white cream to a tinted one while leaving no residue during application. The new generation consists in extra small spherical beads of regular size and particle distribution. Their diameter is of 0.2 to 0.5 mm.  “At only 0.3% they create an outstanding colourful visual effect in any kind of transparent water based formula (shampoos, shower gels, serums, gels, lotions, deodorants, toothpastes),” Induchem claims. ""The cosmetic industry is steadily looking for new visual elements increasing the attractiveness of their products. This is a direct answer to studies showing that consumers are naturally attracted first by the look of the products on the shelves. Unispheres® XS, due to their amazingly small size, create a new visual dimension which enables an instant visual differentiation of cosmetic products in beauty shops,"" explains Fabrice Lefèvre, Global Scientific Marketing Manager, Induchem. The Unispheres XS visual carriers will be launched in five colours: –  Flamboyant red,
– Powerful green,
– Intense yellow,
– Pure white,
– Deep blue. Furthermore, they are loaded with vitamin E, a well-known anti-oxidant for the skin. As the other items in the line they are eco friendly, due to their composition made of cellulose (the most abundant natural polymer on Earth) and sugars, and do not contain preservatives."
The quest for green actives boosts cosmetic innovations,"Eager to find sustainable alternatives to oil-based synthetic ingredients, suppliers have diversified extraction and production processes.  While plant materials were the traditional source of green actives, novel substances are now finding their way from food ingredients or marine sources.  “These novel actives are creating new mechanisms for anti-ageing, anti-inflammation, sebum control, skin moisturisation and related applications. Hair care uses of green actives include hair growth promotion, hair loss prevention and anti-dandruff,” Organic Monitor highlights. New sustainable extraction and processing methods are providing fertile ground for new green actives. For instance, plant stem cell technology is enabling IRB Tech (Croda) and Mibelle Biochemistry to develop novel actives from rare and endangered plant species. Since the actives are produced from plant cells in a laboratory, they have a significantly lower environmental footprint than traditionally harvested actives. Adoption rates are expected to rise as ingredient firms benefit from scale production. Marine actives are also gaining popularity as formulators look to the oceans and seas for inspiration. Sources include fish oils and fluids, coastal plants, seaweed, sea minerals and algae.  According to Organic Monitor, “ingredient companies like Heliae are focusing on algae because of its high rate of regeneration. Unlike fish and agricultural sources, algae feedstock is also less prone to supply fluctuations giving price stability. The French firm BiotechMarine has developed a range of 80 active ingredients, extracts and stem cells from marine sources.” Actives from food ingredients continue to find new cosmetic applications. Many product developers are using superfoods - such as açaí berries, goji berries, pomegranates and green tea - because of their high level of antioxidants. The trend is leading some brands to develop entire ranges based on food ingredients; examples include Skin Food and Yes to Inc. However, Organic Monitor also found that the use of these novel green actives is bringing fresh formulation challenges. “Product stability and preservation are major issues, especially if brands want to develop natural or organic personal care products. Differences between standards on accepted and prohibited ingredient sources, synthesis methods, and formulations are also creating technical hurdles.” The growing use of green actives in cosmetic formulations will be featured in upcoming Organic Monitor events. Sustainable Cosmetics Summit North America (15-16th May, New York) and Natural Cosmetics Masterclass (25 June, Paris) will have dedicated workshops on green actives. Practical guidance will be given to formulators and product developers looking at using novel green actives in cosmetic formulations."
Greentech strengthens its expertise in biotech actives,"The latest edition of the in-cosmetics show in Hamburg put ""green"" cosmetic ingredients under the spotlights, including products obtained from environmental-friendly extraction methods, ingredients derived from renewable resources, or obtained from biotech processes providing an alternative to oil-based chemistry. For Greentech, a French supplier of cosmetic actives derived from plants, algae, micro-algae and biotechnologies, the event was an opportunity to showcase its extensive know-how in this field. The company, headquartered close to Clermont-Ferrand, in the centre of France, thus presented two new classes of ingredients obtained by biotechnologies: – The Ferment’actives developed using a customized and controlled fermentation process to naturally enhance functionality, increase efficacy and develop new activities.
– A new variety of soft butters, the GTB series that have auto-emulsion capacities and higher feel sensory. The Ferment’Actives are active ingredients stem from an original process in cosmetic area: the fermentation.   Actually, Greentech intends to increase developments thanks to the use of biotechnologies.  “This process of fermentation increases the concentration of active molecules, maximises the biological activity and/or creates new biological activities,” explains the company. Greentech already offers three Ferment’Actives: – Protection Ferment’Active Goji, where polyphenol protective compounds are three times higher than a simple goji extract.
– Brightening Ferment’Active Raspberry, highly concentrated in lactic acid (38 times higher than a simple raspberry extract, according to Greentech) for a ""shining "" activity on skin and hair.
– Anti-ageing Ferment’Active Pomegranate, wih an antioxidant power boosted by a factor of 1.5. The GreenSofts represent a second generation of Soft Butters.   They are 3-in-1 actives that can be used as: self-emulsifiers, lipidic compounds for oily phase (and can constitute up to 100%) and boosters of biological activity.  “They give a soft silky touch and a very nice texture to formulations,” says Greentech. To date, there are seven GreenSofts offering the biological activities of traditional vegetable oils.  However, three of them have been tested on volunteers: – GreenSoft 336 Camelina, provides a strong improvement in the immediate skin moisturization (62%) and particularly after 8h (+24%),
– GreenSoft 251 Inca Inchi allows a 66% increase in skin flexibility (at a concentration of 5%) and 90% of volunteers felt a repairing effect on the hair after a single use (in a conditioner and a concentration at 2%),
– GreenSoft® 461 Camellia brings strong improvement and maintain in skin moisturization after 24h (+24%). Greentech adds that new GreenSofts can be created on request. In the range Probiophytes, also obtained by biotechnologies, Greentech has presented Probiophyte Fresh, a new active to counteract body odours (foot, axilla) by inhibiting bacteria that cause odours while preserving commensal bacteria that are necessary for the skin to protect against external attacks. Finally, Greentech has presented new in vivo tests on hair and nails on two of the company’s oils: – Babassu oil, which has smoothing and styling effects on hair and also provides repairing and smoothing effects on nails.
– Apricot oil, which has coating and protective effects on hair fibber.

Solvay suggests to use silica for replacing plastic beads in cosmetics,"Solvay Silica has introduced an eco-friendly grade of its Tixosil® range of highly dispersible silica products, designed to substitute plastic beads in exfoliating body wash, facial cleanser and other specialised personal care formulations. The product is supplied in micropearl form as a replacement for plastics polyethylene (PE) beads, which have recently raised environmental concerns due to their potential pollution hazard when leaking from municipal waste water treatment plants. “Tixosil® MicroPearl Silica is a non-dusting, environmentally safe and sustainable alternative to plastic beads,” says Francesca Peditto, Application Manager at Solvay Silica.  “In exfoliating formulations for personal care, it combines equivalent performance with cost-saving benefits, such as superior dispersion in aqueous solutions, a wide scope for the inclusion of actives, lower surfactant concentration and reduced texturing agent usage.” Solvay, which operates manufacturing, research and innovation facilities on four continents, produces its highly dispersible silicas in a precipitation process essentially using sand as a raw material, which is the most abundant mineral present in the crust of the earth. Tixosil® is odourless, chemically inert and considered non-hazardous in manufacture, transportation, handling and application. “The product range already has a proven fit in oral care and nutrition applications where it must meet the strict provisions of FDA and HACCP regulations. When a leading personal care and cosmetics manufacturer was seeking to replace plastic beads in their body scrub and cleansing products, Tixosil® MicroPearl Silica provided a highly effective and eco-friendly solution. It is commercially available from eight production sites in the Americas, Europe and Asia, all adhering to the same specifications of quality and consistency to serve the growing needs of global customers,” concludes Delphine Hugenot, Commercial Director for Solvay Silica in Europe. Several cosmetic manufacturers, including giants such as Unilever and L’Oréal, have already announced they would stop using plastic microbeads in their products.  Furthermore, legislators in California and in New York have introduced bills to ban these substances."

in-cosmetics: greener than ever?,"The cosmetic industry is not slowing down its efforts in sustainable development, far from that! While formulating cosmetics or perfumes using only plant substances usually remains a real challenge, the palette of green materials has expanded considerably in recent years and the new products that will be launched at the next in-cosmetics tradeshow, which will be held in Hamburg, Germany, on 1-3 April 2014, will just confirm the trend. In such a context, the choice to highlight Brazil during this edition is not only due to the launch of in-cosmetics Brasil (09 and 10 September 2014, Sao Paulo) but also to the growing importance of the Brazilian biodiversity as a key source of natural substances for the global cosmetics industry. The in-cosmetics organisers have also launched a Green Ingredient Award competition, in partnership with Organic Monitor. The award will honour a raw material or ingredient that makes a significant environmental or social difference in the area of sustainability. The competition garnered more than 50 entrants! The 10 finalists were selected by an expert panel of judges including Dr. Pauline Hili, founder and technical director, Neal’s Yard Remedies, Katharina Post, head galenic development NOC, Weleda, Dr. Erik Schulze zur Wiesche, basic development hair care, Henkel, Amarjit Sahota, president Organic Monitor and Judi Beerling, technical director, Organic Monitor.

Perfumery: The secrets of French mimosa,"""Mimosa is still a perfumer’s mainstay,"" says Sebastien Plan of Robertet, a major international supplier of the raw ingredients that go into perfumes.  However, mimosa’s heady fragrance, which enjoyed a heyday from the 1950s through the ’70s, is used in tiny amounts today. Modern perfumes tend to be “subtler, with a good, clean and smooth” effect, says the expert. From a harvest of around 40 tonnes of flowers, Robertet produces some 400 kilos (880 pounds) of a rock-like substance called ""concrete"" - which is in turn purified into about 100 kilos of ""absolute"". Eventually, the mimosa “absolute” proves costly for perfumers, who can opt for synthetic alternatives or can also buy cheaper Indian mimosa, which goes directly to Grasse in the form of ""concrete"". Jean-Pierre Roux, the boss of the Grasse perfumery Galimard, pays tribute to this ""symbol of the Grasse terroir"" by distilling the flowers into a refreshing cologne, popular with visitors who come to see the mimosas in bloom. Galimard’s perfumer Caroline de Boutiny admits that its mimosa scent is more popular with older customers than with the young. The strong mimosa absolute is little used in modern fragrances, but it can ""lend weight to a composition with its honeyed and powdered notes"", she said.  Luxury perfume brands Kenzo and Guerlain use it for this quality in their toilet waters, de Boutiny said. The mimosa tree arrived in France from Australia in the mid-19th century as a decorative plant for gardens and still forms a luxurious forest on the Tanneron hills west of Grasse. ""Mimosa is like velvet,"" says Gilbert Vial, an 85-year-old ""mimosist"" who has never left the town of Tanneron. This year, he said, the blossoms have only flowered for a brief period. To lengthen the season, local mimosa growers first plant the mirandole variety, which flowers in December and January, followed by the rustica and gaulois varieties, which bloom in February and March. Yet the declining use of the flowers in the fragrance industry is being felt here. Vial’s 60-year-old son is the last in line to harvest the steep slopes of the family’s six hectares (15 acres). ""Before the frost of 1956, thirty families grew mimosa in Tanneron. Today there are just three or four of us,"" he said.

"“Parabens will make their return in cosmetics,” Bertrand L’Homme, Thor Personal Care","Premium Beauty News - Cosmetics Europe has asked manufacturers to stop using Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) in leave-on cosmetics. For its part, the European Commission should soon limit their use. What will be the consequences of these actions? Bertrand L’Homme - The first consequence is that this substance will be removed from the market. Especially since other countries will follow the European example. Without prejudging the European decisions, we can legitimately anticipate that MIT will no longer be used in leave-on products. For rinse-off products, its use will probably be limited. In all cases, this will result, for manufacturers, in a reduction of their room for manoeuvre, in terms of protection of their formulas against micro-organisms. The range of preservatives available being increasingly reduced by regulations, but also by the limitations that brands - for reasons of marketing and competition - impose themselves. MIT was therefore an alternative to the use of parabens, which are, may I recall, not subject to any ban but simply partially restricted. Today there are more than 50 substances on the list of preservatives authorized in cosmetic products in Europe. In practice, only a dozen are commonly used, and many are in decline or will be limited. On the one hand, this focus on a limited number of substances mechanically increases the risk of allergies and, secondly, it causes a phenomenon of adaptation of micro-organisms and the creation of dangerous bio-films in production. Premium Beauty News - It is true that preservatives have a bad press! Bertrand L’Homme - Indeed there are an increasing number of products claiming being “preservative-free.” In some markets, like Korea, it has almost become a standard. But in practice, what is underlying behind these claims? Most often, the use of so-called “alternative” substances that are not officially listed as preservatives, but have a similar effect. Premium Beauty News - Preservatives who are not called by that name? Bertrand L’Homme - A preservative is defined as a natural or synthetic substance, whose main function is to protect the product against the development of micro-organisms. These “alternatives” consist in using substances that do not have as a primary function to protect the product, but yet, also have this characteristic. From my point of view, if we only use so-called alternative substances featuring secondary preservatives effects to be able to boast preservative-free claims, we might find ourselves in an awkward legal position. Premium Beauty News - Beyond the legal aspect, isn’t there a safety issue too? Bertrand L’Homme - In any case we can question ourselves. We don’t always have much perspective on these alternatives, which can be used without any concentration limits. We are beginning to see irritation and sensitization issues with substances like sorbic acid or sorbitol. The justification of the positive list of preservatives is the control of these substances. To place a preservative on the market, robust files must be provided. We don’t always have as many guarantees with the alternatives. But we must also recognize that today, the ban on animal testing has complicated things. In this context, presenting a scientific file for a new preservative is almost impossible, legally and technically speaking. This partly explains the drift of giving another main function to an ingredient with preservative properties. Premium Beauty News - Purely physical solutions also exist to protect formulas! Bertrand L’Homme - These solutions are starting to become really operational. They involve combining processes enabling to decontaminate formulas, to condition them with no risk of recontamination in protective packagings. Delivering such results has a cost, which can be supported in some segments but not in mass-market. Premium Beauty News - So, what are your recommendations? Bertrand L’Homme - First, we recommend our customers to continue using the available and legal molecules. Then to sparingly and cautiously test alternative substances. From a legal point of view and from the point of view of technical efficiency and of safety, the soundest solution is to keep on using a preservative listed in formulas and, if required, to boost it with a non-listed substance. Finally, more generally, I think that the protection should be adapted to the real needs of the formula and diversified. The need for protection of each formula must be assessed, this is also part of the services we offer. The market has trapped itself. I am personally convinced that parabens will make their return."
Greentech: a botanical alternative to zinc pyrithione,"On the occasion of the latest Cosmetagora tradeshow, which was held in Paris on 14-15 January 2014, France-based supplier of active ingredients, Greentech has presented a botanical-derived ingredient that is claimed to be active against dandruffs within 72 hours. Launched a few months earlier, Dandrilys is a complete dandruffs reducer agent, which has been developed from the bark of Ziziphus joazeiro, a tree native from Northeastern Brazil. “In Brazil, bark and leaves of Ziziphus joazeiro are used in traditional medicine for external application to cleanse hair and teeth, and to whiten facial skin thanks to their foaming properties. Also, Ziziphus joazeiro is traditionally employed for antidandruff hair care,” says Greentech. According to Greentech, around 50% of world population is suffering from dandruffs. Dandruff appearance is due to abnormal desquamation of cells of epidermis at scalp level. Proliferation of the fungi Malassezia enhances the phenomenon since it provokes inflammations as very unpleasant itching, irritations or sebum excess... Also, many factors can favour dandruff appearance as stress, hormones unbalance, excessive sudation, repeated aggressions to scalp (strong detergent, hair dye, perm hair)... In vivo and in vitro tests conducted by Greentech show that Dandrilys is as efficient as zinc pyrithione, a well-known antidandruff molecule.  This efficacy is, according to Greentech, due to the high concentration of Dandrilys in sapponins. In addition, tests showed that Dandrilys contributes to reduce inflammation as irritations and itching. Data revealed that Dandrilys decreases both: the release of itching mediator (histamine) and the activity of enzyme involved in irritations (5-LOX). Auto-evaluations also show that Dandrilys is more appreciated by volunteers than Zinc pyrithione. Another advantage of Dandrilys, according to Greentech, is that it is very soft and even with a soothing effect, and can therefore be used in daily shampoos and not as a limited treatment."
ID bio combines its ingredients for all-in-one products,"According to ID bio, multifunctional ingredients that claim too much functions have lost a part of their credibility.  However, that does not mean the end of multifunctional cosmetic products themselves.  “In our fast moving world, the idea is to make consumers turn towards multi-functional cares allowing to save time and increase efficiency,” highlights Alexia Machado Forestier, marketing and communication manager.  “However, consumers are not only looking for a special ingredient in a beauty formula but they are interested by an alliance of botanical ingredients that enable to end up with a complete and efficient care in one application.” To address this trend, the French supplier of natural ingredients is launching ID Concepts: a combination of several botanical ingredients to address specific beauty concepts. In order to illustrate some of the possibilities, ID bio has developed three examples of formulations based on the concepts of: – cocooning (a feelgood face mask, based on cotton flower extract, titrated extract of marshmallow and date oily macerate),
– perfect complexion (a thirst-quenching jelly based on Mandarin extract, “ID’Clat” and “Cell’intact”)
– night’s dream (an after make-up removal night emulsion based on Gold extract, “Mang’inTense” and “Pepsobiol PF”) Ideal against the «morning rush» of urban/modern consumers that do not underestimate efficiency, those skincare products that contain various synergetic ingredients can be adapted to various applications (skin care, hair care, make-up, etc) and combined in parallel industries (cosmetotextile, wipes, etc) “The main advantage of «combinology» lies in the creation of a complete and active formula, supported by reassuring concepts and well-known claims,” says Alexia Machado Forestier. An additional advantage from working with new combinations of already well-known materials: the simplification of regulatory procedures!"
Seppic launches a new 100% natural solubilizer,"Sepiclear G7 (proposed INCI name: heptyl glucoside) is a concentrated non-ionic (electrically neutral) surfactant that is readily biodegradable, obtained in compliance with the 12 green-chemistry principles. It is derived from sugar (sourced from corn or wheat starch) and castor-seeds, with sources 100% of vegetal origin (certified by the Association Chimie du Végétal).  It can be delivered in a solid form (more than 70% dried extracts) thus contributing to the reduction its carbon footprint during transport. Sepiclear G7 solubilises lipophilic - and therefore hydrophobic - compounds, notably essential oils, perfumes and vitamin E, in aqueous media.  “As a natural solubilizer, Sepiclear G7, meets the growing need of firms in the cosmetics industry for substances to replace artificially synthesised ingredients,” Seppic says. Furthermore, unlike other natural solubilizers, it does not produce foam, which is a fundamental point in formulating cosmetic products such as toners, toiletries and aqueous gels. Being a liquid and cold processable, it is easy to use and energy-efficient. “The arrival of Sepiclear G7 in the solubilizer range once again demonstrates Seppic’s commitment to green chemistry and sustainable development, and it enables us to support customers with such priorities in their eco-responsibility initiative,” as Lucie Maisonneuve, Product Manager, underlines. The product has, moreover, won the Pierre Potier prize, awarded in recognition of innovation in sustainable chemistry. This prize was created by France’s Ministry of Economics, Finance and Industry, in collaboration with the FFC (French Chemical Sciences Federation) and the UIC (the country’s chemical-industry association), in 2006. The aim of the prize is to highlight chemical-industry initiatives favouring sustainable development and the development of eco-responsible practices in the sector. The list of 2013 Pierre Potier prizewinners was released by the Ministry of Economics, Industry and Employment on 10 September, in the presence of Arnaud Montebourg, the Minister of Industrial Renewal."
From the sea to the skin,"Among the multiplicity of marine actives there are substances of animal origin like marine collagen, very rich in amino acids, that penetrates quickly in the skin, marine elastin, a protein found in connective tissues of certain fish species, that provides elasticity to tissues and helps slow down their ageing, marine DNA, extracted from salmon milt, that plays an active role in the synthesis of protein in the basal layer of the epidermis and which is a perfect moisturiser and cell repairer. The sea also offers many mineral actives, starting with seawater, which has astringent and tonic properties thanks to its content in minerals and trace elements. Sea salt, also, offers an incomparable richness in trace elements and can enter in the composition of various cosmetic products, particularly in those with an exfoliating action or products recommended for peeling. Extracted from seawater, marine magnesium is known to boost skin tone, helping to regulate and optimize the energy capacity of cells. The skin has a renewed tonicity and strength. It is nourished and protected, sustainably. On the side of plant actives, algae are getting increasing attention. Species diversity and a high available biomass across the oceans make it a huge resource. Where does their richness come from? Algae have the particularity of experiencing similar stresses to those of the skin, in often much higher proportions: regular dehydration (tides), attacks from UV radiations, thermal stress (air/water), oxidation, bacterial attacks (wetland), the change in seasons, and shocks against rocks (mechanical protection / healing). The study of algae’s protection strategies opens up a vast field of research in the area of cosmetic actives. Algae contain 75% of organic matter among which mineral salts and trace elements. Among the most valuable: anti-infective sulphur, slimming iodine... On the side of vitamins, they contain vitamins A, D and E, not to mention their high content in proteins and amino acids. The singular advantage of algae, in particular of macroalgae, compared to other natural cosmetic raw materials stands in their “skin-compatibility”. They do not, indeed, present any specific dermal toxicity and are perfectly compatible with skin tissues. Another plus, algae can also meet demand for organic cosmetics. Under certain conditions, including water quality and harvest sustainability [1] wild algae harvested in their natural environment can claim in Europe, to organic certification. In the past thirty years, algal ingredients have boomed in cosmetics. The richness of these algae in polysaccharides of various structures, the multitude of molecules derived from the polymerization of these macromolecules are paving the way for new original actives. To only name a few, the most commonly used are: – Phycolloïdes, who have quickly conquered the market: thanks to their texturing properties they are excellent gelling agents, thickeners and formula stabilizers.
– Algal polysaccharides, highly appreciated for their rheological properties. Algae thereby find their place in topical daily skin care applications, cosmetic institutes and spas. Driven by the craze for naturalness and the search for sustainable industries, a bright future undoubtedly lies ahead of algae and other marine ingredients, in the cosmetic industry.

Symrise launches a new natural tanner derived from marine microalgae,"Tanning is a complex issue in European and American markets. “Being tanned is still much regarded a symbol of a healthy and active lifestyle making it a beauty goal for many. At the same time, consumers show elevated awareness of the risks associated with UV exposure,” explains Symrise.  The main consequence is an increased demand for biological tanners that support the skin’s natural capability to produce the tanning pigment melanin or provide a natural tan combined with an efficient skin protection. To address this demand, the Germany-based supplier of cosmetic active ingredients has launched a new a natural tanner, SymBronze 1659, which is derived from a marine water microalgae [1]. A “natural, sustainable and renewable source” for this ingredient that “reliably enhances the pigmentation of the skin that can be used in many cosmetic applications like sunless self-tanning creams as well as products to prepare the skin for the bikini season”, Symrise says. Actually, Symrise has tested SymBronze 1659 efficacy as both a sunless self-tanner and a tan accelerator during UV exposure. “SymBronze 1659 significantly decreases the tanning time. Without exposure to UV rays, SymBronze 1659 provides a most natural looking tan. The effect actually lasts longer and looks much more natural than that of traditional self-tanners on the market. In after sun products it prolongs the tan. In combination with sun filters, its safe base-tan helps minimizing the risks associated with long-term sunbathing,” the company claims. With this product, Symrise addresses several consumer concerns simultaneously, including naturality and sustainably, as well as tanning and increased protection against the harmful effects of UV rays. “We see plenty of potential in this versatile approach and will come up with more inspiring ideas in the future,” says Dr. Marielle Le Maire, Global Product Director Cosmetic Ingredients at Symrise."
SEPPIC: a new multipurpose active agent for the skin and hair ,"A true glycine and sugar biovector, Fluidipure 8G [1] facilitates their transport within the skin, thus aiding in limiting the proliferation of microorganisms on the skin and in formulations. “Its anionic structure (negative electric charge) prevents the adhesion of microbial biofilms,” SEPPIC says. According to SEPPIC, Fluidipure 8G helps tp restore the cutaneous ecosystem whilst also preserving the integrity of sensitive skins. When used in haircare, it reduces dandruff, calms scalp irritation and decreases the production of sebum in 3 to 6 shampoo washes. An in vivo test performed by SEPPIC on 40 volunteers presenting seborrheic dermatitis has shown the efficacy of a shampoo containing 10% Fluidipure 8G, used a minimum of every 3 days. The test shows that in only 10 shampoo washes, Fluidipure 8G eliminates redness and soothes the irritated scalp.  Furthermore, Fluidipure 8G participates in reducing hair and body odor. As a biomimetic acidifying agent, it helps attacked skin to regain its physiological acidic pH so ensuring its integrity. Lastly, the addition of 5% Fluidipure 8G, in combination with sorbic acid, protects formulations against microbial proliferation. [2] “Fluidipure 8G offers rare multipurpose efficacy, coupled with real ease of use. It is readily incorporated into deodorants, hygiene products, greasy-skin products, preservative-free formulations, etc. Its liquid form, its efficacy and its affordable formulation cost make this active agent an obvious advantage for our clients. It finally affords a solution to the strong worldwide demand for purifying active agents,” concludes Carla Perez, SEPPIC’s Head of Functional Active Products. SEPPIC offers Fluidipure 8G in liquid and transparent form so as the active can be more readily incorporated into various types of cosmetic care or hygiene products, including processes performed without heating."
Naturex launches new range of botanical oils sourced from the world’s biodiversity,"To better address market trends, Naturex offers a range of 13 botanical oils with various properties and meeting strict specifications, both in terms of quality and in terms of sustainability. The range includes well-known oils such as argan oil (Morocco) as well as other more innovative oils, such as Sacha Inchi oil (Peru), Marula oil (South Africa) or the Ungurahi oil (Peru).  Already an expert in apricot or cranberry, Naturex has secured a global sourcing focusing on quality and durability for all the other products in the range. In order to select the oils featured in the range and set up the supply chains, Naturex relied on the expertise of ethnobotanist Chris Khilham, which has been appointed as Naturex’s “sustainability ambassador”.  ""To be included in the range, the oils had to meet three criteria: availability, efficiency and a manageable environmental and social impact,"" he said. Naturex’s global network of buyers and agricultural experts has also largely contributed to the project, in particular in selecting producers supplying the highest qualities. “Our agronomic experts worked closely with local growers, implementing strict control processes and careful documentation to ensure high traceability of crops. We have developed strong partnerships in order to preserve and encourage biodiversity and guarantee fair wages to local populations through their own organizations,” said Personal Care business unit director Stéphanie Puel. To formalize its commitment, Naturex will be donating 1% of the sales generated by its NAT oleis range back to the planet and communities where the botanical oils are sourced.  The funds collected could, for instance, help to buy new presses in isolated villages in Africa or replant trees in the Amazon rainforest. Naturex said that all oils in the NAT oleis range have undergone a strict and rigorous cold-press process for extracting the oil from the kernel or the fruit.  This eco-friendly method does not involve the use of organic solvents and preserves the actives. The group is also able to offer several organic references thanks to the COSMOS certification of its Avignon site in France. In order to preserve the properties of these oils and improve the stability and shelf life of the most sensitive ones, Naturex has also developed a set of natural antioxidant solutions. “For instance, this proprietary process shows exceptional results for Tsubaki oil, whose resistance to oxidation is multiplied by 29,” the company stated. As far as the oils’ cosmetic efficacy is concerned, Naturex has compiled all the scientific references available.  The company also conducted several clinical studies for some them. The oils’ sensorial characteristics were also mapped according to three criteria: wetness, absorbency, and greasiness. Naturex has also conducted clinical trials for some of them, especially to test their smoothing capacity and their effectiveness in reducing wrinkles. “Each botanical oil has a unique composition in fatty acids (monounsaturated and essential) and unsaponifiable compounds and offers different benefits for hair and skin care. For example, the richness in oleic acid of Ungurahui oil makes it the perfect ingredient for repairing dry skin and hair,” explained the company. The NAT oleis range will be showcsed at the next Sustainable Cosmetics Summit in Paris (21-23 October 2013) and at In Cosmetics Asia in Bangkok (29-31 October 2013)."
Merck addresses skin tone concerns with two new ingredients,"These additions to Merck’s RonaCare range of active ingredients address different skin concerns of Western and Asian societies. Whereas RonaCare Bronzyl creates an even, natural-looking tan, RonaCare Pristine Bright produces a flawless, porcelain-like complexion. Both products are based on patent-protected compounds discovered and developed in-house by Merck. The two new active ingredients take into account different, and in some cases, culturally-driven preferences. Indeed, while sun-tanned skin remains a beauty ideal in western societies, light-coloured skin is particularly prized in Asian cultures.  However, common to both is the desire to prevent signs of skin aging - an effect that both ingredients offer. RonaCare Bronzyl, which will be marketed predominantly in Europe and the United States, stimulates the production of melanin and activates the natural tanning process. “Both effects inhibit skin aging caused by exposure to UV radiation,” says Merck. The company has performed studies on human tissue cultures that showed that the application of RonaCare Bronzyl contributed to a significant, 43% increase in melanin in the basal layer after ten days. ""The market segment for cosmetic active ingredients that use a biological mode of action to allow the body to tan is still very new. We are convinced that this technologically sophisticated segment will see strong growth in the coming years and we look forward to helping to shape it,"" says Michael Weiden, Head of the Functional Materials business field at Merck. Merck’s other recent launch, RonaCare Pristine Bright, provides the exact opposite effect as it prevents the skin from tanning, decreases hyper-pigmentation and freshens skin colour.  Merck will market it using the slogan “Skin goes porcelain.” Merck says RonaCare Pristine Bright will help it to tap into a market growing at an annual average rate of five percent.  “Since competing active ingredients often have insufficient toxicological safety and a tendency toward instability and discoloration in formulations, modern ingredients are in high demand in the cosmetics industry,” explains Merck. Merck has assessed the efficacy of RonaCare Pristine Bright in one ex vivo and three in vivo studies that have demonstrated its capacity to inhibit tyrosinase - an enzyme that plays an important role in the formation of the natural skin pigment melanin. “Due to its excellent efficacy, low application concentrations suffice to achieve the desired effect,” says the company."
Beraca’s new Brazilian ingredients hit the market,"Beraca believes that in the wake of the worldwide success of argan oil, Brazil’s murumuru butter is set to show great promise for hair care products.  “Its natural approach to nourishing and revitalizing the hair fibre has caught the attention of cosmetic giants and has been gaining new fans every day,” says the Brazilian supplier of natural raw materials. Thus, murumuru butter was used as the key active in L’Oréal’s recently launched Absolut Control hair care range, which features six different hair care products and is sold exclusively in Brazilian hair salons. A true success in Brazil, the line has just announced a new addition to its portfolio - the Amazonian Oil to help taming rebellious hair, to provide anti-frizz control and to nourish hair - and is set to reach out to new markets, starting by Japan. The ingredient is extracted from the seed of the murumuru (Astrocaryum murumuru), a palm tree typical from the Amazon region. Rich in lauric, myristic and oleic acid, murumuru butter is a powerful emollient agent, which nourishes and moisturizes the hair and skin. When used in hair care products, it has an anti-frizz effect, reducing hair volume and providing softness and shine. Managing Director of the Professional Products Division at L’Oréal Brasil, Maya Colombani says it is the first time that the company uses murumuru butter as a core ingredient in its products. “We wanted to launch a revolutionary range by merging nature and technology, which would be able to fully meet the needs of Brazilian women, the world’s most demanding consumers when it comes to hair,” she says. According to a research conducted by the French group, 47% of Brazilian women claim to have thick, rebellious hair; and 76% out of those would like to reduce hair volume and frizz. Murumuru butter is also one of the main ingredients of Surya Brazil new Ecocert certified body and face care line, Sapien Women. A leading natural, organic and vegan beauty brand in Brazil, Surya offers a line of products formulated with natural ingredients sourced from the Brazilian biodiversity. In addition to murumuru butter, products in the Sapien Women line features ingredients such as white clay, pracaxi oils, açai and buriti. Beraca wants to become a bridge between Amazonian communities and cosmetic brands, while promoting sustainable access to resources through responsible collection and harvest. The murumuru butter supplied by Beraca is manufactured through partnerships with local communities working. In the region of Bragança, state of Pará, more than 100 families are involved in the activity, which contributes to regional development and is an important source of income for the local people. “In order to provide sustainable ingredients to the cosmetic industry, Beraca tracks each and every stage of the supply chain, from sourcing to delivering,” says Daniel Sabará, Managing Director at Beraca. “We are committed to the process of empowering local communities, aiming to increase their opportunities in the market while contributing to the conservation of the world’s largest rainforest.”"
Clariant launches new range of preservative blends to replace parabens,"Clariant, a Switzerland-based manufacturer and supplier of chemical specialities, carries on its research and development on alternatives to parabens, with the aim to help decreasing the quantity of preservatives in cosmetic products. In a context of strong concerns in Europe regarding the impact on these substances on human health, Clariant’s strategy seems consistent with the market demand. Nipaguard Zero, Clariant’s new range of preservative blends, is based on Velsan SC (INCI name: Sorbitan Caprylate), a synergistic booster developed by Clariant and made from renewable and natural raw materials. Velsan SC enables using a reduced amount of preservatives while providing reliable protection against bacteria, yeasts and fungi. According to Clariant, the Nipaguard Zero range “provides broad-spectrum preservation, is easy to use, safe and effective at low concentrations and also meets major regulatory requirements.” The four products in the range, all based on Velsan SC, are: Nipaguard SCE, Nipaguard SCM, Nipaguard SCP and Nipaguard SCV.  The four Nipaguard Zero blends can be used in rinse-off and leave-on applications, wet wipes and difficult-to-preserve formulations, including an Ecocert approved option. “We understand the challenges that our customers face, in finding a safe and reliable preservative for their formulations, while navigating the frequently changing trends, regulations and requirements. We work with our customers to provide solutions to these challenges that are innovative, sustainable and effective to deliver confidence in preservation,” said Anu Desikan, Global Marketing Manager for Personal Care at Clariant."
Worlée Cosmetics launches PE- and PP-exfoliant alternative,"Based on castor oil, the WorléeBeads HCO are sourced from fully renewable resources and are entirely biodegradable.  According to Worlée Cosmetics, there use is safe for humans, animals and the environment.  They can therefore can be used in environmental any kind of cosmetic rinse-off. Indeed, plastic micro particles (100 - 500 μm) used in cosmetic applications have been pointed out for their negative impact on marine eco-systems.  Due to their low particle size, plastic micro particles can pass through filter plants and finally end up in great quantities in the oceans and from there to marine life and finally into the human food chain. Worlée Cosmetics also claims that plastic micro particles finding their way to landfill may still be potentially harmful for decades due to the very slow decomposition of plastics. Based on wax, the WorléeBeads HCO are characterized by a uniformly smooth surface thus resulting in a ""scrub that gently protects the skin."" Unlike pumice, silica sand, silica or walnut shells or crushed wood fibres, the WorléeBeads HCO are free from sharp edges that may cause injuries to the upper layer of the skin and skin dermatitis following, particularly in case of frequent use."
New sunscreen filters mimic coral UV protection,"The development builds on work by scientists at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) who were the first to discover the natural sun screening ability of coral on the Great Barrier Reef.  Natural skincare brand, Larissa Bright Australia, who studied the results of over 20 years of AIMS research into how shallow-water corals protect themselves from UV light then approached the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) with the aim to find a way to convert this natural method of coping with exposure to the intensive UV rays from Queensland’s sunshine, into a safe and effective sunscreen for human use. CSIRO scientists have spent the last two years adapting the coral’s sunscreen code so that it can be s used in human sunscreen. Eventually, the coral’s natural sunscreen was improved to create a suite of 48 new sunscreen filters that are resistant to both UVA and UVB rays and are clear and colourless. “The molecular make up of the coral’s natural sunscreen filter was quite complex, but the real challenge was modifying it so that it was resistant to both UVA and UVB radiation in one molecule which is what makes these filters so unique,” explained CSIRO Research Scientist Dr Mark York, who led the research project in conjunction with Senior Research Scientist Dr Jack Ryan. According to the Australian science body, “the breakthrough paves the way for a new generation of sunscreens which harness the same protective barriers developed by Australia’s Great Barrier Reef corals over millions of years to survive in the harsh Australian sun.” Larissa Bright Australia is now looking for a commercial partner to incorporate the new technology and bring the compounds into full scale production. The broad spectrum coral sunscreen filters are expected to be available to consumers across the globe within five years."
Cosmetopea: botanical knowledge,"Launched by the Cosmetic Valley three years ago, the Cosmétopée (cosmetopea or cosmetopeia) project is the equivalent for the cosmetics sector of the ""pharmacopoeia"" in the pharmaceutical field. The aim of the project is mainly to identify and to formalize the cosmetic properties of the planet’s botanical resources, including through the structuration of individual initiatives. An ambitious project thus, that is carried on through several international partnerships and that should also facilitate the access to these resources for concerned companies, especially for SMEs. An interesting array of investigation for the cosmetics industry, which is well known for its permanent quest of new active ingredients, especially of plant origin. While the project covers the census of traditional practices and usages of plants in the beauty field, the aim is not to plunder ancestral knowledge. From this point of view, states the Cosmetic Valley, the cosmetopea project is part of the Nagoya Protocol, signed in 2010, on the use of the world’s genetic resources and against biopiracy. ""It is important to know that 60% of botanical raw materials used by the aromas and flavours industry are sourced from wild plants,"" said Christain Moretti of the Research Institute for Development (IRD). In practice, ethnobotanists must always perform wide literature and field researches. The collection of information on traditional uses of plants implies to ""take into account the information related to the origin and location of the interviewee; actually, different populations use similar plants differently and for different properties,"" said Blandine Akendengué of the Department of Pharmacology at the Faculty of Medicine of Libreville, Gabon. However, the collection of data regarding traditional uses and the selection of plant materials is only a first step. For instance, the saponins from the African and Asian biodiversity are well known for their detergent properties. But researches have shown their high structural and biological diversity and have demonstrated that ""some saponins are efficient against skin aging, as they interact with the membrane’s sterols at the dermal level,"" explains Marie Aleth Lacaille-Dubois, Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, University Burgundy. ""Our research strategy combines complementary studies such as ethnobotany, phytochemistry,and pharmacology,"" she adds. The cosmetopea project also includes the development of new extraction methods. The most recent advances are centred on green chemistry. The supercritical fluids method is a good illustration of such advances. ""It provides highly concentrated fractions, stabilizes and facilitates the production compounds difficult to obtain. This process suits perfectly to the production of samples with low water content and is consistent with the principles of green chemistry,"" said Eric Lesellier, of the Organic and Analytical Institute of Chemistry in Orleans. Other innovative methods, such as sound waves extraction, microwave extraction, or electric pulsed fields extraction, also match ""with the aim of developing low-cost, rapid, and environmentally friendly, extraction processes,"" added Joel Doussot and Christophe Hano from the Laboratory of Wood and Crops Biology at the University of Orleans. There are also promising outlooks regarding objectivation methods. Patrick Trouillas, from the Faculty of Pharmacy of Limoges, uses quantum chemistry calculations and molecular dynamics to evaluate physico-chemical properties relating to the antioxidant activities of natural compounds. ""In silico simulations have a predictive potential that could quickly be made available to the industry. Calculation can already allow us to understand the pigmentation of different compounds,"" said the researcher. ""Thanks to our models, we can measure the ability of antioxidants to interact with membranes, to quantify this interaction, to measure the penetration effects, and to determine the fraction which is responsible for the antioxidant activity,"" said Sandrine Morandet from Compiègne’s University of Technology. Considering that, according to Joel Doussot, ""only 15% of the 300,000 terrestrial plant species have been studied in terms of their biological activity,"" a lot of research remains to be done by the cosmetics industry."
Clariant: a new polymer for a velvety skin feel,"Clariant’s new Aristoflex Velvet polymer aims at answering the need for ultra soft and velvety skin feel in high-end skin care formulations. Aristoflex Velvet is an ethylene oxide-free and preservative-free ingredient that adds a soft and smooth skin feel to formulations during application and rub in.  Clariant explains that its innovative composition does not immediately break on skin when applied, but instead gently melts while applying to leave skin feeling evenly soft and moisturized. “With Aristoflex Velvet, manufacturers of skin care products can achieve a superior sensory profile for creams, lotions, balms, milks and serums - from light to rich caring products for all skin types. Its broad usage spectrum from pH 3 – 8 makes it compatible with a wide range of preservatives. It has a high compatibility with organic solvents, allowing special formulations such as tonics, hand sanitizers and nail polish removers with a soft, velvety, non-drying skin feel. Aristoflex Velvet also provides excellent suspending properties in a variety of products enabling the stabilization of colorful beads, exfoliating scrubs, microcapsules, sparkling pearls, and shimmering particles, for example,” explains Clariant. Clariant also underlines that an important feature of the Aristoflex Velvet is its high temperature stability in formulations. In addition, Aristoflex Velvet provides ease of formulation: it is pre-neutralized, ready-to-use and is easy to add at any formulation step, dispersing easily in both the oil or water phase. Aristoflex Velvet was developed in line with Clariant’s new Secret Code of Beauty concept that was recently unveiled at the last In-Cosmetic trade show in Paris and most recently at FCE Cosmetique in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Clariant’s new “Secret Code of Beauty” is a combination of these five keywords (Sensory, Innovation, Xpert, Trend, Ecotain) focused on helping the company’s customers achieve new levels of success in Personal Care. “Today’s consumers desire products that make them feel good about themselves,” says Anu Desikan, global Marketing Manager Personal Care at Clariant. “Aristoflex Velvet delivers unique benefits to a wide range of applications, giving skin care manufacturers an opportunity to provide their consumers with the luxurious sensory experiences they desire along with the superior performance our customers expect from Clariant’s Aristoflex polymer range.”"
Alban Muller completes its portefolio of botanical cosmetic ingredients,"Alban Muller International, a French specialist of plant-based cosmetic ingredients and formulations, showcased its two new ingredients at the last In-Cosmetics tradeshow in Paris: Repulpami ER, an anti-ageing active based on the combination of of two Senegalese plants and Amiox ER, an eco-designed antioxidant complying with the Cosmos standard. The company also highlighted Amiderm ER, its solution to maintain the pH of the skin that was initially launched in January 2013 at Cosmetagora. Developed by bringing together White Hibiscus (bissap) and Baobab from the Tambacounda and Louga regions (Senegal), Repulpami ER [1] targets the factors responsible for the visible signs of skin ageing. According to Alban Muller, Repulpami ER acts by a combination of actions: an anti-wrinkle action achieved by reducing face muscle contractions, a plumping action by inhibiting lipolysis and stimulating adipogenesis, and a firming action by stimulating the expression of the genes coding for the proteins responsible for tight-junctions and thus, for the strength and tone of the skin. “Repulpami is the ideal active for global anti-ageing face care products, mature skin care products, anti-wrinkle, resurfacing, firming, plumping products, bust, neck and décolleté care products, firming products for the arms,” claims the company. Alban Muller also offers a new natural antioxidant made from rosemary oleoresin on a sunflower oil base.  Amiox [2] is an alternative to conventional antioxidants that protects the oil phases of cosmetics from oxidation.  Its efficacy was assessed through a RANCIMAT test and a monitoring of the peroxide value conducted over two months. Amiox ER is rich in active principles, resulting from a rigorous agronomic selection. It is titrated in carnosic acid and carnosol, molecules with recognized antioxidant properties. The extraction is made with plant-based ethanol allowing Amiox ER to comply with the Cosmos standard. Eventually, Amiderm ER [3], which was previously showcased during Cosmetagora, completes the list of Alban Muller’s innovations. Amiderm ER offers an anti-urease activity which prevents the degradation of urea in ammonia in case of perspiration.  Its efficacy stands on the specificity of a witch hazel tannin.  Amiderm ER thus enables stabilising the skin pH and maintains its natural protection avoiding irritation and unpleasant smell production.  “Amiderm ER mode of action makes it the essential ingredient in all situations when skin is stressed by an increase in pH: particularly sensitive and wet areas of the body, babies’ bottom, normal and excessive perspiration,“ claims Alban Muller."
BASF presents solutions inspired by people’s everyday needs,"The second level of BASF’s Care Creations brand roll-out, which was presented at In-Cosmetics in Paris, shifted the focus towards observing consumer needs and desires.  BASF analysed market research data and transformed them into real-life products. “We are looking at people’s demands up close, as though we are standing face to face with them,” says Thomas Schroeder, Vice President Business Management Personal Care Europe at BASF. “That way, we can identify opportunities for new, unique performance ingredients that, on the one hand, are of real value for consumers and, on the other hand, help our customers find success on the market.” Thus, along with this second level, BASF unveiled “Cosmetics for real life”: a new formulation concept filled with products that have been inspired by people’s diverse everyday needs.  Actually, BASF employees have been involved in the project by participating in the face-to-face interviews, thus contributing to the definition of consumer’s new day-to-day needs and individual preferences.  Furthermore, some of them were selected to illustrate the different concepts. “Over the course of a single day, people assume a number of roles based on their culture, environment, interests and the opportunities available to them. Going to work, raising children, and enjoying hobbies - everyone has many various facets to their life, each of which involves different needs and desires,” explains the company. Beauty Creations, the cosmetic active ingredient business of BASF, presented Shadownyl, a seaweed (Fucus vesiculosus) extract designed to combat both the formation of wrinkles and “dark circles” around the eyes for a fully refreshed and enlightened eye contour.  Shadownyl utilizes a novel biological pathway targeting heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an enzyme involved in the reduction of free heme content in the skin - a major cause of dark circle formation. In addition, Shadownyl was shown to exhibit antioxidant as well as anti-inflammatory properties. It also showed very good in vitro results for collagen type-1 stimulation activity, which may lead to a skin re-plumping effect. Two clinical studies, conducted on 27 and 22 volunteers respectively, highlighted Shadownyl’s ability to visibly decrease the coloration associated with dark circles across the eye contour area.  Shadownyl also demonstrated a three-dimensional anti-wrinkle effect in just a one-week treatment. Beauty Creations also showcased plant-based Freshaxyl, a natural anti-odour active for the growing deo market.  Freshaxyl is a synergistic blend of Moringa polypeptide extract and plant-based glyceryl laurate, which helps to dramatically reduce bodily odours. “Freshaxyl bacteriostatic activity slows down the proliferation of microorganisms and Moringa has detoxifying properties which help to capture odours,” says BASF.  The active ingredient’s ability to significantly reduce perspiration-related odours has been clinically demonstrated and is comparable to that of a market benchmark product. Another new ingredient on display at this year’s In-Cosmetics was Lamesoft® OD. A micro emulsion made up entirely of renewable raw materials to enrich body cleansing products with finely dispersed oil. The oil remains on the skin after washing, supporting natural skin protection. BASF also launched Tinosorb A2B, a broad-spectrum UV filter which provides protection from UVB and UVAII wavelengths from 290 through to 340 nm.  “Thanks to its superior UV absorbance capabilities, it is now one of the most efficient UV filters available on the European market, and closes the protection gap in the UVAII range that wasn’t covered by UV filters available to date,” claims the company. Eventually, BASF introduced Luviset One, the latest addition to its hair care portfolio. According to the company, this all-in-one solution for hair styling gels, creams and waxes delivers strong styling performance, long-lasting curl retention and provides a smooth, crystal-clear gel base. BASF will also feature these new personal care technologies and market concepts at the New York Society of Cosmetic Chemists (NYSCC) Suppliers’ Day on May 14-15 at the New Jersey Convention and Exposition centre in Edison, close to New York."
SEPPIC introduces its gourmet “Cosmetofood” formulas and a series of new products,"Cooking is also meeting success in the cosmetics industry with an increasing use of food ingredients and food-like claims. Capitalising on this trend Seppic presented, during the lastes edition of In-Cosmetics, (16-18 April 2013, in Paris) a series formulations inspired from cooking recipes. Seppic’s suggestions feature four salty recipes (“Exfoliating Tapenade”, “Southern Flavors Gaspacho - Vitality Serum”, “Egg 2 ways: Marshmallow Yolk & refreshing Whites”, “Avocado Pulp Mask - Global Anti-aging”) and four sweet recipes (“Chocolate Treat - Body Soother”,  “Melting caramel butter”,  “Raspberry Honey Facial Cleanser - Sulfate free!”,  “Smooth Skin Delight - Coffee Slimming Gel”). To extend the experience, Seppic also propose to fill in a form on its website to search for tailor-made ""Cosmetofood"" formulas using available Seppic ingredients classified according to numerous criteria (by claim, food concept, application, texture, formulation, or raw material). Seppic also showcased a series of new products including: – Survicode, a cellular communication booster, that reactivates intercellular interactions for a more harmonious skin. Seppic has assessed its efficacy with the aid of a cellular aging model.
– Simulgreen 18-2, a new green emulsifier for sunscreen lotions providing a non-soaping texture (no white residue on the skin), even in natural formulations rich in vegetable oils and natural gums.
– Esculane, an anti-dandruff natural ingredient of marine origin developed by BiotechMarine, and which was awarded the bronze prize at the In-Cosmetics’ 2013 Best Ingredient Award competition.
– Eliclear 4U, a new rheological modifier and the first outcome of the partnership announced last year between Seppic and Coatex. It addresses the needs of formulators that want excellent clarity for both traditional and sulphate free surfactant based systems containing suspended particles. Eventually, Seppic also presented new data for its Sepiwhite™ MSH, Aquaxyl™ and Simulgreen™ 18-2, as well as advice on formulating «sulphate-free” hygiene products and micellar water."
Most successful in-cosmetics to date highlights natural and high performance ingredients,"As anticipated, the latest edition of the in-cosmetics trade show, which was held on 16-18 April in Paris, has been the most successful ever.  According to Reed Exhibitions, the organisers of the event, more than 9,400 unique visitors - a 20% increase on the previous record for visitor numbers - came to Paris to discover new ingredients, formulations and an extensive educational programme.  More than 650 exhibitors packed the show floor, including over 100 companies who had never been to an in-cosmetics event before. Innovation was celebrated at the show in an awards ceremony at the end of the first day. Induchem’s new ingredient Neodermyl® was selected as the winner of the in-cosmetics’ Innovation Zone Best Ingredient Award, recognised for it efficacy and scientific grounding.  Silver prize went to Symrise with SymHair® Force 1631, a natural anti-hair loss active, whilst BiotechMarine was awarded bronze for its new anti-dandruff ingredient, Esculane®. Furthermore, Dr Karl Lintner was announced as the winner of in-cosmetics Lifetime Achievement Award. The fact that the three winners of the in-cosmetics’ Innovation Zone Best Ingredient Award be natural ingredients or of natural origin (Neodermyl® is an active coming from biotechnology, made of a new derivative of glucose combined with amino acids and copper) illustrates brands’ always growing interest in natural actives. In order to address this demand, ingredient suppliers continue to consolidate their positions in the sector. Thus, the 2013 edition of in-cosmetics has been preceded by the acquisition, earlier this year, of BiotechMarine, a supplier of marine actives based in Brittany, by SEPPIC, a subsidiary of Air Liquide, or the acquisition of CRM (Cosmetic Raw Materials) International, a French based manufacturer of natural ingredients for the personal care industry, by Clariant. And, most recently, Lucas Meyer Cosmetics (Unipex group), announced the acquisition of Australian company Southern Cross Botanicals. Historical players in the natural segment are not lagging behind, as it is illustrated by Silab’s opening of a third production unit at the end of 2012, and the recent certification of five of its ingredients to the Cosmos standard. However, having to cope with an increasing competitive pressure - also from related areas such as cosmetic surgery and dermatological procedures - cosmetic brands are simultaneously demanding ever more powerful ingredients. Therefore, natural solutions proposed by ingredient suppliers must be at least as effective as the traditional actives. Through very extensive claims, the 2013 edition of in-cosmetics thus unveiled he great potential of natural actives. The ingredients innovations listed in PremiumBeautyNews.com’s special issue on cosmetic ingredients are a good illustration of this trend. The next in-cosmetics take place in Hamburg, Germany 1-3 April 2014."
Anti-Aging: Protection strategies for mitochondria,"This article was originally published in our last week’s special issue “Cosmetic Ingredients”.  To read the entire issue and download it, click here. Mitochondria are small cell organelles found in most eukaryotic cells. They have the particularity of having their own DNA – mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) –, to be able to multiply or self-destruct regardless of the division of the cell itself and to be the main power plants of the cell. Their double membrane, the inner part of which is characterized by many folds promotes an intense transformation activity of substances provided by the supply in energy usable by the cells namely adenosine triphosphate (ATP). But it is also during this respiratory chain that the mitochondrion generates the ROS (reactive oxygen species), making it the prime target of oxidative attacks. [1] Mitochondrial DNA has its own particular characteristics by being smaller than the DNA of the cell, less protected because lacking a nuclear membrane and with fewer repair systems available than cellular DNA. If the alterations of mDNA are too important, the mitochondrion will self-destruct thus leading to cellular death. Beyond energy production, the mitochondrion, or rather the mitochondria (all the mitochondrions) are essential to the proper functioning of body cells. They take a part in complex signalling pathways and are involved in a number of neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging. At the medical level, a decrease in mitochondrial functions such as those caused by caloric restriction could have a positive impact on aging according to Dr. Johan Auwerx from the Laboratory for Integrative and Systems Physiology at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale of Lausanne [2]. For his part, Andrew Dillin evidenced that disruptions in the mitochondrial function affected the entire body and its longevity [3]. There is a plethora of research work on this subject and the Congress, “Targeting Mitochondria”, whose 4th edition will take place on 17 and 18 October 2013 in Berlin will address in detail the subject of mitochondria and how they can be reached. “The mitochondrion is at the heart of aging, hundreds of diseases are related to its dysfunctions. In recent years, scientific advances were achieved on the early detection of mitochondrial alterations but also on the possibility of finding nanocarriers allowing to reach these difficult targets,” explained Marwin Edeas, Chairman of the French Society of Anti-oxidants and organizer of the Congress Targeting Mitochondria [4]. Some players like Mrs C. Peyreigne biologist, founder of Oxincell, a company specialized in the study and analysis of the mitochondrial function do not hesitate to say that “it is likely that mitochondriology will become in the coming years, one of the leading disciplines of the 21st century.” Preserving mitochondria is therefore crucial. Cosmetics manufacturers have realized that and have been offering innovations in this area for several years now. Skin being provided with these valuable substances. The molecules of interest which have been developed act according to different approaches. A first path is to consider the mitochondrion like a power plant that needs to be maintained and stimulated. Greentech with Somitine®, a biotech active, acts on cellular respiration by increasing it at the basal and mitochondrial level without however impairing the energy balance. The cells produce more energy and the radiance and luminosity of the skin are improved. Mibelle with its NanoLipobelle DN CoQ10, a bioavailable concentrate of Q10 coenzyme titrated at 7% combats the decline in energy production and enables, thanks to its antioxidant properties, to act against the ROS. The nanoencapsulation delivery system improves the diffusion of the active to the mitochondria. Exsymol, with Methiopeptide® offers a biomimetic derivative of methionine with antioxidant properties, a protection of the respiratory function at the cellular level. Its ability to regenerate itself under the action of the MSR (methionine sulfoxide reductase) imparts it in addition with a long lasting effect. Codif Recherche et Nature with Hydrofiltrat statice G, stimulates the expression of mitochondrial sirtuin SIRT3, an enzyme the over expression of which increases respiration while reducing the production of ROS, an interesting balance to achieve in the fight against aging. Finally Sederma with Juvinity®, a geranylgeranylpropanol extract in a oil soluble carrier regulates cellular oxidative stress, enables to rebalance the mitochondrial activity (+ 63% in the membrane potential) and to stimulate the ATP synthesis (+ 76%). Its complementary action on ensuring the maintenance of telomere length and on the synthesis of the major components of the dermis makes it a global anti-aging active. Another strategy focuses on protecting the mDNA which is very sensitive to oxidative stress. Codif Recherche et Nature, with Phycojuvenine – a brown seaweed extract of Laminaria digitata – offers to protect mitochondria during UVA exposure. Tested at 1%, the active limits UVA induced cytochrome C leakage. Cytochrome C being a heme protein associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane and which is released from it when the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is activated. Barnet, distributed by Inter’actifs repairs the damages caused to nuclear and mitochondrial DNA by oxidative stress, pollution and UV radiation. Their active, Roxisomes V is a liposomal enzyme of the 8-Oxoguanine glycosylase. Solabia with Viniderm derived from a grape juice extract from the French Languedoc-Roussillon region protects the essential components of the skin including the mitochondrial DNA. 0.06% of the active enables to increase by 63% the aconitase activity. Finally, a third approach focuses on molecules enabling an anti cellulite action by acting on mitochondria. A claim recently associated with mitochondria. Codif Recherche et Nature with Actiporine 8G, launched at In-Cosmetics 2013, targets mitochondrial aquaporin 8 in charge of the diffusional transport of H2O2 from the inside to the outside of the mitochondria. By ridding them of this toxic agent, the active maintains their physical and functional integrity and stimulates the original cell activity of adipocytes with namely lipolysis, and of fibroblasts with the collagen synthesis. Sederma with Phytosonic® restores the mitochondrial activity, helps burn the free fatty acids resulting from lipolysis activation and increases the cellular energy while stopping the cellulite induced-oxidative stress. Impag with Corolea Bio stimulates the TGR5 receptor of adipocytes leading to an increase in mitochondrial activity and to a fat burning effect. This active is the result of a partnership with the French company Phytodia. These numerous molecules show why it is really worthwhile targeting mitochondria. To assess their activity, the ICDD company, founded in 2007 by Nathalie Compagnone, offers innovative technologies by working directly on the living cell: “Our strength lies in two differentiating factors as our assays are conducted in the living cell itself and not on isolated mitochondria, meaning that the latter is studied in its natural environment. In addition, it is a multi-parametric analysis within a same cell population during the same experiment,” she emphasised. Their patented technologies were first proposed to the pharmaceutical industry and have now been made available for the past 2 years to the cosmetics market. Several models are offered like the Mitoread Anti-âge, Mitoread mtDNA, Mitoread redox c / mt SOD, Mitoread BBS... enabling to measure the effects of actives on the mitochondrion. Undoubtedly mitochondria have still many things to reveal. On the occasion of the in-cosmetics trade show, which was held last week in Paris, Premium Beauty News has offered its readers a special issue dedicated to cosmetic ingredients.

Induchem’s Neodermyl scoops gold at in-cosmetics,"The judges [1] applauded Induchem for its scientific innovation, the use of green chemistry and the demonstrated efficacy of the ingredient that offers real benefits in formulation. According to Induchem, Neodermyl reactivates collagens and elastin synthesis in the skin and to reenergise senescent fibroblasts by supplying them with an activated source of cellular energy. This results in a fast and sustainable production of Collagen III, Collagen I, Tropoelastin and Elastin, which lead to visible improvement of skin texture and reduction of wrinkle. In just two weeks Neodermyl gives equivalent results to one needle injection of collagen by a plastic surgeon (-15% wrinkle depth reduction). “Our R&D and marketing teams have worked incredibly hard to create Neodermyl, a product we’re extremely proud of.  The other finalists this year all had fantastic products, so to have been recognised with this prestigious award is a real honour. 2013 has so far been a very productive year for us and we look forward to the future,” said Fabrice Lefèvre, R&D and Marketing Director, Induchem. Furthermore, Symrise’s SymHair Force 1631 was awarded the Silver prize.  SymHair Force 1631 is a natural anti-hair loss active from a sustainable source of Microalgae that fortifies hair whilst improving density. The judges were especially impressed with the ingredient’s proven ability to increase hair shaft elongation by up to 13%. Eventually, BiotechMarine’s Esculane, an anti-dandruff natural ingredient of marine origin, was awarded bronze. Also read, PremiumBeautyNews.com’s special issue on cosmetic ingredients: here."

Shiseido wants to grow its own botanical raw materials,"Shiseido has started several test operations for in-house cultivation of its own plant-based raw materials.  As a first step, the leading Japanese cosmetic manufacturer has installed a container-type facility in its Kakegawa factory, thus enabling plants used as raw materials for active ingredients to be grown in a controlled environment.  The next step is the set up of an open field test farm that is debuting full-scale operation from April. Shiseido is thus making another step forward its aims to launch cosmetics products formulated with plants that have been cultivated under the company’s supervision by 2014 at the earliest. Shiseido will gradually expand the on-site cultivation and production of sources of plant raw materials while also gaining cooperation from raw material manufacturers. Of course, the aim of this initiative is to address the expansion of the natural- and organic-oriented segment of the cosmetics market.  Shiseido also aims at increasing reassurance regarding safety and traceability regarding its products, while standing out from the mass of competitors that outsource their production to other companies. According to the Japanese company, there are at least three main advantages to in-house production of botanical ingredients required for cosmetic products: – supervising culture from the stage of seeds and seedlings makes it possible to procure raw materials that are “safe and reliable,” “of stable quality” and “traceable,” enabling identification of the background of plants and producers,
– controlling cultivation conditions will also broaden the potential of producing raw materials that contain greater amounts of active ingredients and using such high quality plant raw materials will contribute to the development of products with strong market competitiveness,
– stable harvests will help securing supplies and reducing price fluctuation risk. Furthermore, Shiseido also plans to use natural energy as a heat source in certain parts of the plant farm."
"The natural trend and India drive the growth of cosmetic ingredients, says Kline ","According to the latest figures from Kline’s Global Personal Care Ingredients database [1], conditioning polymers, antimicrobials, and emulsifiers performed particularly well on the personal care ingredients market in 2012.  However, the research firm highlights that surfactants are maintaining their primacy as the largest product category and that polymers are displaying dynamic growth. The ubiquitous specialty surfactants - that are used in many personal care products as detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, and/or foaming agents - continue to contribute to the highest volumes of the global personal care ingredients market consumption rate.  Kline & Company clasps the combined surfactants consumption across the United States, EU 27, India, Japan, China, and Southeast Asia at 507 million pounds (about 229,97 million kilograms) in 2012.  Kline forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.6% to the year 2017. As a global phenomenon, the natural trend drives the growth of specific surfactants in both mature and emerging markets.  A biodegradable surfactant, alkyl polyglucoside finds fertile ground in the growing number of shampoos and cleansing products containing environmentally friendly ingredients in Europe. Organic alkyl polyglucoside and lauryl glucoside surfactants are gaining momentum in India too. Kline & Company forecasts a 10% CAGR through 2017 for alkyl polyglucoside consumption and an 8% CAGR for lauryl glucosides.  However, India preserves its own specificities. For instance, as many Indian consumers seek cleansing products, which give a “white glove on the hands” appearance, an increasing number of manufacturers are adding high foamers, such as Alkanolamides into their personal care products. Conditioning polymers are expected to experience the most dynamic growth, among all the eight product categories covered by research, estimated to post approximately 5% CAGR over the next five years. The strongest growth is expected in India, where conditioning polymers will post double-digit CAGR over the forecast period. Furthermore, Southeast Asia is projected to display high growth rates, while Europe, the United States, Japan, and China will grow more modestly."
Five COSMOS-certified ingredients for Silab,"Just a few months after the establishment of the standard of the new European label, Silab has obtained the COSMOS certification for five active ingredients from its catalogue: Osilift® Bio, Sensiline® Bio, Glyco-Repair® Bio, Structurine® Bio, and Vitanol® Bio. “The list of these COSMOS-certified active ingredients will grow some time in 2013 with the entire catalogue of active ingredients that are already certified as per the ECOCERT Natural and Organic Cosmetics standard,” says the company in release. The COSMOS standard is the result of the harmonisation of separate standards of Europe’s leading certification bodies (BDIH, COSMEBIO, Ecocert Greenlife, ICEA and SOIL Association). “More than just a simple ingredient declaration, which is opted for by other market players, Silab went ahead and obtained the COSMOS certification for its active ingredients, which is extremely demanding in terms of quality, traceability and transparency – inherent to the core values of the company. This commitment is based on very comprehensive specifications of the Silab natural active ingredients: safe and sustainable sourcing, scientifically proven efficacy, toxicological validation, intellectual property,” the company adds. Thus, the list of criteria analyzed by Ecocert Greenlife, the certification body, during the annual audit, features: compliance of industrial procedures, analysis of water waste, industrial waste and power consumption, responsible purchasing policy and supply of plants from organic farming. “This COSMOS certification confirms the global policy and ethics of Silab, in compliance with the principles of the standard: promote the use of ingredients obtained from organic farming, use processes of production and transformation that are environment-friendly and have no adverse effect on human health,” concludes the company."
Silab launches natural alternative to hyaluronic acid,"Hyaluronic acid, Silab explains, is an indispensable anti-age biomarker.  Thanks to its hydrating properties, “it consolidates the dermal bed and thereby smooths out wrinkles.”  By offering a natural-based alternative to hyaluronic acid, the French supplier of cosmetic ingredients therefore targets the huge market of anti-aging and moisturizing care products. The new ingredient, Prohyal+ [1], acts on the endogenous synthesis of hyaluronic acid, thanks to its high concentration in yeast oligosaccharides from Mexican blue agave leaves. In vitro studies conducted by Silab show that Prohyal+ increases the expression of hyaluronan synthase (HAS2) synthesis enzyme and reactivates the natural mechanisms of hyaluronic acid production which naturally declines during aging. Tested at 2%, Prohyal+ significantly increases the expression of HAS2 by 651% and the synthesis of hyaluronic acid by 237%. A series of in vivo studies also allowed to compare the efficacy of Prohyal+ compared to hyaluronic acid. “After 28 days of twice daily applications and in comparison to the placebo, Prohyal+ smoothes skin microrelief at the crow’s feet. Parameter Sq and parameter Sa are reduced by 6.3% and by 7.1% respectively,” Silab explains. The study shows a reduction of wrinkles’ volume by 14.2% in 70% of the volunteers. According to Silab, the effect is similar to that obtained with hyaluronic acid, the reference molecule, formulated at 0.13% of dry matter and tested in the same conditions. The subjective evaluation also shows the good performances of Prohyal+ compared with hyaluronic acid.  After 28 days of twice daily applications, with comparison to placebo, more than 90% of volunteers considered that the formula containing Prohyal+ is a moisturizing and anti-wrinkles emulsion.  “This result is superior to that obtained with hyaluronic acid molecule,” Silab claims."
Bayer highlights new properties for its active Heterosides of Talapetraka,"The extract obtained from leaves of Centella asiatica and titrated in triterpenes (madecassoside and asiaticoside) was found new properties by acting not only at the cellular but also structural level. Indeed, the last objectification test performed on human keratinocytes showed an increase in the synthesis of ceramides 2 thus improving the skin’s barrier and permeability. In addition, previous data showed the active to normalize keratinocyte differentiation through its action on the involucrin synthesis. Its interest also lies in the strengthening of tight junctions ensuring a greater cell cohesion and activation of the deep epidermis layers through aquaporins 3 stimulation. Its broad potential of action on the skin barrier function combined with a modulation of inflammatory drifts (IL-1, IL-8, PGE-2) enables to recommend it for sensitive and reactive skins but also as an anti-ageing active. Bayer Serdex is a division of Bayer Santé Familiale owned by the German group Bayer. It has been involved since the 70s in research and innovation work focusing on the activity of Malagasy plants intended for pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications. The division takes a careful attention to strictly implement the principles of ethical sourcing."
Soliance : an anti-fat active derived from marine micro-algae,"In order to fight the influence of internal and external factors that, over time, lead to increased fat stocks and affect the body shape, Soliance has selected Dysmorphococcus globosus, a special microalgae with slimming properties that, according to the French supplier of natural ingredients, are likely to give satisfaction to demanding consumers looking for effective slimming solutions. “At Soliance we believe that the effects of time and life could be delayed,” says the company. Named Pro-DG, this new ingredient works through a dual action: – Inhibition of lipids storage by stopping the triglycerides synthesis
– Stimulation of lipolysis by stimulation of cAMP (Cyclic adenosine monophosphate or cyclic AMP) rate and glycerol release Pro-DG targets adipose tissue and can be applied on the thighs or the abdomen. Soliance recommends a dosage of 3% in cosmetic formulas. In vitro tests conducted by Soliance have shown that Pro-DG inhibits the synthesis of triglycerides up to -85% and visibly reduces the size of adipocytes within 7 days. Furthermore, in vivo tests have shown an extremely effective slimming action with a significant reduction of the thigh circumference by 1.5 cm in 56 days."
The Paris edition of In-Cosmetics is set to break new records,"Each year, In-Cosmetics, the leading trade show in cosmetic formulations, sets a new mark in the number of exhibitors. The 2013 edition should be no exception: With 12,500 m2 (134,500 sq ft) of stands already sold, organizers expect more than 600 exhibitors, against 590 for the 2012 edition in Barcelona, among which approximately 60 are first-time exhibitors at In-Cosmetics. As this year the trade show is returning to Paris, it should also break its previous records in terms of number of visitors. ""In-Cosmetics takes place in Paris every three years. Each time it is the edition for which we record the largest number of visitors,"" explains Cathy Laporte, Group Marketing Manager at Reed Exhibitions Ltd., The organizer of the event. For the first time, in partnership with the French Society of Perfumers (Société Française des Parfumeurs - SFP), a space fully dedicated to the use of perfumes in cosmetic formulations will be made available by organizers. ""We wanted to give a better visibility to a sector that is of interest to more than 30% of visitors,"" underlined Laporte. Located at the heart of the exhibition space, this area, called ""Fragrances In Cosmetics"", will consist of presentation counters and will be complemented with a training session of three and a half hours dedicated to various topics, such as natural and synthetic ingredients, technical and formulation issues, regulations and consumer trends. A round-table themed ""Perfume, pleasure, emotion and cosmetics"" will host several key members of the SFP. “The use of fragrances in cosmetics constitutes a large percentage of the work our 900 members do so we’re really pleased to be partnering with in-cosmetics 2013, , which today is the world’s leading international trade show for the personal care ingredients industry,” explained Patrick Saint-Yves, President of the SFP. Like perfumers, professionals in evaluation and regulations will also have their dedicated area. ""In a first phase, this area will mostly host new exhibitors, but we will create a specific route enabling visitors to identify all the exhibiting companies in this sector. Our goal is to group them all in the same area as of the 2014 edition, which will take place in Hamburg. This sector is the one that is enjoying the fastest growth among our exhibitors,"" said Laporte. ""Specialists in assessment protocols, formula optimization or in regulatory compliance are the unavoidable interface between ingredients and finished products,"" she added. Finally, it is water and its use in cosmetics that will be the thematic route of the 2013 edition, with twenty participants and many varied themes such as reducing the water footprint, moisturising actives, water as an active ingredient (in particular outstanding waters such as water from Tasmania, glacier water,...) which will therefore concern both formulation and industrial or environmental processes."
Oily actives: the innovation dynamics of Oléos,"Premium Beauty News - After 23 years of a career in fatty substances at the Institut des Corps Gras (ITERG), why did you chose to create – quite belatedly if I may say so, Oléos using a relatively old idea, namely the extraction of plant actives with an oily compound? Anne Rossignol-Castera - During the 23 years spent at the ITERG I had the chance to occupy four positions which have formed the pillars of my business creation:  A technical experience as a young research fellow after my engineering degree in agribusiness, an experience in team management as a laboratory manager, a mission in marketing and business development, and finally an approach to business strategy in my last position as a Development Director. By working with manufacturers on their needs and the potential transfers with the ITERG, I realized that I was sometimes frustrated at not being able to carry ideas to their logical conclusion. This is how creating my own business gradually emerged as evidence. Premium Beauty News - How was your development undertaken and who were your first customers? Anne Rossignol-Castera - The original idea, which benefited from an envelope Soleau [1] in 2006, emerged from my market observations. Indeed, oily macerated already existed – in ancient times they consisted of compositions made of plants which were left to infuse in fatty substances – but the result was disappointing particularly in terms of oxidative stability and concentration in active ingredients. The first idea, registered with the INPI (Institut National de la Protection Intellectuelle or National Industrial Property Institute) was to develop an innovative and efficient method of oily extraction based on green technology. In 2008, a second envelope Soleau was registered and in parallel, I took leave to start a business. The support of Oséo [2]  and of the business incubator of Lunel enabled me to be in contact with the Faculty of Pharmacy and the School of Chemistry of Montpellier. I took this opportunity to further my knowledge of plants and skin biology. I Very quickly I started testing microwave and ultrasound intensified eco-extractions. These techniques improve the solvent power of oils, ensure a good reproducibility of produced extracts, high yields and optimized organoleptic characteristics. The products obtained are very qualitative. In parallel, I prospected potential customers and several of them found the idea very interesting among which the Laboratoires Nuxe which were interested in organic certified oily actives, stable and objectified. We filed a patent for our oleo-extraction process [3] totally green with zero chemicals, zero solvents, zero pollution and Ecocert certified. The company Oléos SAS was created at the end of 2010. Today we have a portfolio of twenty clients with some large groups like LVMH, NUXE and small innovative brands in organic cosmetics like Alorée, Akane, Kadalys... Premium Beauty News - What do the Oléoactifs® offer compared to traditional oily actives such as oil or vitamin E? Anne Rossignol-Castera - Performance, quality, stability and significant opportunities in terms of actives since we can create exclusive and patented custom made Oléoactifs®. These compounds have a concentration in active molecules 10 times higher than a carrier oil and improved associated properties. Measurement tests have delivered very good results in terms of oxidative stress, hydration, improvement of the barrier function and of the dermal bioavailability. The oily carrier offers many advantages for the skin and can be introduced into all formulas for skincare, make-up, massage products. On the marketplace, liposoluble actives are seldom found and we are partnering with several university laboratories including the one of Prof. Patrice Rat at the University Paris Descartes, to develop cellular tests enabling to highlight the great potential of this product category and particularly of Oléoactifs®. Premium Beauty News - What does your range of Oléoactifs® consist of? Anne Rossignol-Castera - 90% of our customers are looking for custom-made and exclusive Oléoactifs® but we have a small range of specific anti-aging Oléoactifs® developed in 2011. These six products support our International development, which is achieved with exclusive distributors. We are present in South Korea, Hong Kong, Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece and Russia. Premium Beauty News - Now you are taking an interest in the perfume industry with the launch of Oléo’Sense®. Which markets are you targeting? Anne Rossignol-Castera - The Oléoactifs® represent a modern version of maceration, while with the Oléo’Sense® it’s enfleurage which is reworked. We use the solvent power of oils to extract the olfactory fingerprint of plants. We work with a perfumer to refine our compositions. The great advantage of our technique is to only extract heart notes and base notes, the heaviest molecules, and to not have the often allergenic volatile terpenes. These are therefore fragrance extracts with a low content in allergens, very suitable for the bio market and hypoallergenic ranges. The Oléo’Sense® are compounds from waxes, butters and perfume plants, they are sensory and active ingredients. We do not intend to replace a fragrance but to provide to skin care products for sensitive and hypoallergenic skins the fragrant note which was up to now difficult to achieve. We can claim zero perfume and zero allergen. Premium Beauty News - Do you have other projects? Anne Rossignol-Castera - To remain innovative, you must constantly renew yourself and keep a broad open mind. So, of course, we have other projects! Right now, we are working on another extraction technique and on the development of nutritional Oléoactifs®. We were laureates of the Oséo contest for the development of this project which provides us a help for the next two years for the funding of our R&D activities. In parallel, we are building a 500 sqm site as part of a beautiful activity park project hosting ""green"" companies, scheduled in 2014. Otherwise, in the short term, our objective is to develop the Oléoactifs® abroad and introduce the Oléo’Sense® in the perfume and organic world."
Preservatives: Methylisothiazolinone blamed for its allergenic effects,"The news about an upsurge in cases of allergies due to Methylisothiazolinone created a huge buzz in French media in December.  This substance was often presented as a new preservative used in replacement of parabens, which is not really the case. Indeed, this preservative - which is authorized at a maximum concentration of 0.01% in cosmetic products placed on the European market - was not a newcomer and its potential adverse effects have been well documented for many years. The combination of Chloromethylisothiazolinone and Methylisothiazolinone, in proportion 3/1, is well known in the cosmetic industry under the trade name Kathon-CG. Once widely and commonly used, Kathon-CG was gradually abandoned and its use restricted to certain rinsed off products such as shampoos. Kathon-CG has been gradually replaced by parabens, which had the advantage of being much more tolerated. As a consequence, parabens were present in nearly 70% of cosmetic products, until they were questioned recently. However, the use of Methylisothiazolinone rose again in recent years.  Actually, the renewed interest in this substance, often described as less allergenic than Chloromethylisothiazolinone, is directly linked to the disgrace of parabens.  Now, Methylisothiazolinone is one of the most frequently used preservatives in various paraben free toiletries (cleaning wipes, soaps, shampoos), but also in several household and industrial products. According to Professor Annick Barbaud, Head of the Dermatology and Allergology Unit at Nancy’s University Hospital, the information provided by the French vigilance network on dermatologic allergies (Revidal) shows an upsurge in contact dermatitis linked to Methylisothiazolinone. Dr. Barbaud was taking stock of contact dermatitis on the occasion of Paris Dermatological Days, which were attended by over 6,000 people under the aegis of the French Society of Dermatology (SFD) from 10 to 14 December 2012, also reported ""some rare cases of breathing difficulties and irritation of mucous membranes.”  Furthermore, a recent Danish research even shows that non-contact exposure is a growing problem. [1] This upsurge in allergies is not a surprise for experts. Indeed, the frequency of allergies related to preservatives is growing exponentially together with the population exposure, i.e. with the frequency of their use by the industry. It is therefore quite logical that the restored popularity of Methylisothiazolinone be followed by an increase in allergies related to this substance. Does that mean that replacing parabens by safe alternatives is impossible? The French drug regulatory agency (National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products - ANSM) in an information notice, published in May 2011, said it was currently unlikely that “chemical alternatives offering a better safety profile and preservation efficacy equalling those of parabens could be offered. By definition, all preservatives are biologically active. Accordingly, any preservative can potentially lead to safety problems.” In order to reduce the exposure to preservatives, including parabens, a decrease in the concentration of preservatives is not always possible because the anti-bacterial protection might become insufficient. In both in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic sectors, manufacturers are now encouraged to focus on physical methods, including through new packaging solutions. The development of single-dose and so-called airless packaging directly addresses this need."
New konjac-based dermal filler active to correct wrinkles,"BASF´s Beauty Creations - the cosmetic active ingredient business of BASF, resulting from the merger of BASF Beauty Care Solutions and Laboratoires Sérobiologiques that followed the purchase of Cognis - has developed Ultra Filling Spheres, a new version of Filling Spheres, its previous wrinkle filling concept. “Wrinkle formation is one of the today’s consumer major concerns as wrinkles and fine lines represent the most visible sign of aging. Among the several wrinkle corrective treatments which are available today, dermal fillers are still among the most popular,” explains the company in a release. The Ultra Filling Spheres [1] are composed of two biopolymers: hyaluronic acid of low molecular weight (<40 kDa) and konjac, a polysaccharide of high molecular weight (> 200 kDa) with high hygroscopic properties.  The underlying system is based on the ability of cross-linked and dehydrated spheres to penetrate the upper layers of the epidermis and to absorb the water that evaporates from the deep dermis. “Cross-linking of both components forms small spheres which after drying, are transformed into Ultra Filling Spheres. Thanks to their high hygroscopic properties, the volume of the spheres increases rapidly in the presence of the skin’s water reserve, and work as plumping the skin from inside out which may result in smoothing out the wrinkles and fine lines at the surface of the skin,” says BASF Beauty Creations. In presence of water, the Ultra Filling Spheres exhibited a higher capability to swell than previous generation Filling Spheres, thanks to the properties of Konjac. According to BASF Beauty Creations, ex vivo tests have demonstrated increased performances in comparison with the former generation: “their water absorption capability is superior respectively 24 times in weight and 17 times in volume; in addition they were shown to exhibit a water retention capability 20% higher (in tubo gravimetric determination) as well as an enhanced thickness of the stratum corneum by 17 % (ex vivo measurement), both again in comparison with previous generation Filling Spheres.” BASF recommends predispersing the spheres in the oily phase before creating the emulsion and to use them at a concentration of 0.5-3.0% in formulations. They should not be used in aqueous gel or emulsions in oily phase at less than 20%."
In-Cosmetics Asia opens its doors in a booming market,"Opening its doors from Tuesday 6 to Thursday 8 November 2012 at the Bangkok International Trade & Exhibition Centre (BITEC), this edition of In-Cosmetics Asia should confirm the growing importance of the Asian cosmetics market which, according to Euromonitor, may reach the same share of the global market as Western Europe. With more than 300 exhibitors and more than 5,000 visitors expected, this edition is expected to be the biggest in the show’s five-year history. ""In-Cosmetics Asia is the must-attend event for anyone involved in the personal care industry in Asia and we’re looking forward to opening the doors to encourage innovation, education and the sharing of knowledge across the region,” said Sarah Gibson, Exhibition Director.

This year’s winners will be announced on Wednesday, November 7 from 18.30."
CPKelco launches two grades of y-polyglutamic acid with broadened functionalities,"The Aquamax™ range from CPKelco is the result of a collaboration with the South Korean company, BioLeaders Corporation, headquartered in Daejon. It comprises two grades: Aquamax™ HM with a high molecular weight (> 2000 kDa) and Aquamax™ LM with a molecular weight lower than 1kDa. Both feature very interesting properties. Research has shown the high efficiency of Aquamax™ on skin hydration. Due to its molecular structure, Aquamax™ HM captures and retains water 2,5 to 4 times more than hyaluronic acid, leaving a silky and soft film on the surface of the skin. The transepidermal water loss (TEWL) is reduced, the skin’s hydration rate is increased, the natural moisturising factors (NMF) are boosted. According to CPKelco, compared to hyaluronic acid at 2000kDa, to a collagen at 300kDa or to a γ-polyglutamic acid from the market at 1000kDa, as part of an assessment, the performances of Aquamax™ HM at the hydration level are higher in the short and long term. But that’s not all, since the studies conducted by CPKelco have shown that its Aquamax™ γ-polyglutamic acid-acts on the functionalities of hyaluronic acid by potentially inhibiting hyaluronidase, these enzymes that degrade hyaluronic acid. Thus, dosed at 0.004%, Aquamax™ stabilized at 92%hyaluronic acid. The AquaMAX™ LM grade due to its low molecular weight is best suited and a patent on this topic is pending. For sensitive skins, Aquamax™ LM reduces the expression of IL-1alpha, of MMP-1 and partly restores the loss of type I collagen generated by UVB exposure. While for its part, Aquamax™ HM has a calming effect on damaged skin by lowering the levels of IgE and of IL-4. Offering a soft and silky skin feel, these two materials come in the form of dispersible powders in a glycolic or alcoholic medium."
BYK-Gardner: measuring the material effects,"For several years, the dynamism of the market of colour cosmetics is accompanied by a mushrooming of material effects, glitters and pearls, for example, are increasingly part of the products’ composition. Nail polishes, lipsticks, foundations, and to a lesser extent, mascaras often contain these multi-faceted particles. Even the skincare market is concerned, since some of these pigments can also be found in creams and serums. Valued for their aesthetic properties, these particles however raise some practical issues. Indeed, their multiple reflection, their particle size, the variety of possible orientations make the control of the good reproducibility of formulas in an industrial process sometimes difficult. BYK-Gardner GmbH, a company of the Division BYK Additives & Instruments from the German Group, ALTANA, specialized in the manufacture, production and after-sales service of equipments for the measurement, control and quality assurance of coloured materials actually took a special interest in effect products developed in cosmetics. ""Since its inception in 1962, BYK-Gardner has a strong presence in the automotive field where we are the leader for measuring brightness, haze and transparency. Cosmetics accounts for, according to countries between 10 and 20% of our turnover and represents a very complementary field to our core expertise. We have worked with the biggest names in beauty to come up with new solutions to help control effects products, based on our expertise and on the very specific demands of this industry. Apply and observe a product in a repeatable manner is essential, but with no suitable equipment, this goal is difficult to achieve. Unlike the automotive industry where it is easy to spread paint, cosmetics require different protocols for each product. The constraints of a lipstick are different from those of a nail polish but also of a foundation"" confirms Piéric Perret, Regional Sales Manager, BYK-Gardner France. BYK-Gardner offers its customers specific application methods. They are to be used with their new multi-angle spectrophotometer, the BYK-mac that measures the colour hue, the scintillation effects as well and textures. ""It is a highly efficient equipment, the only one that gives information on the Sparkle effect. It also makes it possible to create a electronic standard corresponding to a digital fingerprint of the reference thus avoiding its use and physical conservation. This feature is very popular with our customers in particular those with multiple manufacturing sites,"" emphasised Perret. Nail polishes, which are products very similar to paint are applied onto a contrast card or on false nails following a defined thickness. The contrast card displays a white side and a black side and it give information on the product’s coverage ability. For the application of lipstick, an automatic applicator is used to spread a film of a defined thickness with a very good repeatability. To meet the different product viscosities, several tools exist The fact that it is a non-contact measurement, enables to be the closest as possible to the application of the product observed on the lips. For the bulk appearance, a spoon of the kind that is used for children syrups was developed. According to Perret, ""these new methods simplify the control of lipsticks, their implementation required significant R & D studies both in-house and with our industrial partners."" Powders, foundations, emulsions, mascaras also have specific non contact measurement supports. This encompasses many formulas even if some customers dream of going even further by measuring for example the colour of a lipstick directly on the raisin. ""All these methods enable to offer repeatable, fast and reliable measurements whatever the operator. We are continuing our researchwork  on this subject to further facilitate the work of our customers,"" concluded Perret. BYK-Gardner also offers solutions for the measurement of haze (blur) and transparency with the haze-gard plus. Two very important data material to determine the soft focus effect of a material. With these methods within reach, controlling colours and effects will almost become a breeze."
Formulation of sunscreens: the right balance,"While the formulation of sunscreen products was at the heart of In-Cosmetics latest edition, an expert on this subject that we met, was explaining that in his opinion, ""the formulation of solar products was first a question of knowing how to take into account the various regulations."" As a matter of fact, given the challenge they represent in terms of public health, the regulatory framework for these products has been considerably reinforced. The content of the European recommendations of 22 September 2006 concerning the protection against UVAs, to which can be added the uncertain status of nanomaterials and the different geographical specificities, make the task of formulators particularly difficult. Things get even further complicated because of a still partial harmonization of in vitro evaluation methods. ""Within the European Committee for Standardization, a group is working on the creation, the updating and the harmonization of analytical methods for cosmetics, including sunscreens. The work of the ISO group on cosmetics comes in support. Concerning solar products, results may differ depending on the used protocols. That is why the creation of harmonized international and European standards will ease the work of formulators upstream. The Commission has already given a positive opinion for an in vitro measuring method of SPFs based on transmittance, at the level of their waterproof efficiency discussions are underway,"" summarizes Laurence Mulon, Consultant in strategy development and regulatory affairs. Another relatively recent constraint this one, is the requirement for each product to be efficient against both ultraviolet B rays (UVBs) and ultraviolet A rays (UVAs). During prolonged exposure, UVBs are the cause for sunburns while UVAs by penetrating deeper cause accelerated aging and may contribute to the development of cancers. Europe, via Cosmetics Europe, the organization representing manufacturers, the United States but also Asia, thus demands broad spectrum products. In Europe and in the United States, the requirement focuses on a UVA and UVB ratio equal to 1/3 with a critical wavelength of 370nm. A difficult balance to achieve when looking for high SPFs. It is to overcome this difficulty that Croda launched in 2010 the Solaveil SpeXtra™ range obtained from an exclusive and patented manufacturing process. The TiO2 used enables to have a efficiency on the entire UVA and UVB spectrum. These dispersions help, with no additional chemical filters or ZnO, to obtain high SPFs while respecting the 1/3UVA/UVB ratio. In 2011, the range expanded, with Solaveil XT40W, a dispersion in an aqueous phase thus leaving greater flexibility for the choice of the oily phase and possibly for the addition of chemical filters for very high SPFs. ""With Solaveil XT-40W, formulators can create high SPF natural sunscreens, complying with internationally approved EU recommendations, and with excellent sensory properties,"" emphasised Julie Saintecatherine, Technical and Marketing Coordinator at Croda. This range obtained the award for the best technology at the Cosmetics & Toiletries R&D Awards. For its part, the Zschimmer & Schwarz Group offers, under the name HelioPro, a wide variety of titanium dispersions also compliant with regulatory requirements. The HelioPro BSP 50L grade is very appropriate for the  formulation of high SPFs with no organic molecules. As for Kobo, it offers UV Balanced Powder 100, an optimized titanium mixture of different sizes for the 1/3 ratio substantiation. In addition to broad protection requirements, the particle sizes offered by suppliers are broadening as a result of the uncertainty on the regulatory future of nanomaterials. Starting 1 January 2013, the European Regulation [1] will make it an obligation to mention on the list of ingredients those whose size is nanometric with the [nano] indication. The Commission’s Recommendation of 18 October 2011 clarifies the definition of nanomaterials as ""a nanomaterial is a natural material which contains particles in an aggregate or agglomerate state, and where, for 50% or more of the particles in the number size distribution, one or more external dimensions is in the size range 1 nm - 100nm"" [2] It is in this context that Kobo offers its Non-nano titanium and zinc range, whose name is unambiguous, with particle sizes higher than 100 nm available as powders or dispersions. At the In Cosmetics 2012 show, Kobo also showcased the ACT-50 composite, an innovative matrix of acrylates containing small size particles of titanium or zinc with a good efficiency, with no bleaching effect and preventing the re-agglomeration of particles and with a soft touch. But sun protection does not stop at UVAs or UVBs and some materials go even further. This is the case with Dermoprotectyl from Rovi, which offers a dual protection thanks to a multiple encapsulation system. This product consists of a mixture of chemical filters combined to a cocktail of vitamins C and E. The technology used enables to maintain filters at the surface of the skin while vitamins penetrate deep in the epidermis thus providing a second line of defence. Tayca, which is distributed in France by Unipex, positions itself with the MP100 a protection against infrared radiation (IR), these radiations that constitute most (55%) of solar radiation. It is interesting to note that Lancaster has incorporated into its new Sun Beauty line, a protection against IRs. Suppliers of active ingredients have also added to the array of possibilities newly developed molecules capable of fighting or repairing induced photoaging. Cosmetochem for example presented in Barcelona, Sereniks a natural extract of Tsuga Canadensis with anti inflammatory, antioxidant, properties and of protection against photoaging. Exsymol with OTZ10 offers a protection against UV and IR induced cell and skin damage.  Its optimized bioavailability preserves the quality of skin layers. IRB with Buddleja Davidii Stems G, available in a titrated version in verbascoside is recommended to protect skin against UVAs with its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and photoprotective properties. DSM broadens the concept of sun protection by working on the effects of exposure to sub-erythemal doses, i.e., UV doses lower than those leading to sunburn. ""At lower UV radiation doses, we are already able to highlight significant damage at the DNA, Langerhans cells level involved in the immune system, in collagen and elastin,"" emphasised Caroline Ploton, Regional Technical Marketing Manager. DSM recommends the use of Parsol SLX, a polymeric liquid filter that acts synergistically with Parsol HS, a water-soluble filter to reach high SPFs with a light and non greasy texture. PArsol 1789, a universal standard and the most efficient UVA filter, will be added as a complement to UVB filters. Another important challenge for formulators, although few brands communicate on this subject: products photostability. This ability of the product to keep its efficiency after sustaining a dose of light irradiation, is however very important. A photostable filter re-emits the absorbed energy without being degraded while a photounstable filter under a luminous radiation will fragment into free radicals, change conformation or join other molecules present in the formulation and lose in the process, its UV absorption potential. Several solutions can help such phenomena from occurring. HallStar, distributed in France by Arnaud-Azelis, is very active in this field. The American company proposes Solastay S1, a molecule of ethylhexyl methoxycrylene, known as an excited singlet-state quencher, that is to say, it can recover the energy absorbed by the chromophores of the UV filter before the latter destabilizes leading it to an excited triplet state or to a change in its structure into free radicals. This activity focusing on the singlet state level is innovative and enables to photostabilize sensitive filters like avobenzone, octyl methocycinnamate (OMC). The photostability potential is greatly increased: 3% of Solastay S1 enables a photostabilization of avobenzone in UVAs of 90% and of 98% in UVBs. For the avobenzone/OMC mixture, the photostabilization potential is of 80% in UVAs and of 84% in UVBs. This year, HallStar marketed Polycrylène S1 which adds water resistance capabilities to photostabilization. The obligation to provide information in connection with the photostability of sunscreens has not yet become a topical issue, but who knows what the future holds! Meanwhile, to help the general public be aware of the techniques and of the importance of sun protection, Croda has made available to consumers an educational website: www.solaveil.com. The website provides simple and clear information on the science of solar products. It has just been translated into French this year. No more excuses then for not understanding what are SPFs, UVAs, UVBs and other technical terms..."
Anti-aging: Laboratories target glycation,"Glycation is still drawing a lot of attention because the phenomenon observed on the skin is one of the reasons for skin aging. And staying young, we all know is a quest that seems eternal. The Laboratoires Jeanne Piaubert were among the first to have made an anti glycation claim, with in1996 the launch of the Certitude range. Since then, many players in cosmetics have invested this niche: Chanel, Clarins, Pola, La Roche-Posay and many more. And more are coming... ""It’s a theme that reappears in a periodic manner every 3-4 years and on which we are constantly working to offer our customers the latest advances on this issue"" agrees  Anne Laurie Rodrigues, Communication Manager for BASF Beauty Care Solutions, who has just put on the market the new active Collguard. For Jean-Claude Le Joliff, consultant and founder of the consulting and market-intelligence firm, INN2C, ""the advance and constant renewal of tests of objectivation on glycation are the drivers of its renewal."" Chemically speaking, glycation is the reaction of a sugar, glucose on the amine groups of amino acids constituting proteins. The result is the formation of compounds that lead to by-products named AGEs (Advanced Glycation End products). This reaction is non-enzymatic that is to say, it occurs spontaneously [1]. At the skin level, sugar-based molecules are found in the dermis where are also located collagen and elastin, two proteins that together form the ideal reagents for glycation. Furthermore, glucose in contact with metal ions and oxygen will form aldehydes who also will lead to the formation of AGEs. As a result of these two actions, glycation and oxidation, several types of AGEs are formed.  Some, like pentosidine contribute to tissue stiffness by bridging the span between collagen fibres, others are toxins, like glycotoxines, that disrupt the metabolic activity of cells promoting the inflammatory processes, cell death but also an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the famous free radicals [2]. The result is an aging of the skin with the appearance of wrinkles, age spots and a loss in skin elasticity. Several approaches are proposed by active ingredient suppliers to combat these signs and recently some novelties have emerged. The solution proposed by Exsymol with the range of Silanols (Algisium C®, Argisil C®, Silysin C4®) consists in adding some molecules that will react on protein sites more quickly than glucose. Products that in addition, do not form covalent bonds with proteins and offer a very good bioavailability. Ichimaru Pharcos distributed by Laserson proposes Absorbage, an extract of Plantago asiatica rich in alcanoïdes and Marronnier Liquid b, an extract of Aesculus hippocastanum, which also enters into competition with glucose to limit the glycation reaction. Indena is present in this field with Centevita™ derived from the triterpene rich Centella asiatica. In a different way and to avoid the formation of toxic aldehydes, Lipotec with Dglyage™, a tetrapeptide conveyed in liposomes, targets metal ions by trapping them and thus making them unavailable for the oxidative reaction of glucose. Studies also show a protection of cells DNA. Mibelle with Ameliox a compound of carnosine, silymarin and natural vitamin E inhibits the formation of malondialdehyde thus reducing the glycation process. Another strategy developed by active ingredient suppliers is to focus on proteins and in particular collagen that stiffens after glycation leading to the loss of skin elasticity and the appearance of wrinkles. Silab with Antiglyskin®, an active derived from sunflower seeds, rich in phenolic acids and glucopeptides limits the bridging responsible for the stiffening of collagen fibres while also having an anti glycooxydation effect. Lipotec with Vilastène™, protects the lysine fragments of collagen and therefore limits the glycation reaction. BASF with Collguard™, an extract of Davilla Rugosa, a plant found in the Chinese pharmacopoeia preserves collagen through its anti-glycation, anti-radical and anti collagenase properties but also by supporting the synthesis of functional collagen. While, Greentech with Setiline®, an active derived from fenugreek using biotechnology preserves the skin structures by modifying the expression of specific genes involved in glycation phenomena. In parallel the active reduces the keratinocyte differentiation in the epidermis and thus improves the skin barriers. For the approach of glycation to be total, some suppliers have complemented the offer by proposing for Exsymol an active, Alistin® that acts as a protector of glucose and proteins but goes also further in the concept by ""de-glycating"" molecules helping them to regain their original form. The mechanism is based on a transglycation reaction from glycosylamine, which is the first step in AGEs. This year Exsymol has launched the paraben-free Alistin® P5 and completed its tests of objectivation by demonstrating that the active could also act as a detoxifier of glycotoxines. Ichimaru Pharcos, is also focusing on ""de-glycation"" with Shakuyaku, an extract from a Chinese plant, Paeonia Albiflora. Sederma with Prodizia™ addresses protein structures damaged by glycation. The active an extract of Albizia or silk tree, supports the cells detoxification systems at the proteasome and glyoxalase level. Since the first objectivation tests conducted on cell cultures, models have evolved with the addition of additional parameters and the possibility of performing them on skin explants. BIO-EC in partnership with MMP published in 2011 a study on this topic highlighting, on skin explants, the anti glycation activity of substances of plant origin, among which the raw materials offered by the company MMP, with Puerarin 80MM, an extract of Pueraria iobata titrated to 80% of Puérarine and Eucommia Ulmoides leaf extract 80MM, an extract of Eucommia titrated to 80% in chlorogenic acid [3]. ""The advantage of the model based on skin explants is to reproduce the skin reactions, we are the closest as possible to an in vivo situation"" emphasises Elian Lati, President of BIO-EC. Furthermore, this laboratory is pursuing is investigations in this field by studying the glycation of other proteins and not only of collagen or elastin. One may therefore come to the conclusion that the new developments around glycation are far from over..."
SEPPIC translates trends into cosmetic formulas,"SEPPIC wanted to enhance its range of ingredients and formulation expertise to its customers by providing a palette of inspiration and complete.  The French producer of speciality ingredients thus partnered with the Carlin International style agency to identify next season’s trends and transpose them into the cosmetics world. Four major consumer trends were initially analysed by Carlin and SEPPIC: – ""Interlude"" depicts and extends the ""vacation"" effect,
– ""Hibernature"" reflects glacial beauty and extreme cold,
– ""Manufacture"" modernizes the classicsgiving them a second life with a touch that is both vintage and modern,
– ""Heroic"" embodies the heroes of ancient legends and fantastic tales, who dare to brave the unknown. SEPPIC adopted the ""Manufacture"" and ""Heroic"" concepts and translated them for personal care, renaming them ""Apothi’Care"" and ""Fantasy Paradox"". To transpose these concepts into cosmetics formulas, SEPPIC hosted creative workshops to bring together its international teams (Brazil, Japan, India) to create a lookbook of formulas adapted to the specificities of each geographical area thus serving as an international source of inspiration for creating new products. In order to adapt the Apothi’Care trend, which consists of revisiting the best elements of the past and modernizing them, SEPPIC created a customizable universal chassis formulation - which is the fruit of a clever combination of two flagship products from SEPPIC, Sepimax ZEN and Montanov L - and imagined seven example cocktails inspired by beauty traditions from around the world. With just one ingredient base, it is possible to create highly diversified formulas (moisturizers, after-shaves, capillary treatments, etc.). Through its exceptional stability, the chassis enables formulators to design solutions that are easy to scale-up, transpose and reproduce regardless of the active ingredients selected for the formulation.  For instance, the addition of an active ingredient may impact the formula’s viscosity, but not its stability. As far as the ""Fantasy Paradox"" trend is concerned, which is all about products that intrigue and project the consumer into a magical dream world, SEPPIC created three example formulas: Beauty Armor Blush (fluorescent, transparent, or rose hued upon application depending on skin pH), Ritual Primer (Bordeaux elixir, transparent upon application), and Black and Gold shower gel (black shower gel with gold particules). ""Through our new marketing approach of anticipating trends and our related formulas, we hope to assist formulators and marketers in their creative process and to be a veritable source of inspiration to them,"" explains Corinne Stolz, Marketing Director. Actually, with this in depth work, SEPPIC is addressing a demand from the market that is emerging with an increasing strength: the need for advanced consultations.  While they are urged to multiply new developments, brands are increasingly in demand from advices from ingredients suppliers."
Impact Colors: staying ahead of the competition!,"Premium Beauty News - Impact Colors, is first and foremost a team!  H. Douglas Thornley -  You are right! It was to start with a highly motivated team and who had at that time no other choice but to embark on the adventure of starting a new business. We were not that young but could rely on a wealth of solid experience. Our network too. We decided that our mission would be to provide pigments and high quality ingredients to the skincare and cosmetic market worldwide. From the outset, the challenge was for us to propose technically advanced products that would have maximum impact on our customer base and the consumer market. Of course, we also wanted to focus on offering eco-friendly products and services with the use of ethical practices with regards to our customers, suppliers, staff, and, In general, to all of our professional community. But we also had to establish strong partnerships worldwide to secure a reliable distribution, have sufficient stocks so that shipments could be performed quickly. Premium Beauty News - Four years later, you have succeeded! But you have gone one step further in your business approach of the market. You understood that it was also necessary to anticipate the needs of your customers and become an expert of its own in future market trends!  H. Douglas Thornley -  This is indeed one of the main original features of Impact Colors. We take trends very seriously. Our business is all about the latest and most original application of color in personal care cosmetics and skin and hair care. The best way for our customers and the industry to imagine the possibilities of our glamorous pigments and eye-catching special effects colors is to see our lines used in adventuresome ways in products for lips, eyes, skin, and nails. Premium Beauty News - You propose every year a real Color trend book! And for 2013, the theme will be ""contradiction""! H. Douglas Thornley - contradiction in the influencers of trends and contradictions in the way color will be used to enhance beauty and individuality. It used to be that trends originated almost exclusively from famous people, entertainers, celebrities, or fashion icons. While these are still very strong influences, today’s fashionable trends also originate with individuals on the street and work their way up to the runways and stage. In our presentation, we cite the example of a clever black and white jacket worn by Rianna in her video What’s My Name.  The jacket has the distinct boldness we would expect from a Prada piece, yet it is from the mass retailer H&M. Similarly, the classic colors are being applied in contradictory ways. Take red and black—the mainstays of lips and eyes. Five years ago, we were predicting that black would become a new standard for nails. It was hard to believe then, but here we are. Now we are anticipating seeing red shadow and liner for the eyes, and a move away from black to very dark blue, as that older standard emerges again.  Color Trends 2013 delivers a comprehensive picture of the future color landscape through photography, voice, and video and then suggests how a portfolio of twenty-five of Impact Colors’ advanced colors and effects can be applied to create cosmetics that express visionary trends.  Color Trends 2013 is designed expressly to serve formulators, product developers, and marketing teams in the personal care industry by identifying bubbling trends and predicting future directions in fashion and color. It’s fun and exciting to watch future trends unfold, but at the end of the day, the most important thing to our customers is developing new lines and products that their customers like and want. In Color Trends 2013, we offer specific ideas of how our color and special effects products can be combined to capture the vision of where color in cosmetics and personal care is going next. Color Trends 2013 pops with fresh ideas. Intense small-particle gold from the synthetic mica-based Fiesta Colors line  produce a rich yellow that is wonderful for darker skin. A larger particle violet with shine and glitter blends into an eye shadow that is fitting for women of all ages, from cool to classical. Muted naturals with lots of white suggest powders in large compacts suitable for cheeks and eyes. The influence of metal shows itself in silver flecks and copper, a rich, warm highlighter. With Color Trends 2013, we bring a vision of the future to our customers’ marketing and formulating teams. We then help them move that vision into reality with specific suggestions from our technically advanced lines of unique specialty color pigments. Premium Beauty News - And for 2014? H. Douglas Thornley - We are working on it. This will be the subject of a forthcoming interview."
Multifunctionality and genocosmetics emerge from the green wave at In-Cosmetics 2012,"The 2012 edition of In-Cosmetics, which was held from 17 to 19 April at Barcelona’s Gran Via Exhibition Centre, recorded a total of 7,152 unique visitors in attendance, a 5% rise compared to the previous year. “As ever, the international contingent was strong, with 70% visitors hailing from outside of Spain,” the organizers announced.  With 590 exhibitors, this edition was also the biggest ever, 10% larger than last year’s record-breaking Milan show. Once again, In-Cosmetics proved to be the industry’s annual launch pad for new personal care ingredients. This commitment to creativity was echoed at the Innovation Zone Best Ingredient Award, which saw Lucas Meyer Cosmetics scoop Gold for its new ingredients Progeline and Adipofill. This year again, green products were highlighted, with a host of new botanical alternatives to traditional synthetic substances, or through the use of green chemistry methods or supercritical carbon dioxide extractions. At Akzo-Nobel, for instance, the emphasis was put on the patented Zeta Fraction technology, a unique process developed by IBT, and recently acquired by the chemicals giant, that makes it possible to harvest and separate constituent parts of a living cell from any plant or marine source without requiring any solvents.  “The technology allows for the isolation of intracellular components in a manner that is reproducible, sustainable,” said the company. Symrise in turn chose to highlight the efforts to offer the purest active ingredients possible. ""When there is no technical problem, we eliminate solvents and avoid diluting our products, it is a move towards more sustainability, allowing to decrease the transportation footprint by lowering the effective dose of the active,” said Marielle Le Maire, Global Product Director, Life Essentials. However, the more common and mainstream naturalness and eco-friendly become the less differentiating they are.  ""Green remains an underlying trend, but what we are increasingly asked is a more holistic offer, in particular with commitments for traceability or ethics. We guarantee that our products are from European and not from Asian origin,"" we were said at Quimica Masso, a leading Spanish distributor of specialty chemicals. There are plentiful and sometimes unexpected consequences. For instance, alternatives to palm oil become increasingly popular. Furthermore, techniques to obtain botanical actives without massively cropping plants, are growing rapidly, especially via the stem cell cultures. In the wake of the green trend, but also as an effort to reduce costs, formulators strive to simplify their products and reduce the number of ingredients. The supply-side response apparently consists in offering a growing number of multifunctional ingredients. For example, Alban Muller International, has launched a natural salicylic acid, extracted from wintergreen through distillation followed by hydrolysis in order to obtain a pure molecule. The particularity of this innovation: it comes out in two ingredients.  On the one hand, Amipreserve, a completely natural, ecofriendly cosmetic preservative, “the only on the market to be fully regulatory compliant”.  On the other hand, Amiperfect, a cosmetic active dedicated to achieving a perfect, radiant complexion, thanks to its keratolytic, anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory action. In-Cosmeticsdedicated an entire education session to cosmetogenomics, thus echoing numerous launches by exhibitors, such as Evonik with Tego Arjuna and Laboratoires Expanscience with Effipulp, among many others. The next In-Cosmetics event takes place in Paris, Hall 1, Paris Porte de Versailles, on 16-18 April 2013."
Stressful cosmetics that do you good,"""That which does not kill us makes us stronger. "" This reflection from Nietzsche could almost be applied to the hormesis concept. The term was first introduced in 1943 [1] to describe a dynamic property of the living ""high concentrations of toxic substances inhibit whereas low concentrations stimulate."" Everything is a question of dosage and regularity. It is important to know the limit beyond which stress whether physical, biological or chemical applied to a body no longer exerts a stimulating effect but a deleterious one. In practice and in everyday life, where the phenomenon of hormesis is evident is during physical activities	 [2]. As part of a regular and moderate practice of sport, substances produced by the body (free radicals, acids, aldehydes) will generate beneficial reactions, while these same substances can be harmful in high concentrations. This principle can also be found in calorie restriction or with the application of low ionizing radiations. It has been demonstrated 	 [3] that the frequencies of chromosome breaks induced by waves were lower when cells were treated before with very low doses and even more so when a few hours separated the two irradiations. The regular repetition of low stresses allows the cell or even the whole organism to better resist a stronger stimulation. In the field of cellular aging, Prof. Suresh Rattan [4] is one of the pioneers in the development and use of the hormesis concept. He highlighted the hormétines, a class of natural and synthetic compounds that ensure a slowdown in the ageing process. Studies (5) were conducted on cell cultures to measure the impact of micro stresses regularly applied like as a temperature of 41°C during 1 hour two times a week or 50µM of rosmarinic acid or 0.25µM of curcumin. Responses show a strengthening of cell functions and a global anti-aging effect. All the explanatory mechanisms are not elucidated yet, but these micro solicitations could, result in the increased expression of some repair enzymes, enable the production of resistance proteins such as the HSPs, stimulate the proteasome activity, improve the sodium/potassium pump rate, and play a role in the expression of certain genes related to aging. It is on the basis of the work of Suresh Rattan that Givenchy launched in 2010 VAX’IN for youth, the first cosmetic product enriched with a complex of active ingredients made from Sanchi and hypotaurine, two hormétines which are likely to reproduce the hormesis phenomenon. By generating micro stimuli, skin cells produce in doses in proportion to their need, their own resistance protein to aging, the HSP70. In vitro tests show a 24% increase in its synthesis. Cells defence and repair mechanisms are reinforced, the skin resistance to the signs of aging is increased. An instrumental test performed on several women whose skin was subjected to aggressive washes showed a 30% improvement of the skin protection. This year, Givenchy has made another addition to the range VAX’IN for youth with a version specifically dedicated to the sensitive area around the eye. On the ingredient marketplace, it is Sederma who paved the way for a broader use of hormesis in cosmetics, with Resistem™, an anti-aging active derived from plant cell cultures. This year, Silab followed suit with Vitagenyl® These compounds reproduce the hormesis phenomenon leading to an increase in the cells defence capabilities. Resistem™ helps in particular fight against noci-products. Tested in vitro on keratinocytes stressed with hydrogen peroxide, a strong inhibition of intracellular peroxides was observed (-88% compared to control). The proteasome activity on the hydrogen peroxide stressed fibroblasts is also stimulated (+57% compared to control). Moreover, cellular longevity is increased with a 74% increase of the sirtuin-1 synthesis and tissue regeneration is boosted. It is the ""bodyguard"" of the skin, helping, through a virtuous circle to regain its natural beauty. ""To develop this product, we inspired ourselves with the work of Prof. Rattan who published a hormetic response profile corresponding to several characteristics of cellular survival and repair, Resistem™ demonstrates very good results on all criteria,"" confirmed Olga Gracioso in charge of marketing and communication for Sederma. For its part, Vitageny®, with a rich content in purified alpha-glucans obtained from peach leaves, stimulates the expression of Vitagènes involved in cellular homeostasis and coding such stress resistant proteins as the HSPs, the thorédoxine and sirtuin-1. Tested in-vitro at 1%, Vitagenyl® stimulates the viability of fibroblasts in nutrient deficient medium and their proliferative capacity. Vitagenyl® through its hormetic action helps cells be better prepared and equipped to combat against external aggressions. Vitagenyl® improves the regenerating potential and vitality of the skin. Both active are positioned as anti-aging and offer, in the wake of VAX’IN for youth, promising prospects for the use of the hormesis concept in cosmetics."
Increased consumer awareness impacts cosmetic actives development,"Savvy consumers influence savvy formulators.  That is the conclusion of a recent report, titled “Activism: Does the Consumer Drive Actives Development?” by market research firm Kline & Company. According to Kline, consumers are becoming more informed and engaged and are raising expectations regarding personal care products.  They “invest in themselves” and are ready to pay more, provided products offer specific benefits and visible results. “Savvy personal care formulators understand this and are marketing their products by emphasizing their active ingredients to informed consumers,” explains Nikola Matic, the author of the report.  “Label reading is no longer the exception and, coupled with easy access to information, consumers are making more educated choices. Clever marketing can certainly draw consumer’s attention, but ultimately a product has to deliver,” he adds. “With a growing number of personal care products stressing the inclusion of active ingredients in their formulations, consumers are learning to differentiate between various actives and in turn seek higher-end solutions,” writes Matic. As a consequence, no longer are specialty actives the preserve of women’s prestige skin-care applications, their usage is growing in lower-end products. Increased awareness of the efficacy of actives among consumers also afforded specialty actives marketers excellent opportunities to diversify.  Actives can now be found in products as diverse as hair-care, male grooming products, slimming, sun-protection and active make-up systems. According to Kline, hair care is the second largest market for actives, after anti-aging products with sales accounting for 15.7% of the US market and 9.1% of the European market. Not all ingredients benefit from the raise in consumer awareness. As a result of possible health hazards exposed in the media, some personal care ingredients have become undesirable. Examples include otherwise commonly used additives such as silicones or parabens. Conversely, positively endorsed ingredients such as vitamins, collagen, co-enzyme Q10 and, more recently, hyaluronic acid, are well perceived by consumers and marketers avail themselves of this fact by emphasizing these ingredients in their product communications. Green actives are those that have gained the greater advantage from the consumer Zeitgeist.  Actually, the green trend has been driving the active ingredients market for over a decade.  “Specialty actives suppliers have accommodated this growth by developing natural sourced actives, and eco-certifying some of their products for the needs of fully natural brands. This has also resulted in the rapid growth of the botanical actives segment with an estimated CAGR of 4% expected in the United States by 2015, and 5% in Europe during the same period.” However, plant-based ingredients also are impacted by the consumer’s quest for efficacy, and formulators are increasingly seeking to use botanicals as substantiated functional ingredients. This trend also benefits to natural-sourced biotechnology products. In maturing markets such as Western Europe and the United States, the combination of specialty actives and naturals thus appear as the ultimate growth driver."
"Which airless for which formula? Paris, 26 January 2012","If one refers to the definition given by a group of manufacturers, an airless is “a device that will perfectly dispense a liquid, cream, or paste product from a rigid bottle avoiding any possible contamination from an external source (direct contact with fingers, air, etc.).” Obviously, this technology is very interesting for protecting the sensitive actives of botanical formulations or for limiting the risks of contamination in the case of formulations with few or no preservatives.  Its other main asset is to enable an optimum use of the product. Two main models of airless dispenser currently exist on the market; those with pistons or pouches.  However, the interest of developers and consumers for these systems stimulates innovation.  Suppliers have made important research and development efforts to reduce the cost of these packaging as well as their environmental impact.  Others have worked at adapting the codes and materials of the luxury sector. Today, airless dispensers can even be found in hotels where they contribute to address cost containment and environmental impact issues, while protecting product formulations from contamination. However, the success of the packaging may mask real implementation problems: technical difficulties when it comes to ensuring truly sterile formulas, marketing difficulties when it comes to combining environmental concerns with dreams and desires of consumers, practical difficulties when the introduction of regulations such as REACH or consumer concerns make it necessary to replace certain substances. For an update on current issues of airless packaging and in order to explore the opportunities for future developments, Premium Beauty News will gather some of the best experts in this matter, on January 26 in Paris. Innovation, marketing and regulatory issues will be put in perspective and in discussions. Click on the image here below to download the list of speakers and the full programme of the conference:"
Managing the container/content interactions in cosmetics,"Premium Beauty News - Why are container/content interactions so important in cosmetics today? It is not something which has been discovered yesterday! Benoît Persin -  Quite true, these phenomena have been widely studied in various sectors such as the food industry (where it is referred to as food contact) and the pharmaceutical industry. As I explained at the breakfast organized last September by the BeautyFull Club, the new EC Cosmetics Regulation 1223/2009 has introduced new concepts in this regard. [1] These interaction phenomena between the packaging material and the formula, can manifest themselves in different ways (Figure 1) either during the manufacturing, conditioning process, or during storage. They may have several consequences, visual or not, even under normal conditions of use: organoleptic modification of the formula or of the primary packaging, chemical modification of the formulation, etc. Modifications in connection with container/content interactions therefore potentially have an impact on the quality, efficacy and safety of a cosmetic product. The characterization of the packaging (including its stability and impurities and traces technically unavoidable) and the assessment of the potential interactions are key parameters to demonstrate that the packaging used is safe and does not interfere negatively on the formula. It is precisely in this context that the Regulation 1223/2009 asks to take into account this information! Premium Beauty News - How can this assessment be undertaken? Are there any official standards available? Benoît Persin - No, currently standards or study protocols are not (yet) available for the cosmetic sector. In fact the entire difficulty stands here in view of both increasingly complex and innovative cosmetic formulas and in attractive and efficient packaging articles. It is a real challenge for manufacturers. But not insurmountable, the critical parameters that come into play in this phenomenon of chemical interactions are well known: the composition of the material, the composition of the formula and its properties, the physico-chemical characteristics of the packaging components, the manufacturing and filling conditions the conditions of use and of storage, etc. Premium Beauty News - What is the consequence of this absence of standards or guidelines in cosmetics? Benoît Persin - The studies on the container/content interactions must be carried out under relevant and specific conditions. The ones Intertek undertakes for the industry are foremost based on a long-term collaboration where information exchanges are essential to perfectly understand the context (components, formula) and to correctly define its perimeter. [2] If the knowledge of the raw materials used for the packaging (origin of the substance, production process, etc..) is not sufficient, a comprehensive analytical testing will help provide a good basis to reach the final goal of assessing the potential toxicological impact of the material on the formula. Technical solutions tailored to the needs of the cosmetic industry can be proposed today to identify the nature of packaging (e.g. recycled copolymer...), its purity, its stability and the presence of possible components such as additives, dyes, plasticizers , solvents, antioxidants, etc.. Once the data is collected, the safety assessor will be able to quantify the potential risk. But again, as in cosmetics, guidelines do not (yet) exist, these interaction studies should be undertaken on a case by case basis."
Silab’s innovation strategy rewarded,"Silab, a supplier of natural ingredients for the cosmetics industry, has just received the innovation award of the INPI (French National Institute of Industrial Property, Institut National de la Propriété́ Industrielle). This is a recognition for Jean Paufique, CEO and founder of Silab, whose watchword is, precisely, ""innovation, innovation, innovation."" The award, which celebrates its 20th anniversary in conjunction with the 60th anniversary of the INPI, aims to highlight SMEs that place innovation at the heart of their strategy for growth and value their R&D through Industrial property. This year, five SMEs and a laboratory were honoured for the exemplarity of their innovation strategy. Along with Silab, and also in the health and beauty sector, Cousin Biotech, a company specializing in medical prosthesis and implants, was also awared, as well as Nuxe, the natural cosmetics brand. Since its inception in 1986, Silab has been focusing on research and now invests 20% of its sales and one third of its workforce in research. The company has a portfolio of 163 patents and its research teams market two to three new products per year. The latest of its kind is Menofit, an active that is rich in purified peptides from artichoke leaves. Silab claims an original action regarding aging through a focus on menopausal skin. According to Silab, the Menofit helps compensating cells deficiencies in the dermis and epidermis, maintaining the thickness of the skin, increasing hydration and reducing wrinkles thus approaching the qualities of premenopausal skin. In vivo and in vitro objectivation tests support these results. With Menofit, Silab offers a new active addressing the problems of mature skins linked to the decline in female hormones.  A product in sync with changing demographics."
AgiLab wants to take advantage of the boom in laboratories computing needs,"Premium Beauty News - AgiLab is a young company operating in a booming sector. Mohamed Ndiaye -  It is true that we are witnessing a real explosion in the needs for IT solutions to serve the activity of cosmetic laboratories, mainly because of the strengthening of the regulatory framework. Many companies started business in the sector, often implementing solutions originally designed for the pharmaceutical industry. This is logical since this sector has long been tightly controlled. But solutions offered are more comparable to labyrinthine systems, not easily adaptable to varying needs. Renaud Acker - And this was precisely our goal when we created in 2009 AgiLab: to propose adaptable and customizable solutions, capable of addressing the specific needs of each company, particularly the needs of SMEs. We have set ourselves a goal to fill a significant gap in the operating mode of laboratories by providing them with an application to support both their business processes and decision-making at a truly affordable cost. It is because of the originality and relevance of the AgiLab project that we were handed the Award ’Paris Innovation’, a business incubator supported by OSEO. Premium Beauty News - And to achieve this you rely both on a computing and scientific expertise. Renaud Acker - Both of us have a dual academic background. In my case, I hold a Graduate Diploma of Information Systems, but my basic training is in biology. I have long worked as a functional expert, then as an independent consultant and, as such, I participated in many projects in lab computerization, specially in the installation of IT solutions in major French and European pharmaceutical companies for biologists, chemists and pharmacists. Mohamed Ndiaye - My basic training is also in biology. I hold a Master of Science in Bioinformatics and of a second Master in management of innovative projects from IAE Montpellier. I was a LIMS project leader (Laboratory Information Management System) for several years. As such, I led several applications Integration projects of LIMS in forensics, in the pharmaceutical industry, fine chemicals and environment. Premium Beauty News - What does your offer consist of for cosmetics? Mohamed Ndiaye -  We have developed two new products, tailored to the needs of companies in the cosmetics industry. First AgiLab Compliance, to manage the regulation pertaining to chemicals which are constituents of cosmetics or of chemical formulas. We will deploy a specific version of this module for the L’Oréal group. But it is also perfectly suited to the needs of SMEs. Then AgiLab Formulation, which helps manage ingredients, the composition of formulas, the formulation processes with the associated documents, with the help of formulation plans and to implement the traceability of ingredients required by the new European Regulation on Cosmetics. These are two complementary modules of AgiLims, our global solution for quality control and R&D laboratories. Our philosophy is to offer a hard core of functionalities that we adapt and customize according to the needs of each company. Renaud Acker - This hard core is relatively simple. Using the set of modules available we can easily meet the needs of both large groups and SMEs, and this in a very cost effective manner. With increasing regulatory constraints, and in particular the implementation of the European Regulation on cosmetics, to which companies must comply by July 2013, the needs of the cosmetic industry are considerable."
Lessonia: strengthening abroad,"Lessonia, the French specialist of ingredients and natural formulas, is strengthening its international presence by opening an office in Hong Kong. ""The purpose is obviously to be able to discuss more easily and directly with clients in the area, China, Hong Kong, Korea, Japan and Thailand,"" explains Christophe Wincler, the CEO of the company. Sébastien Guillotin will be in charge of the Hong Kong office which opened early October. The new branch complements the system already implemented in Mexico City and which is in charge of the entire American market including the United States, Mexico and, of course, Brazil, which is a priority for Lessonia. Also present at the Cosmoprof Asia, which was held in Hong Kong from 9 to 11 November 2011, the company based in Brittany, near Brest, also presented Luminous Rice, its new line, specifically designed for Asian markets. The range comprises 17 products, for the face and the body perfectly in line with the big current trend in Asian markets: the search for a flawless and uniform complexion. Also showcased on the stand of the company: a BB Cream and a range of peel-off masks for the face and the body. ""To facilitate the creation of their ranges, we also offer our customers to use pre-defined protocols, they can then complete according to the desired positioning,"" emphasised Wincler. An approach that has already proven its worth and helped Lessonia conquer significant market share in the spa segment. Finally, Lessonia plans to continue diversifying its offering in the field of natural make-up. ""We have a real legitimacy in this area, with an original and unique offer of natural pigments and quality textures."""
"Simulgreen 18-2, Seppic’s new oil-in-water emulsifier","Well known for its emulsifiers originating from sugar chemistry, Seppic, a subsidiary of the Air Liquide Group, continues to innovate in this area with the launch of Simulgreen 18-2. ""The original fatty alcohol-based structure obtained from castor beans and grafted onto sugar imparts it with both technical and sensory performance,"" emphasises Alicia Roso, Emulsifying Product Agents Manager at Seppic. Effective from 2% in a wide pH range, Simulgreen 18-2 has the ability to emulsify a wide variety of oils including vegetable oils. The formulas obtained are consistent creams with a sophisticated texture without even needing to resort to acrylic type polymers. Upon product application and well after its total penetration the feeling of softness is omnipresent according to the sensory profile set up by a trained panel of volunteers. But in addition Simulgreen 18-2 has more to offer. It is particularly resistant to electrolytes, which is rare enough in the category of natural emulsifiers to be mentioned, and prevents the soaping phenomena every formulator dreads. Last but not the least, its capacity to promote lamellar phases facilitating long-term hydration of the upper layers of the skin. In the end, Simulgreen 18-2, of 100% vegetable origin, which is manufactured without any solvents or dangerous reactives, being biodegradable and preservative free is in perfect harmony with green chemistry principles."
Alpol : strengthening in dermo-cosmetics,"Alpol has recently obtained a conformity certification to ISO 22716 on good manufacturing practices in cosmetics. The French company who is specialized in the development of formulas, the manufacturing and packaging of cosmetics, has also completely renovated its production site, with in particular the creation of airlocks and the installation of an overpressure air filtering system. ""We have raised our standards of production to a level much higher than what is required and usually practiced in cosmetics,"" explains Philippe Faure, Director of Operations. Alpol, which is currently achieving 70% of its turnover in ""aesthetic"" cosmetics and 30% in dermo-cosmetics, also intends to significantly expand its business in this second segment. The objective being to manage to balance evenly the two poles within the group. In parallel to its pink brand, Alpol Cosmétique, the company has also developed a blue brand, Alpol Dermo-Cosmétique, and launched a range of five technical products, with a high concentration in objectified actives. Main asset of the French company in the dermo-cosmetic segment: an expertise in pleasure textures inherent to cosmetics. ""There are a lot of sub-contractors from the pharmacy sector in this market. They most often focus on actives but don’t always offer textures suiting the expectations of brand’s marketing services,"" emphasised Faure. ""Given the strong competition in this market, brands can no longer afford to be weak on either point. Consumers expect products that are safe and efficient but they also want to see formulas with some galenic innovation in them to increase their comfort in use."" A segment that follows very specific patterns, where the inclination for natural things is not as strong as in other cosmetics markets, even if eco-design remains a major concern, and where practices can be sometimes very close the pharmaceutical sector, in particular for the development of medical devices. Alpol, which employs 80 people, posted a turnover of 10.5 million euros in 2011 (fiscal year ending in September), up 21% over the previous year and exports its formulas in ten European countries and to the Middle East. The company who took part to the latest edition of Cosmoprof Asia also wants to continue its development in Asia."
"""The good, the beautiful, the authentic"" according to Yves Rocher","Premium Beauty News - In your speech at the Centifolia congress, you presented the first steps of a collaboration with Native American people - ""Men who care for the forest"" - and a exchange model that could be called a ""win-win"" model"". Despite this very worthy cause, don’t you feel you could get involved ""more locally""? Xavier Ormancey - Yves Rocher has always encouraged local sourcing and especially Breton sourcing. 50 years ago, M. Rocher created in Britain an economy in connection with his business with the setting up of plants, with the organic farming on 55 hectares of more than 20 species of plants (chamomile, arnica, cornflower, matricaria, etc.) generating in the end more than 10,000 jobs in the region. The anchor point of the business is certainly Britain where our ""roots"" definitely are, but we also have ""wings"" that lead us to work in other countries worldwide. In a necessary approach of continuous improvement, Yves Rocher wants to use its plant sectors as levers to participate in biodiversity conservation and local development. We actually want to replicate the development model locally applied on our Breton site in La Gacilly to the other sourcing spots in Mali and Madagascar, for example. Yves Rocher has always been strongly determined in supporting the people and the local economy both in Britain and around the world. Premium Beauty News - The Centifolia congress highlighted the principles of collective intelligence, do you work with these concepts of co-creation? Xavier Ormancey - Within the company, a really close proximity exists since the research, communication and marketing teams are in the same building and share in particular the same coffee machine. In addition to formal interactions, meetings can therefore also occur in other places. Contacts are direct and permanent which also fosters co-creation. It is clear that scientists need to think about women who buy the product and they also must be able to feed marketing teems as a co-creation partner. Jobs must be decompartmentalised. Premium Beauty News - How does the customer realize that in buying a Yves Rocher product she is buying an ""authentic"" product that also makes sense? Xavier Ormancey - The customer is buying performance, efficiency, and pleasure through the sensory aspects of the product. But above all, the ethical dimension has been deeply rooted in the brand’s DNA for 50 years. The Foundation Yves Rocher - Institut de France has existed for 20 years and supports a number of actions. For the brand’s 50th anniversary, as part of the program ""Plantons pour la Planète"" (Let’s Plant for the Planet), the Foundation has committed itself to plant 50 million trees across the world within 5 years. Behind the product the price of which also enables a broad accessibility, there is a sense that each customer can see. And we have 30 million customers worldwide."
"Centifolia 2011 - Beautiful, good and authentic: the perfect product","If you were used to attending congresses organized under a series of lectures punctuated by the usual set of questions and answers, surely this 8th edition of the Centifolia congress organized by the Club des entrepreneurs du Pays de Grasse would have surprised you. 150 delegates gathered for three days at the city’s Convention Centre to build together “the perfect product”. Everything was organized to foster exchanges and co-creation with World Café sessions (or ""Café découverte"") enriched beforehand by the informed testimonials of players operating in the cosmetic industry, but not only. Among speakers, some representatives of the profession like Xavier Ormancey (Yves Rocher), Marie-Laure Simonin Braun (Dessange), Claudie Ravel (Guayapi), Georges Ferrando (Albert Vieille) as well as visionaries like Arnaud Poissonnier (Babyloan), Gildas Bonnel (Si#), gathered around Jean-François Noubel (Collective Intelligence Research Institute), one of the pioneers in collective intelligence and the conductor of this atypical congress. To create the perfect product - and isn’t it everyone’s goal? - integrating notions of beauty, good and authentic, at all stages of creation is the challenge that Centifolia wanted to take up. For Guillaume Flavigny, perfumer at Givaudan, ""the first ingredient to create something beautiful is the love one has for his raw materials."" Beauty adds Ngub Nding President of Ephyla must be made of consistency,  ""it is necessary to bridge the gap between ideas that are thought beautiful and good and the materials used which are often low-end"".  Beauty coming from within, always shines out. As for good, it is the image that is echoed back to us by the product, ""if it does good to everyone"", emphasises Jean-François Noubel (CIRI). Values in connection with sustainable development, fair trade, respect of ecosystems all have their place here. ""Let’s be close to Nature’s knowledge, let’s tap into it without exhausting it"", Claudie Ravel, CEO of Guayapi, strongly believes it is the motto to remember. Authenticity refers to a product that holds no lie, as emphasised Gildas Bonnel, President of the agency Si#. ""The necessity of authenticity is more than ever a topicality, we all have become much listened, followed, and credible media, much more than the discourse of companies."" Authenticity does not mean perfect, but it is just a product that assumes its strengths and weaknesses and who dares claim them in full transparency. ""Imagine the consequences if your brand became fully transparent and authentic"" was actually a theme worked on in a World Café. From ""all truths are not good to say"" to ""a tremendous energy will be released by being authentic"", delegates reflected on this issue and some of them even lifted barriers. Interactivity, co-creation, the awakening of consciousness were at the heart of this 8th edition of Centifolia, a different convention where everyone was there to learn but also to enrich the experience of others, be it colleagues or competitors. ""A beautiful spirit of trust and sharing prevailed during these three days"", according to Xavier Ormancey, R&D director of Yves Rocher and co-organizer of the event. For some participants, a downside however: the absence of decision-makers and marketers, which limits partly the musical setting of the notes selected for this congress. ""Companies, who used to consider the product as the key concern, have transformed in recent years by considering the customer at the key concern and will transform again in the future by focusing mainly on human beings"", concluded a congressman. And for most of the participants, the congress did not end on the evening of October 21st, each participant in his way wanting to lay, as soon as possible in his daily life a few stones in the foundation of beautiful, good and authentic. It is also possible to follow these constructions on the Facebook page of the congress."
Colombia to invest in the cosmetics industry,"The increasing trend in organic and natural ingredients in cosmetics may make of Colombia a key player in this sector. In any case, this is what believes the country’s authorities, which are determined to sustain an industry currently in a structuring phase. The cosmetic and hygiene products industry is indeed one of the twelve sectors targeted by the national development program ""Transformación Productiva"", launched last August by the President of the Colombian Republic, Juan Manuel Santos. The development plan for this sector does not hesitate to look (very) far ahead!   As of 2012, priority will be given to Colombia’s customary markets, namely its regular customers and its major trading partners. Then as of 2019, to the creation of more demanding products for new markets. Finally, in 2032, a special emphasis will be put on a continued international development and on the establishment of the recognition of Colombian natural cosmetics. According to Colombia’s Chamber of Industry of cosmetics and toiletries (Cámara de la Industria Cosmética y de Aseo de Colombia), the country’s exports for this sector were multiplied by ten in ten years. With US$683 million in 2010 [1], Colombia is one of Latin America’s leading exporters. The reasons for this success are many: a skilled workforce [2], a climate offering the possibility to produce throughout the year and provide the European markets outside their production season, a unique biodiversity since Columbia is the world’s  second richest country in terms of variety of flowers species (51 2203) after Brazil. Finally, the country can take advantage of a huge market potential, with the second best growth in the area in 2010. As a matter of fact, Columbia attracts cosmetic multinational companies that represent 75% of the total market, and generate alone 81% of industry sales. For example, Reckitt Benckiser has been established in Colombia for more than 60 years. ""Whether for the opening of factories, of distribution or R&D centres, hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested by a number of international firms since almost five years,"" observes Proexport Colombia, the body in charge of supporting Colombian companies on foreign markets. Unilever chose Colombia for the creation of three production plants (Bogota, Cali and Palmira Valle) and a regional distribution centre for an investment of $31.5 million. Procter & Gamble invested $25 million to open its new 150,000m² distribution centre in Rionegro. Avon invested between 50 and 60 million dollars for its 28,000m² ""green"" distribution centre. Are also present groups like Yanbal, Belcorp, Henkel, Beiersdorf. The Cámara de la Industria Cosmética y de Aseo de Colombia has signed in July an agreement with the Cosmetic Valley, the French competitiveness cluster comprising companies and universities. This agreement provides for the exchange of industry information, the mobility of researchers on an international scale, the setting up of business alliances and partnerships both for research and training. Camilo Martinez, director of Proexport Colombia, believes that ""the signing of this agreement is a significant step due to the fact that the French market is the first global player in the cosmetic industry, not only is the market an international benchmark, but it is also a springboard to the European market"". Moreover, height Colombian companies (Neyber, Waliwa, Kahai, Lail Cosmeticos, Laboratorios Francol, TropicOil, Cooparmayo and Biocate) participated to the latest edition of Beyond Beauty Paris where they showcased their natural ingredients: essential oils, aloe vera, avocado, passion fruit, basil or oregano."
Research finds certification is key for trusting cosmetic brands on natural claims,"With the help of a chartered chemist, Organic Monitor assessed the composition of over 50 international brands of natural cosmetic products. The market research firm then ranked the brands in terms of their “naturalness”. The study found that, apart from certified products, the formulations of most brands are not meeting marketing claims.  Organic Monitor says that many companies claiming to have ‘chemically-clean’ cosmetics actually are falling foul of having contentious synthetic ingredients, even when they contain some certified organic substances. For consumers, certification is the most reliable means to estimate the credibility of natural and organic claims made by cosmetic brands the research highlights.  Brands with high levels of certified products received the highest naturalness scores.  Indeed, standards - such as Ecocert, Cosmébio, Soil Association, BDIH, NPA and NaTrue - provide clear definitions of what they consider as natural or organic cosmetics, as well as lists of ingredients and processes they approve. The research also points out that naturalness and certification are no longer a specificity of small niche brands.  Epitomising the evolution of the market, certified mass products launched by large multinationals also scored high in terms of their natural and organic formulations: Garnier Bio Active (L’Oréal), Diadermine Bio Expertise (Henkel) and Johnson’s Natural (Johnson & Johnson). In contrast, the research questions fair trade certification as possibly confusing. Actually, most fair trade cosmetics assessed by Organic Monitor received low naturalness ratings because of high level of synthetic substances. Indeed, most fair trade standards only focus on fair trade ingredients and do not address formulation issues, with no list of approved or prohibited synthetic ingredients.  According to Organic Monitor fair trade seals can be deceptive when brands focus their claims on their fair trade natural ingredients. Organic Monitor also found important variations between geographic regions, partly correlated with the adoption rates of natural and organic standards.  European brands achieved the highest scores, North American brands ranked second while brands in other regions generally receive lower ratings. “Although a growing number of Asian and Latin American brands are emphasising their natural – and in many cases, indigenous – ingredients, the formulations are usually high in synthetic preservatives, emulsifiers and other ingredients,” said the firm in a release. According to Organic Monitor, Latin American and Asian brands are lacking of experience with green ingredients.  “Many Asian companies are not accustomed to using the new palette of green ingredients, preferring to use familiar synthetics in their formulations,” commented Judi Beerling, head of Technical Research. To address the formulation issues associated with natural and organic cosmetics, Organic Monitor is dedicating a workshop and seminar programme to this subject at the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, taking place in Hong Kong on 7-8th November, 2011."
Formulating without parabens? Alternatives to handle with care,"The second part of the information day on the ways to develop paraben-free formulas, organized by Premium Beauty News, with the participation of Mulon Conseil (a overview of the first part is available here), reviewed the alternative ingredients to parabens while also highlighting the difficulties associated to their implementation. As emphasised Stéphane Sellam, Regulatory Affairs and Technical Service Manager for Thor, ""70% of the protection for cosmetic products, these last 20 years, has been provided by parabens.""  Their very good resistance to high temperatures, their antimicrobial efficacy, their relative safety, their ease of formulation, turned them into unavoidable preservatives, until recently. But successive controversies have arisen consumers awareness. A trend which, as stated Ev Süss, Regional Business Manager for Symrise, has spread throughout Europe. ""Originating from an issue raised in Denmark six months ago, now most European countries are asking us to find alternatives to parabens."" Alternative solutions require a lot of know-how and creativity from manufacturers. Some are self-sufficient, but others must be combined to traditional systems of preservation or to the appropriate packaging. ""Unfortunately, there aren’t any universal solutions and work must be carried out on a case by case basis with regard to the type of formula to protect, its nature, its pH, its method of use"", pointed out Jean-Pierre Arnaud, CEO of Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Each supplier has its own ""home-made"" recipe based on its know-how. Dr Straetmans like Symrise offer customized glycol- and alcohol-based mixtures with a therefore broaden spectrum of activity. As for Inolex, it relies on the ""Hurdle"" technology to develop the range of caprylhydroxamic acid-based Spectrastat.  ""Our product has been formulated to create a hostile environment against microorganisms, we act at such levels as, water activity, pH, concentration of metal ions and on the membrane of microorganisms"", explained Lydia Heldermann, Sales & Marketing Manager Europe. The Thor company, meanwhile, recommends using the non-listed molecules only in addition to conventional preservatives. This is how it has developed the range of Microcare MTD family made from methylisothiazolinone. These alternatives to parabens with an initially diverted functionality - because they consists either of emollients, co-emulsifiers, solvents, or aromatic molecules - should have a proven safety. Yet, a number of molecules have low toxicity records, representing an additional challenge with significant financial consequences. To date, only in-vivo tests are available to assess the sensitizing potential of a product. By 2013, with the announced end of these tests, alternatives will need to emerge. As Jean-Luc Garrigue, BIOAGRI Europe Director explained, ""alternative isolated tests will never be able to take account of all the events involved in biological processes"". From raw materials, to new formulation concepts, including appropriate packagings, such as Aptar’s Irresistible distribution system, and the available support, for this approach, of Intertek, a company that can provide a whole range of tests to qualify preservative-free products, ""everyone is seeking help from its cortical brain to rethink its universe,"" concluded Laurence Mulon."
Formulating without parabens? Hurray for creative chemistry!,"An information day organized by Premium Beauty News, with the participation of Mulon Conseil, gathered on 6 July more than 50 formulation specialists, brands and suppliers, all concerned with the uncertainties surrounding some ingredients in use in cosmetic products.  And in particular, the famous parabens, regarded in 2004 in a suspicious light by some scientists, banned in products for children under 3 years in Denmark in 2010, under sustained criticism in France and threatened of being banned by a bill of law in May this year, but also weakened by this gigantic green wave for organic and natural products. To cope with the increasing level of consumer awareness, brands are striving to find new solutions and the appropriate alternative to these widely used ingredients in cosmetics due to their antimicrobial efficacy andtheir safety in use. After an overview of the regulatory status of concerned substances,Laurence Mulon listed the solutions already in use: products authorized by some standards on natural and organic products (some preservatives included on a positive list) but also new approaches and alternatives, such as sterilization, airless or single-dose packagings, self-protection of the formula (with ingredients imparted with microbiological properties, without being however considered preservatives), regulation of the pH in emulsions, reduction of the water activity, addition of alcohol, etc. André Jean Brin (AJ Brin Consulting), with its expertise in this area, shared some thoughts on the pitfalls and options.  Be very knowledgeable in raw materials, in their composition, in their microbial properties but also in water properties, ""because the risks are increased when there is a important water content in a formula."" Prefer the use of raw material with bacteriostatic or bactericidal properties, such as ylang-ylang, or of ""preservative-like"" actives such as sorbic acid, while validating their total safety and approval for use in some markets. Prefer prevention to emergency, think about side risks, study the stability over time, ""try to maybe find the right combination, but will it feature the appropriate cosmetic properties? The consumer will provide the answers!"" A consumer that urgently needs to be educated on its own role regarding the contamination of cosmetics products! Régine Frick, an engineer in formulation chemistry and an expert in innovation, has plunged us into the science of language with its constraints and evolution. A profession that requires expertise, process, and some responsiveness to budgetary and regulatory contingencies but also to market trends. Hence, the minimalistic approach, bordering quintessence in today’s formulas, to only retain the essential and the safest. Not to speak of Formulation Raisonnée, an exciting experimental approach developed in the 1920s, which consists in ""deconstructing the formula’s skeleton taking into account the ingredients physical and chemical properties and performances, to better combine them together, focusing on the more functional ones and avoiding redundancies."" A revolution that requires, thorough reflection, to observe raw materials differently, and to use a program like Nimrod to streamline the testing phases and assess the maximum impact of an ingredient versus a desired result. A tool that helps solve problems, simplify formulas, reduce deadlines and costs, but also open new avenues for innovation and creativity, and why not, anticipate a future trend"". ""A strategy where maximum data is collected with the help of minimum tests."" Confronted to this methodological opportunity Ngub Nding (Ephyla) has rightly addressed the human side of the issue. ""Let’s take this opportunity of having to formulate differently to develop our ability for change, formulate like if it was the first time, but more importantly, get started right now."" And never forget the creative dimension of chemistry, which enables to enhance some ingredients with new biological properties. As Ephyla recently did with clay, by increasing and enriching its inter layers. Think outside the box too, by imagining that alginates, clay, lipophilic solvents, but also dry steam, abrasives, probiotics and enzymes can replace surfactants in a washing product. But avoid alcohol, and a hygienist approach... All this requires to totally change one’s beliefs so to give free rein to imagination and rationality, investigate galenic innovation, take an interest in biomimetic strategies."
Brenntag: New guide formulations,"The Application Laboratory of Brenntag Spécialités, dedicated to cosmetic products, proposes two new guide formulations: a concrete with a fruity and delicious fragrance, and a light and non-sticky emulsion. The perfume concrete [1] has been formulated in a soft and non-sticky texture. The fragrance, which is distributed by Brenntag Specialités, is fruity, floral and delicious, with fresh head notes of licorice. The oil in water emulsion is a light, easy to spread and not sticky formula [2]. The goal is to provide users with a smoothly sensation, thanks in particular to its rapid penetration into the epidermis. “The Sympatens O/2500G, a nonionic emulsifier natural, makes a great addition to this formula,” said Marion Mouchonnet, head of Brenntag’s laboratory for cosmetic applications.  “Indeed, the addition of a co-emulsifier is not necessary for its use.  It can be added either in the oily phase or in the aqueous phase. The icing on the cake is that it is certified by ECOCERT.” Brenntag Spécialités opened the doors of its Application Laboratory for cosmetics in early 2011.  The facility is located in Amiens, North of France. The lab has already formulated and proposed a series of products (an exfoliating gel based on cork powder, a sweet oil for the bath, an organic [3] emulsion, etc…) from the various ingredients distributed by the group in France. “Our goal is to suggest ideas and propositions for almost all the categories of cosmetics,” added Marion Mouchonnet."
How to formulate without parabens?,"The vote by French deputies of a bill of law that would prohibit, the use in consumer products, of certain families of substances classified as endocrine disrupters really stunned the cosmetics industry. Indeed, after a quick inventory of their formulas, many brands have realized, with serious concerns, that the cost of possible ban of phthalates, parabens and alkylphenols would be astronomical. For most companies, parabens are obviously the core of the problem: actually this family of preservatives is widely used in many products.  But “the reformulation of products currently preserved with parabens and the use of new solutions imply to recreate entirely new formulas that to be re-assessed both in terms of stability and safety,"" highlighted COSMED, the association of French SMEs in the cosmetics industry. ""The financial and human resources to devote to this mutation are considerable,” added COSMED. However, in the minds of consumers, this “penalizing media burst"", as COSMED called it, almost completely destroyed, to the deep regret of the French Federation of beauty companies (FEBEA), ""the presumption of innocence"" of which these substances continue yet to benefit from a large number of scientists. Actually, scientific studies indicating possible health effects of parabens, as well as the vote of French deputies, benefitted from a huge media response that is strongly orienting the market. The rationality of consumers is not the as scientists. Indeed, it is virtually impossible for consumers to quantify the actual risk without relying upon experts whose credibility has been badly affected by the succession of health scandals. So, as soon as a risk exists, however small it seems, and as soon as there is an alternative offer, purchases are ""naturally"" reoriented ... the only limit being the substitutability of products. Eventually, manufacturers are trapped by a demand that is growing faster than alternative technical solutions. Certainly, many ingredient suppliers have marketed new substances, or cocktails of substances, in order to replace parabens. But the price of these ingredients is often much higher than that of parabens and, most importantly, they cannot just replace parabens. Indeed, the entire balance of the formulation needs to be reviewed and, sometimes, its is necessary to consider packaging change or even to modify the manufacturing process, for example by opening clean rooms. In order to clarify all these issues, Premium Beauty News has proposed to key players iof the cosmetics industry (expert formulators, ingredient suppliers, toxicologists, consultants and brand owners) to share their solutions and exchange on their experiences during a conference day that will be held on the 6th of July in Paris. Among the topics that will be discussed by the panel of experts gathered on this occasion: formulation challenges, protection from the packaging, new available ingredients, new safety issues, etc. The full program and registration details are available here below:"
ID bio launches a new organic range of titrated extracts,"Presented for the first time during the 2011 edition of the In-Cosmetics tradeshow in Milan, the TitrExtract range launched by ID bio aims wants to address new needs of natural-ingredients based formulations. Titrated extracts, also named standardized extracts, are botanical extracts with a bibliographic claim and in which a molecule or a molecule family, usually the one thought to be the active compound, is identified and titrated.  The extract is processed so that that the supplier can ensure it contains a specified amount of the said molecule.  According to ID bio, this enables to ensure the reproducibility of the effect claimed. Actually, said ID bio, titrated extracts are “at the crossroad of standard extracts and actives.”  They help to comply with the provisions of the new European regulation on cosmetics which, starting from 2013, will require suppliers of botanical extracts to provide safety and efficacy assessments for their products. “Titrated -standardized- extract perfectly answers the current regulatory issues faced by the formulators,” explained the company in a release. The TitrExtract range is composed of four extracts that are 100% certified organic by Ecocert: – A red vine extract titrated in flavonoids, that claims a vascular remodelling effect,
– A ginseng extract titrated in saponosides expressed as ginsenosides, claiming revitalizing and tonifying actions,
– A marshmallow extract titrated in pectic substance expressed as neutral carbohydrates and uronic acids, claiming bio-adhesive and remoisturizing actions,
– A spearmint extract titrated in carvone, for an antioxidant action and a cellular detoxifying effect. Created in 1993, ID bio has a renowned expertise in custom-made botanical extraction.  The company will enlarge this range over the months thanks to product developments notably coming from internal innovation."
Naturex launches Amazonian active for rejuvenation,"Naturex latest development for the personal care industry is derived from a variety of Dragon’s Blood obtained from the Croton lechleri tree, which is the primary topical aid for skin care in the Amazon rainforest. Injuries of all kinds can benefit from the application of the healing red latex derived from this tree. Dragon’s blood is a substance known from the Antiquity that can be obtained from various tropical and Mediterranean plants. “It helps to protect the skin, due to its high content of proanthocyanidins, providing a powerful antioxidant activity. Dragon’s Blood extract, standardized to taspine, stimulates the early phase of the wound healing, by stimulation of the fibroblasts. Dragon’s Blood sap helps to protect the cells of the skin and regenerate the whole tissue,” explains the company in a release. According to the French supplier of natural ingredients, in vitro and ex vivo studies, demonstrate that its Dragon’s Blood extract improves the stratification and quality of the new epidermis and contributes to a complete reparation and regeneration of the tissues, for skin rejuvenation.  Furthermore, Dragon’s Blood sap is rich in antioxidant phenols and can protect cells from oxidative stress. Naturex Dragon’s Blood extract can therefore be used to rejuvenate the skin, to prevent or treat the signs of aging, to protect the skin against environmental aggressions like wind, cold, dry air and pollution, or to normalize stretch marks. “Tropical environment yield many plants that offer benefits to health. The Amazon rainforest provides a wealth of traditional botanicals that demonstrate significant benefits to the skin when topically applied,” told the company. Naturex has applied its expertise to identify the best sources of certified raw materials that are effective in application whilst also being respectful to the environment.  They obtain their Dragon’s blood by cutting the bark in diagonal manner and bleeding the latex. This method is employed by the locals to help preserve the trees, allowing Naturex to supply a renewable resource."
Clariant wants to lead the way to paraben-free preservation,"At the end of 2010, the decision of Danish authorities to ban propyl and butyl parabens in products for children under the age of three, and the recommendation by the EU’s Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) to restrict their concentration to 0.19% in all cosmetic formulations have confirmed the urgent need to find efficient alternatives to the use of paraben-based preservatives. In order to help cosmetics manufacturers to respond to these restrictions as well as to address increasing consumers’ demands towards lower preservative levels, Clariant has developed alternatives that can be used in a wide variety of formulations. Presented on the occasion of the latest edition of the In Cosmetics trade show in Milan, the Velsan SC preservative booster is based on natural raw materials.  Falling within Clariant’s EcoTain range focusing on naturally-derived and sustainable products, and also approved by Ecocert, one of the main certification body for natural and organic cosmetics, Velsan SC is a new 100% based natural hydrotrope and emulsifying agent for cosmetic formulations. According to Clariant, the Velsan SC acts as a synergistic aid to boost the performance of standard preservatives, like aromatic alcohols and organic acids.  “As a result, it decreases the overall amount needed for safe preservation, thereby reducing the odour issue known from some preservatives.” When used in combination with non-listed actives, it may also help manufacturers to formulate “preservative-free” cosmetic and personal care products. In the segment of paraben-free preservative blends, Clariant proposes the Nipaguard PO 5 and Nipaguard POB, based on Piroctone Olamine and Phenoxyethanol. The chemical company claims these alternatives have a comparable and even better performance than classical paraben blends with excellent long-term antimicrobial activity against a wide range of bacteria, yeasts and moulds from pH 4-10. “These PO blends are especially suitable for the preservation of creams, lotions, sun screens, deodorant formulations, cream rinses, shampoos, shower gels, and liquid soaps,” explained Clariant in a release."
Alban Muller brings the benefits of plants into make-up,"According to Alban Muller, today’s make-up products not only colour and make consumers more attractive but they also have expanded their role by offering cosmetic properties (moisturising, anti-ageing, antioxidant, etc.) and, of course, they increasingly bet « on natural values. » « To match these two key-trends of make-up market, plant extracts are perfect and become the true must-have active ingredients, » says the French supplier. Thanks to a unique technique of adsorption on microporous silica, Alban Muller propose its customers to adapt its liquid cosmetic ingredients to the specific formulation of make-up powders. “They can thus create their own Ami-caps from one of our numerous Phytamis (more than 160 eco-designed plant extracts) and high-tech actives. The principle is easy: they select an active and our laboratory experts adapt it to create their Ami-caps,” says the company. When applied on the skin with the powder, the extract is naturally released on contact with the skin through a phenomenon of slow adsorption-desadsorption between molecules with different polarities: water and the extract. The Ami-caps  can be incorporated into any powder formulation, pressed or loose (blush, eye shadow, face powder, bronzer, etc.) and thus make-up powders can claim to have cosmetic activities!"
In-Cosmetics turns into green,"For those who visited the In-Cosmetics trade show, which was held from March 29 to 31 in Milan, Italy, there is little doubt that sustainability is riding high on the cosmetics industry agenda at the moment. Actually, visitors to this year’s In-Cosmetics were being offered the opportunity to find out focuses and showcases on sustainable cosmetic ingredients and the sustainable sourcing of raw materials.  A “Sustainability Gallery” sponsored by Beraca, was promoting some of the industry’s most sustainable initiatives and was featuring a selection of companies with a green story to tell. Explaining how the companies participating in this gallery were selected, Cathy Laporte, In-Cosmetics group marketing manager, said “there are companies who have a sustainability policy just because they think they should. Then there are companies for whom green practices are the cornerstone of their business.”  Among them were: – Active Organics, a company focused on environmentally compatible harvesting, manufacturing and distribution of innovative natural products. – Arizona Chemicals, the world’s largest bio-refiner of pine tree extracts. The line of 97% bio-renewable polymers - Sylvaclear and Uniclear - offer broad functionality as film formers, water-repellency agents, polymeric emulsion stabilisers, structuring agents, rheology modifiers, pigment stabilisers and actives delivery systems in the personal care industry. – Dr Straetmans Chemische Produkte, which was presenting its Dermofeel GSC palm oil fre, an economic emulsifier that protects biodiversity by using locally sourced rapeseed oil, thereby reducing unnecessary transportation. Also taking part in the Sustainability Gallery were: AzkoNobel, Arch Personal Care, Gattefossé, GreenPalm, Honeywell International,Laboratoires Expanscience, Lipotec, Biointec, and Oleon. Beraca, the Brazilian-based supplier of organic and natural active ingredients, was the official sponsor of the In-Focus feature at In-Cosmetics 2011.  On this occasion, the company, which recently became a member of the Union for Ethical Bio Trade, partnered with L’Oréal-owned brand Kiehl’s to present a tunnel-shaped stand named “Beraca Experience”. The company was featuring the ethical and sustainable sourcing of acai, one of its most famous ingredients, which is used by Kiehl’s as a super-antioxidant and skin damage repair in a skincare collection. “Each stage of the açai supply chain is traceable and sustainable,” said Filipe Sabará, Business Director at Beraca.  “Environmental preservation, corporate social responsibility, and sustainable sourcing of ingredients are the philosophies that have guided Beraca’s practices since its inception,” he added. Among the multiple green ingredients showcased at In-Cosmetics, alternative preservatives were particularly highlighted.  These substances are useful to replace ingredients with bad press, such as parabens and are also adapted to would-be “preservative-free” or “self-preserving” formulas.  While not being listed as a preservative in the European regulation, they may have a secondary function that helps to extend the longevity of a cosmetic product and prohibit the growth of harmful bacteria. The US-headquartered Inolex Chemical Company, for instance, presented six paraben-free substances based on a mix of caprylhydroxamic acid (CHA) and a secondary ingredients.  Each of the substances was designed to address the specific requirements of various formulations types."
Symrise focuses on parabens alternative and natural ingredients,"Symrise claims that its new ingredient Hydrolite 6 boosts the preservative efficacy of mild organic acids such as potassium sorbate and dehydroacetate, thus making the use of parabens and other controversial preservatives unnecessary. The Hydrolite 6 therefore offers an interesting alternative to manufacturers of skin care products for children, in a context where Danish authorities have banned propyl and butyl paraben in cosmetic products for children under the age of three, and where consumers increasingly favour natural and preservative-free products.  According to Symrise, Hydrolite 6 would also be efficient to increase skin’s moisture content.  Nearly odourless and colourless, it is suitable for most cosmetic systems and complies with US, European Union (including Danish), Japanese and Chinese regulations. ""The initiative started by the Danish government on paraben-free skin care products for children confirms that we pursue the right path with our high quality ingredients that support health and well-being. In particular, we thereby include consumers’ desire for both skin-friendly as well as highly active ingredients,” explains Ravikumar Pillai, Global Product Director Actives Symrise’s Life Essentials division. To respond to the growing demand for natural ingredients, Symrise Life Essentials business unit is focusing on innovative botanical active ingredients with anti-aging properties as well as on its new vegetable and grain extracts. These products are Symrise’s response. Symrise wants to place nature at the centre of its participation in the upcoming In-Cosmetics tradeshow (Milan March 29-31, 2011) and showcase its new natural extracts of echinacea, quinoa, pumpkin and many other plants. Among the main botanical ingredients the company will showcase: – SymFinity 1298, a 100% natural active anti-aging substance that comes from Echinacea and is claimed to strengthen the skin cells’ resilience to stress, protecting it against environmental damage responsible for wrinkles. – Actipone Superveggies, which gathers the beneficial antioxidative properties of seven vegetables -artichoke, asparagus, beet, broccoli, pumpkin, spinach and zucchini. – Extrapone Healthy Grains, botanical extracts of traditional grains such as amaranth, quinoa and khorasan wheat that are used for their care-giving properties."
CoValence fights ageing with fruit and flower extracts,"US contract manufacturer of private label and custom formulations CoValence has developed a new serum claimed to preserve the youthfulness of eyelashes and eyebrows. The “Lavish Lash and Brow Peptide Serum” combines three main actives: – Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17, for enhancing eye lash growth through the stimulation of keratin production.  According to CoValence, this novel peptide increases eyelash thickness and length by 25% within two weeks during clinical trials.
– Phospholipids from apple stem cells [1] that stimulate and protect hair stem cells, for promoting growth and preventing greying,
– And Tricholastyl®, an anti- hair loss botanical active produced by Cognis, Laboratoires Sérobiologiques. “As we age, our lashes and brows become dramatically thinner, shorter and eventually turn gray. Utilizing cutting edge technologies, our treatment preserves youthfulness of the lashes and brows by thickening, lengthening, conditioning and darkening,” the company claims. The serum is to be used once daily, by drawing the applicator along the skin at the base of the upper eyelashes going from the inner part of lash line to the outer part. The laboratories based in Chandler, Arizona, have also launched three new anti-age formulas using their FlowerFractions™ complex. – Bloom Serum to help fight ageing, while promoting healthy skin transformation.
– Revolutionary Moisture, which is a blend of the FlowerFractions™ complex with antioxidants and collagen, to leave skin feeling moisturized and re-vitalized.
– Buffing Poppy Seeds Scrub, an exfoliator. With their botanical and flower extracts, and stem cells by-products, CoValence new anti-age ranges are on the edge of current trends."

Soliance launches a renewable squalane,"Soliance presented its renewable squalane for the first time in Europe at the Cosmetagora, which was held on the 19th and 20th of January 2011 in Paris. Because of its stability and hydrating properties, squalane is known to be one of the most effective emollients of the market. However, it has progressively been neglected by formulators because of supply difficulties. Historically, squalane was sourced from shark liver. This very controversial source was abandoned in favour of plant-derived materials, mostly from the processing of olive oil. Unfortunately, the disadvantage of olive as a source is its price variability due to its interdependence with food oil. Avoiding these issues, Soliance’s renewable squalane is sourced from sucrose derived from sugarcane thereby benefiting from high productivity rates (2 tons of squalane per hectare of sugarcane). ""The production of a single farm is almost enough to meet the World’s annual needs,"" said Soliance. According to the French supplier of cosmetic ingredients derived from natural resources, other advantages are: the full traceability of the ingredient, from the farmer to the market, and sustainability, thanks to sugarcane’s production cycle. Regarding the sensory qualities of this renewable squalane, tests performed by Soliance show they are quite similar to those of olive squalane. For the development of this alternative source,  Soliance partnered with Amyris, an American specialist of biotechnology."
Lessonia to debut in make-up,"Lessonia, a French specialist of natural ingredients and formulas, is rapidly developing its full-service business, which already represents 50% of its turnover. For the time being, this activity concerns mostly products for beauty parlours, with references as prestigious as Sothys and Decléor, but the company also wants to develop the retail market and has recently produced a glitter oil for a large perfume chain store which will be be marketed on the occasion of the end of year festivities. No question, however, for the French company, based in the Brittany region, to dilute its know-how. ""We don’t want to be another of these contract manufacturer. We have specialized in atypical formulas and products, "" explains Christophe Wincler, CEO of Lessonia. ""It is precisely for this reason that for most of our developments, we also provide the ingredients. We are in a particularly remarkable spiral development where our activity as ingredient suppliers pulls our full service activity upwards and vice versa. "" To cope with its ongoing development, the company which already employs 40 people, must continue its industrial investments and has just put into service a new filling line. Lessonia, who attended In-Cosmetics Asia in Bangkok, Thailand, and Cosmoprof Asia in Hong Kong also announced its intention to enter the raw material market for make-up applications. ""We are going to introduce new ranges of ingredients and formulas at the next In-Cosmetics in Milan. Especially with the Microzest 25 [1] an ingredient featuring sufficient fineness to allow its use quite appropriately as a make-up pigmen, "" added Christophe Wincler. So let’s meet next spring, on 29, 30 and 31 March, more precisely, for the 2011 edition of in-Cosmetics."
BASF uses papaya extract to bring luminosity to the skin,"BASF Beauty Care Solutions new anti-ageing substance does not focus on diminishing the appearance of wrinkles, but on skin luminosity and brightness, another key element of the consumer’s satisfaction.  “Simply acting on wrinkles alone may make you look good, but not great,” BASF argues in a release. Actually, BASF has developed a glow-enhancing technology based on papaya extract.  The company developed on a patent pending process to optimize and stabilize the papain enzyme, which is claimed to be more effective than salicylic acid to exfoliate the skin, and as efficient as glycolic acid to improve the appearance of the skin brightness.  BASF selected a papain of the highest grade of purity and tested it for toxicity.  A natural stabilizer has been used to optimize the performances of the papain, and the preservative system was also carefully chosen to retain maximum efficacy. According to BASF, consumer tests show visible improvement of the skin quality, at 21 days X-pressin brings a new luminosity to the skin.  The effectiveness of X-the substance was assessed with a series of clinical and consumer tests.  “After an overnight application, a large percentage of consumers found their skin was softer and smoother,” the company says."
Green innovation to drive growth of the European personal care ingredients market,"The European personal care ingredients market experienced continued growth in the last few years despite the negative effects of the slow economy, reveals a recently published study by consulting and research firmKline & Company [1]. According to Kline, during the economic downturn, the personal care ingredients market outperformed most other end-use industries in which specialty chemicals suppliers are active. “Fueled by a relatively stable consumption of cosmetics and toiletries during the crisis, the market is expected to recover quickly, as indicated by a sharp rebound in sales in the first half of 2010, and is anticipated to continue to increase at an annual volume growth rate of 2.6% until 2014,” says the company. While price was the key purchasing criteria during the latest years, innovation is now returning as a key buying factor for formulators.  This should “create an opportunity for suppliers to develop more added values and take market shares from established products,” comments Anna Ibbotson, industry manager at Kline’s Chemicals & Materials. Traditional ingredients will take advantage of this upturn, but the largest growth expected is in the “green” product area. Furthermore, boosted by increased consumer awareness about sun exposure side effects, the use of UV absorbers has extended to an increasing number of skin care products, and they now rank among the most rapidly growing markets. As far as the industrial structure is concerned, Kline notes that the personal care ingredients supplier basis is continuously concentrating, the recent acquisition of Cognis by BASF confirming this trend.  “Key suppliers are trying to be present in most market segments to represent a one-stop-shop for cosmetics and toiletries formulators.” However, while most of the personal care ingredient segments are dominated by a few large companies, such as in the case of hair fixative polymers, where the top three competitors hold 87% of the total market volume, segments which cover a broader range of applications, such as skin and hair care, remain more fragmented as the ingredients are widely varied."
Beraca: new hair care active from pracaxi oil,"Although its name is not as widespread as other species of the Brazilian biodiversity, the pracaxi [1] is a very well known tree in the Amazon region. Its antibacterial and anti-hemorrhagic properties have made the plant traditional among local populations in the treatment of snake bites, healing of ulcers and surgical sanitation. According to Beraca, a Brazil-based supplier of organic and natural active ingredients, the oil extracted from pracaxi seeds has several applications in the cosmetic industry. “As a powerful dermatological moisturizing, it helps cell renewal and treats stretch marks, skin discoloration, and depigmentation. When applied to hair care products, it provides an excellent conditioning effect, eases combing, and enhances hair smoothness and shine,” the company claims. Beraca has used pracaxi to develop a hair conditioning ingredient with Ecocert and USDA organic certifications.  Due to its high concentration of behenic acid (C22), BBA (BioBehenic Active System) is a natural alternative to surfactants and cationic agents in conditioners. It provides viscosity and helps in stabilizing emulsions. The BBA also creates a hydrophobic layer around hair fibre, which shields it from humidity and controls the volume. To produce BBA, Beraca works in partnership with 500 members of Amazonian communities involved with a biodiversity enhancement program. They are responsible for collecting pracaxi seeds, which are then sent to the Beraca’s plant, located in the metropolitan region of Belém, in the north of Brazil, where oil extraction and processing take place. “Besides making profit from the trade of seeds, local communities also benefit from investments in infrastructure, training, handling, and certification,” Beraca says. Beraca’s pracaxi oil is already exported to several countries, including the U.S., France, Germany, England, and Italy. Among the ingredient’s major clients are L’Oréal, with the Kérastase brand, and The Body Shop."
Biopiracy: what are the risks for the cosmetics industry?,"In October 2009, the Greentech company specialized in green active ingredients, abandons the patent it had filed in 2006 [1] for the use of Sacha Inchi (Plukenetia Volubilis), a plant of the Andean foothills of Amazonia which grows between 100 and 1000 meters of altitude. Already, Cognis France had given up (early 2009) a patent application concerning the cosmetic and dermatological use of the oil and proteins extracted from the nut of the plant. In both cases the same reason, the accusation of biopiracy made against these companies by NGOs but also by the very official National Peruvian Anti-Biopiracy Commission (Comisión Nacional para la lucha contra la biopiratería). ""Sacha Inchi was probably already cultivated by pre-Inca civilizations, 3000 or perhaps 5000 years ago, specimens of the plant were actually discovered in tombs. But the farming of the plant was nearing extinction in the 1980s"", explains Daniel Joutard, creator of the brand Aïny, which built its reputation on the utilization of plants and knowledge of indigenous-people. ""The seed of Sacha Inchi which has the shape of a star contains almonds rich in omega 3"". The vast majority of cases handled by the National Peruvian Anti-Biopiracy Commission concern pharmaceutical uses of plant extracts. But the Sacha Inchi case, one of the recent cases having received strong media coverage, shows that the cosmetic industry is not spared from such problems. Especially as the concept of biopiracy doesn’t limit itself to cases of patent registration on traditional knowledge. According to Daniel Joutard it must be understood in its broadest sense as ""an access to resources and collective knowledge, with no prior information on intentions and researches, with no explicit approval of local communities and states concerned, with no compensation mechanism, and possibly, by filing a patent of limited innovative significance"". For companies, danger comes first from the media. Because being accused of robbing indigenous peoples of their ancestral know-how is unlikely to benefit to their brand image. The chances are even higher because the attitude of the biopirate is then perceived as being at odds with the ethical, responsible and sustainable attitude often thought to be at the origin of the research and of the use of herbal ingredients. ""Biopiracy not only affects the interests of states and indigenous people, keepers of genetic resources and traditional knowledge, but also those of consumers of ’natural’ products, who surely care about the fact that these products respect the anteriority of customs and knowledge coming from indigenous people"" argue the members of the Collectif Biopiraterie. [2] But the risks is also legal. It occurs mainly with the risk of forfeiture of intellectual property rights sometimes hard-won. Indigenous peoples often lack the legal resources and financial means, which need to be mobilized in order to hope gaining an intellectual property right internationally acknowledged. Their traditional know-how benefits however, from the partial protection of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, adopted at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which attempts to regulate access to living resources, and entered in international law the recognition of traditional knowledge. The Convention establishes the principle of prior consent of affected populations and that of the sharing of biodiversity benefits. But again, procedures are cumbersome and often costly. The people alone don’t have the means to defend themselves. Especially since it is not always easy to demonstrate the anteriority of traditional use. ""The power struggle may seem disproportionate, but the benefit of obtaining a patent becomes increasingly limited compared with the chances of ill-publicity the company has a chance to face with a problem of this type,"" notes Daniel Joutard. As for cosmetic brands, general awareness seems to be very slow to emerge. This issue is far from their everyday concerns. As far as sustainable development is concerned, there are often many more priorities to be solved before this one really emerges. Yet, brands are far more vulnerable than ingredient suppliers whose names are rarely known to the general public. If a major media campaign is triggered by NGOs, it will necessarily be the brand’s products using the incriminated ingredients that will be put forward. Hence the importance there is to question oneself about the precautions to take before using a novel plant ingredient, and the contents of specifications to be provided to suppliers."
Bluestar Silicones wants to become a global player of the cosmetics industry,"Bluestar Silicones, a subsidiary of the Chinese Bluestar group, will participate in the 2010 edition of the In-Cosmetics show in France [1].  Bluestar Silicones will showcase its full range of silicones for use in a number of cosmetics and healthcare segment application fields. Founded in 2007, in particular from Rhodia’s silicone business, Bluestar Silicones generates a turnover of EUR 600 million and operates manufacturing sites in all regions of the world. Bluestar Silicones offers a comprehensive range of speciality silicones (high molecular mass gums in volatile silicones, amodimethicones and their emulsions, silicone polyethers, performance systems, etc.), in particular the Mirasil range, which is devoted to hair and skin care products. Bluestar Silicones, which claims to be a one of the leading manufacturers of completely integrated silicones, is demonstrating its determination to become a key worldwide supplier of performance systems to the cosmetics industry.  “This positioning fits in with Bluestar Silicones’ global strategy and that of its new production facility in China that has joined ranks with its silicone product manufacturing and research sites at Saint Fons (France), Lübeck (Germany), Santa Perpétua (Spain) and Caronno (Italy) that work for the cosmetics industry,” explains the company."
The promising future of aloe vera,"Within living memory aloe vera (including the best known specie aloe vera barbadensis miller) is the most applied medicinal plant worldwide. The first written records about the use of aloe vera were found on over 6,000 years old clay tablets found in Mesopotamia. Today, aloe vera is one of the most studied plants worldwide. Actually, there is hardly any plant that can display such a great variety of scientifically-proven active pharmaceutical ingredients (about 200) whose unique combinations and concentrations generate a broad spectrum of activity. So, it’s not surprising that aloe vera has been playing a major role in the cosmetics, food and many other industries for years. Aloe vera is commonly used in many cosmetic products and the rise of natural and organic beauty may constitute a new opportunity for this plant. In order to shine a light on various aspects of this still very promising ingredient, the Federal Association of German Industrial and Commercial Companies (Bundesverband deutscher Industrie- und Handelsunternehmen - BDIH), in collaboration with LR Health & Beauty Systems GmbH and supported by the International Aloe Vera Science Council (IASC), has organized a one-day symposium dedicated to aloe vera. The Aloe Vera Symposium took place on the 16th February 2010, on the occasion of the Nuremberg fair (Congress Centre Nuremberg). Speakers covered a broad spectrum of issues, from the perspective of medical and natural sciences, quality assurance, legal affairs, marketing, analytics, natural cosmetics and food chemistry without forgetting the ethnopharmacological, ethnomedicinal and ritual use of aloe vera. In an overview of the aloe vera market, Devon Powell (Executive Director, The International Aloe Science Council, Inc. - IASC) demonstrated the potential for growth of the plant.  Considering trends and prospects he questioned the audience about a possible golden age of aloe vera. Several speakers detailed the properties of aloe vera, including its ability to enhance the bioavailability of Vitamin C, E and B12. Michael Peuser (author of the aloe vera bestseller Kapillaren bestimmen unser Schicksal / Capillaries determine our fate) even spoke about empirical experiences: from healing cancer to moisturizing. Dr. Christian Rätsch (ethnopharmacologist) highlighted myths, legends and lore surrounding aloe vera, and RA Harald Dittmar (Managing Director, BDIH) proposed a review of possible and impossible health claims. The event has made clear that there is no equivalent option to aloe vera currently available on the market. Up to now the wide-ranging and scientifically-proven application sprectrum of aloe vera remains unmatched!  Aloe vera is used in the health, food and cosmetic industries and also present the advantage to be well known.  Launching a credible alternative in the current legal and regulatory context would be a hard challenge. After six millennia aloe vera is still a modern-age plant."
Rousselot launches new anti-ageing collagen peptides ,"Rousselot, a French supplier of hydrolyzed collagen specializing in the health and nutricosmetic industries, recently extended its actives range to cover cosmetic applications. Supported by recent studies, Rousselot is launching Peptan SR marine (Skin Regeneration) and Peptan MR marine (Moisture Retention), topical versions of its Rousselot nutricosmetic active. “The results of in-vitro studies which we have conducted using specific grades of hydrolyzed collagen have been particularly positive,” explained Caroline Nègre, RHC Marketing Manager. According to Rousselot, the new Peptan SR marine peptide, which is an active ingredient of marine origin,  would boost fibroblasts proliferation and promote the synthesis of collagen. The new peptide was tested on a culture of fibroblasts. During the first 24 hours, utilized in a dosage of 0.1mg/ml it induced a significant increase of 18% in the proliferation of fibroblasts by comparison with an untreated control,  and by 22.5% over 2 days. According to Rousselot, the Peptan SR marine, used at a concentration of 1% in cosmetics formulations, would be capable of restoring the three-dimensional structure of the dermis, giving it cohesion and tonicity, and would also have an antioxidant effect. The Peptan MR marine is a natural marine biopolymer with film-forming properties. According to Rousselot, it helps maintaining the moisture balance of the skin and provides it with NMF [1]-specific amino acids. Rousselot’s new range of peptides of collagen is available in powder form, and is preservative free an odourless. Eventually, Rousselot highlights the potential synergies between the nutricosmetic and topical ranges and their complementary capacity to improve the health and beauty of the skin."
Industry responds to launch of i-Phone application on cosmetic ingredients,"The Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA) says the launch of Cosmetifique 1.0, a new application for iPhone and iPod Touch “could leave consumers feeling anxious about the safety of the products they enjoy every day”. Actually, Cosmetifique claims to be able to instantly inform consumers about “the quality” of the ingredients in the cosmetic products they might purchase and if they are “dangerous for the health or for the environment!”  The application is available to purchase from Apple’s App Store at a price of US$1.99. “The launch of this new i-Phone application is concerning for a number of reasons. Firstly, because it suggests that consumers might find ‘dangerous’ substances in their cosmetics. In Europe, all products sold are subject to strict safety legislation so would never pose a safety threat to consumers. Secondly, because the way it is being promoted, it seems to perpetuate the myth that natural ingredients are not chemicals and are in some way safer than man-made ingredients. In reality, everything is chemical, whether natural or synthetic, and it’s not simply the presence of an ingredient that determines how safe a product is. Qualified safety assessors have to consider a whole range of factors, including the quantity of the ingredient contained in the product, how it reacts with other ingredients and how often the product is used,” commented Dr Chris Flower, CTPA’s Director General."
Symrise launches superfruits for cosmetic products,"Over the past few years, superfruits (açai, blueberry, cranberry, grape, guarana, mango, pomegranate, etc.) have enjoyed an immense success, in the food and beverage industry. They can be found everywhere in the supermarket - in tea, juices, cereals and many more products. “Even though superfruits were almost unknown to the public a few years ago, today they are part of the modern lifestyle of many consumers,” Symrise says in a release. Capitalizing on this success, Symrise is currently expanding its Actipone line of botanical ingredients by adding superfruits which can be used in all kinds of cosmetic products. The Actipone Superfruit range includes, among others, goji berries, chokeberries (aronia) pomegranate, blueberries, black currants, camu camu, and cranberries. “Superfruits’ excellent characteristics and their stunning success in the food and beverage sector are convincing arguments for integrating them into skin and hair care products. Consumers know about superfruits’ positive effects and will also appreciate them in cosmetic products,” says Dr. Joachim Röding, Senior Vice President of Life Essentials and Global Head of Cosmetic Ingredients at Symrise. Superfruits are reputed to be extremely rich in nutrients and to possess excellent antioxidant effects. They bind free radicals, which helps to prevent premature skin aging."
Plant complexes designed for oily phase Products,"Alban Muller International has developed a range of oil-soluble plant complexes, designed for products with an oily phase (such as emulsions, emulsion serums, care oils, etc.), the Lipidamix. The complexes are made by macerating several plants in sunflower seed oil. Each of the seven complexes in the range features a blend of plant extracts selected for the their effect on the skin or the hair: – Lipidamix Softening, a combination of pot marigold, Roman chamomile, carrot, myrrh and elder flower
– Lipidamix Slimming (bladderwrack, ivy and meadowsweet)
– Lipidamix Antiaging (wheat, sunflower, horsetail and myrrh while)
– Lipidamix Radiance (mallow, red vine and scotch pine)
– Lipidamix Moisturising (ivy, mallow, pellitory of the wall and elder flower)
– Lipidamix Purifying (myrrh, great burdock, great plantain, thyme and mallow)
– Lipidamix Firming (fenugreek, hops, horsetail and frankincense) The Lipidamix range is free of preservatives, 100% natural and manufactured according to low-energy processes, pursuant to the company’s eco-responsible policy. According to Alban Muller, the combination of several plant extracts in a single active, also allows to reduce the number of control tests and regulatory filings."
Beraca wins UN award for sustainable development initiative,"Beraca was one of the winners of the 2009 SEED Awards for Entrepreneurship in Sustainable Development. The prize created by the United Nations recognizes innovative projects that are environmentally responsible and promote sustainable practices in the areas where they operate. Beraca was selected for “The sustainable use of Amazonian seeds”, an initiative developed in the Marajo Island, in the north of Brazil, where Beraca saw an opportunity to transform the collection of andiroba seeds, a traditional practice in the region, into an alternative source of income for the island’s communities. By providing training to residents and transference of technology, the company encouraged the creation of a cooperative called Coopemaflima. It enabled the extraction of oil from the seeds, which has an important use for the cosmetic industry, to be conducted within the community. According to Beraca, the result was an increase in the environmental awareness and in the profit of local populations, reducing their vulnerability to possible reductions in economic activity. Nowadays, Beraca buys 500 tons of seeds from the cooperative every year, benefiting around 1,000 islanders. Beraca also helped the community to obtain organic and environmental certifications for the raw materials collected, cooperating to an increment in the products’ added value.  “One of Beraca’s main commitments is to invest in projects that promote regional development. We are proud to represent Brazil in this major prize with a project that contributes directly to the preservation of the world’s largest tropical forest”, said André Sabará, Coordinator of Corporate Responsibility at Beraca."
Naturex and Natraceutical to form botanicals giant,"Naturex, a French supplier of natural speciality ingredients to food, flavour, food supplements, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, has reached an agreement with Natraceutical, a Spanish biotechnology corporation for the merger of their ingredient activities, which is expected to be effective before the year end. The two companies have a complementary product portfolio that includes nutraceutical ingredients, flavouring, preservative and innovative extracts on Naturex’s side, and natural colours, fruit and vegetable powders, pectins, functional ingredients, yeasts and caffeine by Natraceutical’s ingredients division.  Furthermore, while Naturex is strongly positioned in the USA, Natraceutical holds strong market shares in Europe. This merger aims to create the World’s number one independent company of natural specialty ingredients.  The resulting company will have production sites in Europe (France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and United Kingdom), the USA, Morocco, Australia and Brazil and own sales offices in the USA, Europe and Asia. After this operation, Naturex will double its turnover (proforma sales will reach in 2009 around EUR 200 million against EUR 93 in 2008). Natraceutical will focus its efforts in the development of their nutritional supplements division in Europe, which the company markets exclusively in pharmacies under the brand name Forté Pharma. In the future, Natraceutical should hold between 38% and 40% of Naturex shares. Natraceutical will become a relevant minority shareholder and a board member of Naturex, chaired by Jacques Dikansky, Chairman and CEO."
Arylessence expands its offering of organic and natural fragrances,"In order to meet the ongoing demand by consumers for pure, natural, non-artificial products, Arylessence has developed new fragrances designed to meet the strictest 100% organic requirements and the “natural ingredient” certification as defined by U.S. legislation [1]. Arylessence uses only certified and authorized ingredients, explains Lori Miller Burns, the company’s Director of Marketing. The ingredients can therefore be used without additional certification procedures “Companies making natural and organic products now have the freedom to choose exactly the right fragrance for their brands,” commented Arylessence’s President Steve Tanner."

Cremer Care replaces petrolatum with vegetable alternative,"German producer of natural raw materials for the cosmetics industry, Cremer Care,said it has found a natural and purely vegetable alternative to petrolatum. Named Cremerlin, the product has been developed by Bernd Brinkmann of the Walter Rau Neusser Öl und Fett AG, a subsidiary of the Cremer Gruppe. Petroleum jelly (petrolatum or soft paraffin) is a semi-solid mixture of hydrocarbons, which has been used widely in the cosmetics industry since its discovery in 1859. “We are glad that after exactly 150 years of using this oil gel, we have found a vegetable alternative,” said Bernd Brinkmann. This new ingredient broadens the palette of formulators that are eager to overcome the use of oil derivatives.  “The need for purely vegetable cosmetic ingredients is constantly growing and this very much ties in with the people’s awareness for sustainability. With this vegetable product we fully meet all those expectations”, Business Unit Manager Patrick Knüppel added. Cremerlin will be presented at the next In-Cosmetics tradeshow, which will be held in Munich (Germany) from April 21st to 23rd 2009."
CPL Aromas and Symrise seek revenue growth into organic fragrances business,"British independent fragrance house, CPL Aromas, has developed a range of 100% organic fragrances fully accredited by the Soil Association, UK’s leading organic certification body, thus contributing to the expansion of available materials for brands looking to propose naturally fragranced produced. “The current globally available palette of organic raw materials is growing but is very much more restricted than a standard perfumer’s palette,” explains CPL Aromas CEO Chris Pickthall. “But the collective expertise of our UK and global perfumers has meant we have some great organic fragrances available on our library as well as an ever growing palette of raw materials to be able to create to customer briefs.” CPL Aromas says the Soil Association stringent standard is “recognised by other global bodies such as USDA and EcoCert,” thus allowing the company to offer its products to overseas markets. Germany-based global supplier of fragrances and flavourings, Symrise, simultaneously announced the production of its first three organic fragrances would start in March 2009 as the company’s production sites in Teterboro and Branchburg (both in New Jersey) obtained USDA Organic Certification. Last year, Symrise acquired U.S.-based Manheimer Fragrances, a manufacturer whose specialties included certified natural, organic and fair-trade fragrances. “We see tremendous opportunities for growth here,” said Roberto Ascoli, Senior Vice President Scent & Care Division Creation & Innovation at Symrise, speaking about potentialities of the US organic market. According to Achim Daub, Global President Scent & Care at Symrise, the demand for natural and organic ingredients will continue to grow in the future: “Today’s consumers make conscious, responsible purchases and are buying more and more products made from natural, sustainable raw materials.”"
Symrise launches a new protection against long-term skin damage,"Symrise says that SymHelios 1031 acts by binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transmitter protein, in a non-toxic way thereof preventing harmful substances from adhering to the AhR and penetrating deep into the cells to accelerate the ageing process. “SymHelios 1031 acts exactly where the process of skin damage begins. It prevents toxins from being transported, which in turn reduces long-term skin damage due to UVB rays,” explains Dr. William Johncock, Senior Vice President, Scent &Care, head of the Symrise’s UV Protection unit. However the compound does not shield the skin against sunburn or UVA damage. When it comes to counteracting the impact of sun exposure in general, the protective effects of SymHelios 1031 therefore have to be combined with other substances. “To optimally protect the skin, you should always use a sun care product with special UV filters,” says Johncock. Symrise claims that in a clinical trial, test subjects treated with SymHelios 1031 had the best results in terms of protecting against metabolic reactions, skin aging, dermal irritation and oxidative stress after UVB exposure."

"Fast growth for botanical ingredients, study says","“The increased use of botanicals is one of the major changes in the cosmetics and toiletries industry in recent history,” says market research firm Kline & Company commenting results of its latest study: Specialty Actives and Active Delivery Systems for Personal Care 2008: U.S. and Europe. The study reveals the overall botanicals consumption is growing at 8.0%, outstripping growth of other specialty actives with average growth of 5.4%. Furthermore, “labelled” actives are showing extremely quick growth, at up to 20% a year. “Today’s consumer wants not only natural products, but also performance,” notes Nikola Matic, senior analyst, Chemicals and Material Industry at Kline. “These two requirements were regarded as contradictory a few years ago, but highly substantiated botanical products developed recently brought new solutions to formulators.” According to Kline, the move from synthetic to more “natural” ingredients should now be regarded as an established growth driver, which has benefited botanicals above all. Alleged harmful effects of some synthetic chemicals, the natural trend and the growing demand for more sustainable products are strengthening the shift. “Changing demographics, with an ageing population in the United States and Europe, will also promote growth in botanical consumption in the anti-ageing segment. Botanical suppliers in order to compete with existing formulations are promoting their products as more effective at lower levels, when compared to for example vitamins, making the botanical actives comparable in price on a cost-performance basis,” Kline adds. Kline & Company evaluates the market for specialty actives and active delivery systems in North America and Europe at approximately USD 840 million (EUR 667,56 million)."
Shiseido’s new lipstick pigment makes lips shining and hides wrinkles,"When asked to tell “what they want out of lipstick”, about 500 women in their 20s to 50s surveyed by Shiseido in April 2008, indicated a high awareness regarding such matters as “lips that look full and plump” and “less noticeable lip wrinkles and lines ” in addition to matters related to “texture and colour.” However, according to Shiseido, existing lipstick pigments cannot address brightness and wrinkle concealing simultaneously. Indeed, existing pearlizing agents that are widely used in lipstick have a plate-like shape, which gives them a vivid colour tone, excellent brilliance and lustre, but tend to emphasize the difference in brightness of uneven areas, thereby making wrinkles and lines more easily noticeable. Shiseido therefore changed the pigment’s shape and developed a new spherical substance. Spherical pigments are not unknown in cosmetology.  They are formulated in foundations for such purposes as correcting skin unevenness, but are not effective enough in oil based lipsticks and other cosmetic products. The Japanese cosmetics giant had to develop en entire new ingredient, using innovative technologies to coat high-refractive-index powder with high light-diffusing properties as a pearlizing. Shiseido says the new spherical pigment makes light reflect evenly, giving lips a radiant shine and making lip wrinkles and lines less noticeable.  The company should apply this technology to future lipstick products very soon."
Symrise launches new multifunctional ingredient,"Symrise’s newest cosmetic ingredient, SymTriol, is a synergistic, patent-pending blend of 1,2-octanediol, 1,2-hexanediol and methylbenzyl alcohol. According to Symrise, the innovative blend gives the substance multifunctional properties. On the one hand, 1,2-octanediol and 1,2-hexanediol, are moisturizers with broad spectrum anti-microbial activity. On the other hand, methylbenzyl alcohol is a nature-identical compound that is used in perfumes. It also has antifungal effects, which enhance the anti-microbial properties of the 1,2-alkanediol blend. SymTriol is a clear, nearly colourless liquid which is soluble in cosmetic esters, glycols and ethanol, and it is compatible with most raw materials. SymTriol is stable at a pH-value of 3-8 and has excellent temperature stability. If desired, its faint odour can easily be masked by other fragrances.  SymTriol can therefore be used in a broad range of cosmetic products such as gels, creams and lotions. Thanks to its antimicrobial and antifungal properties, SymTriol also allows manufacturers to reduce the amount of preservatives such as parabens and formaldehyde donors, “both of which remain controversial in public opinion,” Symrise comments in a release. According to the company, the recommended dosage of SymTriol is 0.5-1.0%.  The INCI name of the substance is to be written: Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Methylbenzyl Alcohol."

Cremer Care launches a range of organic fatty acids and emulsifiers,"As the cosmetics industry is massively shifting towards green and organic products, the availability and quality of organic raw materials do play an increasing role in the development and success of new cosmetic lines. Suppliers of raw materials and ingredients are addressing this trend by diversifying the organic offer. Cremer Care and its sister company Prignitzer Chemie, are making another step forward with the launch of a range of organic fatty acids and emulsifiers from certified organic oils. A World’s premiere, Cremer Care claims. “Our company’s focus on natural cosmetics and organic raw materials has thus been reflected to the full extent. We are very glad to have become the producer and provider for a resource that has – up to now – not been available,” Cremer Business Unit Manager Patrick Knüppel emphasises. Actually, Prignitzer Chemie succeeded in processing certified oils into organic derivatives and consequently also organic emulsifiers. For the first time raw materials on a purely organic basis can be used for (liquid) soaps and a variety of other cosmetics and toiletries where it was not possible so far, do to the lack organic fatty acids and emulsifiers.  “With this worldwide unique organic product we fully meet all expectations”, Patrick Knüppel adds."
