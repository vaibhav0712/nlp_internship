"""Eco-design is now a standard practice,"" A. Hubin, Somater","Premium Beauty News - What are the main assets of Somater? Alix Hubin - The Somater Group is a renowned operator on various markets, in particular for offset decorated rigid tubes for pharmaceuticals, high-end air-blown injected cosmetic bottles with optimised and high-tech decoration, mascaras that we produce with a high productivity technology, blown extruded or co-extruded bottles, decorated or not, with automated packaging processes in order to reduce handling. With the purchase of the former Polyflex plant, which became Plastuni Normandie, Somater strengthened its already strong reputation as an air-blown plastic transformer. There was a very good know-how in this factory, it just needed to be developed through new investments, and that's exactly what we did. Our investments account for 8% of the group's turnover. For the Plastuni Normandie factory the rate reached 10%. Indeed, we purchased new air-blown injection machines, we reorganised and modernised the serigraphy equipment, and invested in new machines for improving the way we pack our products and reducing transportation costs. Premium Beauty News - What is the outcome of 2008 for your company? Alix Hubin - 2008 was a good year for the entire group. Thanks to our reactivity and our rapid decision making process, we are able to accompany our customers on many projects, even those requiring heavy investments. We recently participated in the launch of prestigious ranges, such as the line Démaq, Lancôme, Clarins' new Lift Minceur or Bourjois' new So Delicate gloss; and the new Efferalgan 1g with an easy opening system for which our customer, Bristol Myers Squibb got a Pharmapack in January 2009. All these launches were the occasion of advanced technological innovations. For instance, in order to make the Lancôme bottles, we invested in high-tech robotised tools. The decoration on Clarins and Bourjois bottles was only possible through special machines. Our motto has always been that when a company stops investing is a company that is just about to shut down. Thus we never hesitated to support our customers and to follow them when they needed, in particular to invest in the manufacture of their next launches. Premium Beauty News - And what is your vision for 2009? Alix Hubin - 2009 is likely to be a difficult year. The dramatic stock clearing operated by our customers, mainly in high end segment, is directly transformed into postponed orders. It is very difficult to know whether these delays are linked to a strong decrease of consumption or to a new form of supply-chain management. The shortening of payment delays may also contribute to this situation. Small mass retailers and beauty institute might have reconsidered their purchasing policy in view of the new French ""law for the modernization of the economy"". There's a real question regarding the possible impact of this law on the cash flow of the smallest retailers and on their purchasing policy. To date, beauty products in the mass market channel appear to be least affected. The quantity of calls for tenders remains high. There is a real will to launch new products to enhance the demand. I consider it is a sign that the industry is still very active and wants to prevent any risk of recession. As far as we are concern, our financial strength allows us to resist to the current recession. So far, I remain careful and not too worry for 2009. If necessary, we'll not hesitate to take any necessary measures if we see that orders do not come back while our customers should have entirely cleared their stocks. 2009 will be a challenging year in the packaging industry, which is used to that. The new factor is that it will also be a challenging year for beauty operators. Premium Beauty News - Is there a risk that environmental concerns do not survive difficult economic times? Alix Hubin – I consider as a very positive sign the fact that despite ""the crisis, environmental concerns still top the agenda. A growing number of calls for tenders require using recycled materials, even though these materials are not always the best option from a cost efficiency viewpoint. As far as we are concerned, we integrate eco-design practices on a routine basis in our work and our customers do really appreciate that. Eco-design is now a standard practice and there is no possibility to step back, whatever the economic context is. It is a real source of improvement, with demonstrated technical and economical impacts. Somater has initiated the process to be ISO 14001 certified. We are combining eco-manufacturing with the eco-design, through massive investments in low-consumption electrical machines, by making a wide use of frequency modulation to adapt consumption to the needs, and by using free-cooling for the production of iced water."
"""Make-up is offering opportunities,"" S. Castelletti, Faber Castell Cosmetics","Faber-Castell Cosmetics is part of the Faber-Castell group, one of Germany's largest and most traditional family-owned companies. Founded in 1761, the group's turnover achieved a turnover exceeding EUR 400 million for the fiscal year in 2007/2008. Faber-Castell has approximately 7,000 employees in 14 manufacturing sites and currently manufactures cosmetic products in Germany and Brazil, specializing in colour applications: wood-clenched pencils, capillary systems and liquids. Premium Beauty News - What is the outcome of the year 2008 for your company? Stefano Castelletti - Faber-Castell Cosmetics consistently develops new make-up concepts combining both product and packaging innovations. In 2008, we presented Double Deluxe, our luxury collection for eyes, with a new 3-D decoration technique offering a sensitive reptile ""touch"". Another example is Truly Natural, an overall ecological make-up concept with a formula certified by Ecocert, FSC-certified wood and a cap made out of biodegradable material. We also work in interdisciplinary teams with our stationary company to jointly interpret technical expertise in writing instruments into cosmetics. There's definitely more to come for 2009! Premium Beauty News - Forecasts for the year 2009 are not very optimistic. Within such a context, what is your message to the rest of the industry? Stefano Castelletti - Despite of downturns the dynamic market for make-up is offering opportunities on a global scale. We should focus on what is important, the products and our business, in an environment that is more sensitive, demanding and ambitious. At Faber-Castell, we have been managing efficiency regardless of economic downturns and have never really stopped optimising costs, performance and innovation. We will need more focus and cautiousness than before. Premium Beauty News - Is there a risk that environmental concerns do not survive difficult economic times? Stefano Castelletti - Sustainability and respecting the environment are counted among the core values at Faber-Castell to the extent that Count Anton Wolfgang von Faber-Castell, chairman of the board, was nominated ""Ecological Manager of the Year 2008"" by WWF (World Wide Fund For Nature) Germany and the economic magazine Capital. As such we will continue on managing our business with the sustainability principles that are traditional for Faber-Castell from product development to factory emissions: ecological balance and ecological reporting. It's our Nature because we are convinced that business success implies ethic standards."
"""The European market dropped about 2%""","Premium Beauty News - What is the outcome of the year 2008 for your company? Guy Mallinson - Our turnover dropped about 4%, in particular because our exports outside Europe drastically decreased as they were impacted by the weakness of the US currency. In parallel,the European market dropped about 2% while sales were very low during the fourth quarter. Premium Beauty News - What is your vision for the next six months? Guy Mallinson - Beyond general uncertainties, we expect the first quarter to be very difficult, in particular for the perfumery and cosmetics business where orders will be fragmented and projects delayed. Premium Beauty News - How does your company intend to overcome the recession? Guy Mallinson - If there's no demand we'll suspend our production. However, we think important to keep prices at a level allowing us to remain profitable and able to invest in the long term. Price hikes that we obtained in 2008 are not enough, even when considering recent that raw materials continued to decrease recently. Premium Beauty News - So, what about innovation? Guy Mallinson - Iggesund is investing huge human and financial resources in order to reach an almost unrivalled level of quality. We have launched the New Invercote in July 2008, bringing a fresher whiteness to the market, while preserving the qualities of a ""chic and warm"" product that remains elegant throughout years. Furthermore, whiteness durability, which is a factor as important as initial whiteness, was improved. Actually, these investments should help us to accelerate product improvements and I think that several novelties will be visible in 2010. Premium Beauty News - Environment and sustainable development are the new buzzwords in the industry. How do you address this challenge? Guy Mallinson - Traditionally, Iggesund used to be extremely discreet and did not really communicate on this issue. Actually, Iggessund should be presented as a model, in particular if we consider the amount of money that was invested in processes and equipments for cutting harmful emissions and decreasing energy consumption (in particular of fossil fuels). Our latest project to date is the implementation of a plan to reduce oil consumption in our Swedish plant, with the aim to be close to zero within 2 or 3 years."
Caution and pragmatism for SGD in 2009,"""As far as the perfumery industry is concerned, we must be cautious since the recession, which probably climaxed in the USA, will worsen in Europe,"" says Laurent Zuber. In a context of global crisis, ""only Brazil and, to a certain extent, China, appear to be able to resist,"" he adds. However, SGD can rely on strong assets, Laurent Zuber explains: ""thanks to our global implantation - six plants, seven furnaces, in France, Spain, in the USA, Russia, China and Brazil - we can even out the effects of the current economic cycle"". Premium Beauty News - Hopefully, the beginning of 2008 was very positive for SGD. Laurent Zuber - Actually, despite premonitory signs in Spain and in the USA, the first half of 2008 scored a growth rate of 7%. However, from September, everyone witnessed a rapid and general downturn, which was unpredictable. Eventually, we closed 2008 with a growth of more than 2% at fiscal year-end. Premium Beauty News - So what about the outset of 2009? Laurent Zuber - Since the beginning of the year, business slowdown has been very strong, with low range visibility over future orders. There has been a massive stock clearance from our customers. Paradoxically, we can already forecast a strong increase of the demand for glass vials as soon as the crisis ends, with a risk that the demand largely exceeds the production capabilities of glassmakers. Premium Beauty News - What is the best investment policy in such a context? Laurent Zuber - We carry on our ambitious investment policy, but we have adjusted it to the current economical environment. Premium Beauty News - And innovation? Is it still possible to make innovative glass products? Laurent Zuber - Yes, we just demonstrated it with the development of our ""Infinite Glass"", which is made of 100% recycled glass and has triggered strong interest. Some of our customers have already initiated creative reflections. Premium Beauty News - Is it the result of the work of your creative workshop? Laurent Zuber - SGD's creative workshop was created five years ago and we are constantly working to develop new technologies and new decorative materials. The creative workshop contributes to differentiate us from our competitors: all our glass development or decorative innovations are located in one single place. Our customers come there to finalize their projects. Furthermore, this workshop is the place where we create the Trends Books that we present to customers. Premium Beauty News - SGD participated in major launches during the latest months. Laurent Zuber - It is not possible to mention all of them here, but let's point out some most illustrative examples: ""For Him"" and ""For Her"" by Narcisso Rodriguez, ""One Million"" by Paco Rabanne, or ""MaDame"" by Jean-Paul Gaultier, with a bottle carved like a block of glass."
Toly to produce lipstick tubes in India,"Toly has announced that they have extended their product portfolio to include lipstick packaging. A new custom lipstick was launched for Hindustan Unilever. Toly's first lipsticks are being produced in their new factory in India as lipsticks are the No.1 product when it comes to colour cosmetic sales in India. Toly will now introduce its new standard mechanism to its western customer base such that they can tap into Toly's new capabilities from India, China or Malta."
Oeakametall seeks to capitalize on its strengths,"""Actually, it's true that the car industry is in a very harsh situation while, the cosmetics industry remains in a better shape, so far,"" explains G. Oehlhorn, Oekametall's CEO. With a turnover of 35 million euros in 2008, the German company remains one of the main European manufacturers of mascara and lip-gloss containers (75% of the cosmetics business), and lipsticks cases. ""The development of our mascara business has been a strong propeller for our company during the last three years,"" G. Oehlhorn underlines. Actually, one of Oekametall's main assets is its ability to handle the whole manufacturing process, including the manufacturing of traditional brushes. ""And will soon be able to make plastic brushes,"" G. Oehlhorn adds. ""This asset is strengthened by our structure: we are a familial company with a very high reactivity and quick decision-making processes, we have always been able to adapt ourselves to changing circumstances and to integrate other cultures,"" says G. Oehlhorn. Today's, the group runs two manufacturing units: one is in Bamberg, where are located metal and plastic transformation, finishing workshops, assembly lines and the production of brushes; the other one is the brand new CCO plant in Korbussen, which is specialized in surface coating, whether lacquering, polishing or metallization. A new production line for lip-glosses flocked applicators has recently been added to the COO's manufacturing equipment. ""Also note that, during the last decade, we have been working with a subcontractor in the Czech Republic for small series and hand assembly,"" G. Oehlhorn adds. The next step for the Oekametall is the reorganization of the decision-making process with the aim to enhance the potential for added-value creation. ""Believe me, there's a lot of work to do,"" G. Oehlhorn says. One more singularity for Oekametall, since the company will implement a method inspired from Japanese cars maker Toyota!"
The beauty industry seeks to reenchant cosmetic products,"As a first step, participants tried to identify the roots of difficulties that pre-existed the credit crunch, and that emerged on the occasion of the global slowdown in the form of a shift in the status of cosmetic products. Why ""products that used to sell better than the average consumption rate, did suddenly become less performing?"" questioned Joël Palix, President of Clarins Fragrance Group. Brands have failed to ""listen the society, and the evolution of what does luxury mean,"" commented Nathalie Duran, Deputy General Manager of YSL Parfums. Luxury, in particular for the youngest generations, is less linked to a specific object than ""to experiences, relationships,"" she said. For Joël Palix, these difficulties come from ""the lack of investment in the training of people who are in charge of selling products"" and the subsequent lack of knowledge about the product itself and what are the key factors of product quality. Thibault Ponroy, Director of International Luxury Purchases for AS Watson/Marionnaud, insisted on the price issue: ""In France, excepted in 2007, the growth of the market in value was just hiding the stagnation or the decrease of volumes sold."" For Xavier Renard, General Manager Fine Fragrance & Beauty Care Europe at IFF, some explanations might be found in ""the high rhythm of launches leading perfumers to develop new fragrances within delays that do not allow them to match with the level of innovation awaited by the market"". Actually, participants agreed that the offer's segmentation is becoming unclear, with old landmarks almost entirely blurred. ""There's a clear difficulty to identify one's target. To easily sort products designed for the prestige channel from those designed for the mass market,"" said Vera Strubi, the Honouring president of the Beautyfull Club. Indeed, ""the middle market appears as an attractive reference for most business models. However, niche brands demonstrated it is possible to sell expensive products when they are highly differentiating"", Thierry de Baschmakoff, the founder of the design agency Aesthete, said. Thibault Ponroy therefore called for a ""comeback to smartness"". Since, ""the only justification of a price is the creation of value"", he said. While participants widely shared this analyse they paradoxically also regretted the increased triviality and lack of differentiation of products, with ""perfumes made in three months, and others in three years,"" but sold at very similar prices, and just distant by ""a few centimetres from one the other on retail shelves"". The creation of more added-value would imply to go back to the sources of the ""spirit of enterprise,"" suggested Vera Strubi. In order to reintroduce passion and pleasure in the product development process, she proposed to create small multidisciplinary teams, featuring staff from all the company's departments: sales, marketing, purchases, etc. It was certainly not by chance if the Honouring president of the Beautyfull Club was promoting the opening of vertical borders! ""Marketing teams must meet suppliers on a regular basis, in order to be able to negotiate with the company's purchasing department,"" she explained. A point of view Thibault Ponroy shared. ""It is important not to be submitted to its own job, to be able to escape from the daily work in order to think and analyse, in particular through exchanges within the industry, with brand owners, retailers and suppliers,"" he said. Exactly what the Beautyfull Club is aiming at! Of course it was not possible to speak about value creation without mentioning innovation! According to Gérald Martines, General director of RPC Beauté, ""in a market with such a plethoric offer, brands imperatively need to stand out from the mass"". There is subsequently strong pressure to innovate for packaging suppliers. With, sometimes, ""impossible requests"" from brands simultaneously asking for low production costs, short time to market and innovation. ""Eventually, innovation is always the adjustment factor, with existing and well-known solutions being chosen in order to limit risks"". Behind the question of time lays the question of launches and their rhythms. For Joël Palix, ""It is important not to forget that the date initially scheduled for a launch is not settled for ever. One should never launch a product without being ready and proud of the product"". With the aim to carry on producing perfumes and cosmetics that make consumers dream, the President of Clarins Fragrance Group is betting on ""slow design"", by reference to the ""slow food"" movement that was born in Italy in reaction to junk food. ""We are working in the long-term. We are currently preparing the products that will be launched in the next three or five years"". For Joël Palix, a part of the solution is in the hands of retailers who may start making a selection among the endless succession of novelties. A task Thibault Ponroy is ready to fulfil. ""It is the mission of retailers to select the offer, and to contribute to segment the market in its outlets,"" he said."
IFF opens creative centre in Shanghai,"The centre includes state-of-the-art creation and application facilities, as well as a consumer insights centre that allows IFF and its customers to gain deeper understanding of the rapidly-changing needs and preferences of this dynamic region. Located at The North in the Putuo district of Shanghai, ""the centre provides a customer-focused environment for flavour and fragrance creation,"" IFF said in a release. The facility strengthens IFF's presence in Greater Asia and is part of an ongoing global program to expand and modernize its facilities to capitalize on strategic growth opportunities. ""IFF is dedicated to helping our customer grow their brands,"" said Robert M. Amen, chairman and CEO of IFF. ""To deliver on this, we must invest in material science, creativity, and consumer insights. The new Shanghai Creative Center is a wonderful demonstration of this commitment. I am confident that it will inspire our colleagues to create scent and taste experiences people love,"" he added."
LVMH announces another year of growth in 2008,"Group share of net profit was stable compared to 2007 and came to 2,026 million Euros. ""The 2008 results demonstrate the exceptional reactivity of our organization in this period of economic crisis. The Group has always emerged stronger from previous economic downturns thanks to the dynamic innovation of its brands, the quality of its products and the effectiveness of its teams. LVMH approaches the challenges and the opportunities of 2009 with confidence and determination and has set the objective of increasing its leadership position in the worldwide luxury goods sector,"" said Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH. Perfumes & Cosmetics registered organic revenue growth of 8% in 2008. Profit from recurring operations reached 290 million Euros. The current operating margin reached 10%. According to LVMH, Christian Dior continued to win market share. ""The vitality of its star perfume, J'Adore, and the success of Dior Homme Sport, have contributed to the brand's strong momentum. Make-up is growing fast and has benefited from the success of the Dior Addict and Diorshow lines."" "" The excellent performance of Guerlain was supported by the successful launches of the masculine perfume Guerlain Homme and Le 2 mascara. The principal drivers of Givenchy's growth were the continued progress of Very Irresistible, the launch of the masculine fragrance Play and the new mascara Phenomen'Eyes. Benefit enjoyed rapid growth in China and confirmed its worldwide success, "" LVMH added. In 2008, Selective Retailing registered organic revenue growth of 9%. Profit from recurring operations was 388 million Euros. According to LVMH, ""DFS revenue grew slightly. The slowdown in Japanese tourism was offset by the momentum of other Asian clients. DFS benefited from this trend through the opening of the Macao Galleria and the airport concessions at Mumbai and Abu Dhabi. Opening new stores in these destinations requires short-term investment but constitutes an important source of future growth"". ""Sephora continued its strong momentum in 2008 which resulted in market share gains and a continued good level of profitability. Revenue growth on a same-store basis was steady. The brand is expanding its presence in key markets and continues the evolution of its existing store network. On-line sales have shown strong growth in France, the US and China. Sephora continued its differentiation strategy with a more innovative and exclusive product offering, complemented by a large range of in-store services and treatments."""
Weckerle plans to takeover Dr. Scheller Cosmetics' production,"Thomas Weckerle, owner and CEO of Weckerle, and Reinhold Schlensok, chairman of Dr. Scheller Cosmetics, said they already agreed upon the essential framework conditions. According to the proposed agreement, Weckerle would take over Dr. Scheller Cosmetics' production premises, factory buildings and facilities in Eislingen (Germany). All of the current 200 jobs would be maintained. Originally a manufacturer of automatic machines for the production of lipsticks, Weckerle has developed into a globally established contract manufacturer. ""By taking over Dr. Scheller's business with trademarks, Weckerle expects to get access to strategically important customers in Europe and overseas,"" Thomas Weckerle said in a release. Through this transaction, the Weckerle Group also aims at expanding its field of action in Germany. ""Weckerle has a strategic and long-term interest in the location of Dr. Scheller Cosmetics in Eislingen,"" said Thomas Weckerle. ""It is a production plant that has grown over decades and is successful because of competent and reliably operating employees with excellent know-how in the production of decorative cosmetics and toothpaste,"" he added. Weckerle operates other production units in Switzerland, France, North- and South-America. As far as Dr. Scheller is concerned, the divestment should help the company to concentrate their financial and personnel resources fully on promoting their brands. Dr. Scheller's portfolio features brands such as Manhattan, Manhattan Clearface, Dr. Scheller Naturkosmetik and Phyto Solutions. In connection with the take-over, both parties plan a medium-term agreement concerning production cooperation, in order to guarantee a trouble-free hand-over of the business. According to this agreement, Weckerle will continue to deliver the products that Dr. Scheller Cosmetics produce now at the site, for the next 5 years. Weckerle and Dr. Scheller Cosmetics declared their aim is to sign the agreement on the 2nd of April, 2009 with the take-over to occur the same day."
Trade association launched to promote airless systems,"In an exclusive interview with Premium Beauty News, Mrs Lucyna Silberstein, Megaplast's General Director and APA's President, describes the strategy and priorities of the new association. On its first year of existence, APA intends to promote airless designs widely in Europe, focusing on the systems' strengths making them increasingly popular among cosmetics, pharmaceuticals or foods manufacturers, in particular their contribution to formulas' preservation and their ability to dispense 100 percent of the product. Premium Beauty News - First of all, could you describe what airless designs are? Lucyna Silberstein - Actually, one of our first actions was to provide a relevant definition of these products. We agreed that an airless design is a non-pressurized dispensing system, combining a mechanical pump with an airless filled and sealed container, delivering the product without air aspiration. The container is either flexible or rigid, with a hose or a piston. Premium Beauty News - Why such an association? Lucyna Silberstein - Our main goal is to develop the global market for airless products, mainly through communication initiatives promoting the systems and highlighting their strengths, in particular to final consumers. It is obvious that this kind of campaign will be helpful to brand owners - our customers - who are making the choice innovation and added value. For us, it's a way to accompany and support them in this direction. Last but not least, we intend to create an ""Airless"" quality labelling that will guarantee that airless designs comply with APA's specifications. Premium Beauty News - What about APA's workload in 2009? Lucyna Silberstein - As a first step, we are preparing a press kit providing more details about the association. We are also finalising a strategy to send out press releases and information to both the industry and general media, in particular we want to target the women's press. Furthermore, we are working on a website with the aim to put it online by the 1st of March 2009. Eventually, we should start working on the quality labelling by the end of the year."
Maesa to focus on growth,"Founded in 2003, Zorbit has a similar organization to Maesa, with integrated design, engineering, project management and quality control, backed by a wide network of producers based in Asia, Europe and the American continent. Based in New York, Zorbit has offices in Los Angeles and Shenzhen (People's Republic of China). In just five years, Zorbit has become a U.S. leader in the design and manufacturing of tailor-made products for the beauty industry. The company generated 23 million dollars in revenues over 2007, and around 45 million dollars in 2008. The acquisition of Zorbit should help Maesa to strengthen its presence in North America. Maesa Inc., the company's U.S. subsidiary created at the end of 2006, has moved to Zorbit's headquarters, just a few hundred meters away its former premises, and a specific management committee has been created for the North American Region, and three of Zorbit's founders, Howard Sherman, Tom Butkiewicz and Scott Oshry have joined the Group's steering committee. The business combination has created a group with 200 staff, serving more than 150 clients from out of seven offices in Europe and the US, with a business volume of around 74 million euros in 2008, spread over four business lines: Maesa Beauty (26 million euros), Maesa Home (23.8 million euros), Maesa Promotions (4.9 million euros) and Maesa Packaging (19.3 million euros). Over the next year Maesa will focus its development ""on the deployment of high creative value-added retailer brands on the one hand, and the outsourcing of resources on the other, notably on packaging, for luxury and beauty brands,"" the company said in a release. The group also said to be confident regarding its ability to meet the target that was set three years ago for 100 million euros in revenues in 2010. To accompany its development, Maesa strengthened its management team in Europe with the arrival of a new Chief Executive Officer for Maesa Beauty and Maesa Home Europe and a Chief Procurement Officer. New Chief Executive Officer of Maesa Beauty and Maesa Home Europe, François Duquesne, 43 years old, has a strong backaground in the luxury and beauty world. He has been a director and President USA at L'Artisan Parfumeur, while at the same time heading up the American business of two other Cradle Holdings Group brands: Erno Laszlo cosmetics and Penhaligon's perfume and fragrance products. Laurence Hyest, 48 years old, is taking over from Cédric Noël as Chief Procurement Officer for Maesa. She has a 25 year experience in Procurement and Development in the perfume industry. After starting off her career as a commercial assistant in a trading company (bottling and sealing), she was a Purchasing Manager at Annick Goutal then Guerlain, before being appointed Head of Procurement and Development at Jean Patou then Cartier, where she was in charge of purchases for accessories. More recently, she was in charge of procurement and development at Selective Beauty."
Perfume and cosmetics: the needed revolution,"The BeautyFULL Club is organising a Lunch Debate that will gather representatives of the entire cosmetics industry to discuss ""the needed revolution of perfume and cosmetics"". [1] Mrs Nathalie Duran, Deputy General Manager of YSL Parfums, Mr. Reinold Geiger, CEO of L'Occitane, Mr Joël Palix, President of Clarins Fragrance Group, Mr Thibault Ponroy, Director of International Luxury Purchases for AS Watson/Marionnaud, Mr. Xavier Renard, General Manager Fine Fragrance & Beauty Care Europe at IFF, and Mrs Judith Gross, Global Director, Fragrance Innovation at IFF, will tell share their opinions on the state of the beauty industry. With topics such as ""Considering new definitions of luxury by consumers and keeping in mind innovation responsibilities"" or ""Our industry has a true business model problem … solutions do exist … let's face it and discuss"" the debate is unlikely to be limited to ordinary descriptions but may propose real solutions to think beyond current pessimism. Not to be missed!"
"""Innovation and quality are the propellers of our growth"", Pierre Miasnik, Fiabila","Premium Beauty News - What have been the highlights of 2008 for Fiabila, in particular with regard to innovation? Pierre Miasnik - Whether in France, Mexico, India, Japan or in the USA, the totality of Fiabila's manufacturing sites recorded increased activity in 2008. In the USA the volume we produced has doubled. Even though we expect decision makers to turn very careful on these various markets, we remain confident, in particular when considering our order backlog and Fiabila's financial strength. We have always regarded innovation and quality as the key propellers of our steady growth since more than 30 years. Today, only to speak about France, 20% of our staff is involved in research and development. Last year, we finished the conception and industrial implementation of a new method to produce thixotropic gels. This impacts the quality of products, their fluidity and brightness. Furthermore, we concretized a technical partnership in the USA with NaturalNano Inc. regarding the use of natural nano tubes in nail polishes. These tubes are used to serve as vehicles for active substances that will slowly diffuse in the product. Their action can therefore be time-controlled. Premium Beauty News - Environment and sustainable development are the new buzzwords in the industry. How do you address this challenge? Pierre Miasnik - Of course we're still hardly working on water-based enamels. Our investments related to safety, productivity and working environment are growing strongly. Installing sprinklers on the entire production site of Maintenon (France) implied to invest more than 2 million euros. Production induce pollution, raw materials consumption and requires energy… Why should we produce low quality enamels that will not be used and that will be destroyed eventually? The market is crowded with such products. Our mission is to produce high-quality formulas only, in that way we contribute to protect the environment. Premium Beauty News - What is your position with regard to the development of full-service? Pierre Miasnik – Structurally, we are subcontractors both for the production of bulks and the filling of products. That does mean we have the manpower, the equipment, the computers and plenty other required resources. There's only a small step from subcontracting towards full-service, and we have been proposing it for several years."
"""Competition will not be detrimental to the environment"", Philippe de Brugière, L'Occitane","Premium Beauty News - What have been the highlights of 2008 regarding new launches and innovation for L'Occitane? Philippe de Brugière - 2008 was a transition year. Launches were aiming at reinforcing the positioning, the legitimacy, the value and efficiency of each product in proposed to our women customers. This policy was also applied to products' packaging, where we chose not to introduce breakthrough innovation. Generally speaking, we focused on the know-how of our suppliers and we have been seeking in every little place on the planet to find the best quality/price ratio. We focused on improving the quality of the manufacturing in order address higher expectations from Asian customers. We have performed series of tests and issued new specifications in order to improve the aesthetics and reliability of the packaging. Actually, the real breakthrough is occurring silently, in a humble way, in order to be always more consistent with our eco-friendliness commitments. This breakthrough will only be possible with the help of our suppliers. Premium Beauty News - Many industry insiders are announcing harsh times in 2009. What is your message to the supply side for this new year? Philippe de Brugière - Well it's a plain message that makes the headlines. Brands have started a fierce competition to keep their market shares. Huge investments are made in order to appeal customers, with unprecedented retail offers. These efforts have a cost. L'Occitane is not different and we are expecting our suppliers to share at least a small part of the efforts we are making. Supporting our sales is also supporting their business. They are dependent on our sales. In such a situation, being a fair player means to rethink its own business, to eliminate useless burdens and costs. Pro-activity is required and being the first to make proposals is important. Premium Beauty News – Is your business impacted by the current volatility of raw material markets? Philippe de Brugière - L'Occitane is partly protected from these fluctuations, the first reason being that we are making our best to reduce the weight of our packaging. However, we had to fight against general pressure. We also seize this opportunity to question some established business relationships and to meet interesting new suppliers. The cooperation between our Development and Purchase departments proved to be efficient. Premium Beauty News - Is there a risk that environmental concerns do not survive difficult economic times? Philippe de Brugière - On the contrary I think that environmental concerns will be reinforced by the crisis. I am going to be iconoclastic but we do no longer make packaging for the pleasure of making packaging. We merely seek to preserve our products together with the environment. We have seized the growing interest in sustainable development as an opportunity to launch several initiatives that would have been longer to develop otherwise, but we are not going it alone. The important, is to be able to make a smart selection between all the options, to sort good and bad ones, to find the right partners, who will cooperatively and proactively explore a new direction. Eco-design is now a full part of our projects development process. Premium Beauty News - What is your supply policy with regard to ""full service"" opportunities proposed by some suppliers? Philippe de Brugière -L'Occitane is producing a wide variety of products in its manufacturing facility in Manosque, using a range of processes. In particular, we produce everything linked to essential oils, it's our core business. The plant's capacity is always growing. At the same time, research needs to be more and more specialized, and investments in state-of-the-art processes are required. Over the latest years we have developed industrial partnerships with companies offering specialised know-how or technologies and complying with our quality insurance requirements and our brand's values. As far as we are concerned, full service is not an externalisation strategy, its added value for our brand and the company's know-how. It's exactly the philosophy that lays behind the launch of 'L'Occitane do Brasil' this year, the first sun care range with 100% mineral filters, which is made in Brazil using ingredients from the Amazon region and locally produced packaging."
Sothys: eco-responsible luxury and marketing reactivity in 2009,"Premium Beauty News - What have been the highlights of 2008 in terms of new launches and innovations for Sothys? Stéphanie du Chaxel - As far as Sothys is concerned, the outcome of 2008 is very positive. We have been exploring new areas with many innovations in the fields of cosmetic science, and communication, and also in packaging, including heavy research investments in eco-design for our new eco-friendly and organic line: Beauty Garden® by Sothys. It was a challenge for our marketing team to combine our image of elegance and originality, with the organic option of the line, and the company's eco-responsibility. Primary packaging are made of recyclable materials. Beyond that first step we also worked extensively on the design of secondary packaging, using a lightened cardboard that is sourced from sustainably managed forests, vegetable inks for the printing, and designing the box so as we can mark instructions of use on its reverse side… As a result, we have achieved full consistency between the packaging, the brand's aesthetical values and the environmental expectations of consumers. Premium Beauty News - Forecasts for the year 2009 are not very optimistic. Within such a context, what is your message to the supply side? Stéphanie du Chaxel - In such a particular economical environment, sales forecasts become a key component of the management of projects. We therefore expect high levels of responsiveness from our suppliers, so as they can adjust to necessary corrections. Reactive and reliable suppliers, being able to propose a real partnership during these harsh times while addressing tomorrow's key issues, will stand out from the mass. Premium Beauty News - The volatility of raw materials prices does not simplify your daily business. Stéphanie du Chaxel - That's true, in particular because our retail price policy cannot change at the same pace as the prices of raw materials. The only advantage of this situation is that marketing and development teams, now have strong incentives to analyse and optimize value and costs, in cooperation with our Department of internal method and our suppliers. Premium Beauty News - Will environmental concerns survive difficult economic times? Stéphanie du Chaxel - As far as Sothys is concerned, sustainable development is not superficial window-dressing but a deeply rooted commitment. Mr Bernard Mas, Sothys' chairman founder, explains recently explained for our company sustainable development is ""the conceptualisation of values that we already put into practice in 1970, when we make the bet to develop worldwide a family-owned company based in provincial France"". [1] Our commitment goes far beyond the creation of a botanic garden [Jardins Sothys, editor's note] and our daily efforts to preserve the environment through our manufacturing practices that comply with ISO9001, OHSAS and GMP standards. Indeed, eco-design is at the very heart of our marketing strategy. The latest illustration is the creation of the C Renewal System TM line. For this high technology and high-end line with elegant graphic specifications, we also worked extensively to lighten cardboards' weight. Premium Beauty News - Owners of luxury brands are apparently modifying their supply policy with regard to ""full service"". What about Sothys? Stéphanie du Chaxel - Full-service is something we scarcely use. There are two main reasons for that. The first one is that we focus on the control of our supply sources, with strengthened quality controls, as per the company's stringent specifications. The second is that, in compliance with the sustainable development principles, we think it is important to rely on our own local staff than making the choice of external suppliers in France or abroad."
"The BeautyFULL club: only the industry, but all the industry","Premium Beauty News - You seem to be optimistic regarding the BeautyFULL Club and its development in 2009? Charles-Emmanuel Gounod - Yes, I am. Only six months after its launch, our association, which aims at gathering leaders from the entire health-and-beauty industry, from the producers of perfumed components and cosmetic ingredients to final retailers, through manufacturers of packaging and finished products, is totalling more than sixty members. It's a very encouraging figure. Premium Beauty News - What is the main reason for this success? Charles-Emmanuel Gounod - I think there are many reasons for it but, one thing is certain, the BeautyFULL Club's vocation to gather all the industry in order to work on common issues is addressing a real need. Whether your name is Intercos, L'Occitane, Kurz or Sothys, Clarins, or Guerlain, the need to share the work on some common issues has become evident. More specifically, I'm thinking about everything linked to environmental concerns, to counterfeiting or professional training. It's no longer possible to go it alone, with the risk to miss a key factor within the industry and with the subsequent risk that all the energy invested in a project be slashed by such a lack of connection with other concerned people. That's the philosophy under the work made by our Environment Working Group, which is chaired by RPC's Gérald Martines. Additional working groups are being created and will be operative in 2009. Premium Beauty News - What about the Club's actions so far? Charles-Emmanuel Gounod - I just mentioned the working groups, some of them are starting producing results, and we are finishing to set up the others. We also launched a monthly newsletter that is informing our members about the progression of our actions. And we just debuted our monthly business breakfasts successfully. The first edition was fully-booked, and we were delighted with the presentations made by Jean-Louis Matthiez, a product development consultant, about innovation, and by Attorney Matthieu Bourgeois, about recent evolutions regarding intellectual property rights. This kind of informative meetings perfectly matches with our members' needs. Our website, which will make the link between our members, is being created and will be functional during the first months of 2009. Next February, we'll invite the BeautyFULL Club members and all those interested in our activities to join us on the occasion of business lunch in Paris, with the participation of the leading industry players. The lunch will be the occasion to debate about development opportunities for the perfumes and cosmetics industry. Eventually, with the help of our Vice-President, Thierry Lucereau, we are cooperating with the leading trade events worldwide. I'd like to thanks Aurelian de Sanctis, chief executive officer at Sogecos, the organiser of Cosmoprof, Nathalie Grosdidier, Luxe Pack general manager, and David Bondi, president of ITEC France, the organizer of Beyond Beauty Paris. Premium Beauty News - How many new members do you expect in 2009? Charles-Emmanuel Gounod - Actually we do not have specific targets in this matter. However, if we want the BeautyFULL Club to be influential and representative of the industry, it's clear that we need more than a handful. A hundred members is a target that is both reasonable and realistic, considering the level of ""influence"" we want to reach. The most important is that the BeautyFULL Club be representative of the industry's common interest. It's important also to note that the Club is bound to be international. That's the reason why we'll participate in the leading trade events worldwide. It's also why we are working at the very next opening of the BeautyFULL Club's North American branch. Premium Beauty News - Economic forecasts are not very positive for 2009? In such a context, what do you have to say to the health and beauty industry? Charles-Emmanuel Gounod - I do not want to appear as a presumptuous person but I think that the right message is very simple. It's true that next months will be harsh. Precisely, the Club can help to solve a large amount of problems. Talking and working together on important issues, for the common interest of the whole industry: what is more exciting?"

"Enjoying nature could lower inflammation levels, scientists say","Numerous studies have highlighted the beneficial effects of contact with nature and green spaces on physical and mental health and even creativity. New research, conducted by scientists at Cornell University in the United States [1], highlights a new advantage. The study reports that frequent positive contact with nature is associated with lower levels of systemic inflammation. To reach this conclusion, Prof. Anthony D. Ong's team analyzed data from 1,244 participants. They were asked not only about the frequency of their exposure to nature, but also about the quality of their contact with these green spaces. ""It's not just about how often people spend time outdoors, but also the quality of their experiences,"" said Professor Ong, quoted in a news release. The results showed that people who reported more frequent pleasant encounters with nature had lower levels of inflammation. Specifically, participants were tested on three biomarkers, interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen. Elevated levels of these proteins indicate the presence of systemic inflammation. ""By focusing on these inflammation markers, the study provides a biological explanation for why nature might improve health,"" Ong said, ""particularly showing how it might prevent or manage diseases linked to chronic inflammation, like heart disease and diabetes."" ""Even when controlling for other variables such as demographics, health behaviors, medication and general well-being, Ong said his team found that reduced levels of inflammation were consistently associated with more frequent positive contact with nature,"" the study news release reports. ""And it's this sort of nexus of exposure and experience: It's only when you have both, when you are engaging and taking the enjoyment out of it, that you see these benefits,"" adds Professor Ong. ""These findings lay the groundwork for future investigations exploring the complex interplay between emotions, health, and the natural environment. Integrating regular contact with nature into daily experience may provide a potent means of promoting public health and fostering resilience amid the myriad challenges of modern life,"" the scientists conclude in their paper."
PGP Glass reportedly in the running to acquire French glassmaker Verescence,"Apparently, Verescence is highly coveted! Stirling Square Capital, the British private equity fund who has owned the French luxury glassmaker since 2019, has entrusted Rothschild & Co with a sales mandate, as revealed by the Reorg website at the end of 2023, and the investment bank would have received at least four acquisition offers. According to L'Informé, the New York-based private equity fund One Rock Capital Partners, as well as two family offices, Teak Capital and the Safra family investment structure, would also be working on the project. But it was the identity of the fourth protagonist disclosed by the online media which caught all the attention! Inded, L'Informé unveiled that the Indian glassmaker PGP Glass, previously known as Piramal Glass, has also made an offer.

Demand for luxury goods drives perfume sales in Saudi Arabia,"Saudi Arabia's perfume market is expected to reach USD 3,374.72 million by 2032 (from USD 2,005.99 million in 2023) with a CAGR of 5.95% from 2024 to 2032, according to a recent report by ResearchAndMarkets.com [1]. International visitors and a growing local luxury market are forecast to drive increased sales in the country's perfume industry. The thriving tourism sector largely contributes to the market's dynamism. Saudi Arabia hosted over 100 million tourists in 2023. This included 27 million from overseas and over 79 million domestic travelers, as reported by the World Tourism Organization. International tourists are drawn to traditional Arabian fragrances, with their rich scents coming from a deep-rooted historical past. Now celebrated as a critical part of the luxury fragrance, they blend traditional elements like oud, musk, and rose. The global market is increasingly interested in their luxury distinctiveness and social media, high-profile collaborations and endorsements have expanded their appeal. On the other hand, locals embrace global brands. The growing population of Saudi Arabia (37.3 million inhabitants as of March 2024) continually increases the patron base for perfumes. The perfume market experiences persistent growth driven by diverse choices and a growing emphasis on self-care and indulgence. Many individuals are searching for luxury merchandise, and the high disposable earnings of many of them represent one of the essential factors catalyzing the demand for luxurious commodities in Saudi Arabia, including top-rate perfumes. Substantial internet usage has heightened client knowledge of perfumes in Saudi Arabia. The kingdom boasts the highest proportion of active social media users across platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter. DataReportal states that during January 2023, 29.10 million social media customers were active, representing 79.3% of the population. As of early 2023, there were 42.5 million active mobile cellular connections, 115.9% of the population. Arabian beauty influencers are emerging as modern marketers in the Saudi Arabia perfume market by leveraging their social media presence. Saudi Arabian media figure Sara Murad entered the fray in 2023 by launching her perfume brand, By Sara Murad. As a self-proclaimed perfume enthusiast and MBC1 presenter, her debut fragrance, Black Oud, is a gender-neutral blend she describes as 'bold and intense.'"

Luxury industry: Chanel nears USD 20 billion in sales in 2023,"French luxury brand Chanel said Tuesday that its sales jumped last year to a record just shy of $20 billion, although profits only edged higher. Half of the group's turnover was achieved in the Asia-Pacific region, which has nevertheless posed many challenges for luxury brands in recent years. Sales climbed by 14.6 percent to $19.7 billion last year, with double-digit growth across its fashion, fragrance and jewellery products. Meanwhile, net profits rose by three percent to $4.7 billion, a slowdown from the 14.3 percent profit growth registered in 2022. Global Chief Executive Officer Leena Nair said Chanel had made significant investments in research and development, expanded its retail distribution network and added staff to enable further growth. The 2023 financial results ""underline sustained investment in building the desirability of our brand, creating the ultimate luxury experience for our clients and supporting our people to grow and develop,"" she said. Since the third quarter of last year the luxury sector has seen growth slow in the key European and US markets, while China has disappointed. Privately-held Chanel doesn't provide a quarterly breakdown of its results, but chief financial officer Philippe Blondiaux said ""sales increased in each of our markets as retail teams continued to nourish relationships with our local clients, while also embracing the continued return of tourist travel around the world."" Chanel saw its sales in the Asia-Pacific region climb by 17.7 percent to more than $10 billion. The rise was even higher in Europe, at 18.8 percent, to $5.6 billion. But the growth was a slower 2.6 percent to $3.9 billion in Americas. Sales of the perfumes and beauty division were mainly driven by the makeup sector and sales at airports."

Young workers make no compromise about environmental responsibility,"Particularly conscious of environmental issue, young workers are far more attentive than their elders to their employer's environmental impact. This is reflected in the criteria they prioritize when looking for a job. A quarter of the Generation Z and Millennials polled in the latest edition of Deloitte's ""Gen Z and Millennial Survey"" said they had already researched a company's environmental impact and policies before applying for a job. More generally, some 70% of young working people say they place importance on environmental credentials and policies when looking for an employer [1]. Furthermore, young workers have a strong desire to be useful to society. For young people, working in a profession that goes against their value system is out of the question. That's why 20% of Generation Z and 19% of Millennials have already decided to change their job or sector of activity because of environmental concerns. Others plan to do so in the future to avoid a potential conflict of environmental ethics at work. Others prefer to act from within. Nearly half of Generation Z (54%) and Millennials (48%) say that they and their colleagues are pressuring their employer to take action on climate change and its impacts. This trend has been growing steadily since 2022: at the time, 48% of Gen Z and 43% of Millennials said they were doing so. The young professionals surveyed by Deloitte are not short of ideas on how their employers could take concrete action to help fight climate change. They would, for example, like employers to offer workers training to help them adopt more ecological behaviours in their daily lives, or to rethink their offices in line with climate issues. However, the young working people surveyed have the overall impression that their employers are taking the seriousness of the situation into account. In fact, 59% of Generation Z and 58% of Millennials feel that their employers are taking steps to address climate change."

Shiseido also recorded a small quarterly operating loss of 8.7 billion yen, due to exceptional charges linked to its plan to transform its Japanese operations. The plan, which was announced at the end of February, includes about 1,500 voluntary redundancies, or nearly 4%. of its global workforce. However, the group's sales increased by 3.9% over the period to 249.5 billion yen (nearly 1.5 billion euros). On a like-for-like basis, quarterly sales rose by almost 20% in Japan, by almost 17% in the EMEA (Europe, Africa and Middle East) zone and by more than 9% in the Americas. However, sales fell again slightly in China (-2.6%), the third consecutive quarter of decline in this key market for the group. Shiseido and other Japanese brands have been targeted by a boycott from Chinese consumers since last summer, following the release of treated water from the Fukushima nuclear power station in north-east Japan into the Pacific Ocean. The Chinese government has been highly critical of the start of this process, even though Tokyo and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) claim that it is harmless to the environment and human health. Beijing has suspended all Chinese imports of Japanese seafood since last August. Despite the context, Shiseido continues to expect a rebound in sales in China this year. ""The consumer pullback on Japanese products is now coming to an end, and the Business is on a steady path towards recovery,"" the group stated. For its part, the travel retail business (sales in airports and other duty-free outlets) remained sluggish in the first quarter. The sector continues to suffer the consequences of tighter regulations in China and South Korea. For 2024, Shiseido is still forecasting a net profit of 22 billion yen (+1.1% year-on-year) and sales of 1,000 billion yen (+2.8%). ""With respect to the outlook for our business environment, we expect positive impacts from several factors in the coming quarters, including a further acceleration of growth in the Japan, Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific Businesses and favorable foreign exchange translation due to the weaker yen. On the contrary, however, there are still uncertainties surrounding the business such as the delayed recovery in demand from and changing purchase behavior of Chinese consumers,"" the group explained. In a separate statement, Shiseido also said its former consumer cosmetics business, which is now called FineToday, plans to list on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Japanese group had sold this business in 2021 to the investment fund CVC for the equivalent of around 1.3 billion euros, while retaining a 20% minority stake in the new entity. According to sources close to the matter quoted by Bloomberg, CVC is targeting a market value of between 2 and 3 billion dollars for FineToday. A sale of the business to another investment fund or another cosmetics group is not ruled out either, according to the same sources."
Avon continues to negatively impact Natura &Co's profitability,"Avon's poor results continue to drag down the profitability of the Brazilian cosmetics giant. Indeed, the group's Q1-2024 losses widened due to falling sales at the Avon business. Natura &Co's consolidated net revenue reached BRL 6.1 billion in Q1-24, up 1.1% vs Q1-23 in constant currency (CC) and down 5.7% year-on-year (YoY) in Brazilian Reais (BRL). Q1-24 reported net loss widened to BRL 935 million, compared to a net loss of BRL 652 million in Q1-23. Strong results in Natura Brazil were offset by Avon Latam, which is still delivering soft top-line, with revenues down 11.3% in Brazil and 11.8% in Hispanic Latam. Furthermore, Avon International had a slow start in Q1 in terms of revenue, down by 4.7% YoY in CC. ""In Brazil, Avon still experienced headwinds impacting the top-line, but with an improving trend month over month, and we expect Avon's top-line to stabilize in the second half of the year. We also saw significant margin expansion in Peru and Colombia,"" said Fabio Barbosa, Group CEO of Natura &Co. ""Avon International had a slow start of the year, following a solid Q4 2023 profitability performance. The new management team took office in January and is working on simplifying the market, focusing on key countries, and enhancing our portfolio with superior promotional execution. We believe these steps are crucial to stabilize revenues and keep us on track to improve profitability,"" he added."

Stoelzle creates and decorates Charlotte Tilbury's perfume bottles (Puig),"Inspired by the six senses, Charlotte Tilbury's new fragrance collection is infused with emotion-boosting molecules. The line includes six scents – Love Frequency, Magic Energy, Calm Bliss, More Sex, Cosmic Power, and Joyphoria – created with IFF perfumers Anne Flipo, Juliette Karagueuzoglou, and Dominique Ropion. Barcelona's headquartered Puig Group entrusted Stoelzle for the production and decoration of the 100 ml glass bottles. The design of the bottles was inspired from 18th-century potions. The diamond-shaped cuts on each bottle echo the brand logo, creating a cohesive aesthetic. Each bottle mirrors the hues of gems such as morganite, ruby or aquamarine. The colours were meticulously crafted to evoke specific moods, with Joyphoria standing out in Charlotte Tilbury's signature rose gold with its metallic finish, managed by Stoelzle's UV decoration process. Stoelzle achieved the decoration of this unique set of bottles with a double UV hot stamping technique, showcasing the brand and fragrance names in rose gold. Holographic hot stamping added intricate details, with only the metallic version featuring hot stamping for decoration and screen-printing for names. ""Stoelzle's double hot stamping technique overcame the challenge of precise decoration alignment. To meet exacting standards, spray and hot stamping decorations were sealed with a hydro-based transparent spray,"" details the glassmaker in a statement. Adding the finishing touch, a medallion placed below the neck collar enhances the bottle design. Collaboration with suppliers led to innovative solutions ensuring precise placement, with specialized tooling developed for the Stoelzle team to install the medallion correctly. Meticulous attention during the initial hot stamping ensured perfect placement, aligning with the crimp for a flawless finish."
"Since Brexit, London has lost some of its shine as a shopping destination","Buoyed by big names in fashion such as Vivienne Westwood and Stella McCartney, London has nevertheless fallen out of favour with overseas visitors looking to combine a getaway with shopping. The removal of tax-free shopping after Brexit would be responsible. Whether it's a stroll through the designer boutiques of Regent Street, a trip to Harrods for an iconic shopping experience, or browsing in Covent Garden or Camden Market, London has long been known as a shopping hotspot. But since the Brexit agreement signed with the European Union on December 30, 2020, the British capital appears to be less of a destination for shoppers, at least for those from countries outside the European Union. Indeed, overseas shoppers have become accustomed to getting their designer handbags and garments tax-free. The disappearance of this tax refund possibility since Brexit, except in Northern Ireland, was already denounced last year by many major British luxury brands, who are seeing their foreign customers choosing other countries for their lavish shopping sprees. France, Italy and Spain are three countries that are increasingly being chosen by foreign travellers for their shopping trips. France and Italy are particularly desirable, with Paris and Milan the EU's undisputed shopping capitals. According to a report by Global Blue, a Swiss company offering tax-free services to international travellers, quoted by the Schengen Visa News website, some 162,000 tourists required compensation for VAT sales tax in the UK in 2019. Now, one-fifth of those tourists are taking advantage of rebates in the EU, where the tax break is still effective. An even greater shortfall for the UK since spending in the EU among the 34,000 visitors who have shifted their duty-free purchases outside the country averaged EUR 3,800 in 2023, a 31% increase compared to EUR 2,900 in 2019. The purchases were primarily made in France and Italy. In 33% of cases, they were made by travelers from the Middle East. Visitors from the US represent the second-largest group of visitors who combine travel with shopping (19%). The cliché of the Chinese traveller raiding French department stores is a thing of the past. Since the pandemic, far fewer Chinese tourists have been coming to Europe."

"The Estée Lauder Companies expects annual sales drop, despite Asia recovery","The US-based beauty giant has published results exceeding analysts' expectations in the third quarter of its 2024 fiscal year. However, the group maintained annual sales drop expectations despite return to growth in Asia. The Estée Lauder Companies reported net sales of USD 3.94 billion for its third quarter ended March 31, 2024, an increase of 5% from USD 3.75 billion in the prior-year period. On a comparable basis, net earnings per common share increased to USD .97, compared to USD .47 last year. Analysts had anticipated USD .50. ""For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we delivered our organic sales outlook, exceeded expectations for profitability and continued to improve working capital. La Mer, Estée Lauder, Jo Malone London, Le Labo, and The Ordinary led organic sales growth, driven by beloved hero products and highly sought innovation,"" said Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer in a statement. Organic net sales increased 6% primarily due to double-digit growth (+12%) in Europe, the Middle East & Africa and ""stronger sales"" in Asia travel retail. In the previous quarter, the group recorded a 10% decline in its turnover, due to a slower than expected recovery in Asia, and especially in China. The fiscal 2024 third quarter impact of business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East was $.01 dilutive to reported and adjusted net earnings per common share. Despite these better results, the group nevertheless reports ""ongoing macroeconomic headwinds"", including ""continued softness"" in overall prestige beauty in mainland China, and geopolitical volatility in some areas around the world. The group therefore forecasts annual organic sales would fall 1% to 2%, compared with its previous estimate of a 1% decrease to a 1% increase."
Lessonia: A plant-based emulsi-gelling agent for silicone-like feeling,"At in-cosmetics Global 2024, in Paris, the French manufacturer launched a new plant-based natural emulsi-gelling agent that is claimed ideal to formulate gel cream with silicone-like feeling. It offers a natural alternative to acrylate-based emulsifiers. This fully natural plant extract named Alter-Emulgel is ideal to formulate emulsion (oil / water) with the texture and feeling of a gel cream. When used at 1.3%, no co-emulsifier is needed. Depending on the oil percentage used, the emulsion's texture can be fluid (between 5% and 10%), light (between 10% and 20%) or rich (between 20% and 25%). Alter-Emulgel is therefore a perfect fit in emulsions targeting young demographics, and combination or oily skins. According to Lessonia, the bright white gel cream obtained with Alter-Emulgel offers a typical silicone-like feeling during application. ""In a sensorial study on a panel of experts, Alter-Emulgel showed a sensorial feeling similar and even better on certain parameters than emulsi-gelling agent based on acrylates,"" said Lessonia in a statement. Its sensory profile offers a very nice glide comfort with a quick penetration into the skin. After application, the study revealed an extreme softness with less sticky and oily effect. Alter-Emulgel also shows strong stability in the 3 to 6 pH variation range. According to Lessonia, it is compatible with the use of electrolytes, preservatives, ethanol. It is easy to use in formulation, solubilizing very easily in aqueous phases without the need for pre-dispersing. Unlike emulsifier-gelling agents on the market, it does not need to be combined with a co-emulsifier.

Eurofragance's sales increased by more than 20% in 2023,"The Barcelona-headquartered fragrance maker closed 2023 with sales of EUR 146 million, up more than 20% over 2022 on a like-for-like basis. All categories — fine fragrance, personal care, air care and home care — and all regions where the company operates experienced healthy growth. Strong growth was achieved in top countries such as the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Europe, which helped Eurofragance successfully reach its 2023 targets. India and Indonesia also contributed to these positive results. ""Each of our four main regions, IMEA, Asia Pacific, Europe and Turkey, along with Latam, played a significant role in attaining exceptional results by the end of 2023. Notably, increased sales in the strategically crucial Gulf region area had a substantial impact on our results,"" said Juan Ramón López Gil, CFO of Eurofragance. At the end of 2022, the fragrance house had announced the acquisition of PT Euronindo Fragrance in Indonesia. After having reassessed its operational presence in key strategic markets, Eurofragance said they aimed to reinforce their presence in the APAC region. In parallel, the company had divested itself from the U.S. market. ""The good results of 2023 come from a strategy carried through over several years, which has allowed us to focus both regionally and locally to determine where to bet and compete in new product categories, which represent new opportunities for us. And today, as we embark on a new strategic plan, we are emboldened to make organizational adjustments and reinvest some of our gains in strategic projects that will ensure the company's continued growth,"" adds Eurofragance's CEO Laurent Mercier. Eurofragance thus intends to continue its commitment to innovation and to keep on strengthening alliances with strategic AI partners to support processes, systems, fragrance-related technologies and new ways of working. Today, the company has two major initiatives in Artificial Intelligence to innovate in fragrance development, both of which require a significant level of resources. The first one, announced last year, is the collaboration with the French green-bio-deep-tech company Alphanosos with the aim to uncover new exclusive technologies to address unpleasant odors. And the second major project is to be revealed later in 2024. In addition, the fragrance house has strengthened its organization in terms of cybersecurity to mitigate risks and has developed a cybersecurity culture plan to raise employee awareness on this matter. Eventually, Eurofragance has just been recognized with EcoVadis' Platinum medal, the highest possible recognition from the provider of business sustainability ratings. ""This recent accomplishment encourages the company to push forwards with its sustainability agenda,"" concluded Eurofragance in a statement."

""Under his leadership, PCPC will increase its advocacy efforts to promote science-based public policies and promote the industry's commitment to innovative and sustainable cosmetics and personal care products, further enhancing consumer trust in the safety and quality of the products they use and rely on every day,"" the trade association stated."
US consumer confidence at lowest level since 2022: survey,"US consumers appear less optimistic about the jobs market and more worried about future financial conditions, bringing a closely watched confidence metric to its lowest level since July 2022, a survey showed Tuesday. The consumer confidence index fell to 97.0 in April, said The Conference Board, significantly below the 104.0 reading that analysts anticipated. This marks the third straight month consumer confidence has worsened, the report said, and comes as President Joe Biden struggles to boost perceptions about the economy as his reelection campaign ramps up. ""Consumers became less positive about the current labor market situation, and more concerned about future business conditions, job availability, and income,"" said Dana Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board. But she added that despite the slip, ""optimism about the present situation continues to more than offset concerns about the future."" The biggest worries surrounded ""elevated price levels, especially for food and gas,"" said Peterson. Meanwhile, politics and global conflicts were ""distant runners-up,"" she added. While consumers rated current business conditions ""positively,"" their views of the labor market weakened with more reporting that jobs are hard to get, said The Conference Board. Consumers also became less upbeat about their families' financial situations, both currently and in the future. When asked what spending they would cut back on to save money, consumers place discretionary purchases to the top—including food away from home, clothing/fashion items, entertainment away from home, and vacations. Meanwhile, fewer consumers plan to reduce spending on non-discretionary purchases like childcare, education, and health care. ""Perceptions about the labor market deteriorated even as job growth remains robust, and the unemployment rate is historically low,"" noted Rubeela Farooqi, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. ""A deteriorating trend in sentiment could persist,"" she cautioned.

L'Occitane stocks surge in Hong Kong after privatisation offer,"Shares in French skincare giant L'Occitane jumped almost 13 percent in Hong Kong on Tuesday as they resumed trading after its owner offered to take it private. Austrian billionnaire Reinold Geiger said he would buy back all the shares he does not own for nearly US$1.78 billion, the company said in a statement to the city's stock exchange on Monday night. The offer, submitted with the support of US private equity giant Blackstone, concerns nearly 28 percent of the shares. It values the company at around more than USD 6 billion. The firm soared as much as 12.9 percent to HK$33.30 in the morning before paring the gains. The offer price of HK$34 per share was a 15.25 percent premium to its closing price of HK$29.50 when the company halted trading three weeks ago ahead of the offer. Privatisation would free the company ""from the pressures of the capital markets' expectations, regulatory costs and disclosure obligations, share price fluctuations, and sensitivity to short-term market and investor sentiment,"" the company said in the announcement. Geiger believed significant further investment in marketing would be necessary to invigorate the brand's shares in increasingly competitive markets, citing pressure from weakening consumer sentiment and rising rivalry from local brands in China, the company's second-largest market. L'Occitane International in September rejected an offer from Geiger's investment holding company, L'Occitane Group, which at the time owned more than 72 percent of the firm. Founded in France's southern region of Provence in 1976, the luxury cosmetics retailer listed in Hong Kong in 2010. The group's portfolio includes the brands L'Occitane en Provence, L'Occitane au Brasil, Melvita, Erborian, Sol de Janeiro, Dr. Vranjes Firenze and Elemis. Its share price peaked in 2022 at HK$32.45 ($4.14), more than double its IPO price."

TNT Group creates an astonishing collection of four caps for Binaurale,"The French supplier of high end packaging components, and leader in zamak transformation for perfumery, has worked closely with Binaurale's ownership to create the imaginative globe caps of this fresh, new brand. Binaurale was conceptualized in Miami by husband and wife, Arielle and Jack, a duo with backgrounds in fragrance and design. The collection includes four different scents brought to life in collaboration with Jérôme Epinette and Clément Marx, perfumers at Robertet. Each fragrance has a unique cap that tells a story. The two founders provided TNT Group with 3D files detailing the desired characteristics of the cap such as the areas of the continents in relief and the curves of the coastlines. TNT GROUP engineers were then able to convert the 3D designs into technical files for industrialization, including tooling and production. For TNT Group, the three challenges were finding a way to unmold the caps, minimizing the mold seams, and achieving the 3 color decor on an industrial scale. Engineering and innovation contributed to this amazing project."

P&G profits rise despite hit from Middle East tensions and slowdown in China,"Procter & Gamble reported higher profits Friday, citing strong demand in the United States and many European markets that offset weakness elsewhere due to Middle East tensions and a lackluster performance in China. P&G — the consumer products giant that makes Tide detergent, Bounty paper towel and Gillette razors, among many others — had flat volume in the just-completed quarter but a three percent rise in price that helped produce a slight increase in overall sales. ""We delivered solid sales and strong earnings growth in the third quarter despite multiple headwinds, enabling us to raise our EPS growth guidance and maintain our top-line outlook for the fiscal year,"" said Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. In the beauty segment, organic sales increased three percent versus year ago. Skin and personal care organic sales declined low single digits due to lower sales of the super-premium SK-II brand, partially offset by volume growth from innovation in personal care. Hair care organic sales increased high single digits driven by increased pricing in Latin America, Europe and North America. Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten described consumption as ""very strong"" in the United States and in leading European markets. But he said sales in the Middle East were pressured by conflict in the region, while China sales were down 10 percent, excluding the effect of currency changes and acquisition. Profits in the quarter rose 11 percent to $3.8 billion, while revenues increased one percent to $20.2 billion. The rise is entirely due to price increases, while sales volumes remained stable. Prices were up 3% on average across all divisions, and even increased by 10% in the personal care division. Despite price hikes over the last few years, ""consumers are not trading down within the US,"" he said, arguing that shoppers stick with known products because of reliability. In China, Schulten noted ""weak underlying market conditions"" as well as lagging sales of SK-II premium skin care, which has been affected by anti-Japan sentiment. Schulten said the company has nevertheless seen some improvement in the world's second biggest economy, but that it will take another quarter or two for sales to return to growth. Volume trends in several markets including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey ""have remained soft since the start of the heightened tensions in the Middle East,"" Schulten said."

How and when to back a viral trend: WGSN launches TikTok Analytics,"Genuine trend or just trending this week? A fad to test or a product to invest in? Navigating all the trends on TikTok can be overwhelming. In order to help brands find their way in today's fast-paced digital world, where there is an endless stream of aesthetics going viral on the platform, trend forecaster WGSN launches a new trends forecasting service dubbed TikTok Analytics. The new service is based on a new methodology that combines data analytics, expert insight and WGSN's signature STEPIC model to ensure brands cut out ""the noise"" and identify the trends that matter. According to WGSN, it allows to go beyond views and virality. The trend forecaster's approach identifies the TikTok trends that matter by analysing their health, strength, and stability in the context of their macro forecasts. This enables WGSN to predict the lifespan of a trend, anticipate what will come next, and identify any risks to avoid. By doing so, brands can incorporate trends into their long-term product and marketing strategies and avoid the short-term reactive approach. ""No more TikTok FOMO. Instead of jumping from trend to trend, decision-makers can confidently stay ahead of whatever the algorithm throws at them, and eliminate the anxiety around keeping up with every trend,"" says WGSN. Indeed, trends on TikTok don't just spring from nowhere, WGSN deems. Moreover, they aren't as 'fast' as people assume. By framing the trends within proprietary macro forecasts, WGSN intends to deliver a contextualised view and to provide prediction on where each trend will go next. ""In the hyper competitive beauty market, identifying fad vs trend is essential. With our truly unique, ground-breaking TikTok Analytics forecasts no brand needs to waste time nor investment on here-today-gone-tomorrow product fads, and instead can get ahead of the market with the trends that will really change the bottom line,"" highlights Carla Buzasi, CEO of WGSN."

Trends: 'Doll makeup' combines a light touch on complexion with sweet accents,"After the success of ""berry makeup"" and ""chrome makeup"" looks, ""doll makeup"" is gaining in popularity among beauty enthusiasts. The trend has become increasingly popular on social media ever since singer and actress Sabrina Carpenter adopted it. Her coquettish, girly makeup looks in pink tones have captured the attention of internet users, making it one of the strongest trends on TikTok in recent weeks. 'Doll makeup' is all about reproducing the look of a doll's face with makeup while reducing the use of cosmetic products to adopt a lighter beauty routine. All with a view to achieving the most naturally glowing skin. Fresh, natural and easy to apply, this light approach to makeup is perfect for the return of warm weather in the northern hemisphere. Although blush is the star of this beauty routine, as it gives that doll-like look, highlighter and white pencil, applied under the eyes, are also essential. Unlike other makeup techniques that focus more on contouring, the aim here is not to define the angles of the face, but rather to create the illusion of a rounded face. Meanwhile, when it comes to the complexion, it's best to opt for a fairly light foundation to create a ""glowy"" look. Lips are the final step in creating a doll-like makeup look. Using a pinkish lip pencil will enable to outline the mouth. Eventually, applying gloss as a finishing touch will your lips a plumping effect. With its simplicity, freshness and playfulness, 'doll makeup' is finally moving away from the more bolded trends that marked last summer, such as the ""espresso makeup"" look or the ""strawberry makeup"" look, the latter being characterized by pronounced blush, glossy lips, sculpted eyebrows and, above all, visible freckles on the nose."
Evonik partners with Jland Biotech in vegan collagen for cosmetic applications,"In a new strategic move to expand their collagen platform, Evonik's Venture Capital arm has invested in Jland Biotech, a company dedicated to developing and manufacturing non-animal-derived collagen.

Evonik recently launched its own vegan collagen Vecollage Fortify L for cosmetic and personal care applications. The new collagen products, manufactured in collaboration with Jland, will be launched later this year. ""Evonik's life sciences division is using its biotechnology platform to leverage the expertise of its partners and collaborate on precision biosolutions. We welcome Jland to our partner network,"" said Johann-Caspar Gammelin, President of the Nutrition & Care division.

Collagen can be used as a bioactive in cosmetic and personal care applications to improve elasticity and hydration in the skin. Vegan collagen is of particular interest for formulators developing cosmeceuticals that are effective in the deep layers of the skin.

Fermentation-based collagen also has low immunogenicity and batch-to-batch variability and is highly reproducible."
Spanish fashion and beauty house Puig announces IPO,"Spanish fashion group Puig, which owns the Nina Ricci, Paco Rabanne, Charlotte Tilbury or Byredo and has a controlling interest in Jean Paul Gaultier labels, on Monday said it was planning to float its shares on the local stock market. Puig ""announces its intention to proceed with the initial public offering (IPO)"" with a view to being listed on the Madrid stock exchange, said a statement from the Barcelona-based family-owned group that specialises in perfumes and cosmetics. The aim was to raise an initial 1.25 billion euros through newly-issued shares after which it would make a ""larger secondary offering"" of existing shares held by its holding company Exea. This second step could allow Puig to raise an amount ""higher"" than the issue of new shares and would therefore bring the total fundraising worth of 2.5 billion euros. Following the IPO, the Puig family will retain a majority stake in the company and the ""vast"" majority of voting rights, the group added. According to analysts, this IPO would value the Catalan group at nearly 10 billion euros.

AI vs humans: influencers face competition from virtual models,"Social media influencers have embraced artificial intelligence to spice up their content but they are also facing growing competition from AI-generated Instagramers, TikTokers and YouTubers. Sporting pink hair and posing in lingerie, swimsuits or gym outfits, Aitana Lopez has more than 300,000 followers on Instagram where she is described as a ""gamer at heart"" and ""fitness lover"" — except she's not real. Aitana was created by The Clueless, a Barcelona-based company that describes itself as an ""AI modeling agency"" run by ""visionaries on a mission to redefine the world of influencers"". Sofia Novales, project manager at The Clueless, said the ""rising costs associated with human influencers"" was a reason behind the company's creation. ""Virtual models, being digital, present a more economical alternative,"" Novales said. The influencer market whets appetites. Indeed, it is expected to grow rapidly, from $16.5 billion in 2022 to nearly $200 billion by 2032, according to Allied Market Research. Other ""advantages lie in unparalleled creative control, allowing seamless decision-making on image, fashion, and aesthetics without the need for physical photoshoots,"" Novales added. However, the rise of AI has fuelled concerns about the proliferation of deepfake videos that could be used maliciously. Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, said Friday it would start putting ""Made with AI labels"" on AI-generated content in May. Using virtual influencers is not new: Barbie already has millions of followers on Instagram. But they are now being used in advertisements where they can't be told apart from a real person. Take Lil Miquela, a ""19-year-old Robot living in LA"" created by a California agency in 2016. With 2.6 million followers on Instagram and 3.5 million on TikTok, Lil Maqueta has promoted brands as big as BMW. The idea was to ""create something never seen before,"" the German premium carmaker said in a statement to AFP. ""Attracting a younger, technology-savvy generation is for us the icing on the cake,"" it said. Maud Lejeune, who heads up the Paris-based digital strategy agency AD Crew, said that it isn't difficult for the public to accept AI influencers. ""It's like actors on TV: we know it isn't real yet we follow them and we find it interesting, it's like watching a mini-series."" Human influencers are also seizing on AI technology to make better videos. France's Charles Sterlings sees an opportunity to improve translations. He uses different tools on platforms like HeyGen and Rask.ai to automatically translate and lip-sync his video posts into English and Spanish. Sterlings also uses Deepshot, a platform that allows users to create deepfakes by changing the words and mouth movement of people in real videos. But Sterlings sees the technology as a competitor as well as a useful tool. ""Anyone with a phone can be an influencer. But eventually, it will be artificial intelligence, available 24 hours a day, and much cheaper to develop,"" he said. For Maud Lejeune, AI can help influencers produce more content. ""It's tough to put yourself in front of the camera for a long time and certain creators burn out... Maybe AI will provide a new way to create without exposing oneself,"" she said. The Clueless has no qualms about its AI models taking away business from real influencers. ""We don't foresee real models becoming obsolete or replaced by AI-generated models like Aitana,"" said Novales. ""In our view, they can coexist as another competition of the industry."""

""The weekly podcast audience (34%) has more than doubled from 15% in 2017."" This increase may be linked to the surge in female podcast audiences, as the study points out. ""From 2020 to 2023, female monthly podcast reach remained in the mid to upper 30% range. This year, female monthly podcast reach surged +15% from 39% in 2023 to 45% this year,"" the research states. Women now listen to almost as many podcasts as men, 48% of whom listen every month. Women also listen to more programs than men. Men listen to 7.2 podcasts a week, compared with 9.5 for women. On average, listeners follow 8.3 podcasts every week. All in all, more than eight in ten Americans (84%), or 241 million people, are familiar with the term podcasting in 2024, compared to 60% in 2017. Two-thirds (67%), or 192 million, have ever listened to a podcast, according to Edison Research, up 68% on 2017. At the time, 40% of Americans had ever listened to a podcast."
Monogram Capital Partners acquires majority stake in Tru Fragrance & Beauty,"Monogram Capital Partners, a Los Angeles-based private equity firm that invests in consumer brands and services companies, has acquired a majority stake in Tru Fragrance & Beauty, a beauty brand builder whose portfolio includes owned, licensed, and exclusive fragrance and beauty brands sold to national beauty and apparel retailers and direct to consumers. The partnership builds on Tru's growth over the past three years, during which the company's owned brands doubled the company's revenue. Driven by a suite of fragranced lifestyle brands that include Le Monde Gourmand, a Gen-Z favorite which recently launched in 700 Ulta doors and on Ulta.com, as well as with ASOS in the UK; fragrance-as-wellness brand Lake & Skye; and licensed perfumes and colognes with Yellowstone and Wrangler, Tru's portfolio has focused on clean and differentiated formulations and community-driven marketing to capitalize on strong tailwinds in the fragrance market. Founded in 1969 and acquired by current executives in 2004, Tru Fragrance & Beauty operates out of Willowbrook, IL and New York City. In addition to the company's branded portfolio Tru also develops fragrance brands exclusively for retail partners. Tru represents Monogram's seventh investment in the beauty space in the past five years. Monogram's other beauty investments include Beach House Group, D.S. & Durga, Foundry, Live Tinted, Violette_FR, and Prime Matter Labs, a contract manufacturer. Monogam's investment is intended to accelerate Tru's growth and scale, supporting expanded distribution in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Europe, and beyond, launching new brands and licensing relationships, bringing synergistic brand marketing and operational resources, and fostering a continued focus on talent development and complementary acquisitions. Tru's Executive Chairman Monte Henige shared, ""Our partnership with Monogram is not a culmination but a furtherance of our vision and mission, affirming our talent-driven culture and positioning us for even greater success."" Eric Bilenko, Tru's Chief Executive Officer, continued, ""Monogram's expertise in identifying and growing innovative consumer brands bolsters our own approach to best-in-class consumer experiences in the fragrance and beauty space. We look forward to building on our platform through accelerated growth of our own brands, the launch of new brands, and the addition of strategic acquisitions, leveraging Monogram's extensive experience in each of these key areas."" Oliver Nordlinger, Monogram Co-Founder & Partner, added, ""We're incredibly excited to partner with Monte, Eric, and the rest of the Tru team to build on their impressive momentum. We believe Tru is differentiated not only in its ability to identify and build brands around whitespace opportunities but also in its nimble and sophisticated global supply chain and exceptional company culture. Whether it's by expanding distribution of existing brands, launching new owned or licensed brands or making strategic brand acquisitions, we expect Tru's growth to only accelerate from here."""

Shoppers Drug Mart to recycle the packaging of its private label beauty brand,"Canada's drugstore chain Shoppers Drug Mart (known as Pharmaprix in Quebec) has announced the launch of a recycling program dedicated to its Quo Beauty cosmetics line. Based on a partnership with TerraCycle, the new program offers customers the possibility to recycle empty Quo Beauty cosmetics components and keep plastic packaging from going to landfills and incinerators. This partnership with TerraCycle comes less than a year after the launch of ""More Planet Love"" by Quo Beauty which includes over 500 products with more sustainable packaging, using recycled plastics, mono-materials, and reduced plastic packaging. In addition, for each pound of cosmetics waste shipped in through the recycling program, $1 will be donated to Shoppers Foundation for Women's Health. ""As we work to ensure all control brand packaging is recyclable or reusable by 2025, we continue to look for new and innovative ways to eliminate the use of single-us plastics for all product packaging,"" says Pat Dean, SVP, Category Management, Shoppers Drug Mart. Plastic and glass tubes, pots, pumps, sprays, and jars, lipstick, lip balm, lip gloss tubes, and wands, mascara tubes and wands, eyeliner pencils and components, eyeshadow and bronzer components, foundation packaging, powder components, concealer tubes and sticks, are all eligible for recycling. However, nail polish bottles, nail polish remover bottles, makeup wipes and sponges, makeup brushes, and pressurized canisters (including aerosol cans) will not be accepted through this program. ""The majority of cosmetic products are not accepted by curbside recycling services due to their complex, multilayer packaging, which often includes small components such as wands, pumps, and caps that slip through the sorting machinery at recycling facilities,"" said Tom Szaky, TerraCycle founder and CEO. ""As the first major retailer in Canada to create a free recycling program for their own private-label beauty brand, Shoppers Drug Mart is setting a great example for the beauty industry."" At the end of January, Shoppers Drug Mart also announced that it would stop using single-use plastic shopping bags in all its stores across Canada."
China's Temu drops ad campaign in Europe over personal data use fears,"Chinese online marketplace Temu said Saturday it would drop an advertising offer in which clients could gain vouchers in exchange for surrendering their personal data for an indefinite period. The campaign, launched this month in England and later in France, promised vouchers of up to 100 euros if a client downloaded the Temu shopping app and invited another person to sign up. But the terms of the offer state that Temu is granted the right to use for life, and without notice, much of a client's personal data. British news site The Independent reported this week that the terms specified the use of ""photo, name likeness, voice, opinions, statements, biographical information, and/or hometown and state for promotional or advertising purposes in any media worldwide"". Temu, part of Chinese low-price retailer Pinduoduo, said in a statement to AFP that its offer had been a ""great success in France, with numerous satisfied clients"". Nevertheless it had been halted in both France and Britain because of ""misunderstandings on the extent of client data use"". Temu said it had only involved ""user names and profile pictures"". It did not respond to requests on whether the promotional offer was being used in other countries. ""Temu is committed to client confidentiality,"" it said. ""We do not and will not sell client data."" Earlier this month, Temu's parent Pinduoduo, a main competitor of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, reported a 90-percent surge in net profit for 2023, to 60 billion yuan (USD 8.3 billion)."
Beautycounter breaks into fragrance with full ingredient disclosure,"California-based clean beauty brand Beautycounter has announced its foray into the fragrance category with the launch of Clean Eau De Parfum, a collection of five new scents: Miles Away, Sun Spill, Hyper Rose, Second Skin, and Pacific Dreams. The collection is available for purchase through Beautycounter.com, in Beautycounter brick and mortar stores, and through their community of independent ""Advocates"". With this five-unit line, the brand intends to fill a blank space in the clean beauty market. As with the brand's other products, the ingredients used in the new formulas have been thoroughly vetted. Beautycounter explains that each ingredient was reviewed across 23 health and environmental endpoints. Created by Robertet Group's perfumer Clément Marx, all five scents are EWG Verified, Leaping Bunny certified, and tested to be safe for sensitive skin. Furthermore, Beautycounter has chosen to disclose the full list of ingredients substances making up its fragrances. With the launch of the Clean Eau De Parfum collection, Beautycounter is focused on closing what they call the ""fragrance loophole"", a legal provision that allows companies not to disclose the ingredients used to make a scent and instead to label their products with generic terms such as ""fragrance"" or ""parfum."" ""The current industry practice prevents consumers from being informed about what they're putting on their bodies,"" said Beautycounter in a statement. A similar move was already made five years ago by Hollywood actress Michelle Pfeiffer with the launch of her Henry Rose fragrance brand. Looking ahead, the brand plans to mobilize its community and travel to Washington D.C. in May of this year, to lobby Congress to close the ""fragrance loophole"" and support the larger Safer Beauty Bill package introduced by Rep. Jan Schakowsky (IL), a suite of four bills that address issues Beautycounter has been vocal about: the need for more supply chain transparency, banning the most harmful ingredients—like PFAS— and explicit protections for overexposed communities including women of color."
European firms falling behind in climate transition targets: report,"Four out of five European companies are not cutting their carbon emissions at the pace or scale necessary to meet the EU's climate targets, according to a report released Tuesday. The cost of adaptation is one factor holding back businesses, despite 20 percent expecting to lose customers to more climate-friendly competitors, the report by non-profit Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and management consulting firm Oliver Wyman found. While many firms have adopted transitions plans they ""are struggling to change their business models at the pace and scale required,"" James Davis, partner at Oliver Wyman, said in a statement. A key challenge, he added, is ""green business models are typically less attractive and riskier than the existing ones they seek to replace."" But to meet the EU's targets to cut emissions by 55 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels ""the need to significantly accelerate efforts could not be clearer"", the report stated. Its findings were based on an analysis of 1,600 European companies, including those in the United Kingdom, representing 89 percent of the continent's market capitalisation. Insufficient investment, including access to capital, was the main hindrance to a more rapid transition. Less than a quarter of capital expenditure was being dedicated to projects aligned with their transition plan or European criteria for the environmental performance of economic activities within the bloc. At the same time, ""government policy has not yet shifted the economic landscape decisively enough in favour of greener products and services"" and could offer more support to certain sectors, the report said. For European electricity companies already facing a shortfall in funding to replace oil and coal generation with renewables ""this investment gap would widen to 285 billion euros by 2030"". Greater collaboration across the financial sector was needed to spread risk between the many players from banks to philanthropic organisations involved in the green transition, the report said."

Sephora to exit South Korea after more than 4 years in the country,"In a statement posted on Sephora Korea's social media accounts, the LVMH-owned prestige beauty retailer said it would gradually terminate all its online and offline operations in the country. Sephora launched in Korea in 2019 with a flagship in the Parnas Mall located in upscale Gangnam District in south Seoul. However, the company's development plans were thwarted by the Covid-19 pandemic and strong local competition. Other international retailers like Watsons and Boots have also struggled in this very specific market dominated by CJ Olive Young, which operates over 1,300 stores in the nation and sells a mix of mass and prestige products. Sephora Korea currently has five physical stores in Korea, in addition to its online operations. The company will start closing its operations on May 6. Sephora said its customer service team in Korea will continue operating until mid-August for returns and refunds."

Prestige retailer Douglas Group shares drop after stock market return,"Europe's leading prestige beauty retailer, Douglas Group, suffered a disappointing stock market return on Thursday March 21 in Frankfurt. After ten years of absence, the group decided to come back to the stock exchange with the aim to reduce its debt. Douglas priced its initial public offering (IPO) at 26 euros (US$28.3) per share on Tuesday. The stock opened at 25.50 euros on Thursday and cost 23.06 euros at the end of the day, a good eleven percent less than the issue price, which was already at the lower end of the issue range of up to 30 euros. Based on this price of 23.06 euros, the Düsseldorf-headquartered company, would be priced at a valued of around 2.5 billion euros. ""The deleveraging associated with the IPO will increase our financial flexibility and provide additional support for our successful development,"" Douglas Chief Executive Sander van der Laan said earlier this month. Shares of the Douglas group were withdrawn from the Stock Exchange in 2013 by its co-owners at the time, the Advent fund and the Kreke family. In 2015, the group was sold to CVC Capital Partners, another private equity fund, which was holding 84% of the shares before the IPO. The free float now stands at around 32%, with CVC Capital Partners and the Kreke family holding 54.4% and 10.2% of the shares, respectively. The two private owners have also committed to injecting around 300 million euros to bolster the group's balance sheet. The group, which sells perfumes, skincare and makeup products in around 1,850 stores in 22 European countries, through brands such as Douglas, Nocibé, parfumdreams and Niche Beauty, closed nearly 20% of its stores in 2021 to strengthen its online sales activity. In the 2022/23 financial year, Douglas generated sales of 4.1 billion euros, an increase of 12.1%, and a net profit of 17 million euros after several years of heavy losses. The company's goal is to reach the 5 billion sales mark by 2026. The group has launched a program to develop and expand its store network. By the end of the financial year 2025/26, Douglas plans to add more than 200 stores to its portfolio, and more than 400 stores are set to be upgraded or refurbished."
Swedish pharmacy chain limits sales of skincare products to minors,"One of Sweden's main pharmacy chains, Apotek Hjartat, said Thursday it was limiting sales of certain skincare products to those under 15 in order to combat unhealthy beauty standards for youth. ""Today there is an unhealthy and unnecessary use of advanced skincare products among young people and we want to be a voice that says stop,"" Monika Magnusson, CEO of Apotek Hjartat, said in an email to AFP. ""As a major retailer of skincare products and as a pharmacy we want to take responsibility for the use of skin care according to need,"" Magnusson added. Inspired by influencers on social media networks, more and more children, some as young as 10, are turning to anti-ageing products, according to the company. ""As one of the links in the healthcare chain and a retailer of skincare products, Apotek Hjartat is concerned about the growing trend of children using, or being encouraged to use, advanced skincare products,"" the company said in a statement. The products in question, most of which are anti-aging products, are listed on the pharmaceutical group's website. They include products with AHAs (alpha hydroxy acids), BHAs (beta hydroxy acids), vitamin A and vitamin C. To purchase these products, customers must be at least 15 years old, have permission from their parents or be able to produce a medical certificate justifying their use. Annika Svedberg, chief pharmacist at Apotek Hjartat, stressed the importance of choosing skincare products based on needs, not beauty ideals. ""Skin care needs are highly individual and depend on skin type and condition, not age,"" she said in a statement. ""Using products aimed at reducing wrinkles and evening out skin tone is not something a child needs."" The age limit is currently being rolled out, both online and in Apotek Hjartat's some 390 pharmacies in Sweden. ""We hope that this age limit will make more people stop and reflect, and that it can lead to important conversations between parents, within families and in society, around ideals and norms,"" Magnusson said."

Fashion designer Dries Van Noten to step down,"The feted Belgian designer Dries Van Noten will step down as creative director of his fashion label this summer, he announced today. Van Noten, 65, is set to leave after the next Paris Fashion Week menswear show in June. Known for luxurious colours and avant garde styles, Van Noten began as part of the so-called Antwerp Six who trained at the city's Royal Academy of Fine Arts in the 1980s. Other members included daring designers Walter Van Beirendonck and Ann Demeulemeester. In his statement, Van Noten said his career had been ""a dream come true"". ""I want to shift my focus to all the things I never had time for. I'm sad, but at the same time, happy,"" he said. Van Noten added that a replacement would be announced ""in due time"", and his studio team will handle the next womenswear collection.

For him, creativity always comes first. Nothing is dictated by marketing, simply by the desire to do beautiful things,"" highlighted Johansson about this collaboration.

Stoelzle creates the bottles for the first AMG Thrill perfume line,"Drawing on a successful collaboration for the Mercedes-Benz Parfums brand, INCC Parfums has entrusted the French glasswork division of the Austrian Stoelzle Group to produce the bottles for their first AMG Parfums collection. The inaugural AMG Parfum line-up features three fragrances – Silver Thrill, Black Thrill, and Red Thrill – crafted by Fabrice Pellegrin, principal perfumer at dsm-firmenich. For this launch, INCC Parfums has opted for recycled glass for the bottles, ensuring they are refillable with the new SNI15 screw cap standard. Each full-size bottle (100ml) features a glass heart, protected by a metallic shell. For Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie, the design challenge lay in crafting glass fittings adaptable enough to accommodate the plates and their precise tolerances. The three bottles were lacquered in transparency, the Silver Thrill in orange, the Black Thrill in red and the Red Thrill in dark yellow. The smaller 60ml bottles also feature the same lacquering technique, mirroring the colour codes of their larger counterparts. In this format, the brand logo and fragrance names are screen-printed directly onto the glass. Notably, these smaller bottles are presented without a shell, expanding the product range with a lighter, more portable option. ""Stoelzle successfully addressed the challenges posed by the bottles' height and thinness, ensuring uniform glass distribution throughout,"" said the glassmaker in a statement. The AMG Parfums inaugural collection has been available since September 2023."

Metsä Board: fresh fiber paperboards for a reduced carbon footprint,"Thanks to the use of fossil free energy during their production and their lighter weight, Metsä Board's folding boxboards allow to reduce significantly the carbon footprint of packaging. Assessments [1] conducted by Metsä Board demonstrate the significant carbon footprint reductions that pharmaceutical manufacturers can achieve by switching from commonly used grades to Metsä Board fresh fibre paperboards. Indeed, switching from a solid bleached board (SBB) to Metsä Board folding boxboard can reduce the carbon footprint of packaging by over 50%, and replacing white lined chipboard (WLC) with Metsä Board folding boxboard can result in a 60% reduction or even higher. These assessments have been verified by IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute. The technical background report and the verification statement are available on Metsä Board's website. Despite the lighter weight, Metsä Board's folding boxboards still retain the durability and functional properties of traditional heavier grades. ""As a responsible materials supplier it is our job to provide pharma brand owners with transparent, unbiased information that helps them evaluate packaging materials to make better-informed and sustainable choices to reduce their carbon footprint,"" says Anne Uusitalo, Product Safety and Sustainability Director at Metsä Board."

Germany launches major subsidy scheme for greener industry,"Germany on Tuesday launched what it called ""an innovative"" multi-billion-euro subsidy scheme aimed at turbocharging investments that will make industrial production in Europe's top economy more climate friendly. Energy Minister Robert Habeck said four billion euros ($4.4 billion) would be up for grabs in the first round of the programme, with companies in energy-intensive sectors like glass, steel and paper-making invited to submit proposals for green technology projects that will slash their emissions. ""We are the first industrial country to introduce this,"" Habeck told a press conference, calling the scheme ""an innovate, new instrument"" that would cut red tape, boost technological innovation and help Germany reach its climate targets. The ""climate protection contracts"" will run for 15 years, Habeck said, with the government awarding subsidies to those firms that can decarbonise their production processes at the lowest cost. The government has set aside a ""mid-double-digit"" billion euro amount for the programme overall, Habeck said. The next round of bidding will open in the autumn for 19 billion euros in subsidies. The scheme comes as Germany's crucial manufacturing industry is suffering through a downturn, battered by inflation, weaker global demand and soaring energy costs after Russia's war in Ukraine cut off access to cheap gas imports. ""We need this as stimulus for the economy and of course for climate protection,"" Habeck said. The scheme is expected to help reduce carbon emissions from industry by 350 million tonnes by 2045, according to the economy ministry. Germany aims to be carbon neutral by 2045. Habeck said the subsidy programme was also ""a good answer"" to the green incentives offered by the United States' Inflation Reduction Act, which have already prompted some German firms to mull moving production abroad. ""We need production in Germany, I want energy-intensive industries here and I want that production to be climate neutral,"" he said."

New studies show scalp microbiota benefits of Lubrizol's Fensebiome peptide,"Lubrizol Life Science Beauty has unveiled results of new tests for Fensebiome peptide applied on the scalp. The ingredient had previously shown to have transformational effects on the skin by reinforcing the double cutaneous barrier, promoting microbiota balance and enhancing the physical barrier, helping to achieve a healthier and younger appearance. The new data showed that when applied on the scalp, Fensebiome peptide led to an increase in beneficial scalp microbiota that tends to decrease with age and a modulation of age-induced microbiota changes, associated with a rejuvenated and healthier scalp. The ingredient was also tested on two panels of volunteers: a group of women with sensitive scalps and a group of men with bald sensitive scalps. Both groups found that Fensebiome peptide soothed the scalp, leaving it feeling hydrated and with less itchiness and desquamation. In addition, new in vitro tests showed a reduction of Kallicrein-5 and PAR-2 activation, which helps relieve inflammatory and itching skin and scalp conditions. According to Lubrizol, the heptapeptide can now be incorporated into scalp care formulations designed to reduce sensitivity, prevent dehydration, and rejuvenate the scalp."

"Competition and immobilism explain the demise of The Body Shop, says Ecovia","Once a trailblazer in the cosmetics industry, the iconic cosmetics retailer has gone into administration with over 40 percent of its UK stores to close and most of its international subsidiaries have or are expected to declare bankruptcy. According to Ecovia Intelligence, a London-based specialist research and consulting company that focuses on global ethical product industries, the demise of The Body Shopgives some insight into how fast the sustainability arena is changing. The collapse of the cosmetics firm came as a surprise as it has only been under new ownership since November. The private equity firm Aurelius acquired The Body Shop from Natura & Co. in a deal worth GBP 207 million (EUR 240 million). The Brazilian cosmetics giant sold the business after acquiring it from L'Oréal in 2017. Many saw Natura & Co. as a 'natural fit' for The Body Shop since the Brazilian company is one of the most sustainable (large) corporations in the beauty industry. Its flagship brand Natura Brasil has pioneered many green initiatives, involving carbon management, green packaging, and ethical sourcing of raw materials. However, Natura & Co. sold off The Body Shop to the private equity firm for a fraction of what it paid L'Oréal: GBP 880 million (EUR 1.02 billion). However, Ecovia emphasizes, The Body Shop has long innovated in terms of ethics. It was one of the first brands to actively campaign against animal-testing methods. It was also one of the first to introduce refillable packaging, something that has become fashionable in recent years. It was also one of the first companies to ethically source natural ingredients with its fair trade initiative in 1987. More recently, it was the first beauty brand to use fairly traded plastics in its packaging. In January this year, it was the first major brand to have all its products certified by the Vegan Society. So what has been responsible for the demise of The Body Shop? Ecovia Intelligence believes it hasn't been a case of the ethical brand losing its way, but it stood still. The Body Shop was indeed a trailblazer with many of its green initiatives in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the beauty industry has moved on since then. Sustainability is now an integral part of beauty, with almost all cosmetic brands undertaking some green / ethical initiatives. In short, being ethical was no longer good enough. Competition has played an important role, says Ecovia Intelligence. The Body Shop initially offered shoppers an array of natural cosmetics, made from raw materials sourced from the far corners of the world. Natural cosmetics are now well-established, with major high street retailers like Boots and Superdrug also marketing these products under their private labels. Competition has also come from rival brands. Lush has taken ethical cosmetics to new levels with its green campaigns and innovative natural products. The UK brand is a pioneer with packaging-free products, selling solid shampoos and naked mascara. About a third of its cosmetic products are sold without packaging. It operates almost 900 Lush stores in 50 countries; some new store openings are 'naked' i.e. all cosmetic products have no packaging. One can argue that Lush took the ethical baton from The Body Shop shortly after its formation in 1995. Changing consumer preferences are another factor, according to Ecovia Intelligence. The Body Shop initially offered consumers a unique shopping experience offering novel natural products, essential oils, and ethical gift packs. Natural cosmetics are now mainstream, whilst mass market brands are also marketing themselves on sustainability attributes. Ethical consumers no longer look at just natural ingredients, but also consider packaging impacts, carbon footprint, social causes, and related green issues when making purchases. There are questions on whether younger consumers, especially Millennials and Gen Y, resonate with the Body Shop brand. According to Ecovia Intelligence, the demise of The Body Shop highlights how competitive stakes are rising in the sustainable cosmetics arena."

Puig grew in all segments (fragrances and fashion, makeup, skincare), with double-digit revenue growth vs 2022, ahead of the market average. Puig registered a 17% increase in the fragrances and fashion segment compared to 2022. This segment represented 72% of Puig net revenues in 2023 compared to 74% in 2022. Key highlights in 2023 included Rabanne's launch of a new brand identity and becoming the first Puig brand to exceed Net Revenues of 1 billion euros, while Jean Paul Gaultier became the fastest growing brand in the Puig portfolio. The makeup business segment recorded a 23% increase in revenues in 2023 and made up 18% of Puig's net revenues (vs 17% in 2022). Momentum in this segment continued to be driven by the success of Charlotte Tilbury, which celebrated its 10-year anniversary with a positive performance in the United Kingdom, North America and Europe, the Middle East, Australia and Singapore. The strong growth in the segment was further fueled by the acceleration in the Middle East and Latin America, the performance of Christian Louboutin Beauté and the positive reception of the launch of Rabanne's make-up line. Revenues from the skincare segment rose by 31% in 2023, becoming the fastest-growing segment for Puig and representing 10% of its net revenues. This increase was once again partly driven by the success of Charlotte Tilbury's leading product Magic Cream, in line with its commitment to providing a complete skincare regime. Growth was further fuelled by sales of dermatology products from Uriage and Apivita. Finally, the incorporation of the full-year results of Loto del Sur and Kama Ayurveda, both acquired in 2022, was key to achieving this strong double-digit growth in 2023. The segment was once again reinforced with the acquisition of Dr. Barbara Sturm in January 2024."

French antitrust authority to investigate product rating systems,"The French antitrust authority (Autorité de la concurrence) has announced it is starting inquiries ex officio to analyse the competitive functioning of the product rating systems sector, in particular when it aims to provide consumers with information on the sustainability-related characteristics of consumer products and services. Available via digital applications or labels that voluntarily affixed by manufacturers, these rating systems focus on nutritional quality, environmental impact, energy efficiency, and so on, said the French Authority. Present in a wide range of sectors (agri-food, cosmetics, textiles, toys, household appliances, interior design and tourist accommodation), some systems may be created by public bodies, while others are offered by consumer associations or independent companies in the sector of the products or services rated. Lastly, some rating systems are the result of individual or collective initiatives by companies in the same markets. The Autorité intends to analyse how the information provided by the rating systems is likely to guide consumer purchasing decisions and thus constitute a parameter of competition. It will examine whether the systems encourage companies to innovate to create products or services that are more virtuous in terms of sustainability. In addition, the Autorité will explore the question of relevant markets with a view to providing a market analysis grid. Lastly, it will strive to understand the consequences for competition of the multiplication and coexistence of rating systems within the same sector. Rating applications — such as Yuka, Beautylitic and Clear Formula — have disrupted the cosmetics market in France, and strongly stimulated the demand for products of natural origin. But manufacturers are not left out and are also seeking to implement rating scales, particularly in environmental matters, with the Green Impact Index or EcoBeautyScore projects."
"A minority of TikTokers produce the vast majority of content, research finds","Despite its growing popularity, TikTok remains a platform where the majority of users are content to consume videos. A recent study by the Pew Research Center reveals that the most active 25% of US adult users produce 98% of public content on TikTok. Moreover, the report states that about half of all US adults on the site have never actually posted a video themselves. The top 25% of US adult TikTok users who are the most active in terms of posting produce 98% of all publicly accessible videos from this group, according to analysis from Pew Research surveying 2,745 US adults using TikTok in August 2023. The research highlights a significant concentration of publishing activity, with a minority of very active users generating the majority of content. The research reveals that almost half of the American TikTok users surveyed have never posted a video. What's more, most of them haven't even filled in their biography. Users aged 18 to 34 (52%) are more likely to use TikTok than their elders. However, only about half of them have actually posted content, a figure similar to that of the 35-to-49 age group (60%), the study points out. Users who post videos are generally more active on TikTok: they follow more accounts, are followed by more people themselves, are more likely to have filled out their bio, and are somewhat more likely to find the content of their ""For You"" page highly interesting, the research reports. The analysis found that the median poster has uploaded six videos and received a total of 149 likes. Moreover, a median poster will also follow almost four times as many other accounts as someone who doesn't post. TikTok's recommendation algorithm, experienced via the ""For You"" page, seems to be working effectively for the platform's users. Indeed, 85% of users find the content of this page at least somewhat interesting, with 40% describing it as extremely or very interesting. Only 14% found it of little or no interest."

General Elections: CTPA calls for a UK strategy to support the beauty industry,"As the United Kingdom is heading towards a General Election this year, the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA) — the UK trade association representing companies involved in making, supplying and selling cosmetics and personal care products – is calling for the next Government to develop a strategy for the cosmetics and personal care industry to secure the continued sustainable growth of the sector. The association's 12 key asks are developed in its first ever Manifesto (www.ctpa.org.uk/CTPAmanifesto2024). Gathered under five pillars (Essentiality, Regulation, Science, Sustainability and Business) these 12 asks are described as ""the most important things Government can do to help ensure the continued growth and success of the sector."" According to CTPA, the next UK Government should: promotes the essentiality of the industry's products and services, maintains strict risk-based safety legislation, protects science-led decision-making, provides a framework for growth with sustainability at its core, enhances the competitiveness of the UK industry for both import and export, champions the UK industry as a leader in product manufacture, design and innovation. For instance, CTPA says a formal UK/EU cooperation structure for the cosmetics and personal care industry should be created to facilitate trade and regulatory cooperation. The association also explains the Government will have to ensure consistent implementation of new rules within the UK internal market across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and be supportive of take-back schemes and to invest in a harmonised infrastructure for recycling. CTPA also advocates for the return of tax-free shopping in the UK to boost tourism spending in stores and at airports… ""To date, the cosmetics and personal care industry has not had a dedicated Government strategy focused on this vital sector. CTPA would like to work with the UK Government after the General Election on a strategy recognising the essentiality of the industry's products and services by maintaining the strict risk-based safety legislation, protecting science-led decision-making whilst providing a framework for growth with sustainability at its core. The strategy should also enhance the competitiveness of the UK industry for both import and export and champion the UK industry as a leader in product manufacture, design and innovation,"" said Dr Emma Meredith, CTPA's Director-General. The full Manifesto, including all key asks and rationales is available at: www.ctpa.org.uk/CTPAmanifesto2024"
L'Oréal USA launches second edition of its inclusive beauty fund,"L'Oréal USA just launched a new edition of its Inclusive Beauty Fund, which provides financial support and resources to small businesses and entrepreneurs across the beauty industry. Administered in collaboration with the NAACP's Economic Empowerment Fund and Hispanic Federation, respectively, L'Oréal has partnered with GlobalGiving to provide 40 one-time grants to small businesses and entrepreneurs in the beauty industry across the United States. In 2021, recognizing that beauty businesses were some of the most acutely impacted by the economic fallout of COVID-19 and resulting shutdowns, L'Oréal USA partnered with the NAACP to provide much needed support in terms of funding and business mentoring to 33 small beauty businesses. Grant recipients used the funds to grow their inventory, refine marketing strategies, and open new retail locations. ""The grant provided by L'Oréal USA and NAACP came at the perfect time for us. It truly provided us with the fuel to invest in inventory, as well as marketing. The resources were really the linchpin for us. As a business it provided us with a gateway to connect with salon owners and stylists in a whole new way,"" said LaToya Stirrup, Co-Founder and CEO of Kazmaleje, a recipient of an Inclusive Beauty Fund grant in 2021. While progress has been made, L'Oréal says it is important to continue supporting beauty entrepreneurs who are still facing economic hurdles and headwinds. According to the beauty giant, these challenges limit their potential to scale their businesses and provide essential beauty services to consumers nationwide. In 2024, L'Oréal USA is expanding the program to include NGO partner Hispanic Federation and grant administrator GlobalGiving. In addition to one-time funding, the company is committed to providing grantees with professional mentorship and business development support with the participation of top executives from its leading beauty brands and its professional beauty products distributor, SalonCentric. ""The Inclusive Beauty Fund is one of the cornerstones of L'Oréal's broader commitment to advancing inclusivity within the beauty industry,"" said Liliahn Majeed, Chief Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Officer, North America, L'Oréal Groupe. ""We value the role small businesses play in bringing vital products and services to consumers across all backgrounds and lived experiences and we want to do our part to support beauty businesses and entrepreneurs who are working to navigate economic challenges."" Beauty businesses, extensions artists, braiders, estheticians, barbers, salon owners, suite owners, students and stylists nationwide are invited to apply for the Inclusive Beauty Fund. How to apply? Applications for the Inclusive Beauty Fund will be administered by the NAACP and Hispanic Federation, respectively. The NAACP and Hispanic Federation will each award 20 one-time grants of $10,000 each and applications opened on February 20. All submissions must be conducted through either the NAACP or Hispanic Federation's websites, with links included below. The candidates selected to receive the grants will be announced in April 2024. – To apply via the NAACP, please use this link: https://app.helloalice.com/grants/naacp-x-l-oreal-inclusive-beauty-fund-round-2 – To apply via Hispanic Federation, please use this link: www.hispanicfederation.org/images/pdf/HF_x_LOreal_Inclusive_Beauty_Small_Business_Grants_2.pdf"
Quadpack reimagines the dropper with a new tube solution,"The Wanderer by Quadpack is a dropper tube created to provide precise and targeted application, thanks to an exclusive internal design. The Wanderer features a unique flow control disc, which disrupts the flow of the product. By applying pressure to the tube, the formula enters the pipette and 'wanders' around the disc's circuit, giving the consumer better control. A slanted tip facilitates direct application to targeted small areas, with visibly separated drops. The new item is designed specifically for low-viscosity formulations, such as oils, light serums and boosters. Available with a 19mm or 25mm diameter, it supports capacities of 7-20ml and 15-50ml. The functional, minimalist design has just four components: tube, disc, pipette and cap. The cap and pipette come in polypropylene, while the tube is made of polyethylene. It can be monolayer or multilayer, with an EVOH (ethylene vinyl alcohol) barrier for extra protection of complex formulations. The tube and cap offer the possibility to include PCR content. Brands can play with the tube's proportions – from short and wide, to long and thin – along with a host of decoration options to ensure it matches brand identity. ""The Wanderer is a perfect example of optimal control in a mono-family pack. When designing a high-performance product, it is important to consider sustainability right from the start,"" said Quadpack Category Specialist Alejandra Isern. ""The flow control disc works wonders. It's amazing how such a small part can impact performance. With regard to external design, having this applicator in a tube makes the user experience comfortable and completely intuitive, making it an easy but effective self-care solution."" Like every product in Quadpack's catalogue, life-cycle assessment and other impact data for The Wanderer are available in its Environmental Report, to help brands make conscious decisions and achieve their sustainability goals."

Pure Trade celebrates Lunar New Year with Christian Dior,"Every year, some time between late January and early February, an estimated 2 billion people across the globe, many of them in East and Southeast Asia, celebrate the Lunar New Year. To celebrate this important event in China and in other Asian countries, Dior has entrusted Pure Trade with the creation of a specially designed set of boxes and envelopes. The box soberly combines the codes of the House of Dior and those traditionally associated with this time of year. Typical of these festive days, the ""Lucky Money"" envelopes are made of red-tinted FSC paper, decorated with a glossy transparent pattern, a gold hot-stamped band and the Christian Dior logo, also hot-stamped in gold. They are presented in batches of eight, in a large envelope, accompanied by a greetings card from the House of Dior. A case, also in red-tinted FSC paper, perfectly accommodates a lipstick. It closes with a golden eyelet that wraps around two buttons, embossed and gold stamped with the monogram. Finally, two rigid boxes (S & M) and two folding boxes (M & L), in red-tinted FSC paper, make majestic gift boxes. They too are decorated with embossed patterns and gold hot stamping, including the brand logo."
Coty strengthens its perfume portfolio with Italian fashion brand Etro,"The fragrance and beauty giant has signed a new agreement with Italian luxury fashion house, Etro. The deal establishes a long-term partnership (beyond 2040) between Coty and Etro to produce and distribute signature fragrance lines and home scent collections. Upon entry into force of the agreement, Coty will assume the development, production, and distribution of all Etro perfumes and fragrances, including Etro's iconic fragrances Shantung and Paisley. The two companies said they will work together to explore new categories and innovations to grow Etro's beauty portfolio. Acquired by L Catterton in July 2021, Etro was founded in Milan Etro in 1968. The brand offers a full range of men's and women's ready-to-wear collections. Etro's presence is driven by the brand's retail stores consisting of more than 130 locations in over 20 countries across Europe, North America, Middle East and APAC with a prestigious positioning in the symbolic cities of luxury shopping such as Milan, London, Paris, Dubai, New York, Beijing, and Tokyo. Etro's distribution network also includes omnichannel, travel retail, and selected global wholesale retailers. ""This agreement further underscores Coty's focus on fashion driven licenses with significant multi category potential which resonate with consumers in our key markets. We are excited to collaborate with Etro, building on the brand's existing beauty offering and bringing its unique brand identity to life through new categories and launches,"" said Sue Nabi, Coty's CEO. Coty, which also holds licensing deals with Burberry, Gucci, Davidoff and Hugo Boss, recently signed a licensing deal with Italian fashion brand Marni, further strengthening its presence in the luxury fragrance sector."
"What the future for sustainable cosmetics, according to Ecovia Intelligence?","Ecovia Intelligence, a London-based specialist research, consulting and training company that focuses on global ethical product industries, has given its predictions for the year ahead for sustainable cosmetics… The range of cosmetic products with sustainability attributes will continue to expand. Natural and organic cosmetics are the most established, with their market share approaching 10% in the US, Germany, and Switzerland. But new products will be launched with green attributes. Waterless products such as shampoo bars, solid moisturisers, and sheet masks will continue to make headway this year. Other sustainable products that are gaining popularity include microbiome-friendly products and refillables. The number of ethical labels in the cosmetics industry will continue to mushroom. Natural and organic are the most established labels; COSMOS and Natrue are the leading standards, having over 35,000 and 6,400 certified products respectively. Other popular eco-labels include Nordic Swan, Fairtrade, Non-GMO, and Climate Neutral. As more consumers switch to a vegan lifestyle and / or reduce their intake of animal-based products, they are seeking plant-based cosmetics. More brands are expected to market their products as vegan. The Body Shop announced this month that it became the first major brand to have its entire product range certified by the Vegan Society. Cosmetic ingredients are increasingly made using precision fermentation, plant cell and new technologies. Geltor and Modern Meadow are two companies that have created collagen alternatives using precision fermentation. The proteins are marketed as vegan, animal-free and sustainable. The Californian start-up Debut is making active ingredients using a cell-free biotechnology model. Expect to see more companies using carbon captured molecules to make cosmetic ingredients, packaging, and finished products. Last year, Coty launched the first widely distributed fragrance using alcohol from industrial carbon emissions. Recently, the Element Packaging obtained CO2 Carbon Captured certification for its packaging materials. Growing consumer concerns about deforestation is encouraging organisations to develop green ingredients. The Dutch-Indonesian enterprise Forestwise is marketing butters and oils made from wild harvested raw materials sourced from the Borneo forest. They are marketed as rainforest ingredients. In 2022, Palmless was launched as an alternative to palm oil in the US; almost chemically identical to palm oil, the material is marketed as deforestation-free. In Europe, NoPalm Ingredients and Äio are creating palm oil alternatives from agricultural by-products. Expect to see more such ingredient launches this year. The move away from single-use plastics is encouraging cosmetic brands to experiment with new packaging materials. Bamboo, beeswax, wood chips, agricultural fibres and other bio-based materials are finding their way into cosmetic packaging. Some brands are looking at dissolvable and compostable packaging. There will be greater scrutiny of green marketing claims this year as regulators bring in new legislation. The EU parliament gave the go ahead for a new directive that will require companies to substantiate environmental or sustainability claims they make about their products. Ecovia Intelligence will showcase these developments at the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit throughout the year. The North American edition will be hosted in New York on 4-6th June, European edition in Paris on 28-30th October, and the Asia-Pacific edition in Hong Kong on 11-12th November 2024.

Cosmogen creates the applicators of the Lancôme x Louvre's Richelieu palette,"For its Lancôme x Louvre Richelieu Wing limited edition eyeshadow palette, Lancôme entrusted Cosmogen with the creation of the two mini double applicators included in the Richelieu palette. Their black handle with aluminium ferrule accommodates three NBR foam tips and one bevelled tuft of PBT bristles, to apply shades and materials professionally to all areas of the face. With the Richelieu multi-use palette, Lancôme celebrates the sculpture of Corine, a Greek poet from the 5th century BC, presented in the Richelieu wing of the Louvre. The poetry of this palette, created by Lisa Eldridge, is inspired by the magnetic light of the gallery, punctuated by the relief of the sculptures revealing their silent but surprising beauty. ""The texture is very creamy, easy to blend. With these shades, you can use it as a highlighter, for light and deep complexions. You can apply it with your finger or brush, on the eyes, lips. The green shade is sublime as a liner or for a smoky eye look,"" said Lisa Eldridge."
DKSH signs exclusive distribution agreement with Exsymol in Canada,"DKSH has been entrusted to grow Exsymol's business across Canada. DKSH's Business Unit Performance Materials will provide business development, marketing, sales, logistics, and distribution services for Exsymol's range of active ingredients designed for skin care, cosmetics, and dermo-cosmetic applications.

Geka continues to score high when it comes to sustainability,"The German manufacturer of cosmetic applicators has been awarded its fourth consecutive Platinum Sustainability Rating from EcoVadis. This result places Geka within the top 1% of assessed companies. EcoVadis independently assessed Geka across four categories, consolidating results to achieve a final rating. Geka scored in the top 1% for the Environment, Ethics, and Labour & Human Rights categories, while landing in the top 3% for Sustainable Procurement. ""This is a great result and illustrates our commitment towards the creation of a responsible cosmetics industry. Our improved performance this year, even with expanded criteria from EcoVadis, is evidence that our long-term sustainability strategy is working. It also shows our customers and users that our approach to beauty is more than skin deep, and that we're committed to preserving our planet and supporting society too,"" commented Oliver Vogel, CEO of Geka. Geka is enacting structured sustainability initiatives across its business, one of which is introducing sustainable materials into its products. In 2023, Geka launched the first ever commercially available post-consumer recycled (PCR) fibre filaments for vegan friendly mascara and eyebrow brushes. Furthermore, its Reborn Collection of mascara, lip gloss, eyebrow brushes, cleaning pads and accessories contains at least 93% PCR and bio-based materials. Furthermore, Geka's commitment to reduce its 2029 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% compared to 2019 has been independently validated by the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi). The company has also pledged to send zero waste to landfill by 2025."
"dsm-firmenich wants to focus on health, flavours and beauty","The Dutch-Swiss giant wants to separate from its Animal Nutrition & Health (ANH) division by 2025 to focus on its three other businesses Perfumery & Beauty (P&B); Taste, Texture & Health (TTH) and Health, Nutrition & Care. The merger of DSM and Firmenich created a world-leader in nutrition, health and beauty, however the ANH business ""is driven by different dynamics to the rest of the Group,"" said the multinational in a statement. Based in Kaiseraugst, not far from Basel, Switzerland, the ANH business generated a turnover of more than 3.2 billion euros last year, or a quarter of the dsm-firmenich's revenues. However, it weighed on the results for the 2023 financial year, in particular due to the volatility of the vitamin market. ""This is a difficult moment, but we strongly believe that a separation would be better for both businesses and their employees,"" commented Dimitri de Vreeze, CEO of dsm-firmenich. According to dsm-firmenich, the sale of the ANH business would enable the group to strengthen its position as a world-leader in nutrition, health, and beauty. ""By fully focusing on Perfumery & Beauty (P&B); Taste, Texture & Health (TTH); and Health, Nutrition & Care (HNC), the company can further develop its complementary world-class scientific research, technologies and manufacturing excellence. Full focus on these businesses is expected to enhance their commercial potential and synergies, supporting an attractive and consistent growth outlook alongside robust margins,"" detailed dsm-firmenich."
A PET bottle from Quadpack for Collistar's new concealer,"For their new LIFT HD+ Smoothing Lifting Concealer, Collistar has chosen Quadpack's monomaterial Gala dip-in pack with The Essential applicator, for super soft and easy application. The Gala dip-in pack features a thick-wall bottle entirely made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), meeting the brand's criteria for the exclusive use of recyclable materials. ""Among our main sustainable development objectives are those linked to packaging and eco-design. Specifically, we are committed to releasing only refillable or recyclable packaging by 2025. This means reducing the complexity and quantity of materials by favouring monomaterial choices to ensure that our packaging, once correctly disposed of by the consumer, can be recovered and recycled through standard recycling technologies. By choosing the monomaterial Gala bottle, Lift HD+ Corrector has been revisited in a modern and eco-conceived way that is aligned with our objectives,"" explained Matilde Rossi Scota, Head of Sustainable Development at Collistar. Developed by Quadpack, the 4.5ml Gala bottle exudes prestige with its substantial size impression and clean silhouette. Having tried out the choice of matching applicators, Collistar selected The Essential as the right tool to deliver the formula. Its round-tipped spatula has dual reservoirs on opposite sides to load the right amount of product. The flexible wand and soft tip make application gentle, easy and pleasurable. Quadpack ensured the decoration met the brand's exacting requirements. A black matt varnish is applied to the cap, with the logo discretely hot stamped on the top. The bottle is left transparent, keeping the formula within view, with the lettering silk screened in black along the side. ""Collistar, a long-time client of Quadpack, was delighted with the result. For the next iteration, the brand is considering the use of post-consumer recycled (PCR) PET. Quadpack's life-cycle assessments show that a switch to a full PCR version would improve the pack's circularity index by 60%, with a 25% reduction in the brand's Scope 3 carbon footprint,"" added the supplier in a statement."

Coverpla and Estal seal a commercial partnership,"Coverpla strengthens its offer of ultra-personalized, ready-to-go solutions through a marketing and commercial partnership with Spanish company Estal. Estal offers extensive lines dedicated to fragrance, cosmetics and home fragrance. Its concepts are subsequently developed by a range of major European glassmakers. This offer is partially complementary to the one of Coverla, which has chosen to work with Estal to enhance its home fragrance collection with a range of diffusers in various sizes (from 100 to 750ml) and associated accessories. Thick-based candle jars with a premium feel complete the collection. As far as cosmetics are concerned, three new products are joining the Coverpla catalogue: two 50ml jars and a 30ml vial. And the fragrance offer is enhanced on the one hand with Estal's ""Doble Alto"" concept, which combines the appearance of a heavy base in line with luxury codes with a range of models in lightweight glass (a 35% reduction in glass weight) with classic shapes. Finally, Coverpla is enhancing its green offer with three lightweight bottles. Bandeau, Tote and Cloche are based on Concept Bubble, with an indented base borrowed from that of champagne bottles, compensating for the reduced scale of lightweight bottles, that confer an identical format to a traditional flacon. These three designs are available in 30, 50 and 100ml formats with a choice of three different necks: FEA15, SNI 15 and flat necks for fragrance diffusers. They are compatible with all the caps in the Coverpla catalog. The products in the range are offered in pure, naturally colored glass or in amber glass. They are also available crafted from 100% recycled, non-sorted household waste. This type of glass varies in color, and sometimes presents other irregularities. Such a choice represents a strong environmental standpoint, a commitment to a ""raw"" product that consumers must accept or alter their perception of ""imperfections."" Estal has asserted itself by offering this bold solution; Coverpla has chosen to open its catalog to the concept."
Wellness is Gen Z's latest obsession,"Feeling better about yourself in mind and body is the key to being more confident, more successful, and better equipped to face a world in crisis. More than previous generations, Gen Zers seem to be obsessed with all things relating to well-being, or at least, things that could improve it. Such are the findings of the Future of Wellness report from McKinsey, surveying over 5,000 consumers in China, the UK and the USA. Respondents are generally inclined to take charge of their physical and mental health, and are turning to science-backed solutions to do so. Contrary to what you might think, it's not older consumers who are driving the popularity of wellness activities, practices and other solutions, but younger people. The report reveals that Millennials and members of Generation Z spend more than their elders on wellness products and services. Appearance and overall health are among their top priorities, but they are also keen on products and services related to nutrition, fitness, mindfulness and sleep. Looking specifically at American consumers, it would seem that physical activity acts as a pressure release valve, or at least helps them feel good. More than half of American Gen Zers (56%) see fitness as a ""very high priority,"" compared to 40% of all American consumers. The youngest generations are also turning to preventive solutions, particularly to slow down the aging process. ""There are a bunch of possible reasons why Gen Z is so interested in health and wellness at such a young age. For one thing, Gen Z has more exposure and access to information about health and wellness at an earlier age than other generations have had .... It's also possible that the Covid-19 pandemic — which catalyzed a global focus on health and wellness — coincided with Gen Z's formative years. And to stave off loneliness, Gen Z is looking for friends in so-called third places, which often include gyms or fitness classes,"" the report suggests. According to the data presented by McKinsey, younger people's attraction to activities and practices dedicated to their physical and mental well-being has already begun to transform offers in certain sectors. This is particularly true in the tourism sector, where establishments are adding wellness centers and gyms, as well as proposing new types of excursions or packages. This has been seen in recent months with new activities such as 'silent walking,' 'quiet parks' and sleep tourism. The emphasis on well-being, and more broadly on mental health, could also have consequences for the relationship between young people and the world of work. A recent survey conducted in several European countries showed that mental health was more important than career success in the eyes of Gen Z women."

Seppic enriches Alariane CV tests results with scalp care benefits,"Like other cosmetic ingredient manufacturers, Seppic is getting a closer look at the skinification of the hair care products market. Indeed, more and more consumers around the world have realized that healthy hair is directly linked to having a healthy scalp. According to Mintel, in China, over 90% of those who use hair products believe that scalp care can enhance their hair health. To meet this demand and offer a solution to protect the scalp against daily aggressions, Seppic is re-exploring the potential of Alariane CV [1], an anti-aging active ingredient of marine origin initially launched in 2008, in order to provide a double protective effect on the scalp: protection of hair follicles cells as well as protection of scalp lipids from exposome [2]. Alariane CV is an extract of Alaria esculenta, also known as the ""Irish wakame"". It is a traditional food along the far northern coasts of the Atlantic Ocean, eaten for its excellent health properties as well as for its binder/detoxifier effect against heavy metals [3]. Tests have been carried out to illustrate the effect of Alariane CV protection capacity against cadmium, a heavy metal present in overall pollution due to cigarette smoke or phosphate fertilizers for example. In contact with cadmium, the scalp is weakened and submitted to inflammation, and thus, hair follicles are no longer able to produce healthy hair. According to Seppic, the use of Alariane CV demonstrated, by in vitro protocols, a significant diminution of 27% of hair follicles inflammation compared to non-treated one, after cadmium stress. Microscopic observations of cells in presence of Alariane CV show an increase in their number and an improvement in their morphology, similar to cells not exposed to cadmium. Alariane CV has a protective action on the hair follicle against inflammation induced by cadmium, and helps to preserve scalp function and maintain healthy hair. The in vitro data have also shown the protection of lipids peroxidation after a UVB stress."
Yellow Wood Partners' Suave Brands acquires ChapStick from Haleon,"Yellow Wood Partners, a Boston-based private equity firm focused on investing in consumer brands and companies, has announced that its portfolio company Suave Brands has signed a binding offer to acquire the ChapStick brand from consumer health company Haleon. The transaction is intended to close in the first half of 2024 upon completion of customary closing and regulatory approvals. ChapStick pioneered the lip care category in the 1880s with the launch of a now-iconic lip balm that made ChapStick a household name. For more than a century, ChapStick has added products to its portfolio with innovative new ingredients, skincare benefits, and flavors. Today, ChapStick is a leader in lip care and synonymous with the product category – it is the #1 brand by volume and has over 80% brand awareness in the United States. ""The Yellow Wood team established Suave Brands Company in May 2023 to acquire the Suave brand from Unilever. We saw the opportunity to grow Suave with a more focused management approach while also creating the corporate infrastructure to acquire and manage additional personal care brands across multiple categories to drive synergies across the platform. We are excited to add ChapStick, another leading brand with deep equity and history, into our platform. At Suave Brands Company, our management team is focused on building a platform of category leading brands that consumers love while working with our retail customers and manufacturing partners to grow the brands. We look forward to continuing to build Suave Brands Company by identifying additional personal care brands to add to the portfolio,"" commented Suave Brands Company Chief Executive Officer Daniel Alter. Suave is a personal care brand that sells products across the hair, body, skin and antiperspirant deodorant segments. The Suave brand sells products for women, men and kids across mass retailers, grocery stores, drug retailers, and ecommerce platforms and today is found in one out of every two U.S. households. ""ChapStick is the #1 lip care brand in the mass, drug, food and convenience store channels. Chapstick products are purchased by one out of every five households in the United States; consumers love the brand. Chapstick has the highest brand awareness in lip care, as well as the strongest purchase conversion among all brands in the category. Similar to Suave, ChapStick will benefit from Suave Brands Company's leadership, setting the brand up for continued innovation and growth driven by increased consumer marketing investments, as well as a more focused sales approach. We look forward to completing this transaction in the first half of 2024,"" added Dana Schmaltz, Partner at Yellow Wood Partners. Yellow Wood's diverse portfolio of consumer brands also includes global footcare brands Dr. Scholl's and Scholl International; Beacon Wellness Brands, led by its anchor brand PlusOne®, the #1 sexual wellness device brand; beauty brands Real Techniques and EcoTools; skincare brand Byoma, and self-tanning brands Isle of Paradise, Tanologist and TanLuxe. In December, Yellow Wood announced the pending acquisition of the Elida Beauty portfolio of brands from Unilever. This platform includes leading brands such as Q-Tips, Caress, TiGi, Ponds, St. Ives, and Noxzema, as well as European brands including Brut, Impulse, Monsavon, and Timotei. This transaction is scheduled to be consummated in 2024."
"Interparfums: sales grow by 13% in 2023, driven by Jimmy Choo","With sales approaching EUR 800 million in 2023, and up from just above EUR 700 million the previous year, Interparfums posted another double digit growth year (+13%) in 2023. ""While sales price increases introduced at the beginning of the year contributed to this performance, growth was largely organic, with an 11.5% increase in volume sales on continuing strong demand for the portfolio's top-selling brands, resulting in double-digit gains for the year,"" said the company in a statement. Jimmy Choo fragrances, now the Group's top-selling brand, had more than EUR 200 million in sales, up 16%, driven by the established Jimmy Choo and Jimmy Choo Man lines, and above all the continuing international success of the I Want Choo and I Want Choo Forever lines, launched in 2021 and 2022. With sales also exceeding EUR 200 million, up 12%, Montblanc fragrances' steady gains continued to be driven by the solidity of the Montblanc Legend franchise, the enduring strength of the Montblanc Explorer franchise, plus an additional boost from the launch of the Montblanc Explorer Platinum line at the beginning of the year. Nearly all regions reported growth, with the exception of the Middle East and Africa. With sales of EUR 323 million, up nearly 13%, North America's strong momentum remains intact. ""Despite an extremely complex global context in terms of geopolitics, the economy and also the supply chain, we had a very good year in 2023, significantly exceeding our initial forecasts. Our portfolio's three top-selling brands posted double-digit growth based on annual sales now ranging between EUR 180 million and EUR 210 million. 2024 will be highlighted by the start of operations for the Lacoste brand.We are convinced of its significant potential and are extremely confident in our ability to establish its position as a major brand in our portfolio in the near future,"" commented Philippe Benacin, Chairman and CEO of Interfparfums. ""While H2 2023 gross margins will be to some extent affected by inflation of certain components, this impact should be largely offset by sales price increases introduced at the beginning of the year. By maintaining tight controls over all expenses, especially marketing and advertising, the operating margin for 2023 should exceed 19%,"" added Philippe Santi, Executive Vice President."
Groupe Berkem extends its H2OLIXIR range of 100% natural floral waters,"The group specializing in bio-based chemistry has announced the extension of its 100% natural, 97.5% organic floral water range, H2OLIXIR, designed for the Health and Beauty industries. After having debuted its range with two solutions launched in March 2023, namely peppermint water and lemon balm water, Groupe Berkem is now launching two new products composed of plant extracts with natural qualities particularly sought after in the composition of many cosmetic products, namely: – Lavender water: features a soothing and antioxidant action that reduces discomfort, its properties can be used in a wide range of cosmetic applications, such as facial care and sensitive skincare, soothing skincare and the fight against premature skin aging; – Thyme water: providing a wide range of benefits, from its antioxidant action to its purifying properties, it is used in facial care for combination, oily or acne-prone skin, as a purifying cleanser or as a repairing facial treatment and also purifies oily hair and cleanses the scalp. As with its two previous products, these new solutions have been designed by Groupe Berkem using a process known as desiccation, which involves drying plants to extract the water they contain, while preserving the benefits of the original plants. This method ensures that the best possible properties are drawn from the very heart of plant extracts to address the cosmetics market. Each floral water in the H2OLIXIR range is guaranteed 100% natural and 97.5% organic. All are upcycled, organically grown in France and certified COSMetic Organic and natural Standard - COSMOS (Organic and natural cosmetics). ""The extension of our H2OLIXIR range is further proof of Groupe Berkem's ability to innovate in a market where naturalness and performance are key themes. Thanks to these two new solutions, with their multiple applications and recognized virtues, we intend to address new, high value-added segments of the cosmetics market, while guaranteeing our customers their natural, organic properties and sourcing in France,"" said Eric Moussu, Vice President of Sales of Groupe Berkem."
Flock Box: A zero plastic and fully recyclable premium gift box,"Developed by four companies – Holmen Iggesund, Krekelberg, Inmaco Solutions and Van de Velde Packaging Group – in a collaborative approach, the Flock Box is a new packaging concept that combines natural fibre flocking technology with paperboard to create a fully recyclable premium gift box. A plastic-free packaging concept, the Flock Box consists of an embossed outer box and an inner tray with tailored cavities of various shapes and forms which can be used to present different items. The insert's luxurious look and feel have been created with flocking technology, which uses static electric currents to make fibres stand up and resemble a velvet-like material. ""The Flock Box has been enabled by the development of Holmen Iggesund's highly formable paperboard Inverform, which has unique characteristics that allow it to be press-formed in the required shapes,"" says Per Berglund, Head of Formables at Holmen Iggesund. For this joint project, the Dutch company Krekelberg, which has been manufacturing flocked materials since 1948, has flocked Inverform with cellulose fibres, adding a high luxury feel to the board. The fibres can be coloured in any specific shade required. Inmaco Solutions, a Dutch machine builder, made the tools to press-form the flocked Inverform inserts for the Flock Box. In addition, Van de Velde Packaging Group has created the outer Flock Box packaging from Holmen Iggesund's Invercote DUO paperboard, and die-cut the top part of the inserts made from Inverform. The gift box surface was treated to emphasise the embossing and luxury feel of the gift box. ""We are seeing more and more conscious luxury brands wanting to replace plastic with fibre-based solutions. The Flock Box is made of board and fibres that are 100% recyclable in the existing paper collection stream, contributing directly to a circular packaging ecosystem. Flocked fibre-based inlays could replace large quantities of plastic inlays,"" highlights Berglund. The Flock Box is made from paperboards supplied by Holmen Iggesund from sustainably managed forests. The paperboards consist of fresh wood fibres, a renewable raw material well suited for recycling. The outer box is made from Invercote DUO, which has printing surfaces that enable optimal reproduction of the most sophisticated printing images. The inner tray is made from Inverform, a paperboard with high stiffness designed for stable pressed and folded trays with high visual appeal."
Mibelle Biochemistry appoints Mike Conti as Vice President USA,"Mibelle Biochemistry has announced that Michael (Mike) Conti joined the company recently as Vice President Mibelle Biochemistry USA, effective January 1st, 2024, leading the US sales and marketing team.

Clarins and Albéa Tubes partner for lighter samples with recycled plastic,"Clarins is upgrading its range of sample tubes with EcoLittle Top, the latest addition to the EcoTop range from Albéa Tubes. This new flip-top closure system, adapted to the sample format, responds to the triple CSR challenge of weight reduction, recyclability, and the use of recycled materials. Thanks to the removal of one component, EcoLittle Top offers a 47% weight reduction on the complete tube. In line with Clarins' and Albéa Tubes' commitment to circular economy, the tube incorporates 45% recycled material, thanks to the Albéa Tubes' PCR Max range. This PCR PE solution combined with EcoLittle Top in HDPE is therefore mono-material, making it recyclable in HDPE streams. The incorporation of recycled plastic reduces the amount of virgin plastic used to produce the tubes. ""This innovation is the result of two years of close collaboration between our two teams,"" says Isabelle Séry, Sales Director at Albéa Tubes. ""Clarins' and Albéa Tubes' CSR commitments and premium quality requirements were at the heart of product development. EcoLittle Top is a further consolidation of our CSR roadmap."" ""We view all our innovations through the prism of sustainability, so it was natural for us to turn to Albéa Tubes for our samples. EcoLittle Top will be used for most Clarins ranges (Skincare and Make-up), with very few exceptions. We're proud of this innovation, which is another step towards a more responsible industry,"" adds Philippe Briand, Director of Packaging Design, Direct Purchasing & Launch Coordination for Clarins."
'Soap nails' are taking over as the minimalist manicure of the moment,"After the 'no make-up' trend in beauty and the 'quiet luxury' aesthetic in fashion, here come 'soap nails.' Going against the grain of the maximalist trends often highlighted in this sector, nails in turn are embracing a certain minimalism — more natural and chic than ever — emphasizing care over colour and superfluous details. This incoming trend has been on the rise since the beginning of the year. While red, chrome or 3D nails remain among the main nail trends forecasted in 2024, more minimalist inspirations also appeal to many fans. Following in the footsteps of the fashion world, which propelled quiet luxury to the top of the trend list in 2023, or the rise of 'no make-up' beauty looks, nail art enthusiasts are now turning to more discreet manicures. And it looks as if they've found just what they're looking for in 'soap nails'. The idea is to craft a minimalist manicure on perfectly groomed nails, with an ultra-shiny, glossy, wet-look finish. The trend is already attracting a huge following, and is spreading at lightning speed on social networks — as in real life. On TikTok, the hashtag has already racked up several million views, even though the phenomenon is still in its infancy. The social network is home to a multitude of tutorials featuring these soapy, super-shiny nails. And, whether they're milky white or pale pink, above all, they're always perfectly manicured. In fact, this is the very essence of 'soap nails', whose almost 'naked' finish contrasts with the work they actually require in terms of care and prep. In this respect, nails are echoing skincare, which is gradually taking over from complex, highly crafted makeup looks. So, how do you actually get 'soap nails?' While there's no specific technique, it goes without saying that this manicure requires a glossy varnish, a top coat and all the tools you need to push back cuticles, as well as file, polish, smooth and shape your nails to achieve a flawless manicure. Once all that preparation is done, simply apply the gloss varnish — some opt for a transparent pink, others a milky white — then finish off with a glossy top coat. That's all there is to it! Be careful, though: a perfect manicure also means a perfect hand care. Remember to exfoliate and moisturize your hands for ideal results."
Eurazeo takes minority stake in niche fragrance brand Ex Nihilo,"Investment group Eurazeo spent about EUR 25 million to become a minority shareholder in Ex Nihilo Paris, a perfume brand created in 2013 by Sylvie Loday, Olivier Royère and Benoît Verdier, the majority owners. The brand has earned global recognition for its iconic and widely successful Fleur Narcotique perfume. Ex Nihilo leverages technology through its ""Osmologue"" machine – a high-precision fragrance blending system – to offer personalization services to customers allowing them to customize existing fragrances. The House also offers collectible pieces and unique fragrances on demand. Since the opening of its first boutique in Paris, at 352 rue Saint-Honoré, Ex Nihilo has experienced rapid growth, reaching a global customer base through a combination of digital and physical channels, in particular in prestige department stores such as Harrods, Bergdorf Goodman, Galeries Lafayette, and Saks Fifth Avenue, complemented by selective partnerships with specialty stores, niche perfumery shops. In addition, its network of seven flagship stores serves as hubs for discovery and experimentation with personalized services. The brand has achieved a turnover of more than 50 million euros. Eurazeo is interested in the strong potential of Ex Nihilo on global markets. After the Middle East, the brand aims to accelerate its expansion in North America and Asia. ""We have targeted the niche fragrance space given trends towards premiumization driven by consumer aspiration for uniqueness and experiences. Ex Nihilo – through its high-quality products, brand authenticity and selective distribution – is ideally positioned to benefit from the current market momentum,"" said Laurent Droin, Managing Director of Eurazeo, Brands."
Beautycounter founder Gregg Renfrew is back at the helm the brand,"Gregg Renfrew, Beautycounter's founder, will return to the brand she founded in 2013 and will officially assume the role of Chief Executive Officer as of February 1st. Renfrew launched Beautycounter in 2013, after spending two years preparing its creation, in particular through a list of ingredients that she deemed harmful and potentially harmful and that the Santa Monica, CA-based brand would never use in its formulations. Under her leadership, Beautycounter grew as pioneer of the clean beauty movement and became an iconic brand of the so-called 'clean beauty' movement in the United States, pushing other brands to begin taking steps to increase their own safety standards and transparency. Beautycounter was also involved in several advocacy actions to strengthen the cosmetic legislation in the U.S. or to promote a clear definition of what are ""natural cosmetics"". In 2021, she decided it was time to sell the brand and signed a deal with US capital-investment group Carlyle, which acquired the majority stake of Beautycounter in a transaction valuing it at USD 1 billion. While initial plan was for her to stay on as CEO, she stepped down in 2022 and Marc Rey, formerly the head of Shiseido Americas, was brought on as CEO. The Carlyle Group aimed to increase the brand footprint through an omnichannel business model. Beautycounter thus partnered with beauty retailer Ulta to be available on Ulta.com and in Ulta Beauty stores across the U.S. In addition to Ulta Beauty, Beautycounter intended to continue selling through its own DTC e-commerce site, its network of 45,000 direct sellers in the United States and Canada, and its two standalone stores in New York City and Denver, Colorado. However, Rey departed the company a year later and was replaced by Board Director Mindy Mackenzie as Interim Chief Executive Officer. And eventually, Carlyle decided it was time for Renfrew to return as CEO while Mackenzie stay as a member of the Board of Directors. ""Without question, Beautycounter's greatest opportunities are ahead of us. Consumers are demanding, now more than ever, the things that we have brought to the industry from the very beginning: transparency, health & safety for people and the environment, innovative products, an engaged community and a business that is much more than its bottom line. Who we are, and the work we do, truly matters to so many people. I'm energized to build on our history of disrupting to create a movement for change and a higher industry standard,"" Renfrew said in a statement. ""I am looking forward to getting back to working with the team (including some familiar faces joining me again). It's not going to just be business as usual, and I'm looking forward to raising the bar even higher for our company and the industry at large,"" she continued."

Sisley calls on Lumson for the airless bottle of Supremÿa La Nuit,"Sisley's latest innovation, Supremÿa La Nuit, The Supreme Anti-Ageing Skin Care, was launched in September 2023, after 15 years of research. Designed with chronobiology in mind, the treatment works during the night, a crucial time for skin regeneration. According the brand, the product unlocks every ounce of the skin's regenerative power to help it recover from daily damage sustained during the day, thanks to state-of-the-art active ingredients that target 25 anti-ageing markers for immediate and long-term results. Soft and gentle, its lightweight, fluid texture blends quickly into the skin for a unique sensory experience and scented with the line's signature floral notes. For this precious formula, Sisley has chosen to call on Lumson's skills in airless technologies. The Italian packaging supplier has developed for the brand a custom airless glass bottle adorned with a series of high-end details and precious finishes. Gold reigns supreme: refined and sophisticated, with metallic glares that highlights the lines of the bottle. The gold pump and the overcap covered in brushed gold aluminium with debossed logo give the bottle an elegant allure. The ""mirror-effect"" inner lacquering combined with an external lacquering in shaded semi-transparent shiny gold with UV screen printing on the outside round off the design. According to Lumson, the airless pouch system keeps the formula totally intact and protects it from any external contamination. After use, the glass can be separated from the other components and recycled appropriately."

"TikTok is driving Gen Z spending trends, especially among women","The popularity of TikTok among Generation Z women is proving to be a driver of consumer trends and financial behavior. The app, popular for its short videos, captures the attention of its female audience in particular, with a notable impact on purchasing decisions. In the United States, Generation Z women are more likely to use TikTok. Three quarters spend time on the app, compared with 62% of men of the same age. This difference may explain why young women are driving trends in purchasing and financial behavior. It may also explain why the consumption patterns of Gen Z women are more likely to be influenced by TikTok. According to a survey conducted by Morning Consult, from November 2 to 8, 2022, among a sample of 1,000 Generation Z Americans aged 13 to 25, 53% of women in this age bracket buy beauty products featured on TikTok, versus 13% of men. Women are the biggest spenders on fashion accessories, jewelry and watches, at 35% versus 21% of men, as well as home decor (26% versus 17%), clothing (49% versus 41%) and shoes (34% versus 32%). Men are more keen on books and games (48% vs. 38%), electronics (30% vs. 19%) and sports equipment (16% vs. 15%). Morning Consult analyst, Ellyn Briggs, points out that TikTok, as a platform centering around Gen Z women, defines what is considered ""trendy"" on the internet. This effect is reinforced by influencers who create aspirational content, notably through ""haul"" videos showing recent purchases, often sponsored by brands. However, this display of wealth can be misleading. Although these influencers are roughly the same age as their audience, their often high incomes don't reflect the financial reality of the majority of their followers. Research from LendingTree reveals that Gen Z's non-mortgage debt almost doubled between March 2021 and the first quarter of 2023. On average, young consumers accumulated over US$21,000 in debt, an increase of US$10,797 in two years. While auto and student loans account for nearly 80% of their debt, personal loans and credit card balances have risen sharply since 2021 (+207.4% and +174% respectively)."

Water-based Inner lacquering according to Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie,"At Luxe Pack Monaco last October, Stoelzle Masnières has introduced its new water-based inner lacquering technique. To ensure thorough coverage, accommodating the bottle's specific volume and glass density, the inner lacquering coats the bottle's interior. Since there is a direct contact with the liquid product inside, the glassmaker creates a unique formulation that prevents any risk of fragrance contamination, even with alcohol-containing products, eliminating the need for an internal pocket. ""The lacquer's formulation is meticulously crafted by our in-house team, allowing for customization to meet specific customer requirements. Beyond being water-based, the lacquer is free from CMRs (carcinogenic, mutagenic, or toxic to reproduction), SVHCs (substances of very high concern), and migrating pigments, ensuring product integrity. This commitment to quality aligns with Stoelzle's eco-friendly principles and complies with California Proposition 65 safety standards,"" says the company. The inner lacquering solution provided by Stoelzle Masnières offers design versatility with a range of tones, from translucent to opaque. Ongoing research and development efforts aim to expand the colour palette further, ensuring precision in each shade. However, a dedicated development remains necessary for the development of specific shades. ""This technique seamlessly complements various bottle shapes and sizes, making it a versatile addition to glass bottle decoration. It harmonizes well with other decoration methods, such as screen printing, hot stamping, digital printing, and embossing, typically applied externally,"" concludes Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie."

Wella celebrates its third year as an independent company,"Wella Company has marked its third year as an independent company, demonstrating broad-based growth balanced across brands, categories and geographies. The company achieved high single-digit growth in constant currency in Fiscal Year 2023, which closed at the end of June, cementing its foothold as one of the fastest-growing companies in the hair and nail sector. Wella Company's portfolio of professional and retail hair, nail, and beauty tech brands includes Wella Professionals, O·P·I, ghd, Briogeo, Nioxin, Sebastian Professional, and Clairol.

Squalene market driven by demand from Asia-Pacific and the cosmetic industry,"The global squalene market is expected projected to reach USD 202 million by 2028, at a CAGR of 6.3%, between 2023 and 2028, according to MarketsandMarkets' latest report [1]. Its size was estimated at USD 141 million in 2022. Squalene is a natural emollient and moisturiser that is used in various end-use industries including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, food and others. As a result of its striking resemblance to the skin's natural sebum, it makes a fantastic ingredient for skincare products. It aids in moisture retention, avoiding dryness and keeping the suppleness of skin. The cosmetics segment is estimated to be the largest end-use industry of the squalene market during the forecast period. Squalene has antioxidant properties, which can help protect the skin from oxidative stress and free radical damage. This makes it a valuable ingredient in anti-aging skincare products, as it can help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Increasing demand for cosmetic products specially skin and hair care products is expected to fuel the demand for squalene in cosmetics end-use industry. Europe accounted for the largest market share for squalene, in terms of value, in 2022, with North America being the second-largest market. However, Asia-Pacific is expected to be the fastest growing market over the period, with a rising demand from the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. In the past, the traditional source of squalene, shark liver oil, has faced restrictions due to concerns about overfishing and the conservation of shark populations. Some regions have imposed bans or limitations on the extraction of squalene from shark liver oil. Several regulatory bodies have imposed restrictions such as fixed quotas for shark fishing, which, in turn, has resulted in supply shortage of shark liver and, thereby squalene. These restrictions are expected to remain strictly enforced during the forecast period. As a consequence, the offer of vegetable squalene has grown steadily, however, according to the report, vegetable oils only contain very low squalene quantities and tons of olives and amaranth are therefore required to produce a small quantity of squalene. This has led to high squalene retail prices and creates new opportunity for the players to come up with new technologies to develop squalene from alternative sources. Sugarcane and other sugar-containing biomaterials are identified as the sources of producing squalane (hydrogenated squalene). An environmentally friendly substitute for conventional sources of squalene is biosynthetic squalene. The need for materials obtained responsibly has increased as environmental and social issues become more prominent. Squalene can be produced by biosynthesis without having an adverse effect on the environment. All these factors are expected to drive the demand for biosynthetic sourced squalene during the forecast period. In addition, biosynthetic production allows for better control over the quality and purity of squalene. Manufacturers can ensure that the product meets specific quality standards, making it attractive to industries like cosmetics and pharmaceuticals."

""We are seeing growing interest from industrial companies in power purchase agreements with higher volumes and longer terms,"" adds Markus Lesser, CEO of PNE AG. ""Companies like Gerresheimer are thus actively shaping their own energy transition and securing long-term capacities for clean electricity at attractive conditions in a volatile market environment."" Gerresheimer's glass production locations in Essen, Lohr, and Tettau, which are particularly energy-intensive, will benefit from the power purchase agreement on a priority base. However, the medical systems' production sites in Bünde, Pfreimd, and Wackersdorf are set to benefit as well. Gerresheimer expects that, combined with other planned projects, the newly signed agreement will push green electricity as a share of the power supplied to production sites worldwide to over 50% by the end of 2024. In June 2023, Gerresheimer signed a 32 GWh power purchase agreement with the operator of a hybrid wind and solar farm in India, which will supply electricity to the production site in Kosamba."
"Metsä Board to expand folding boxboard capacity in Husum, Sweden","The Finnish maker of pulp and paperboard is starting the expansion of its folding boxboard production capacity at its Husum mill in Sweden.

""By increasing Husum's production capacity, we are responding to the growing demand for packaging materials that support the circular economy. The first phase of the recently completed renewal of the Husum pulp mill further increases the production of bio-based energy and the mill integrate's energy efficiency. This helps to further reduce the carbon footprint of our products and also helps our customers reach their sustainability targets,"" explained Mika Joukio, CEO of Metsä Board. The additional capacity will be directed mainly to the North American and European markets, where the demand growth for premium lightweight paperboards is expected to continue.

Lessonia invests in a new dry granulation technology,"Specialized from its creation in the manufacture of powder cosmetic ingredients (exfoliants, fine powders, active ingredients, extracts...), Lessonia has acquired a renowned expertise in this area, from grinding and sieving to blending and sterilizing powders. Gradually, the French manufacturer has also developed expertise in dry cosmetic formulation (clay masks, peel-offs, scrubs, cleansing powders...).

With this equipment Lessonia intends to innovate and meet the challenges of the powder cosmetics market. It also enables Lessonia to expand its range of services for manufacturers looking for this type of solutions."

Chromavis says the proximity between the two sites will foster efficient collaboration and coordination, ensuring a seamless flow of innovation and ideas. In addition, the new site will contribute to the reduction of the environmental impact of the operations. There are currently 15 staffs working at the Argos site and the number should gradually rise to 40 by the end of the year. Chromavis anticipates up to 150 people on site over the next two years. ""The Argos factory represents our dedication to pushing boundaries and delivering unmatched cosmetic solutions. It signifies our promise to provide cutting-edge capabilities and unequalled service to our clients worldwide,"" said Chromavis CEO, Thibaut Fraisse. Previously, in 2019-2020, Chromavis Farevainvested 50 million euros in the construction of its new production site and head office in Offanengo, thus bringing together different units on a single 50,000 m2 facility."
"Mibelle launches RejuveNAD, a natural NAD+ booster for skin care","Mibelle Biochemistry has developed a holistic solution to increase NAD+ levels in the skin through cosmetic applications. NAD+ is the oxidized form of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), a coenzyme central to metabolism. NAD+ plays a crucial role in various cellular processes and has received significant attention in anti-aging supplements. ""However, the use of NAD+ in cosmetics failed so far, as the molecule has a very poor stability in formulations and cannot be taken up into skin cells,"" said Mibelle in statement. To overcome this hurdle, the Swiss manufacturer has created RejuveNAD [1], a natural active ingredient that stimulates the endogenous regeneration of NAD+ by activating the enzyme NAMPT (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, formerly known as pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor 1). According to Mibelle, RejuveNAD ""naturally boosts the longevity molecule NAD+ to optimize cellular processes."" The new active ingredient is sourced from sustainably cultivated sunflower sprouts through indoor farming. Clinical studies show that RejuveNAD can counteract at least five hallmarks of aging in the skin simultaneously: mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, loss of proteostasis, epigenetic alteration and genomic instability. As a result, according to Mibelle, the skin looks eight years younger in just 42 days."

Romania is introducing a deposit-refund scheme for plastic bottles,"With Europeans generating packaging waste on an unprecedented scale, the roll-out of plastic deposit-refund schemes is gathering pace across Europe. The latest country to adopt this kind of measure is Romania, which will refund EUR 0.10 for each bottle returned. The day-to-day system that drives the ecological transition and is perfectly in tune with the codes of the circular economy. It involves a deposit-refund scheme for recyclable plastic. In this case, people will receive the equivalent of €0.10 for each plastic bottle returned. The scheme is due to officially launch on November 30. The launch of the RetuRO program is already a victory in itself, since the project has been repeatedly postponed due to pressure from retailers, who were evidently not ready to integrate the process into their operations. Initially, it was due to be rolled out from January 2021, before being postponed until October 1, 2022. Deposit-refund schemes are not new, but they are on the rise in Europe. Plastic bottles have been returnable in Sweden since 1994, while Norway followed suit in 1999 for plastic and aluminum packaging. Germany, for its part, can pride itself on being top of the class, with its deposit system dedicated to all reusable beverage containers rolled out all the way back in 1990, before being bolstered in 2003 by an initiative integrating all single-use containers, such as yogurt pots. The Netherlands adopted a deposit-refund system in 2004, but waited until 2021 to include plastic containers of less than one liter, paying an average of €0.15 for each bottle returned. In 2005, a deposit system was rolled out in Estonia, where €0.10 is returned for each bottle. In the Baltic countries, Lithuania set an example in 2016 when it introduced this kind of scheme, also requiring companies to pay a ""pollution"" tax when less than 95% of their plastic bottles are recycled. In 2022, Slovakia, Latvia and Malta joined the gradual roll-out of the deposit-refund system across Europe."

World's available CO2 'budget' for 1.5C smaller than thought: study,"The amount of CO2 the world can emit and still limit warming to 1.5C is much smaller than previously thought and could be used up in six years at current pollution levels, according to research published on October 30, 2023 [1]. Scientists said the revised ""carbon budget"" meant that humanity was now more likely than not to blow past the Paris Agreement's safer temperature threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius since the preindustrial era. ""The window to avoid 1.5 degrees of warming is shrinking, both because we continue to emit and because of our improved understanding of atmospheric physics,"" said lead author Robin Lamboll, of Imperial College London. But with climate impacts magnifying as warming increases, the researchers stressed that the findings make every fraction of a degree worth fighting for. ""It's not that the fight against climate change will be lost after six years,"" Lamboll said, adding however that if there was not a ""strong downward trajectory"" by then, it would be too late for that 1.5 degree limit. The most recent reports from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said to keep 1.5C in play the world had a carbon budget of some 500 gigatons, from 2020, warning that emissions would need to be slashed in half by 2030. This new assessment, which focuses on the main greenhouse gas CO2, calculated that the budget has now dwindled to 250 gigatons, measured from the beginning of 2023. The study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, was presented as an update to the IPCC figures, incorporating new expectations for the role of other pollutants, particularly the cooling impacts of aerosols — emitted with planet-heating fossil fuels. Meanwhile emissions remain stubbornly high, despite a slight dip at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, and are around 40 gigatons a year. The findings come a month ahead of crucial UN climate negotiations in the United Arab Emirates, tasked with salvaging the Paris deal goals after the latest round of reports from the IPCC made clear that the world was far off track. Co-author Joeri Rogelj, also of Imperial College London, said that high-likelihood options for limiting warming to 1.5C — 50 percent or better — ""are gone"". ""That doesn't mean that we're spinning out of control to three or four degrees, but it does mean that the best estimates suggest that we will be above 1.5 of global warming,"" he said. Earth's average temperature has already risen nearly 1.2C, causing a cascade of deadly and costly weather extremes. While temperatures this year, boosted by the El Niño weather phenomenon, could average out at 1.5C, the Paris target is measured over a period of decades. The IPCC has said 1.5C could be passed by the mid-2030s, with scientists warning this could trigger dangerous tipping points in Earth's fragile life support systems. The Paris deal's main target was to limit warming to ""well below"" 2C, but with greenhouse gas emissions still at record highs the world is currently on a path to warm 2.4C or more by the end of the century. Lamboll said the researchers also calculated for 2C as a ""last resort"" and found the budget for a 50 percent chance of limiting warming to this threshold was 1,220 gigatons. To improve the odds to 90 percent, the budget falls to 500 gigatons, or around 12 years at current emissions. The study should make ""uncomfortable reading"" for policymakers, said a commentary published in Nature Climate Change by Benjamin Sanderson at Norway's Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research, who was not involved in the research. He said the new carbon budget would mean the world would need to reach ""net zero"" emissions by 2034, not in the middle of the century as is envisaged in climate policies across the world. Rogelj said the IPCC had already acknowledged uncertainties in calculating the remaining carbon budget and had given a one in three chance it could be as low as the latest study suggests. ""A one in three chance is far from unexpected, it's like playing Russian roulette with two bullets. Few people will be surprised if someone gets shot with such odds,"" he said."
Unilever Ventures makes first foray into fragrance with The 7 Virtues,"Unilever Ventures, the venture capital arm of the Unilever Group, has joined forces with True Beauty Ventures, a US based investment firm specializing in scaling beauty and wellness brands to make their first foray into the fragrance category. The two companies have acquired minority stakes in the Canadian clean perfumery brand The 7 Virtues. Founded in 2010 by entrepreneur, author and activist Barb Stegemann, the brand pioneered the clean and sustainably sourced fragrance category. The concept took inspiration from her best-selling book: The 7 Virtues of a Philosopher Queen – a woman's guide to living and leading in an illogical world, which was published in 2008. The 7 Virtues crafts perfumes with a high 22% fragrance oil concentration and based on aromatherapy principles. The brand's mantra is Make Perfume Not War, and they do this by advancing period equity in North America and globally. The company is pending B-Corp certification. The 7 Virtues' fragrance collection is available exclusively on the brand's website and at Sephora in 18 countries including Canada, US, UK, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Their fragrance ingredients are sustainably sourced from around the world. The brand has earned the ""Clean + Planet Positive"" seal from Sephora, awarded only to the most ambitious clean and planet-positive brands. The 7 Virtues global year-on-year sales have grown by more than 80% in FY 2023. ""The 7 Virtues has cracked the code on creating long-lasting, perfumes using sustainable ingredients that their loyal customers love, along with their empowering and authentic story,"" says Anna Ohlsson-Baskerville, Partner at Unilever Ventures. ""Driven by its philosophy, The 7 Virtues is elevating from an exciting indie brand to a legacy brand and we're delighted to be a part of its growth journey."" The joint investment from Unilever Ventures and True Beauty Ventures will equip The 7 Virtues with the resources to open a New York office to bolster their team and magnify its global expansion with Sephora to create significant inventory to keep up with the rapid demand. The brand also plans to open a ""Maison"" in Nova Scotia, Canada, where clients can come visit and create their own bespoke perfume with classics like Vanilla Woods and Cherry Ambition. ""When an indie brand like The 7 Virtues outpaces brands with million dollar budgets, they prove the revenue potential is explosive with the right type of support,"" added Rich Gersten, True Beauty Ventures Co-Founder and Partner. Barb Stegemann, the brand's fouder, remains the majority shareholder."
FDA proposes ban on hair relaxers containing formaldehyde,"In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing a ban on using formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasing chemicals as an ingredient in hair smoothing or hair straightening products. Already banned in the European Union (Regulation (EC) 1223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Annex II) and limited to 0.01% in Canada (Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist – Health Canada) in hair straightening products, inhalation of formaldehyde [1] in the form of vapor when occur when the products are heated (by a hair dryer or flat iron, for example). It is therefore suspected to cause respiratory problems and to be linked to an increased risk of certain cancers. ""Use of hair smoothing products containing formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasing chemicals is linked to short-term adverse health effects, such as sensitization reactions and breathing problems, and long-term adverse health effects, including an increased risk of certain cancers,"" said the FDA in the proposed rule. Last year, a research by the US National Institute of Health (NIH) found a link between the use of hair straightening products and a higher uterine cancer risk, with Black women potentially more affected due to higher use. The proposed ban is the first step of the regulatory process. The FDA will now receive public comments on it, and after reviewing those comments, the agency will decide whether further action is needed. The FDA currently discourages consumers from using hair-straightening products that contain formaldehyde and similar ingredients. ""Breathing in formaldehyde gas can be harmful and cause immediate reactions ranging from irritation of the eyes and throat to coughing, wheezing, or chest pain to chronic or long-term problems such as more frequent headaches, asthma, skin irritation, and allergic reactions, and possibly cancer,"" the agency wrote in a fact sheet published on its website."
"Positive Plastics teams up with Roctool to launch a""Positive Surfaces"" kit","Launched by three material experts — Efrat Friedland, Erik Moth-Müller, and Markus Paloheimo — Positive Plastics aims to provide designers, engineers, and product managers a more accepting outlook on plastics. The agency identify and selects the plastic resins and compounds that address the transition of products towards sustainability and circularity. Two years ago, at Fakuma 2021, Positive Plastics launched their first kit, which they annually refresh with innovative plastics. These plastics are suitable for injection moulding to produce high-quality products, such as consumer electronics, home appliances, sports goods, automotive interiors, accessories, etc. At the K2022 they launched their second kit, and now, it is time for the third kit, which was presented at the Fakuma trade show, held on 17-21 in Friedrichshafen, Germany, on the booths of Sabic, Mocom, Poracom and Group Pernoud. For this latest edition, the Positive Plastics team partnered with Roctool to best display the various surface qualities and textures alongside some mechanical properties of the selected materials. This is how was created the Positive Surfaces kit, showcasing materials that are all 100% post-consumer, mechanically recycled grades: PP, PET, ABS, PC/ABS and ABS with glass fibres. Markus Paloheimo, co-founder of Positive Plastics, designed the sample and Group Pernoud performed the mould modifications while Oerlikon Balzers provided the hot runners. Roctool applied their induction moulding Heat and Cool technology to improve the aesthetics of the recycled plastics. ""I simply love the idea behind Positive Plastics. The kit is an excellent tool for any designer who wants to create more sustainable products. But, I firmly believe that the material is not the only parameter to consider. What about the process? How far can we increase the perceived quality of those materials? How can we improve the look and feel of recycled materials without having to coat them? I was missing this perspective, so I offered Positive Plastics to collaborate and investigate this direction,"" said Roctool's CEO, Mathieu Boulanger. ""We are thrilled to equip designers with additional knowhow and tools to create beautiful and circular products"", added Efrat Friedland, co-founder of Positive Plastics. ""Roctool is a proven moulding creation of advanced surfaces, from ultra gloss finishes to very low matte levels. Aside from aesthetic advantages, brands also have a chance to eliminate secondary processes and, as a result, reduce production costs. The induction process improves the overall process, with defects elimination, flow improvement and, depending on the resin grade, cycle time reduction. This is a real chance to bring recyclates to light and boost consumer adoption."""

'Latex lips' outshine the no-makeup look with glamorous gloss,"After 'cherry makeup' or 'pumpkin spice makeup', as here comes a bolder beauty look by the name of 'latex lips.' By bringing glossy lips back into fashion, while ramping up shine to the max, the new trend could outshine the natural or even no-makeup looks that have been riding high since the Covid-19 pandemic. With their catchy name, 'latex lips' spell the return of maximum shine, whatever the shade chosen, for a glossy, almost lacquer-like finish. The idea is to recreate the high-shine effect of latex by using very specific products, including gloss, which is poised to make a comeback. As far as trends go, latex lips didn't actually emerge this fall, with some videos dating back several months on the TikTok social network. But it's clear that the look has been gaining renewed interest since the start of the fall. And this could well intensify in the run-up to the festive season due to the extravagance and audacity synonymous with this colourful and glamorous period. Practically, it's all about shine, or rather ultra-high shine, and about giving your lips a luscious glossy finish with a good dose of lip gloss. There's nothing complicated or expensive about this technique. All you need is a lip pencil, lipstick and lip gloss to get the look. And if possible, use an exfoliator beforehand to get your lips smooth and free of dead skin to optimize the process. Once this has been done, all that's left to do is apply the pencil to the lip contour, with a particularly strong line, then fill in with the lipstick of your choice. Finally, finish off with a coat of transparent gloss — or a gloss in the same shade as the lipstick for an even stronger effect. Unlike many other trends, latex lips has already been adopted by celebrities and influencers such as Dua Lipa, Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner, and has been spotted on the catwalks of leading luxury brands. On TikTok, the #latexlips hashtag has already racked up over 18 million views, reflecting the younger generation's enthusiasm for this seasonal aesthetic."

The origins of Groupe Pochet in France start back to the time of Louis XIII, in 1623, at Le Courval in Normandy's Bresle Valley. It was thus located near all the elements needed to produce the finest bottles, from the sand used to make the glass to water and wood from the forest for the furnaces. Since then, the company has acquired unique multi-material expertise through the mastery and combination of glass, metal, plastic, decoration, and beauty accessories, developed by its expert business divisions: Pochet du Courval (glass), Qualipac (metal and plastic), Solev (decoration) and Aura (objects, cases and accessories).

A privately held French business, Groupe Pochet has been owned by eight generations of what is now the Colonna de Giovellina family, spanning nearly 230 years. The company now owns 12 production sites in three continents with 3,500 employees. In 1970, with the growth of perfume sales in Europe and in America, Henri Colonna de Giovellina employed a sales representative in New Jersey, to develop business contracts with prestigious U.S. brands. It was the beginning of the Pochet of America and Qualipac of America adventure! Since then, the American teams have grown, and the Group opened an office in Los Angeles to develop business with indies and brands form the West coast.

"From fashion shows to social media, red is back on everyone's lips","After latte makeup, a major beauty look of the summer, then with strawberry makeup and chai latte nails, here comes cherry makeup, a bold, uplifting beauty look that puts red center stage as fall's star color. There's plenty to suggest that red could stand out as the star color of the season. For starters, it was seen all over the catwalks of the fall-winter 2023 shows. Christian Siriano, Dolce & Gabbana and Gucci were just some of the fashion houses that opted for makeup looks dominated by this hue synonymous with audacity and passion. It then emerged on social networks with the trend for cherry cola lips, a lipstick shade directly inspired by the famous soda. Four months later, it has become one of the season's leading makeup trends, adorning eyes, lips, nails and cheeks. The #cherrymakeup hashtag already has over 32 million views on TikTok. While cherry red is one of the most popular shades for this trend, carmine, vermilion, tomato and poppy red shades also do the trick. However, on social networks, and TikTok in particular, users are gradually turning to darker reds. The popularity of purple-reds, garnet, burgundy, mahogany, maroon and even deep black/red shades is soaring, as evidenced by the emerging black cherry makeup trend. Thus, fall 2023 seems to have two strong makeup trends: pumpkin spice makeup, dominated by orange hues, and cherry makeup, focusing on shades of red. It remains to be seen which will dominate. For the moment, the former seems to have the upper hand, already proving a hit on TikTok (over 50 million views) and even establishing itself in other areas of beauty. Nail varnish, for example, is getting in on the act, with shades inspired by Starbucks' famous fall drink, and hair coloration and face masks are following suit. In the UK, the craze is such that the SpaSeekers platform hopes to organize the first pumpkin spice latte spa day later this fall. This will include a hot tub experience spiced with cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, pumpkin purée and a drop of coffee, as well as a pumpkin-themed facial and massage."

Koesio selects Coverpla for the launch of their first range of fragrances,"Available since the beginning of summer, Koesio fragrances have turned to Coverpla for the primary packaging of their fragrance collection: refillable glass bottles, caps, pumps and pump covers. The brand's 20 fragrances are grouped into four families (marine, sweet, musk, powdery) for women, men, and young men and young women. A questionnaire evoking life situations helps identify the consumer's olfactory profile to recommend the perfect fragrance. The brand selected three 50ml bottles from Coverpla's catalogue: Vertigo, Ulysse and Venus. They are respectively paired with the Top Passion cap clad in aluminium (the brand selected the black and shiny silver shades), and with the Galet and Gény caps, both injected in Surlyn. Coverpla also supplied the matching pumps and pump covers. This mix-and-match selection was then personalized with a range of lacquers selected by the brand. Eager to offer a 100% refillable collection, Eric Moraldo, the brand's founder, was no less demanding when it came to the design of the packaging. Among his choices in the Coverpla catalogue only the Vertigo design was available in a refillable version. However, driven by the project, Italian glassmaker Bormioli Luigi accepted to produce their Venus and Ulysse bottles with screw necks. As such, these two references are now available in refillable versions. Coverpla and Bormioli Luigi had already cooperated on a similar operation to facilitate Essential Parfums' transition to refillable."

Plant-powered performance in deodorant application,"In the deodorant category, consumers' demand is trending towards safer and more natural ingredients that combine effectiveness in sweat absorption and masking body odor, while respecting their skin and offering a pleasant sensorial experience. Roquette Beauté is emphasizing its leading position in the sustainable beauty sphere and focusing on its range of high-quality, versatile, 100% plant-based ingredients in the deodorant category combining high performance and amazing sensorial experiences to match consumers' expectations! Body odours make us all uncomfortable, and let's be honest, we all face it! They are caused by natural bacteria that are present all over the body, including the armpits. Some people naturally sweat more or less than others, but it is not the secretion of sweat that causes the smell; it is when the odourless sweat mixes with bacteria. Once the bacteria on your skin mixes with the sweat, the creation of volatile malodorous compounds causes an odour. Body odour also can vary from person to person with specific organoleptic properties; one person can sweat excessively but not smell, whereas another because of the type of bacteria on his skin can generate bad odours (sweet, sour, tangy, or like onions). Deodorants are designed to effectively absorb sweat and mask odor while providing a pleasant sensory experience. Roquette Beauté Solutions in Deodorant Answer Consumers' Demand for Safe and Plant-Based Ingredients. It is important to absorb sweat to limit the sweat to mix with bacteria. For this, our ingredient Beauté by Roquette® ST 005 zea mays starch can absorb sweat and is as efficient as talc while being COSMOS approved with a natural index of 1 (ISO 16128) offering consumers a safe and natural alternative. As explained previously, sweat is not only responsible for bad odors but bacteria also are. Beauté by Roquette® LS 007 gluconic acid, caprylyl/capryl glucoside, and cymbopogon citratus (Lemongrass) leaf oil inhibits the growth of microorganisms responsible for unpleasant odor while respecting the skin microbiota. Beauté by Roquette® LS 007 is Microbiome-Friendly approved by MyMicrobiome standard at 1% and 2% of use. In addition, our exclusive range of cyclodextrins acts on sweat malodorous compounds and encapsulates perfumes to offer long-lasting efficacy. Beauté by Roquette® CD 110 hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin encapsulates fragrances with a high ethanol content. Beauté by Roquette® CD 102 cyclodextrin encapsulates axillary malodorous compounds and fragrances in aqueous solutions to mask bad smells and protect fragrances, for a long-lasting release of scents for up to 24 hours. Besides encapsulation of axillary malodorous compounds and fragrances, Beauté by Roquette® CD 100 cyclodextrin also brings sensorial benefits. To go further and provide consumers with a highly natural and readily biodegradable complete solution for efficient deodorant, Beauté by Roquette® DE 006 dextrin acts on skin health. This microbiome-friendly soothing agent can help sensitive and irritated skin while respecting the skin microbiota. Consumers are including their deodorant application within their beauty routine; sensory aspects are as important. Beauté by Roquette® ST 118 sodium carboxymethyl starch has a great capacity for sweat absorption and enables the creation of deodorant formulations that bring freshness to the skin and a soft powdery after-feel.

TNT Group manufactures the cap of Penhaligon's new fragrance portrait,"The Omniscient Mr. Thompson, the latest addition to the Penhaligon's Portraits collection, is a discreet, devoted butler and, above all, the keeper of family secrets, who finds himself a spectator to the Penhaligon's family dramas.

After having focused on lip, eye, and face makeup, La Bouche Rouge recently entered the perfume category with a range of five natural and upcycled fragrances packed in glass bottles that can be refilled with 100% aluminium tubes. Despite a successful funding drive that saw the brand raise EUR 12.5 million since September 2020, the company faced financial difficulties and was placed under judicial administration by the Paris Commercial Court in July. However, the brand's operations continued without interruption and the Court eventually ruled in favour of an acquisition by Beauty Brands Global, a Dubai-based holding company led by Dilesh Mehta, president of British fragrance house Designer Parfums (Cerruti 1881, Ghost Fragrances, Jennifer Lopez, Ariana Grande, Hawaiian Tropic, etc.). Confirming the acquisition, Mr Mehta said: ""This new venture is especially close to my heart and marks the start of a new strategic orientation into luxury and eco-responsible brands (…). La Bouche Rouge carries a unique DNA based on innovation, sophistication and a remarkable eco-responsible business model."" To ensure a smooth transition and to capitalise on the brand's French origins, Beauty Brands Global will set up a new company based in Paris and will maintain the manufacturing laboratory in Orléans. Luxury industry veteran Florence Rollet will join as General Manager while founder Nicolas Gerlier will transition to Creative Director. ""I am confident that the uniqueness of La Bouche Rouge, associated with the entrepreneurship spirit and solidity of the wider Group, will bring a lot of excitement and success for the future,"" added Dilesh Mehta."

Texen designs the cap for Yves Saint Laurent new men's fragrance MYSLF,"For this major launch, the house of Yves Saint Laurent chose an ultra-premium, refillable pack. It entrusted Texen with the development of a specific cap with a multitude of technical and esthetic challenges. With an understated, minimalistic look, MYSLF Eau de Parfum is available in three sizes (100 ml, 60 ml and 40 ml) with an identical cap. For this product, Texen continues its historic collaboration with the brand. Once the body of the cap and its insert are injected, each component is decorated and assembled in-line. The finished product is thus delivered pre-assembled to the brand. The YSL logo is engraved inside the insert and on top of the cap, both perfectly aligned with the cap and the face of the bottle. The aesthetic quality of the decorations is are based on a high-solid varnish with extremely low solvent content, followed by pad printing on the top; this creates a daring contrast between the shiny sides and the matte top, highlighting the elegant ridge of the cap's edges. In addition, the pad-printing hugs the slightest contours of the letters, revealing their texture. The fineness of the grain and the ultra-smooth surfaces can be clearly distinguished, making the technical complexity of making the parts undetectable. ""Texen ran a multitude of tests and invested in the highly sophisticated processes to achieve the level of quality to which it was just committed in partnership with the L'Oréal development teams (calibration and adjustment of industrial processes, decoration techniques, inspection by camera…),"" said the manufacturer of beauty packaging in a statement."

MiYé targets often taboo and misunderstood symptoms of hormonal imbalance. Today, it offers a comprehensive range of 13 products (5 dietary supplements and 8 dermo-cosmetics) centered on performance, naturalness, safety and ease of use. In the short term, MiYé is preparing to develop an awareness-raising and personalized support program via online consultations with naturopaths and micronutritionists. ""Pierre Fabre Laboratories' acquisition of a stake in MiYé two years after our launch is a fantastic endorsement. It's an invaluable opportunity to strengthen our R&D resources so that we can promote the democratization of women's hormonal health and work together to redefine the rules of a new ecology for the female body - one that is holistic, transgenerational and, above all, safer,"" said Caroline de Blignières. According to Frédéric Ennabli, CEO of Pierre Fabre Dermo-Cosmétique: ""Hormonal balance is a major stake that dermo-cosmetics shall address. With MiYé, Caroline de Blignières and Anna Oualid have found a way to support women from puberty to menopause. They have created a brand with a strong territory, with specialized and differentiating products that are now esteemed by consumers, such as the Happy Cycles Serum."" In 2021, Pierre Fabre Invest became the majority shareholder in Ladrôme Laboratoire (specializing in organic skincare and cosmetics), and in 2022, the sole shareholder in Même Cosmetics (specializing in wellness treatments for cancer patients)."
"Trends: One in 10 Japanese are older than 80, government data","More than 10 percent of Japanese people have crossed 80 years or older for the first time, new official data showed, as the nation faces a rapidly greying population. Government data released on October 17, ahead of Monday's ""Respect for Aged Day"" national holiday, also showed that the share of Japan's population at 65 or older expanded to a record 29.1 percent from 29.0 percent a year ago. The level compared with second-ranked Italy's 24.5 percent and third-ranked Finland's 23.6 percent, according to the internal affairs ministry. ""Japan has the highest percentage of elderly population in the world,"" the ministry said in a press release. For decades, Japan has seen its population shrink and grow older as young people delay marriage and children. The ministry said that with the baby boomer population turning 75 or older, Japan's 124.4 million people are continuing to grow older. Around 12.59 million people are 80 or older while 20 million are 75 or older, it said. However, retirement and elderly care programs have not been upgraded. As a result, more than nine million elderly people (65+) are working, accounting for 13.6 percent of the workforce, or one in seven workers in Japan. Actually, a quarter of all elderly in Japan have jobs, less than South Korea's 36.2 percent, but far ahead of other developing countries such as the United States at 18.6 percent, and France at 3.9 percent. More than a third of people between70 to 74 have jobs in Japan, the data showed. By 2040, Japan's elderly population is projected to account for 34.8 percent of the population."

"Fake belly buttons, the latest beauty craze among China's social media users","Followers of the trend can get around 30 fake belly buttons for the equivalent of EUR 0.50 on Pinduoduo, one of China's largest e-commerce platforms. An offer that seems to appeal to thousands of regular users of the Douyin and Xiaohongshu social networks, as recently reported by the South China Morning Post. Originating in China, this phenomenon is starting to spread on social platforms like TikTok, showing that ideals surrounding body image are still very much a part of women's daily lives, all over the world. Videos posted under the hashtags dedicated to these fake belly buttons, whether on Douyin or Xiaohongshu — two of China's most popular social platforms — show young women cutting out and then sticking on what look like temporary tattoos in the shape of a navel, a few centimeters above the real orifice. The latter is concealed by pants, a skirt or shorts, while the fake navel is highlighted by a crop top. For those involved, the purpose of this ploy is to create an optical illusion. Indeed, fans of the trick claim that a belly button raised by around 10 centimeters will allow a skirt or pair of pants to be pulled up by the same amount, subsequently lengthening legs and slimming the silhouette. Or at least giving the illusion of doing so. On Xiaohongshu, videos are accompanied by captions extolling the virtues of the trick. ""It's not a fake belly button patch, it's a tool to lengthen short legs!"" one user posted with their video. ""Every beauty has two belly buttons! Here's the secret to lengthening your legs!"" says another user. In addition to applying the temporary tattoo, some women also apply makeup around the area to ensure a more harmonious effect. While this craze for fake belly buttons poses no risk to physical health, it does, however, raise questions about the persistence of certain body image ideals, such as equating long legs with a standard of beauty to be attained. And it's just one example among many. Fake freckles, fake breasts, fake buttocks and even fake noses are just some of the 'tools' that abound on today's social networks, when it's not a question of makeup tricks designed to refine or smooth this or that part of the face, again reflecting a desire to attain a certain beauty standard. Ultimately, these temporary tattoos are akin to the social media filters that are the subject of much debate. As well as proving a source of stress and anxiety for young people, they can also contribute to body dysmorphic disorder, the tendency to obsess over an imaginary flaw. A phenomenon that, in turn, increases stress and anxiety, and impacts self-esteem. ""I wonder how these women can still face their true body figures after removing the fake belly button stickers, breast pads, buttock pads, and other enhancements,"" observed one internet user, quoted by the South China Morning Post. Numerous studies have suggested that social networks, through their filters and editing apps, can have a negative impact on the mental health of users, particularly the very young. It's a fact that worries parents the world over, to the point that some would now like to see beauty filters subject to an age limit, or even banned altogether. Despite the emergence of numerous movements in favour of the acceptance and appreciation of all body types, the ideals linked to appearance and to the 'perfect body' — if that exists at all — die hard, demonstrating the need for action to limit associated risks and dangers."

Sustainability: How to measure the impact of cosmetic products?,"Taking place in Paris on October 30 - 1st November 2023, the next edition of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit will discuss the various impacts of cosmetic and personal care products. The summit will feature green ingredients, sustainability metrics, and biodiversity & customer impacts. The highlights of the agenda include: For the first time, the summit will give detailed insights into how sustainability associated impacts of personal care products are measured. Professor Miguel Mendonca Reis Brandao from KTH University (Sweden) will host a workshop on sustainability metrics. He will show how environmental, social, and financial indicators can be utilised by cosmetic and related firms in their sustainability programmes. The EcoBeautyScore Consortium will give an update on its science-based approach to measure impacts and its harmonised scoring system for cosmetic products. Ioana Dobruscu from Water Footprint Implementation will explain how operators can measure the water footprint of such products. Aurelie Weinling from Garnier will show how the brand is reducing its impacts via its Green Beauty initiative. Garnier has pledged to move away from virgin plastic and to have CO2 neutral factories by 2025. The climate emergency is putting pressure on cosmetic companies to reduce their carbon emissions. Lucy Kirkup from ClimatePartner will discuss how operators can measure, reduce, and offset their carbon emissions. Details will be given of its certification scheme, which is gaining traction with cosmetic brands. Sabine Kaestner from one of Europe's leading natural cosmetic companies Lavera, will share their experiences in adopting the ClimatePartner label. A growing number of cosmetic & raw material firms are looking at adopt regenerative agriculture because of its sustainability merits. Davines is a frontrunner, setting up the European Regenerative Organic Center in partnership with the Rodale Institute. Its Research Director Dario Fornaro will give details of the cosmetic raw materials it is growing according to regenerative agriculture, which improves soil fertility, enhances biodiversity, sequestrates carbon, and can have socio-economic benefits. Coconut oil is widely used in personal care products, however the industry is facing a crisis. Many of the coconut palms in South-East Asia are reaching the end of their lives, whilst farmers are leaving the industry. Laura Schlebes from AAK will explain how the Sustainable Coconut Charter aims to improve farmer livelihoods, lessen the carbon footprint of coconuts and boost supply to meet rising global demand. AAK is one of the first signatories of the Sustainable Coconut Charter. At last year's UN Biodiversity conference, 195 countries made a commitment to protect 30% of land and water by 2030. An industry expert will discuss the implications of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, especially in terms of sourcing of cosmetic ingredients. Emma Trogen, Deputy Director General of Cosmetics Europe, will share some of the initiatives the industry association is undertaking to protect biodiversity. New technologies are facilitating the move to green cosmetic ingredients. There is high interest in precision fermentation as it can produce sustainable alternatives to petroleum-based ingredients. The Danish start-up Biosyntia will show how it is using fermentation techniques to produce cosmetic ingredients. Dr. Prateek Mahalwar, Founder of Bioweg, will explain how it is using new technologies to make micropowders and rheology modifiers from agri-food waste. The start-up recently partnered with Ginkgo Bioworks to create sustainable alternatives to plastics. Other speakers will cover innovations in upcycled materials and ingredients for waterless cosmetics. Details will be given of the new EU deforestation-free regulation which ensures products sold in Europe do not come from deforested or degraded land. The regulation applies to palm oil, soya, cocoa, and other agricultural commodities. Farmforce will show how its technology can help operators develop deforestation-free supply chains for their raw materials. Greenwashing is a major issue in the cosmetics industry, as many products are marketed as natural, organic, vegan, free-from, etc. without meeting any industry standards or certification. The EU Green Claims Directive aims to establish clear criteria for companies to make such claims. The Obelis Group will give details on the proposed directive and its marketing implications to brands. Various studies show the highest environmental impact of cosmetic and personal care products is at the consumer level. For rinse-off products like shampoos and soaps, over 95% of carbon emissions are from consumer use. Approaches to encourage responsible consumption and disposal of cosmetic & personal care products will be discussed. Dr. Helen Holmes from the Sustainable Consumption Institute (University of Manchester) will discuss approaches to modify consumer behaviour for sustainability. Julien Kaibeck from the Slow Cosmetique Association will share its experiences in encouraging consumers to make greener choices when buying personal care products. As sustainability issues rise on the corporate agenda, there are questions about the future. How will raw materials and packaging change so there will be more sustainable cosmetics? How are emerging trends likely to influence product development? How will consumer behaviour evolve in the coming years? The futurist Monique Large (PollenConsulting) will give some of her predictions in the opening keynote of the summit. Organized by Ecovia Intelligence, the European edition of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit will be hosted at the Crowne-Plaza - Republique Paris.

Pace of increase in CO2 concentration has increased three-fold: report,"The pace at which the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is increasing — due mostly to the burning of fossil fuels — has jumped three-fold in five decades, according to the State of the Climate in 2022 report published by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In 2022, there were on average 417 parts per million (ppm) of the planet-warming gas in the air, up 2.2 ppm from the year before. This is 50 percent more than pre-industrial levels. Annual growth in global mean carbon dioxide averaged across the last decade has tripled since the 1960s, it found. Unsurprisingly, the level recorded in 2022 is ""the highest in the modern atmospheric record and in paleoclimate records dating back as far as 800,000 years"", the report noted. Throughout 2022, ""the climate continued to respond to the ongoing increase in greenhouse gases and resulting warming,"" it added. Temperatures reached record-breaking highs during the year across multiple continents, including peaks above 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) in Western Australia and 47C in the American southwest. Sustained heatwaves ravaged South and East Asia, with China enduring the worst heatwave ever recorded anywhere in the world. Tempered by the impact of a climate-cooling La Nina, a naturally occurring weather phenomenon across the southern Pacific, 2022 was ranked as the fifth or sixth warmest year since reliable records began in the mid-19th century. The last eight years — 2015 through 2022 — are the eight warmest on record, and 2023 is on track to be warmer than any of them, the EU's climate monitoring service said Wednesday. The increase in global drought area that began in mid-2019 continued into 2022, according to the report. August 2022 saw a new high for the percentage of global land area — 20 percent — experiencing moderate or worse drought conditions. More frequent and intense heatwaves last year also contributed to the second-greatest loss of mass for mountain glaciers across the globe since satellite tracking began in the 1970s. Glaciers in the Swiss Alps lost a record six percent of their volume. Across the two-thirds of the planet covered by seas, nearly 60 percent of ocean surface waters experienced at least one marine heatwave, according to the report. Oceans have trapped and stored more than 90 percent of the excess heat generated by global warming, keeping Earth's land surface liveable for most of its inhabitants."
Knoll Packaging shortlisted for two UK Packaging Awards,"Knoll Packaging has been shortlisted for two UK Packaging Awards, Knoll Ecoform Molded Pulp Compacts in the Best New Concept Award category and Knoll Gives Back Day in the Corporate Social Responsibility Initiative of the Year.

Each location, including USA, UK, Europe, Hong Kong, China and Philippines, volunteered with a local non-profit organization of their choice in activities such as cleaning up beaches and local trails, tree planting, volunteering with underserved communities, and assist at a local food pantry. Knoll Gives Back Day aligns with our values and mission to protect our people and planet and continues to raise employee's awareness on social and environmental issues by having them involved in these initiatives. ""Social and environmental issues that each community experiences are unique which might not be widely known. We believe that awareness can spark action and Knoll Gives Back Day is a great opportunity for our teams globally to understand what is happening in their local community.

Castor oil sourcing: Inolex joins Sustainable Castor Association,"Inolex has joined the not-for-profit organization founded by Arkema, BASF, Jayant Agro-Organics Ltd, and Solidaridad. The Sustainable Castor Association (SCA) is focused on enhancing the environmental, social, and economic profile of castor farming throughout the supply chain. The aim is to enable a more traceable and verified castor oil supply chain through certification, and to build programs that support the livelihood of castor farmers. The castor standard code, SuCCESS, which is managed by the SCA, is the standardized certification criteria for sustainable castor. Currently SuCCESS certified supply represents about 1% of global castor oil supply and includes over 6,200 farmers and 6,000 hectares. In addition to building traction in the certified castor supply chain, the community around SCA supports farmers through educating on good agricultural practices that boost yields, create water reduction efficiencies. According to Inolex, ""castor is an inherently sustainable crop."" Indeed, it is naturally drought resistant with the ability to thrive in marginal soil, it can grow on rotation with staples such as cumin, mustard, and other local crops, the plant does not compete as a food source, and what is not extracted from the seed pod as castor oil is generally repurposed as fertilizer. Further, because the cash crop has a long storage life, the farmers have more flexibility and autonomy in the marketplace. 80% of the world's supply of castor seed is produced in India by smallholder farmers and their families. While these benefits are extensive, ""there are always opportunities to better support growers and contribute to improved outcomes via the environmental, social, and governance impacts of farming,"" said Audrey Wesson, Corporate Sustainability Manager at Inolex. ""When we look at the work that the Sustainable Castor Association members are doing, all of these actions are positively impacting farmer livelihood, local ecosystems, and the security and sustainability of the value chain,"" added Wesson. ""We are excited to be part of SCA."""

Global Bioenergies accelerates the ramp-up of its industrial capacities,"The company, which specializes in the conversion of plant-derived resources into chemical compounds used in many cutting-edge fields such as cosmetics and energy, has raised its industrial ambitions. In order to meet the expectations of its partners in terms of decarbonization, Global Bioenergies has decided to focus as of now on a plant project with greater production capacity than initially scheduled. This new plant, designed to produce 10,000 tonnes of isobutene and derivatives per year (compared to 2,000 tonnes in the previous project), will target the cosmetics market, followed by the sustainable aviation fuel market, for which Global Bioenergies has just obtained ASTM certification. ""We have delivered our first orders and our first-half revenue totalled €2.4 million. Guided by the current trend of a ramp-up in renewables, along with strong markets traction on the topic and technical progress regarding our direct path process, we are changing our roadmap. The commercial activities of the Pomacle unit, while generating sales but with a low associated margin, are no longer a priority. We are now focusing all our efforts on building this larger plant, scheduled to come on stream at the end of 2027. At the same time, we are already starting to deploy our technology in other regions and using other feedstocks alongside international industrial groups,"" said Marc Delcourt, co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies. For L'Oréal, Global Bioenergies' biggest shareholder via its BOLD (Business Opportunities for L'Oréal Development) investment fund, the plan for a large-capacity plant resonates with the environmental challenges and commitments taken as part of its L'Oréal for the Future programme. ""Our commitment for 2030 is for 95% of the ingredients used in our formulas to be bio-sourced, derived from abundant minerals or from circular processes. This new ambition for Global Bioenergies will make bio-sourced isobutene derivatives accessible at competitive prices to cosmetics markets and, beyond that, will enable everyone to play an active part in the environmental transition,"" highlighted Ana Kljuic, Vice President R&I L'Oréal for the Future & Green Sciences. Global Bioenergies will release design and construction schedules for the new plant by the end of 2023. After having started in 2022 the commercial production of the first biobased isododecane — Isonaturane® 12, a key ingredient for the makeup industry — Global Bioenergies launched at in-cosmetics 2023 the first natural and renewable Isohexadecane, under the trade name Isonaturane® 16."

Coty posts excellent results and relaunches Marc Jacob Beauty,"The owner of Kylie Cosmetics, Rimmel, Covergirl and Bourjois, has reported a strong Q4 performance, with double digit growth in both sales and profits. For the full fiscal year 2022-2023, closed on June 30, Coty posted sales growth of 12%, to EUR 5.55 billion, ahead of expectations. The group's operating income more than doubled to USD 543.7 million (EUR 500 million). ""In sum, Coty is successfully executing on the strategy we laid out 3 years ago,"" said the company in a statement. The news follows a series of major announcements, including Adidas license renewal, sale of Coty's remaining Wella shares and, most recently, the relaunch of Marc Jacobs Beauty. Long-time allies in the fragrance category, the two companies have indeed added the beauty category to their agreement while extending the license for over 15 years. ""The expansion and extension of our longstanding agreement with the house of Marc Jacobs, now in its 20th year, is a testament to the enduring success of our partnership and the brand's limitless potential. Through its partnership with Coty, Marc Jacobs' Fragrances have achieved great success, growing to become one of the top 10 female fragrances world-wide, thanks to the iconic Daisy Marc Jacobs and Perfect Marc Jacobs franchises. The revival of Marc Jacobs' cosmetic portfolio, now in partnership with Coty, is eagerly anticipated by consumers around the world who have been campaigning for its return. This agreement reinforces Coty's position as a go-to partner for global fashion houses and brands that share our ambition of creating leading beauty portfolios,"" said Sue Nabi, Coty's CEO. The first Marc Jacobs Beauty collection originally launched in 2013, in partnership with Kendo Brands, and was discontinued at the end of 2021."
Texen creates a PET version of the iconic Le Blanc de Chanel foundation case,"The French luxury brand has entrusted Texen with the transition to PET of the compact case of its Le Blanc foundation, one of its iconic references. The choice of this complex material represented a strategic step for the brand and a new challenge for Texen. Until now, this large, refillable compact was crafted from ABS, it is now made entirely from PET (with the exception of the pin and mirror). With this strategic choice, the brand is anticipating changes in European legislation on cosmetic materials and pursuing its quest for eco-design. Chanel chose to switch its packaging to PET, all the while maintaining their rigorous technical and esthetical requirements. Another recent development, the big-sized compact for Les Beiges, involved a number of challenges for Texen because of its large size and injected thin walls in rPET. This time, Chanel opted for PET and not rPET for reasons of colour stability, given the compact's pale shades. ""This latest development demonstrates the numerous challenges imposed by the transformation and decoration of a new material,"" said Texen in a statement. Texen drew on the experience gained during the development of the previous compact to better industrial processes with the design, but also to challenge its partner suppliers. The complex injection of PET was a big challenge, which required multiple test runs, in particular for the lid, with a top and edges in different shades. To inject the edges, Texen used the ""Besst Transform"" induction technique based on Roctool's engineering [1]. ""The part has perfect aesthetics without any surface flaws,"" highlights Texen. The brand's logo is then applied to the center of the lid using hot stamping. Each part was injected then decorated in-line with a high-solid varnish. The final assembly was performed on a production line equipped with an onboard ""zero defect"" inspection module for each and every part. The lid and hinge are joined with a pin compatible with the mechanical properties of the material. Inside, the pan is clipped into the well, allowing the consumer to easily replace it with a new refill."

Americans are concerned about the impact of beauty filters on self-esteem,"A recent survey conducted by StyleSeat in the United States reveals that a significant proportion of the population would like to impose an age limit on their use, or even ban them outright. The beauty and wellness booking platform asked 700 Americans to test the ""Bold Glamour"" filter, which guarantees a flawless face, and then asked them about their perception of the beauty filters popular on social networks. And the results were clear: three out of five respondents thought they were bad for their mental health, and 70% feared they would have a negative impact on self-esteem. Contrary to popular belief, younger people are not more inclined to turn to beauty filters when posting photos or videos on social networks, or at the very least they fear their effects as much or more than other demographics. Nearly three quarters of Generation Z respondents (72%) think that these filters have a negative impact on mental health. And with good reason: these applications, which modify users' appearance, often to meet certain unrealistic beauty standards, could be linked to low self-esteem or even body dysmorphic disorder, which is characterized by an obsession with non-existent or imperceptible physical defects. The survey reveals that one in three Americans would like to look the same in real life as they do when they look at themselves through a beauty filter. In this regard, Americans are even more concerned about the impact of beauty filters on the mental health of younger people. Many social platforms have rules and restrictions in place for younger users, especially teenagers and children under the age of 16 (the age required to register depends on the country of origin). But this does not apply to beauty filters. For this reason, one in three Americans now believe that beauty filters should be subject to an age requirement, and one in five believe they should be banned outright. It's important to keep in mind that beauty filters totally modify appearance according to very specific stereotypes: a flawless complexion, a slimmed-down nose, a perfectly sculpted chin and cheekbones, luminous eyes... A perception of beauty far removed from reality, particularly when taking the diversity of the world's population into account. So it's hardly surprising to learn that, after viewing their faces through the ""Bold Glamour"" filter, around 20% of those surveyed said they felt less sure of themselves. And an overwhelming majority (80%) already believe that this type of filter has transformed beauty standards. The impact of social media on mental health and self-esteem is a concern not only in the USA, as shown by a survey conducted by Edelman DXI for Dove, in collaboration with Mental Health Europe, and the e-Enfance association, published last spring. Carried out among the general population, as well as parents, teenagers and experts in youth mental health, it highlighted the growing concern of healthcare professionals about the use of filters in France. More than half of them (52%) felt that content encouraging the intensive use of filters could be the cause of feelings of anxiety, as could content showing perfect bodies or bodies far removed from reality (44%)."

"Dior, Givenchy and Kenzo support a greener production of perfume alcohol","The three perfume houses of the LVMH group will collaborate with Cristal Union — a French agricultural cooperative that brings together more than 9,000 beetroot growers and employs more than 2,000 people to produce and market sugar, alcohol and bioethanol – to improve the agricultural practices in the beetroot sector. The cultivation of beets is a key element in the perfumery supply chain since it produces the alcohol that serves as a support for most luxury fragrances. This year, Parfums Christian Dior, Givenchy Parfums and Kenzo Parfumsare financing a project aimed at supporting the agroecological transition of 380 hectares of beetroot cultivation in the east of France to produce the equivalent of 45% of their alcohol needs (""Mass balance"" approach). The project is based on the Regeneration Index, a tool developed by French NGO Pour une Agriculture du Vivant. It allows to assess the agro-ecological score of farms and to support farmers on their path to progress. ""This collaboration sets an important milestone on the path traced by the LIFE 360 program towards the regeneration of 5 million hectares of ecosystems. Beetroots hold a prominent place in the supply chain of the LVMH Beauty business group. The implementation of new, virtuous production models in this sector represents a key step on the way to our commitments,"" highlights Hélène Valade, Environmental Development Director of the LVMH group. In addition, and for a period of five years, LVMH finances a Research & Development program with Cristal Union within 12 farms with the objective to test new agronomical practices with a particular focus on: – Reducing nitrogen inputs in beetroot cultivation by optimizing cover crops. – Limiting the addition of fertilizers of mineral origin through an increased use of organic matter. As part of these trials, the three Maisons will work with Genesis, selected by the Maison des Start-ups LVMH and awarded for its tool measuring the health and quality of soils. Genesis will be in charge of collecting precise data about soil health on a regular and geolocated basis in order to assess the impact of agricultural practices on their health and their contribution to ecosystem functions. Perfumery brands have made very different sustainability choices when it comes to perfumery alcohol. Some of them, usually niche brands, have opted for organic alcohol, but quantities of organic beet alcohol is very limited and they usually have to switch to organic sugar cane alcohol. Others, like Coty, have opted for synthetic alcohol from carbon recycling. The transformation of the perfume industry in a context of ecological transition will be one of the key topics of the next Fragrance Innovation Summit on November 30 in Paris."
Amyris files for bankruptcy and sells consumer brands to focus on ingredients,"Amyris and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries have commenced voluntary Chapter 11 proceedings in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The company said the decision was taken in order to facilitate its business and financial reorganization. Amyris intends to streamline its business portfolio to focus on its core competencies in R&D and the scale-up, commercialization, and applications development of its sustainable ingredients derived through biofermentation.

EU industry calls for a swift ratification of the agreement with Mercosur,"Cosmetics Europe, Cefic and a coalition of 17 other business associations representing different European industrial sectors call for a swift ratification of the EU-Mercosur Free Trade Agreement. In an open letter sent to the President of the European Parliament, Ms. Metsola, the President of the European Council, Mr. Michel, and the President of the European Commission, Ms. Von der Leyen, they claim the agreement is key to preserve their competitiveness and secure supply chains. The text was supported by a wide variety of signatories including the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA); The Brewers of Europe; the European Confederation of the Footwear Industry (CEC); the Committee for European Construction Equipment (CECE), the EU wine companies committee (CEEV); the European Association of the Machine Tool Industries (CECIMO); the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic); the European traders in agri-food commodities (CELCAA); the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA); the European association of cosmetic industries (Cosmetics Europe); the Confederation of National Associations of Tanners and Dressers of the European Community (COTANCE); the European Dairy Association (EDA); the European Services Forum (ESF); the European Apparel and Textile Confederation (EURATEX); the Association of European Chambers of Commerce and Industry (EUROCHAMBRES); the retail sector (EuroCommerce); Europe's Technology Industries (ORGALIM); SpiritsEUROPE; and Toy Industries of Europe (TIE). ""Free, fair and sustainable trade is key for our industry to leverage its strengths. The EU-Mercosur agreement is one of the key Free Trade Agreements that can foster multilateralism across regions.

The ratification of EU-Mercosur agreement should be a priority on Europe's agenda,"" said Marco Mensink, Cefic Director General. Finalized in 2019, the EU-Mercosur agreement provides for a gradual reduction of nearly 90% in customs duties between the two zones over a period of 10 to 15 years depending on the sector. However, its signature and ratification came up against the hostility of a large proportion of citizens, opposition from the European agricultural sector, and hostility from several left-wing political forces. The agreement has also raised many questions about its impact on the environment."

Nutricosmetics: Seppic unveils the efficacy of Ceramosides on hair,"Seppic continues its development in the nutricosmetics sector after the acquisition of EPI France. The subsidiary of Air Liquide Healthcare, which specializes in the manufacture of specialty ingredients, has unveiled a new clinical study demonstrating the efficacy on hair of active ingredient Ceramosides, obtained from wheat lipids and rich in phytoceramides. A gold standard clinical study was carried out on a panel of women of all ages suffering from non-pathological hair loss. In only three months, the results highlighted significant effects on various key hair parameters: – A significant growth by 12.5% in hair length vs. placebo; – A 2-fold increase in the number of hairs in the growth phase: +11,000 (vs. less than 5,000 for the placebo group); – A significant reduction by 27% in hair loss vs. placebo; – A significant improvement in hair resistance to breakage through enhanced hair elasticity; – A significant reduction of scalp sebum in women with a tendency towards oiliness. This new study thus extends the field of application of Ceramosides, whose anti-aging and moisturizing efficacy on the skin has already been proven by three clinical studies. ""At a time when one in two women is likely to suffer from excessive hair loss in their lifetime [1], the hair care segment is increasingly gaining interest within the global nutricosmetics market,"" said Seppic in a statement. ""The maintenance and renewal of healthy hair is directly correlated with its lipid composition. This is why ceramides, known for their involvement in the formation of intracellular lipids, play a key role and act as a barrier protecting the hair cuticle."" Ceramosides is vegan, guaranteed with no GMOs, no additives, no preservatives and is gluten-free. It is also certified kosher and is available in organic grade."

""Our new Workshop locations are proving to be something very special,"" said Hilary Lloyd, VP of Brand & Corporate Social Responsibility, The Body Shop North America. ""If activism is the soul of our brand, our retail locations are the heart. This is why we put so much effort into our Chagemaker's Workshop stores.

This is The Body Shop's sixth Changemaker's Workshop location in Canada. Other locations are in Vancouver, Oshawa, Calgary, Burnaby, and Edmonton. There are five more stores set to open this year. A key feature for each Canadian Workshop store is that they reflect the local communities they serve and each store is unique with a variety of local artists designing in-store murals, installations and/or sculptures. In the Yorkdale location, The Body Shop presents a custom piece of textile art by multidisciplinary Toronto-based artist, Laura Moore. The piece, a handmade memory quilt, was inspired by the brand's 40+ years of activism work in Canada, made with The Body Shop materials sourced across the brand's Canadian employee collective as well as from the previous Yorkdale store. The Body Shop has a long history of using textiles as tools for change, upcycled tote bags, aprons, t-shirts, scarves – all designed to communicate our Canadian activism efforts over the years.

Boots to shut 300 stores across UK over the next year despite strong growth,"Despite posting strong sales over the latest quarter, British health and beauty retail chain intends to continue cutting store numbers in the UK. Boots has announced plans to close a further 300 stores across the UK in the next year. This will result in 1,900 branches left across the UK from a base of 2,200, however Boots does not plan redundancies as staff will be offered work at nearby stores. ""In addition to uplifting existing stores, over the next year Boots will continue to consolidate a number of stores in close proximity to each other. Evolving the store estate in this way allows Boots to concentrate its team members where they are needed and focus investment more acutely in individual stores with the ambition of consistently delivering an excellent and reliable service in a fresh and up to date environment,"" said the retailer in a statement. During the three months ended 31 May 2023, Boots' retail sales grew by 13.4%. The retailer said it represents its ninth consecutive quarter of market share growth with gains across all categories, led by beauty. Indeed, beauty sales were up over 18% year on year, led by skincare and May saw the biggest week for the category outside of Christmas. City centre flagship and travel stores saw the biggest increase, while digital sales also continued to grow, up 25.2% year on year. Overall, e-commerce is a very dynamic channel for beauty products in the United Kingdom and the phenomenon has only increased since the pandemic. A trend that probably explains the retailer's desire to close its less profitable stores in the country. ""Our focus on offering our customers the best in healthcare and beauty, together with a continued commitment to great value, has been well received, and it is lovely to see more people choosing to shop with Boots. It is particularly pleasing to see our owned brands proving popular, including an exceptional No7 performance,"" said Seb James, Managing Director, Boots UK and ROI."

TNT designed the latest Loubimar miniature for Louboutin Beauty,"The Spanish group Puig entrusted TNT Group with the creation of the Loubimar 9ml miniature, echoing the 90ml size of the Loubimar Eau de Parfum Légère. This is the fourth miniature that TNT Group has designed for the Louboutin Beauty Loubiworld 11-miniature collection, that is now presented in a newly unveiled box. The stylized cap recalls the marine world that inspired this eau de parfum with notes of citrus and salt water. It is adorned with a ship's anchor and mooring line posed delicately upon a sea urchin and is finished with a rose-gold e-coating. A PP (polypropylene) insert ensures its retention. Producing this new cap was a real challenge for TNT Group, due to its small size.

For example, there is a great quality of detail in the representation of the scarab, the snake and the falcon.

"TikTok's multi-use makeup trend claims to save time, money and the planet","'Multi-use makeup', TikTok's latest viral beauty tip, which has now racked up over seven million views, involves using just one product for your entire beauty routine. According to its promoters, it's a time- and money-saving hack, which also helps to protect the environment by banishing a whole load of plastic from the bathroom. User @EhlieLuna, with over 35,000 followers, is the creator of one of the most viewed multi-use makeup tutorials on TikTok. In this short video, we see her crafting her entire beauty look with a single product, in this case a matte liquid lipstick from Sephora. And contrary to what you might think, the young woman doesn't just use it to enhance her lips, but also uses it as eyeshadow and blush. This trick hasn't gone unnoticed, and has even gained quite a following with a lot of positive reactions about the beautiful result, and the fact it can also be a means to save time and money while consuming less plastic. A word of warning, however: not all cosmetics are designed to be applied anywhere on the face and body! Some sensitive areas, such as around the eye, require suitable products. This is by no means the first time that users of a social network have used a beauty product, or any other object, for something completely different from its intended function. In recent years, TikTokers have got creative using a lip pencil to create a smoky eye, swapping their primer for lube, using an eyebrow pencil to get the perfect shade of lipstick, or using a blush to camouflage under-eye bags and dark circles. All these tricks have not only gone viral, but have also been adopted by many brands, including beauty giants."

Inaugurated at the end of 2022, Afyren Neoxy – the world's first plant for the industrial-scale production of bio-based carboxylic acids from sugar beet by-products – has already manufactured several metric tons of acids and delivered the first batches. ""The production and delivery of the first lots of biobased organic acids from the Afyren Neoxy plant marks an important stage in the industrial start-up of this first-of-its-kind plant. These significant achievements are the fruit of the highly motivated Afyren and Afyren Neoxy teams, whose commitment I salute.

With Tap to Pay on iPhone, client advisors in the US stores of the LVMH Group will have the possibility to accept Apple Pay, contactless credit and debit cards, and other digital wallets anywhere in the store simply by using their iPhone and a partner-enabled iOS app. No additional hardware is needed, regardless of the purchase amount.

Besides their sustainable and superior performance profile, the non-ionic nature of APGs makes the formulation with other surfactants versatile. APGs are widely used in different applications within personal care, home care, industrial and institutional cleaning, industrial formulations and agriculture markets."
Sweet Paradox: Chromavis' new proposal at MakeUp in Paris 2023,"On the occasion of MakeUp in Paris 2023 Chromavis presents Sweet Paradox, a quest to venture beyond the expected definition of performance and colour of a make-up product. This new proposal focuses on multiplied product identities, unimaginable colour results and indefinable sensorialities that challenge the senses in the most diverse ways. The Sweet Paradox concept is explored through three collections which focus respectively on the three main features of a make-up product: sensoriality, colour, and performance. ""Untold Senses"" collection represents a hymn to investigating new forms of expression through unbiased creativity. Going beyond existing definitions, the collection encapsulates ultra-concentrated fluids with an ethereal lightness, powders with transformative and indefinably touches, flares of color that melt into misty blur tones, textures of unexpected plasticity and pure-light payoffs that come in breath-taking visuals with spectacular reliefs. ""Spare Spectra"" collection ventures into unknown kaleidoscopes. The paradoxical nature of the notion of colour itself is here explored in new forms, going as far as imagination can extend. Products showcase new possibilities of colour artistry, boldly pairing warm and cool shades, walking the fine line between blur and shine, playing with daring visuals and shifting tones, revealing the softest creamy core of glassy crystals. ""Altered Ego"" collection acts as a reminder of the illusory nature of physical perceptions: nothing ever is as it seems. Resulting in renewed trompe l'oeil illusions, the textures look identical yet boast completely opposite performances. Visuals have contrasting appearing consistencies while being made of the same make-up formula. Packaging solutions act as doubles, containing multiple versions of the same product, or allowing for various possible applications and results. For the first time, Chromavis will also present a special collection to introduce its 'Atelier Service'. A business model that provides influencers, creators and brands with smart cosmetic creations, offering full marketing services, operational support, and a never-before-seen time to market. Featuring the ""Wild Harmony"" collection that recalls the iconic effortless-chic Parisian attitude, formulated with Atelier best-selling clean, highly natural, and talc-free formulas, presented in sustainable packaging solutions.

"'Cherry Cola Lips', the lipstick shade that makes the buzz on social networks","It's not a tip or a hack that's currently buzzing on TikTok, but rather a lipstick shade, dubbed 'Cherry Cola Lips' in reference to a famous sparkling drink. The shade has become the star of the summer. The words 'Cherry Cola' are currently running wild on social media, with no fewer than 64 million views on TikTok. Through this hashtag, users can find numerous tutorials entirely dedicated to lip makeup, detailing different ways — gloss, pencils, lipsticks, or a combination of all three — to achieve the coveted shade. And that's not all, since the #CherryColaLips hashtag has racked up over 2.5 million views to date, with several beauty bosses – including makeup artist, influencer and brand owner Huda Kattan – having already tried and tested this tasty new shade. The 'Cherry Cola' shade is essentially a bright, vibrant red that gradually turns darker red, then brown, like the colour of the fruity soda. In her video, Huda Kattan first uses a brown lip pencil, which she applies around the contour and gently blends over the edge of the lips. She then finishes with a matte red lipstick to fill in the lips, before adding a final stroke of brown pencil to accentuate the 'Cola' effect. But techniques vary from user to user, the idea being simply to recreate the viral shade as best as possible. There's nothing revolutionary about using brown lip liner — as anyone already doing their makeup in the 1990s can testify. However, back then, the idea was to combine a brown contour with a transparent gloss, and not such a vibrant lipstick colour. So, are bold colours back? The fact is that the shade hasn't just made its mark in the world of makeup. Actually, it could also become the star hair colour as we head into summer, this time dubbed #CherryCokeHair and with some 20 million views and counting on TikTok."

Fasten's refillable jar concept wins gold at German Innovation Awards,"Fasten Packaging won a Gold Award for its Goodloop refillable jar concept at the 2023 German Innovation Awards, presented by the German Design Council. This recognition was given to only 19 entries out of 650 companies across 22 countries. The German Innovation Awards recognize products, technologies, and services that break new ground and offer solutions that shape the future, provide added value for users, and may also have a positive impact on the environment.

Texen: A cap made of RPET for Yves Saint Laurent's All Hours new foundation,"Yves Saint Laurent's new All Hours foundation promises full coverage and staying power with a luminous matt finish without caking. Mirroring that of the Libre fragrance, its packaging sports a new design with the YSL logo as its standout feature. The Yves Saint Laurent logo enlaces the cap like a vine, a decorative feature which, when added to the technical challenge of a manufacturing a lid made with recycled content, demanded both audacity on the technical front and industrial maturity on the part of Texen's teams. In line with the brand's expectations and its environmental commitments, which Texen shares, the project involved adopting new-generation materials. Texen pushed the boundaries of its industrial capabilities with a dual challenge: esthetic imperatives and the use of RPET. The cap is a single part thanks to in-mould engraving of the logo, for which the thickness of the relief added complexity. In order to optimize the conception of industrial tooling, Texen's teams relied on rheological research. As such, the experts were able to perfect the various injection parameters, anticipating the performance of the material to avoid gluing lines so the moulded part would be completely uniform. ""This expertise perfected over time offers a major advantage when product specifications are both technical and esthetic,"" said Texen in a statement.
