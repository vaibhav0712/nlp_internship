Lumson's aluminium airless packaging TAL now available in a recycled version,"TAL, the airless system with pouch technology in a lightweight aluminium container launched by Lumson in 2021, is making a return in an even environmental-friendly version. At Luxe Pack New York last week, Lumson has unveiled a new version of TAL made from post-consumer recycled aluminium (PCR). ""Given that aluminium is already a sustainable material as it is 100% recyclable and can be recycled an infinite number of times without losing its tactile, aesthetic, and functional characteristics, using aluminium that is already in circulation is a step forward in circularity. This choice reduces the carbon footprint and energy consumption while maintaining the aesthetic qualities and performance of the final product,"" said manufacture of primary beauty packaging in a statement. As for the first version, the durability of the whole packaging solution is guaranteed by the possibility of separating the aluminium body from the plastic components. The new TAL can be paired with two pumps with different designs: Half Moon and Cyber. Half Moon is a plastic pump that can be paired with two dispensers, Half Moon and Pearl 223, while Cyber can be paired with the Aura Crema 223 dispenser, which is coated with aluminium to create an elegant and sophisticated design. In addition to the different pump options (plastic or aluminium-coated), several types of decoration are also available, including: hot stamping, for a more luxurious effect, or lithography, that allows up to six colours to be combined. TAL is available in three sizes: 50, 75, and 100 ml."

Seppic's Solagum Tara also helps to formulate more natural hair care,"The hair care market is transforming itself! To meet consumer demand for more natural ingredients, brands are modifying their formulas and, according to Mintel, naturalness claims in these products have been growing strongly over the last five years [1].

Launched in 2012, Solagum Tara is a polysaccharide derived from Tara seeds, an emblematic shrub native to the Andean valleys of Peru. According to Seppic, this natural gum can be used to thicken and stabilize emulsions and cream-gels and also acts as a texturizing agent by providing them with a structuring effect and soft feel.

Indeed, Solagum Tara is 100% natural origin, according to the ISO 16128 standard, and easily biodegradable, according to the OECD 301F standard. ""In a more minimalist formulation approach, Solagum Tara is also an ally of choice for hair formulas because, in addition to thickening, it plays a role in controlling volume and frizz in curly hair care,"" adds Seppic in a statement."

Moreover, in line with their commitments as a responsible skincare brand, Nuori selected recyclable materials for the packaging, including 100% recycled PET for the outer bottle and cap, retaining their sea green shade, aesthetically blended with the brand ID. ""We wanted the most sustainable pack with the highest protection,"" said Nuori Brand Manager Ann-Marie Rønlund Jensen. ""As our expert partner, Quadpack always takes us on a journey to navigate the options in terms of innovation and sustainability. With The One, our research and discussions led us to embrace recycled material, complete with its imperfections and colour variations. Airless was a given. The finished pack perfectly fits our mindset of high performance, simple aesthetics and low waste."" The One is an inclusive product designed for everyone with the aim to simplify skincare routines thanks to an easy yet effective one-step all-in-one product. Like all Nuori products, it contains no synthetic preservatives, stabilisers and other additives used to prolong shelf life. The outer bottle and cap, both rPET, were left uncoloured and visibly recycled, with branding applied in two-colour silk-screen. The inner bottle, adapter and dispenser were colour injected for a harmonious match with the sea green of the outer. ""The result is a sustainable packaging solution that encapsulates Scandinavian minimalism, endowed with the airless protection required to ensure the efficacy and freshness of Nuori's simple, super-charged skincare formula,"" underlined Quadpack in a statement. The inner bottle and metal-free pump – the parts in contact with the bulk – are made of PP for product compatibility. Nuori's The One is entirely made in Europe. It is blended in Denmark, its packaging is manufactured and decorated at Quadpack's production facilities in Kierspe, Germany. It is sold online, on Nuori's e-boutique (nuori.com) and in selected stores across the word."

"Givaudan recreates the scent of petrichor, the smell of nature after the rain","The fragrance and beauty giant has unveiled Geogaia, a blend that reproduces the scent of Petrichor, the smell that comes from the ground when rain falls after a dry period. Givaudan said they had to overcome a series of technical challenges to recreate this complex smell that will provide green, earthy and watery tonalities to fragrances. According to the company, this development is the result of a holistic work approach combining perfumery expertise and consumer understanding. The emotional resonance of Geogaia has been supported by the Givaudan Proprietary Mood Portraits 2.0 testing approach and InSituScanz brain imaging exploration. With its 100% biodegradable formula, Geogaia enriches Givaudan's Gaia collection, already featuring Phytogaia — which captures the wellbeing benefits of molecules emitted by forest trees – and Thalassogaia – which mimicks the composition of the marine environment. ""Demonstrating the emotional dimension of this new creation, 81% of consumers observed an ""After the Rain"" olfactive effect in the compositions containing a significant level of Geogaia, describing a pleasant natural outdoor sensation [1]. Being the most accurate translation of this universally evocative wet weather smell, Geogaia opens new creative perspectives, across all product categories,"" said Stéphanie Martin, Home Care Category Director. Givaudan added that Geogaia aligns with their objective of achieving a biodegradable fragrance palette by 2030, and of being climate positive by 2050."
Groupe GM relaunches its' Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle amenity line,"The international expert of guest amenities has relaunched the luxurious line created in partnership with Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle. A true perfume lover, Frédéric Malle's decision to found Editions de Parfums in 2000 was driven by his ambition to revive quality and authenticity in the increasingly commercial perfume world of the mid-1990s. He also truly believed in the idea of perfumers being artists. The concept of Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle was thus born: a publishing house for perfume, where scents are created and published as unique works of art. The new hotel line leverages on Eau de Magnolia, which was created by America's perfumer Carlos Benaïm. The fragrance smells of blooming citrus. Carried by a woody undercurrent, a citric balance of bergamot, lemon and grapefruit evolves towards darker notes of oak moss and patchouli. The Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle hotel line features iconic red 40ml plant-based tubes of shampoos, conditioner, body wash, and body lotion tubes. They are also available in a 50ml and 80ml cylindrical bottle format reminiscent of the brand's perfume bottles. These products, as well as a luxurious bath foam can also be found in elegant 50ml black aluminium tube packaging. Two perfumed soaps in pleat wrap available in 30g and 50g, and a modern wooden tray printed with the brand's name complete the line. For an even lower environmental footprint, larger format dispensers of 300ml and 400ml have also been added to the amenity line. The Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle hotel line now features body wash, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, and hand wash in 300ml large-capacity Ecopump dispensers made from bio-based plastics. Several secure wall bracket options are available in combination with the Ecopump made of stainless steelor black or white ABS plastic and can be fixed to the wall with screws or double-sided tape. The range also offers 400ml liquids in Groupe GM's new Ghost packaging format. As its name suggests, Ghost is a dispenser fixed on a hidden rail which gives the impression that the product is levitating. This eco-designed large-capacity dispenser of 400 ml is made from sugarcane and lasts around 40 days. Its' level of product is easily visible thanks to a discreet visibility window. Tamper proof, it can be removed with a secured key when empty. Finally, the Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle amenities also comes in the refillable dispenser Ecofill, which is refilled with up to 400ml sealed pouches made with only 8g of plastic, for a minimum packaging and total cosmetic traceability. Ecofill is also available in a 300ml black aluminium format. Ecofill bottles also come with a stainless steel or ABS recyclable plastic wall bracket that can be fastened to the wall using two screws or double-sided adhesive tape. A black aluminium base can be used to place it on bathroom furniture. Groupe GM consistently prioritizes the usage of plant-based materials, post-industry or post-consumer recycled plastics and the sourcing of 100% renewable raw materials. ""We are delighted to update this successful collaboration and introduce more eco-friendly amenities to this luxurious line. Similar to the Frédéric Malle vision, we at Groupe GM, are constantly striving for creativity, quality and innovation. This line deeply reflects our core values and will enable hotels worldwide to pamper their guests with expertly fragranced amenities,"" said Laurent Marchand, President of Groupe GM."

The Body Shop CEO David Boynton steps down,"Brazilian cosmetics giant Natura &Co has announced David Boynton is stepping down as Chief Executive of The Body Shop. Ian Bickley, member of the Natura &Co Board, has been appointed as interim CEO. Boynton was named CEO in late 2017, following Natura's acquisition of The Body Shop from L'Oréal in June the same year. He was previously the CEO of British men's clothing chain Charles Tyrwhitt and also held several positions at L'Occitane during a 10-year period.

"As U.S. consumers spending decreases, product innovation is much needed","In March 2023, discretionary U.S. general merchandise retail sales revenue fell 7%, compared to March 2022, and unit sales fell 8%, which is double the average monthly declines in January and February. These steeper sales declines remained consistent during the last three weeks of March, spanning both units and dollars for the first time this year, according to Circana, the new market intelligence firm formed by the fusion of IRI and The NPD Group. ""Consumers are beginning to spend less on both discretionary and essential purchases with more consistency,"" said Marshal Cohen, chief retail industry advisor for Circana. ""In order to create some spending elevation, there needs to be new products and new ways of thinking to reflect the changed consumer behavior and retail landscape."" Simultaneously, Circana notes that product innovation has reached a historical low. ""Before the pandemic, new general merchandise products represented more than 5% of the market. By the end of 2022, that number was less than 2%,"" underlined the market research firm. Indeed, investment in new product development was put on hold due to uncertainties caused by the pandemic and most companies adjusted priorities to fulfill demand while addressing supply chain issues, and then focused on selling excess inventory. ""One of the biggest retail casualties of the pandemic has been the availability of new and refreshed products for consumers, and now economic uncertainty is putting even more pressure on the consumer's interest in spending,"" said Cohen, ""Manufacturers and retailers need to broadcast their value and prove their worth to the consumer now, in order to avoid a downward spiral later."" According to Circana, the trends in consumer spending and new product deficits in the marketplace have directional similarities that are intensified by elevated prices. Compounding these consumer distractions are news stories about inflation and bank insolvencies that continue to raise consumer concerns about the economy, which can adversely affect consumer sentiment and spending."

Cosnova removes 100% of microplastic particles from its cosmetic products,"Since March 2023, all products by Cosnova's brands essence and Catrice are completely free of microplastic particles [1]. This is a result of a decision dating back to 2020, when the German beauty player decided to remove microplastic particles from all its ranges of cosmetic products. According to the Sulzbach-headquartered company, each year in Germany, 977 tonnes of microplastics are released into the environment through wastewater from washing off cosmetics and cleaning products. However, cosmetics only account for a small part of microplastics that area released in the environment (between 0.1 and 4 percent of the total): for instance, the highest proportion of microplastic particles in Germany is caused by tyre wear. ""Even decorative cosmetics contribute to water pollution with microplastic particles. I am very proud that we have now succeeded in permanently removing the particles from the products of our brands,"" says Katrin Steinbach, Technical Unit Expert Corporate Responsibility at Cosnova. To curb the enormous impact of these tiny, solid insoluble and non-biodegradable plastic particles, Cosnova began updating its formulas in 2020. However, switching to microplastic particle-free formulas with the same quality is not easy. Indeed, microplastic particles have been very popular in the cosmetics industry for a long time. They can be used in a variety of ways to achieve different effects: for example, they can mattify, give the skin a soft feel or make the product last longer on the skin. ""Microplastics cannot be replaced one-to-one, nor can they be removed retrospectively. We had to completely renew our formulas to make them work without the plastic particles. Together with project partners and our own project team, we went through every single product and tested alternative ingredients, especially natural substances such as corn or rice starch. But it was worth the effort,"" says Katrin Steinbach. However, Cosnova is not stopping at the elimination of microplastic particles and is also working on formulas that are free of volatile silicones. ""The spectrum of silicones and their applications is very broad, as is their health and environmental relevance. Like microplastics, these synthetic plastics enter the environment via wastewater, where they are difficult to break down,"" says the German group. Cosnova therefore aims to completely eliminate volatile silicones from its formulas by 2025."
Silab puts the spotlight on its CSR program via an eco-designed website,"At the occasion of the 2023 edition of the in-cosmetics Global trade show, the manufacturer of cosmetic ingredients unveiled its new website dedicated to its CSR program: activelycaring.silab.fr/en Dubbed ""Actively Caring"", Silab's CSR program that sets down the company's multi-year objectives and action plans for sustainable development. ""It is based on a highly transversal vision comprising five major pillars: sustainable strategy, development of human potential, responsible sourcing, preserved environment and societal dimension,"" said Silab in a statement. With a view toward transparency with all of its stakeholders, Silab has chosen to develop a website dedicated to this program, explaining the initiatives implemented by the company and whose purpose is to replace the paper report published annually until now. This site enables users to easily obtain the desired information, whether it is overall views or factual and precise elements. It also highlights the main initiatives of the current year. ""CSR is an important component of our development strategy. By bringing this new site on line, it is our desire to give it heightened visibility and to bring a new impulse to our Actively Caring program. We also want to provide our partners with the latest news and data, made possible by this new format that will enable us to update the contents very regularly,"" explains Jean-Philippe Cosson, General Manager of Sales, International subsidiaries and CSR at Silab. For this development, Silab has opted for an eco-designed site consistent with digital simplicity, available in both English and French. The environmental impact of consulting websites is steadily increasing, and so this site was designed to reduce energy consumption by the suitable technical and editorial choices such as: green hosting, responsible development, ""mobile first"" design, streamlined design, seamless user experience, relevant contents, only essential functions and a measurement of impact. ""This technical challenge is part of Silab's overall sustainable development strategy, focusing on continuous improvement,"" highlights the company.

Pierre Fabre acquires dermo-cosmetic brand Même,"The Pierre Fabre Group has acquired Même, the first French dermo-cosmetic brand for patients experiencing the side effects of cancer treatments. A minority shareholder for 5 years, Pierre Fabre has acquired the remaining capital from the co-founders and the Eutopia investment fund specializing in ""emerging consumer brands"", via its Otium Consumer fund. Launched in 2017 by Judith Levy Keller and Juliette Couturier, who will continue to manage the company, Même has won over the hearts of people affected by cancer by offering the first skin, scalp and nail care range, developed in collaboration with oncologists and dermatologists, to address the side effects of cancer treatments. ""With the Pierre Fabre teams, we will be able to develop excellent synergies to accelerate our development, particularly on the international front, and turn our dream into reality: making MÊME accessible to those who need it, everywhere in the world and for many years to come,"" said Judith Levy Keller and Juliette Couturier, co-founders of Même. The brand was born following the painful personal experiences of the co-founders. Judith Levy and Juliette Couturier have first-hand experience of the physical (adverse effects on the skin, mucous membranes and hair) and psychological difficulties that cancer patients often encounter both during and after their treatments. They refused to accept defeat and created a range of dermo-cosmetic care products and make-up based on natural ingredients, with formulas that have been tested to guarantee tolerance and efficacy. According to Frédéric Ennabli, CEO of Pierre Fabre, Même – which has established itself as a reference brand when it comes to heal skin damaged by cancer treatments – is a perfect fit with Pierre Fabre Dermo-Cosmetics' mission to provide solutions for skin conditions and improve the lives of patients and consumers. The acquisition of Même by Pierre Fabre signals the continuation of the commercial partnership signed in December 2017. For three years, the sales network of the Eau Thermale Avène brand introduced the philosophy and products of Même in pharmacies and drugstores. Today, the brands offers a portfolio of 46 products, in 4,800 pharmacies and drugstores, as well as on its online store. The brand is already distributed in 10 other countries (Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Morocco, Romania, Czech Republic, Ireland, Spain, Italy and, more recently, China) with significant potential for growth in numerous markets. ""Through this acquisition, we confirm our strategy of investing in innovative brands and products in our priority areas of oncology, dermatology and dermo-cosmetics. Through its positioning, MÊME is at the very crossroads of these 3 strategic priorities. When I first met Judith and Juliette 5 years ago, I realized very quickly that we shared common values and that their project had strong development potential. We will now continue to write this meaningful story together in service to those affected by cancer,"" concluded Eric Ducournau, CEO of the Pierre Fabre Group."

DNA & Cosmetics call on to a mobilization for botanicals traceability,"Created two years ago under the impulsion of DNA Gensee (a small sized company specializing in the DNA analysis of plants, algae and beehive products), the DNA & Cosmetics consortium aims to guarantee the traceability of plant-based raw materials.

Maison Sambin chooses Aptar's Silk pump for a sensual dispensing,"Maison Sambin is the first brand to leverage Aptar Beauty's patented Silk diffusion technology, which was launched in 2021 within the Inune range. The result of five years of research and development, Silk by Aptar offers a spray described as ""continuous and ultra-soft, like a veil of perfume."" The traditional one-way insert is replaced by a new-generation nozzle with multiple micro-holes, allowing a better diffusion of the fragrance on the skin to optimize sensation. Dosage depends on the duration and force of pressure exerted on the pump. The ultra-fine and gradual diffusion can be up to ten times longer than that of a classic spray. The spray-pump thus helps to highlight the sensorial benefits of fragrances, bestowing ""the enveloping feeling of a veil on the skin."" ""Indie prestige brands tend to have pioneering approaches that inspire, stimulate and revolutionize the beauty market. The innovative Silk by Aptar perfume experience combined with the essence of the Maison Sambin is definitely in line with this trend,"" Patrick Bousquel, Marketing Director Beauty EMEA, Aptar Beauty.

Natura &Co sells Aesop to L'Oréal for USD 2.525 billion,"Brazil's Natura &Co has agreed to sell Aesop to French beauty giant L'Oréal as part of an agreement valuing the Australian luxury cosmetics brand at USD 2.525 billion. Acquired by Natura & Co in 2012, Aēsop was created in 1987. The brand is renowned globally for its skin, hair and body products. With its signature amber packaging, plant-based ingredients, sustainable vegan formulations, and its bespoke customer service, Aēsop has evolved into a global brand available across luxury retail, beauty, and hospitality locations around the world. Aēsop currently operates around 400 points of sale across the Americas, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia, with a nascent footprint in China where the first store opened in 2022. The brand posted sales of USD 537 million in 2022. Natura &Co says the sale of Aesop will help the group reduce debt while freeing up resources for its strategic priorities, such as strengthening the Avon brand in Latin America, and improving The Body Shop operations. ""With a strengthened financial structure and a deleveraged balance sheet, Natura &Co, exercising strict financial discipline, will be able to sharpen its focus on its strategic priorities, notably our investment plan in Latin America,"" explains Fábio Barbosa, Chief Executive Officer of Natura &Co.

Bolloré Logistics launches an air charter service between Singapore and Hainan,"To support the growth of the travel retail market in Hainan, Bolloré Logistics recently launched a new air charter service. The air charter service will operate weekly from Singapore to Haikou via Hong Kong. With these flights, Bolloré Logistics intends to provide perfumes and cosmetics, and luxury retail brands with secured transport capacity to grow in the Hainan market. The service offers end-to-end monitoring for both Dangerous Goods (DG) and Non-Dangerous Goods (Non-DG). ""Coupled with the warehousing capabilities and value-added services in the Bolloré Logistics' three hubs, the solution will provide brands with the agility and flexibility required for their business,"" says the company. On the Singapore-Hong Kong-Haikou route, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a low-carbon alternative to traditional jet fuel, is used. Made primarily from used cooking oil and waste resources, the use of SAF reduces CO2 emissions of the charter by 25% as less natural resources is used. ""Many of our customers share similar goals when it comes to sustainability and reducing carbon emissions in their supply chain. Using SAF in this charter is therefore in accordance with our group's program 'Powering Sustainable Logistics' and showcases our capability to set up and expand our services for clients,"" said Loig Pavard, CEO of Bolloré Logistics Singapore. Over the past three years, offshore duty-free spending has skyrocketed in the city of Haikou, the capital of Hainan island, which hosts the largest stand-alone duty-free shop in the world. To support Hainan's booming travel retail industry, Bolloré Logistics has worked to enhance its transport and logistics services and provide end-to-end supply chain solutions for retailers there. Sun Bo, Vice Mayor of Haikou city, said, ""This February, we discussed the constructive cooperation plan in Haikou with the Bolloré Logistics team. The launch of the new air charter service, together with the distribution hub that Bolloré Logistics will build in Haikou, will support Haikou's strategic development plan to be an international travel retail center."""
Berkem acquires Biopress and secures its vegetable oil sourcing,"The group specializing in vegetable chemistry has just acquired Biopress, a French producer of 100% vegetable oils and proteins, thus securing its supply of vegetable oils while increasing its extraction capacities. Located in southwest of France, Biopress is one of the first French agri-food companies to specialize in the production of vegetable oils extracted from organic oil seeds from local farms. With properties similar to petroleum derivatives, while being renewable and biodegradable resources, vegetable oils can be used in a wide variety of applications such as cosmetics, coatings, inks, and lubricants. Also, the vegetable proteins contained in oil cakes, which result from the crushing process that is used to extract the oil from the seeds, are particularly prized in the nutraceutical field. With this acquisition, Groupe Berkem adds to its value chain the sourcing of a raw material essential to its activity of integrating plant-based chemistry. The group now benefits from a local supply of technical vegetable oils, as Biopress is geographically close to the Berkem's plant. Biopress' facilities also provide significant new storage space for the group as it anticipates the future growth of its business. Berkem can thus expand its production capacity and ensure the processing of more than 8,000 tons of plants per year. With this acquisition, Groupe Berkem is consolidating its offering in the ""Health, Beauty & Nutrition"" area of expertise and more specifically in the cosmetics market thanks to the virtues of its oils and the nutraceutical market because of the benefits provided by plant proteins. According to Groupe Berkem, this transaction is fully in line with the acquisition of i.Bioceuticals, a North American distributor of nutritional supplements, announced on 16 February 2023, and paves the way for new opportunities for growth in this booming market [1]. Surfactants derived from these vegetable oils are also used in numerous industrial applications, being particularly prized for their solubilizing, detergent, wetting and emulsifying properties. These products will therefore find applications in sectors already addressed by the Group. Finally, the integration of Biopress will provide Groupe Berkem with new commercial opportunities in the agri-food market. ""Raw material sourcing has always been a real know-how for Groupe Berkem and, faced with an inflationary and geopolitically complex environment, we felt that it was necessary to internalize this ability through a dedicated subsidiary. With the acquisition of Biopress, Groupe Berkem now manages its supply of vegetable oils, essential raw materials for its extraction and formulation activities, while at the same time significantly increasing its storage capacity in the direct vicinity of its production facilities. Through local and 100% plant-based sourcing, we will strengthen our Health, Beauty & Nutrition, Industry and Construction & Materials business areas, which fully benefit from the recognized virtues of so-called technical vegetable oils and plant proteins. Finally, this acquisition gives us access to a new market, that of agri-food, where we intend to develop new sustainable solutions for manufacturers looking for naturalness,"" explains Olivier Fahy, Chairman and CEO of Groupe Berkem. The integration of Biopress into the consolidated accounts of Groupe Berkem was completed on April 1, 2023. The acquisition of Biopress was made by Berkem Développement (a wholly owned subsidiary of Groupe Berkem), financed out of equity and fully paid in cash. The 11 employees of Biopress joined Groupe Berkem on April 1, 2023."
Zero-waste: Cosmetic brands take the plunge into powder formats,"Already beloved by DIY enthusiasts and promoted by many indie brands, the powder format is now also being used in more classic products, in everything from cleansers to scrubs and deodorants. Unlike traditional beauty products, powder cosmetics contain zero water. So, it's up to the consumer to add the required amount of water. The environmental-friendly solution appears as an ideal alternative to appeal those who do not like the texture of solid cosmetics. The brands Yanne Wellness, Tatcha, Yodi and Eyden are among those that offer numerous powder cosmetics, from revitalizing masks to exfoliating powders to purify the skin, as well as shampoos and facial cleansers. Perlucine, which specializes in cosmetics featuring white oyster shell powder, offers a wide range of products of this type, from shampoo to deodorant, toothpaste, and shower gel. Luxury houses and consumer brands have also started using powder formulations. Dior, for example, has its Hydra Life Time to Glow – Ultra Fine Exfoliating Powder, and Klorane sells a 3-in-1 Purifying Powder that transforms into a foam on contact with water. Note that other brands, such as 900.care and Mono Skincare, have chosen in-between offerings, with solid cosmetics that also turn into a liquid on contact with water. This is the case with the brand's shower gels, that can be customized in line with individual tastes and desires. Powdered or solid, cosmetics have well and truly set a transformation in motion, helping consumers shift to zero-waste alternatives."

Microplastic pollution impairs seabird gut microbiome health,"Scientists have long known that wild seabirds ingest bits of plastic pollution as they feed, but a study published on 27th March 2023 [1] shows the tiny particles don't just clog or transit the stomach but can subvert its complex mix of good and bad bacteria too. Plastic-infested digestive tracts from two species of Atlantic seabirds, northern fulmars and Cory's shearwaters, showed a decrease of mostly beneficial ""indigenous"" bacteria and more potentially harmful pathogens. There was also an increase in antibiotic-resistant and plastic-degrading microbes, researchers reported in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. Certain types of microplastic, the findings suggested, may be leeching chemicals that disrupt the birds' so-called gut microbiome. Microplastics — produced when plastic products break down in the environment — are directly and indirectly ingested across most animal food chains. They can be found in every corner of the world, from the deepest oceans trenches to top of Mount Everest. In humans, they have been detected in the blood, breast milk and placentas. The new study supports previous findings that prolonged ingestion of microplastics causes an imbalance of healthy and unhealthy bacteria in the stomach, a condition known as gut dysbiosis. The implications are far-reaching. Like humans, birds have evolved with a vast network of microbes, including bacteria, that live in our bodies in communities called microbiomes. Some microbes cause diseases, but most exist as ""friendly"" bacteria with a critical role in digestion, immune response and other critical functions. ""There's a symbiosis that goes on — and that's the case in the seabirds as well as in humans,"" lead author Gloria Fackelmann of Ulm University in Germany told AFP. The authors hope the findings in seabirds will spur related studies for humans. ""If this manmade substance could alter our microbiome, I think that should make people think,"" said Fackelmann. *"

Greentech unveils a new skin care ingredient that acts on the holobiont,"Holobiosys, the latest achievement of Greentech's research, is a wild yellow gentian roots extract enhanced by an upcycled fermentation process with a rare and cold-tolerant bacteria from French aerobiota. According to Greentech, it restructures skin from surface to its heart, boosts hyaluronic acid and lipids synthesis and restores skin hydration with smoothing effects, while invigorating the skin holobiont. To counteract dehydrated (lack of water) and dry (lack of lipids) skin, Holobiosys boosts hyaluronic acid (HA) synthesis both in the epidermis and the dermis. It also stimulates HA receptor CD44 and its signalling cascade allowing the reinforcement of epidermal barrier. Indeed, tight junction and differentiation markers are upregulated as well as lipid synthesis in keratinocytes for a more cohesive epidermis able to lock in skin moisture. Holobiosys also stimulates dermal-epidermal junction markers expression for a better diffusion of water bound to HA within the skin. Finally, antioxidant cell responses are upregulated after treatment with Holobiosys both in keratinocytes and fibroblasts for a protection against HA degradation by free radicals. Clinically tested on volunteers with dehydrated skin, Holobiosys increases skin hydration index after 28 days of application at 1% vs placebo and smoothes wrinkles. It also protects hydrolipidic film and has even a lipid-replenishing effect on a sub-panel presenting dehydrated and sebum-deficient skin. However, with Holobiosys, Greentech R&D goes a step further by studying the skin holobiont (the assemblage between the skin and its microbiota) with a metaproteomic study. With age and loss of hydration, the Greentech research shows that there is a slow-down of skin barrier and antioxidant functions both from human and microbial origins. ""By focusing on the host/microbiota interactions, Holobiosys stimulates these functions and contribute to a more harmonized and invigorated holobiont, allowing a deep hydration-restructuring action,"" explains Greentech. According to Greentech, studying the holobiont provides a comprehensive view of the interactions between the skin and its microbial ecosystem, helping to take a step further than a simple study comparing the skin on one side and the microbiota on the other.

Indian cosmetic brands seek to benefit from their support to gender equality,"As two Indian cosmetics brands, Lakmé and Sugar Cosmetics, have launched distinct marketing campaigns highlighting the theme of women's empowerment to mark International Women's Day 2023, connecting with gender equality issues can help Indian cosmetics brands win consumer loyalty, said GlobalData. According to the data and analytics company, campaigns linked to relevant social causes, such as women's rights, beauty brands are connecting with young Millennial and Gen Z cohorts, who will power the future growth of the USD 16 billion Indian cosmetics and toiletries market. [1] Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL)'s Lakmé launched its #UnapologeticallyMÉ campaign to encourage women to wear fashion and beauty styles boldly without feeling guilty or justifying themselves to society. ""The campaign sheds light on the social prejudice against women who wear fashionable makeup or clothing. HUL plans to extend the campaign through the Lakmé Fashion Week in March 2023, where the company will launch new products that imbue the campaign's philosophy. With the new campaign, HUL's is aligning the 70-year-old Lakmé brand with pertinent issues of the youth,"" commented Bobby Verghese, Consumer Analyst at GlobalData. Simultaneously, Sugar Cosmetics unveiled its #BeYourOwnMuse campaign to inspire women to overcome insecurity and be confident. The company posted an Instagram video featuring nine ambitious working women being asked what advice they would give to their younger selves. The women emphasized self-belief and confidence in chasing passions and opportunities. According to Bobby Verghese: ""This ties in with the company's 2022 campaign, #EveryWomanIsAWonderWoman, which encouraged women to embrace their virtues and flaws and love themselves completely to overcome self-consciousness in the social media age."" ""These marketing campaigns are stimulating conversations on the social issues that impact modern-day Indian women. Brands espousing such social causes can win consumer goodwill as revealed by GlobalData's Q3 2022 consumer survey, wherein 34% of Indian respondents said that they actively look for ethical brands and brands that support social causes when making a purchase,"" added Francis Gabriel Godad, Business Development Manager, GlobalData India. ""The emotional connection forged by the brands can elevate the user experience beyond the product's features. Consumer experiences linked to social causes, such as gender equality, can help brands in winning consumer loyalty and pockets, especially among new-generation women. This is corroborated by GlobalData's 2022 survey finding that 45% of female Indians are willing to pay more for products or services that support gender equality causes [2]. Notably, the trend is more skewed towards the Gen Y and Gen Z consumer cohort."" ""International trends on gender equality and gender fluidity are influencing young Indian consumers. More cosmetics and apparel makers are pledging support for such social movements. However, companies need to align corporate actions with the ethos of their marketing campaigns. Else, consumers will perceive the branding activity as mere social washing,"" concluded Verghese."

Lumene chooses Eastman's Cristal One E Renew molecularly recycled resin,"For its latest skin care innovation — Nordic Hydra Birch Dew Jelly — beauty brand Lumene has chosen Eastman Cristal One E Renew, a recyclable resin with molecularly recycled content that is specifically designed for extrusion blow moulding (EBM). Cristal One E is Eastman's latest addition to its Cristal One portfolio, giving brands the brilliance and lustre of glass with rigid, thick-wall construction for EBM that is not typically achievable with conventional recycled resins.

Pelham Group launches turnkey creation platform with low MOQs,"The UK based contract manufacturer of cosmetic and personal care formulations has launched a new platform dedicated to the fast-track turnkey creation of innovative products. Dubbed Pelham Matrix, the new tool offers ready-to-market formulations created to help brands — big and small — to stay agile in their product launches. To create the new ranges, Pelham uses Mintel data, feedback from their customers, insights, and trends from innovative beauty markets such as Korea and the USA and their own technical team's knowledge. Pelham saw an opportunity to provide a solution that allows brands to explore and test the market with ""innovative and on-trend products"", available with low MOQs starting at 1000 units. As all products are pretested for stability and safety, and are formulated to the ""Clean At Sephora"" guidelines and are compliant to many worldwide markets, Pelham says brands can expect delivery in just 8 weeks from artwork signoff, instead of the usual 12 months. As far compatibility is concerned, the ranges are tested in a series of packaging options. ""We know how hard it is for brands to react to trends and offer continuous innovation. With large MOQs, lengthy testing timelines and large investment, this often results in brands missing the opportunity completely or by the time products are ready, the market has moved on,"" says Oliver Felstead, Founder of Pelham. ""Trends come and go quicker than ever, and it's difficult to distinguish between a trend and a fad, speed is key to taking 'early adopter' margin before the market becomes saturated and margins are squeezed. We want to give our customers the ability to test and learn to find out what works best for their brand and audience; giving them the opportunity to develop bespoke formulations with the learnings once they have proven concept,"" he adds. Pelham Matrix will be dropping new ranges every 2-3 months in multiple product categories across health and beauty based on market trends and innovation, with over 200 products planned for 2023 alone. The first drop, launched on the 1st March, is a range of SPF skincare formulations, all fully tested and ready to go. ""We are known as the Indie brand manufacturer, we seek out challenging briefs which allow us to create 'newness'. Now we're writing briefs to challenge ourselves so we can showcase our creativity to stand head and shoulders above the competition,"" highlights Oliver."
Coquette makeup: the beauty trend that takes romance to the extreme,"There's a fresh, new kind of romantic aesthetic blowing through social media. We thought users were obsessed with the gothic chic style of Netflix series ""Wednesday,"" but here they are already turning to beauty that evokes the sweetness of spring. And so it is that 'coquette makeup' has already inspired several million followers on TikTok. An extension of the 'Barbiecore' aesthetic, this new trend puts pink in the spotlight, but this time, it is not a hot pink shade but rather a soft rosy pastel pink, tinged with romance. The new beauty aesthetic is causing a sensation on TikTok with no less than 7.7 billion views for the hashtag #coquette, 1.6 billion for #coquetteaesthetic, more than 300 million for #coquettecore and over 120 million for #coquettemakeup. A surge that shows genuine enthusiasm for this aesthetic inspired by pretty, romantic stylistic elements. This trend also celebrates an ultrafeminine style – that users own 100% – celebrated with bows, pearls, lace, butterfly patterns, flowers, and other details. All tinged with a touch of retro nostalgia: antique mirrors and ribbon-like headbands in the hair. Sort of a mix between Daphne Bridgerton and Blair Waldorf. Once again, blush is a key element of this trend. After working on the complexion as for a classic beauty routine, it's a matter of applying a pink blush – stick or powder – to the cheekbones, before finishing the whole look with a pearly powder. A luminous touch that is applied to eyelids, punctuated with a line of black eyeliner for a doe eye. For the mouth, matte lipstick is swapped for a pink or transparent gloss, which adds the dose of signature prettiness and romanticism that characterizes the 'coquette makeup'."

Rissmann creates gift packs for Valentino and YSL,"The German manufacturer of paper packaging – tailor-made carrier bags and boxes – for luxury brands in cosmetics, perfumes, jewellery, spirits and technology, recently produced a series of new gift boxes and packaging for Valentino and Yves Saint Laurent, two brands of the L'Oréal Group's luxury division. For their -commerce gift boxes, Valentino required a sophisticated 3D décor. Rissmann managed to create the brand's logo from golden embossed studs, with a multi-level gold transfer finishing. The use of an uncoated matte paper, printed in a very deep black, is also worth to be highlighted. The glossy varnish finish enhances the luxury appearance of these boxes and emphasises the hot-stamped Valentino logo. Yves Saint Laurent asked Rissmann to develop its collection of gift packaging inspired by its ""Indulge in Gold"" campaign. Boxes, pouches, bags, envelopes, and cards are made of black tinted FSC paper. Whether in silver or gold, the transfer finished rectangle in the background highlights the black embossed YSL logo. The filigree stars and squares of the metallic decoration echo the embossed patterns of the black surfaces through a play of light. The cord that makes up the handles of the bags is also made of FSC-certified paper. ""This collection illustrates Rissmann's ability to combine expertise and high-tech know-how around the manufacture of luxury packaging in paper and cardboard,"" said Sophie Ivens, Chief Executive Officer, Strategy, Sales & Marketing at Rissmann. As far as production operations are concerned, Rissmann relies on its German industrial plant, furnished with semi or fully automatic production lines. The manufacturer also relies on its historical network of Chinese industrial partners, in line with its expectations, and entrusts manual finishing operations to Hungarian workshops which employ people with disabilities, thus promoting their integration through work. Since 2022, Rissmann has a new plant in Bulgaria, manufacturing shopping bags and boxes."
Antitrust authorities investigate over possible price cartel in fragrance,"Antitrust authorities in Europe and the U.S. are investigating over alleged price cartel and other anti-competitive practices in the fragrance industry.

Brazil bans animal testing for cosmetics and fragrances,"Vertebrates can no longer be used in tests conducted for the development and quality control of fragrances, cosmetic and personal care products in Brazil. The ban, which has been debated for several years in the federal parliament, was eventually enforced by the new Lula government via a resolution (Resolução No 58/2023) of the National Council for the Control of Animal Experimentation (Concea - Conselho Nacional de Controle de Experimentação Animal), a collegial body under the authority of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI). The measure applies to products for which formulas and components have already been proven to be safe and effective. For the others, the new text requires the use of alternative methods. According to Kátia de Angelis, coordinator of Concea, 40 alternative methods are currently recognized by the council. ""We have recognized methods for assessing skin toxicity using artificial skin, or eye irritation using an artificial cornea. These alternative methods allow us to maintain our autonomy to assess new ingredients, in particular those sourced from our biodiversity, in the Amazon for example, and without using animals or possibly a very small number of animals,"" she explained. Kátia de Angelis also pointed out that the new text puts Brazil in line with the most recent international legislation in this area. Today, more than 40 countries around the world have already banned animal testing for cosmetic products, including the member states of the European Union or in Latin America, countries such as Colombia, Mexico and Guatemala. However, the Brazilian text does not provide for a ban on the import of products tested abroad. The text was approved last December during a Concea meeting and was signed on February 28 by the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Luciana Santos. It entered into force on March 1, 2023. At the end of last year, the Federal Senate approved a similar text before sending it to the Chamber of Deputies. In addition to the ban, the project provided for inspection measures and a strategic plan for the adoption of alternative methods."

Sustainable decoration: Quadpack bets on full-cover hot foil stamping,"Full-cover hot foil stamping consists in endowing packaging components with a glossy, premium finish through the seamless application of foil to cover a complete pack, offering a low-emission, solvent-free, more sustainable alternative to metallization. Full-cover hot foil stamping has been incorporated into the decoration portfolio of Quadpack with the acquisition in 2021 of Stefan Wicklein Kunststoffveredelung GmbH, one of the few expert global providers of this complex technique. While metallization offers many advantages, full-coverage hot foil stamping requires less energy and no solvents. The PET carrier film can also be produced in PCR material and Quadpack is developing a process to recycle it. What's more, typically accounting for less than 5% of the full packaging solution's material, it does not affect recyclability. ""Material usage in general is minimised thanks to low reject rates, facilitated by the know-how of Quadpack's decoration specialists,"" the company highlights in a statement. Aesthetically, full-cover hot foil stamping adds lustre to a pack and offers a variety of creative finishes. Brushed aluminium, wood, and hologram effects can be applied, in matt or gloss, in monochrome or a multitude of colours, alone or in combination. Foils and foiling tools can be standard or bespoke, to match pack designs, budgets, and launch plans. Branding and lettering can be incorporated into custom foils, allowing for single-step decoration, accelerating time to market, while optimising cost and boosting sustainability. Full-cover hotfoil stamping is suitable for regular shapes, including concave surfaces. Quadpack currently has six production lines for caps and closures and two lines dedicated to cylindrical packs including airless, each capable of decorating millions of pieces a year. The supplier plans to add another line at the purpose-built decoration centre in Kierspe, Germany, by the end of 2023."

And we are seeing today that fragrance is more relevant than ever because it helps us connect with ourselves and with others."" The Fragrance Foundation said L'Oréal cultivates a unique fragrance ""savoir-faire,"" mastering all the facets of the fine fragrance creation, anchored in French heritage.

Mitsui invests in Kao's Brazil subsidiary to help grow skincare business,"Japanese conglomerate Mitsui & Co is taking stake in TBP Importação e Comércio de Cosméticos, Kao Corporation's wholly-owned subsidiary in Brazil. The two companies have signed a Quota Subscription Agreement under which the Mitsui will own 30% of the Brazilian subsidiary while Kao will retain 70% of the capital. The agreement is expected to go into effect in April 2023, after approval by CADE (Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica), Brazil's antitrust body. The financial details of the operation have not been disclosed. The agreement mainly aims at expanding the sales of Kao's Bioré skincare brand in Brazil, the world's fourth-largest beauty and personal care market. According to Kao, this market is projected to post a yearly growth rate of 7.7%, driven by new consumption behaviours, in particular among the growing middle-income earner class and Gen Z consumers [1]. Kao and Mitsui have cooperated in the sales and marketing of Bioré in Brazil since 2017. The two companies recently carried out a market research that, they say, has shown strong acceptance of the brand by Brazilian consumers. The two companies therefore intend to strengthen the brand's footprint in the country with the aim to manufacture Bioré products locally."

Brazil: Portuguese labelling of cosmetic ingredients can be done via QR Code,"The labelling in Portuguese language of the full list of ingredients in cosmetics and perfumes sold will be mandatory in Brazil from November 1, 2023. However, the National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) recently adopted new rules confirming brands will have the possibility to use a QR Code to make this information accessible to consumers. This clarification was made after a request from ABIHPEC - the Brazilian Association of the Personal Hygiene Products, Perfumes and Cosmetics Industry - which wanted to minimize the impact of this mandatory labelling in Portuguese, in particular for small-size products. Anvisa thus adopted a new resolution (RDC n° 773/2023 of February 15, 2023) modifying an earlier resolution of March 24, 2022 (RDC n° 646/2022), which authorized online information. The latest text clearly states that the presentation in Portuguese of the detailed chemical composition of a hygiene, cosmetic or perfume product can be provided in digital format by reading - through a mobile device - a code permanently printed on the label (for example a QR Code). According to ABIHPEC, ANVISA will also soon publish its own database of ingredients translated into Portuguese. Companies will have a period of 36 months to update the old labelling (in the event of a difference with the translation made available by Anvisa or in the event of an update of the list of ingredients published by the agency)."

Each of the four new creations of the Oman-based brand laces frankincense with a broad palette of rare ingredients in a display of tradition-steeped modernity. By exploring introspective themes, Lineage, Search, Guidance, and Purpose speak of escapism, the strive to grow, the search for a new path and the finding of a new life – transformation at last. ""When exploring Oman, you can often feel like touching treasures in a very pure way. A lot of my ideas come from travelling alone, from going somewhere. The third chapter of The Odyssey Collection emulates this escapism and Oman's memorable redolence. This collection is a singular, introspective olfactory voyage that should stir successive feelings of curiosity with Lineage, courage with Search, inner triumph with Guidance and a sense of awakening with purpose. By focusing this collection on the barren Omani island of Masirah, I wanted to pay tribute to Amouage's roots in a contemporary language, staying true to the House's ethos, or 'wave', to bring cultures and generations together,"" commented Renaud Salmon, who has been at the helm of Amouage's creative direction since 2019. To bring this new chapter to life, Amouage collaborated with perfumers chosen for their creativity and sense of poetry: Karine Vinchon-Spehner (Lineage) – whom previously worked with the House on fragrances including Interlude Woman, Memoir Man, Overture Man and Boundless – as well as Quentin Bisch (Guidance and Purpose) and Alexis Grugeon (Search). The Odyssey Collection: Chapter III – Escape is available in all Amouage boutiques and distributors worldwide and can be purchased online at www.amouage.com."

Is 'shower makeup' marking the return of boldness in beauty?,"Launched on social networks by Huda Kattan, 'shower makeup' is all the rage on TikTok, with no less than 5 million views for the hashtag #showermakeup. The trend could signal the return of boldness in makeup. Actually, it's all about ditching the matte complexion – which has been popular for years – and adopting shiny skin, subtly rosy cheeks, and slightly puffy lips. To achieve this bold look, which Huda Kattan says is just 'the sexiest,' makeup addicts have to start with a glowy makeup base. The idea is to banish any mattifying product from this new beauty routine. The founder of the cosmetics brand Huda Beauty then mixes her foundation with a moisturizer for a light and fresh look, and focuses on concealer, which should be lighter than her skin tone, with an emphasis on the forehead and chin. Then comes contouring, with more product under the cheekbones and on the jawline to capture the effect of bathroom lighting and the famous warmth of the shower, all followed by a glossy highlighter to achieve a wet look. All that's left to do is apply mascara, lip liner, lip gloss and – an essential step – to give hair a matching wet look. And that's it. Just be careful not to get caught up in the game and leave home in a bathrobe…"

Afyren chooses Mitr Phol to expand its low-carbon technology in Asia,"The French Greentech company has choosen Thailand for its second biobased organic acids plant. The company is entering a partnership project with Thai company Mitr Phol, a leading producer of cane sugar and its derivatives and the world's third largest sugar producer. The two companies aim to establish a biorefinery in Thailand. The project will take the form of a joint venture 70% owned by the majority partner Afyren, with 30% held by Mitr Phol. The agreement is expected to be finalized mid-2023, subject to agreement by the parties on the final terms of the partnership. Thanks to their proprietary technolgy, Afyren produces organic acids using agricultural co-products as feedstock. These acids are identical (drop-in molecules) to ingredients produced using petroleum derivatives, so they can be directly substituted without changing customers' production methods. The acids produced can be used as such, as ingredients, or transformed into derivatives for the cosmetics and perfumes industries, for example. ""With this second plant project, we are organizing our presence in a strategic region in the heart of Asia to better serve our customers,"" said Nicolas Sordet, CEO of Afyren. ""By partnering with Mitr Phol, Afyren is securing long-term access to a sustainable raw material from the local sugarcane industry."" According to Afyren, Asia represents 25% of the world market for carboxylic acids. The growth of this market is driven in particular by the dynamics of the food and animal nutrition sectors. Afyren's bio-based organic acids are used in many food products as preservatives or natural flavourings, as well as in many animal feed products, notably as an alternative to the preventive use of antibiotics. Located in the immediate vicinity of Mitr Phol's operations, close to Bangkok, the plant under consideration will benefit from direct access to its raw materials, considerably reducing the environmental footprint associated with transport. In addition, the plant will have access to renewable and low carbon electricity and steam, produced by cogeneration of biomass, strengthening the biorefinery and circular economy model. Like Afyren's first plant in France, the Thai fermentation unit will not consume water, and the mineral by-products of production will be used as a high-value natural fertilizer. With this approach, Afyren continues its commitment to produce biobased acids with a much lower carbon footprint than those produced using traditional petro-based feedstocks. This second plant aims to have a production capacity of approximately 28,000 tons per year, representing an annualized turnover of approximately 60 million euros in full capacity. Production start-up is expected by 2025, with the timetable to be specified at the end of the engineering studies scheduled for second semester of 2023."
LVMH announces record results in 2022 despite China,"The luxury goods giant recorded revenue of EUR 79.2 billion in 2022 and profit from recurring operations of EUR 21.1 billion, both up 23%. The group's share of net profit totalled EUR 14.08 billion (up 17%). Sales of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton's luxury goods rose sharply in Europe, the United States and Japan, benefiting from strong demand from local customers and the recovery of international travel. On the other hand, sales in Asia were stable over the year due to developments in the health situation in China. All business groups achieved significant organic revenue growth over the year. Fashion & Leather Goods notably reached record levels, with organic revenue growth of 20%. Profit from recurring operations stood at EUR 21.1 billion for 2022, up 23%.

While the Perfumes & Cosmetics business group recorded revenue growth of 17% in 2022 (10% on an organic basis), profit from recurring operations was slightly down ""as a result of a very selective policy of distribution to assert itself in the prestige universe,"" said LVMH in a statement."

European luxury sector impatient for return of Chinese tourists,"The European luxury sector is welcoming the end of pandemic lockdowns in China, as the return of big-spending Chinese tourists could sustain further growth. Prior to the pandemic, Chinese tourists visiting Europe were a major source of sales for luxury houses. The Chinese accounted for ""a third of luxury purchases in the world and two-thirds of those purchases were made outside China"", said Joelle de Montgolfier, head of the luxury division at management consulting firm Bain and Company. Their return has led RBC bank to revise up its growth forecast for the sector this year to 11 percent, from seven percent previously. ""China reopening is one of the key 'mega-themes' for the luxury sector in 2023,"" RBC Bank said in a recent note to clients. After a drop in 2020, the luxury sector managed to surpass its pre-pandemic sales in 2021. ""The Chinese consumed, but only in China,"" said Bain's de Montgolfier. ""In 2022, it was much more complicated with unexpected confinements in the country,"" she added. Nevertheless, that didn't hold the sector back from making an estimated 22 percent jump to 353 billion euros (USD 384 billion), according to a November forecast by Bain and Company. That growth was supported by the wave of post-lockdown US tourists visiting Europe armed with a strong dollar, as well as Korean and Southeast Asian tourists. Another pleasant surprise was Europeans ""who had been ignored for decades... and were more interested in luxury goods than expected"", said Erwan Rambourg, a luxury industry insider turned analyst and author of the book Future Luxe: What's Ahead for the Business of Luxury. With the lifting of travel restrictions in China ""there will be a considerable return of Chinese tourists but that will be more likely in the second quarter"", said Arnaud Cadart, a portfolio manager at asset manager Flornoy. ""The pandemic is still very active in China and it will affect lots of people."" The Chinese tourists may be needed if the flow of US tourists slows. ""European boutiques need this rebound in Chinese clientele to replace its American clientele which could buy locally,"" said Cadart. They also need to readapt to Chinese customers, who tend to travel in groups, and will join a large number of US tourists. ""There are already lines in front of the boutiques even without Chinese clients... they need more staff,"" said de Montgolfier. Otherwise, they risk a ""degradation of the experience"" of shopping in a luxury boutique. Another concern: the volume of merchandise that Chinese customers will want to buy is unclear. The sector likes to keep volumes low and does not discount to ensure exclusivity."
"Lumson launches APP Light, a lightweight airless solution in PCR PE","The Italian manufacturer of primary packaging for skincare and make-up is launching a lightweight PCR PE version of their APP 355 airless standard. Dubbed APP Light, the new 50ml PCR PE airless, adds up to Lumson's large portfolio of pouch airless packaging solutions, which also includes aluminium (TAL) and paper (XPaper) options. Thanks to a reduction in the bottle's thickness, the new APP 355 Light is 25% lighter than the equivalent standard APP 355. The new airless packaging is made even more sustainable thanks to the use of post-consumer recycled (PCR) and recyclable materials: 80% of PCR HDPE and 20% of virgin HDPE. According to Lumson, APP Light allows a significant reduction of CO2 emissions, compared to a traditional pouch airless. Indeed, results from a SPICE analysis (an international platform that measures the sustainability of products and processes) have shown that CO2 emissions generated during manufacturing of the APP 355 Light are 19% lower when compared with an APP Start (another one of Lumson's airless in PE). To complete the design, the bottle can be paired with the Lumson AA355 pump in PCR PP, thus making the different plastic components fully recyclable. When it comes to formula protection, thanks to its the multi-layered pouch designed to act as a barrier against external agents, the new APP 355 Light offers the same functionalities than any other Lumson's pouch airless solutions. ""The new APP 355 Light incarnates all of Lumson's technical and technological expertise and is a solution that is keeping up with the times. Not only is it a winning choice in terms of safety and sustainability, but it's also extremely versatile because, like all of our airless packaging solutions, it can be customized with various effects and decorations,"" said Matteo Moretti, President of Lumson. Lumson will introduce APP Light at the Paris Packaging Week tradeshow, which will take place on January 25-26, 2023."

"Verra's rainforest carbon offsets 'worthless', according to media analysis","Buying carbon credits by financing projects to protect rainforests has become a popular way for companies to claim they are carbon neutral, even though their activities generate gases that cause global warming. However, some 90 percent of credits offered by the world's leading provider, Verra, are likely ""phantom credits,"" said a study published on January 18 by British newspaper The Guardian, German weekly Die Zeit and SourceMaterial, a nonprofit investigative journalism organisation. Their nine-month investigation, including an analysis of existing studies into Verra's rainforest schemes and on the ground reporting, found that the offsets largely did not lead to effective reductions in deforestation or any climate benefit. ""Only a handful of Verra's rainforest projects showed evidence of deforestation reductions, according to two studies, with further analysis indicating that 94 percent of the credits had no benefit to the climate,"" said The Guardian. Verra, the world's largest carbon credit provider that has issued over one billion carbon credits since 2009, wrote on its website that the studies cited had reached ""incorrect conclusions."" It said their methodology did not account for ""project-specific factors that cause deforestation."" To generate a ""carbon credit,"" a project must be implemented to protect a part of a rainforest and ensure it is not felled. Thus, the area saved corresponds to an amount of carbon those trees are able to absorb from the atmosphere. A company can buy credits to offset its emissions. Companies like Verra are supposed to ensure that the projects they invest in are real and effective, however questions have long hung over the methodology used to determine this. Verra said it has ""recently"" reviewed its calculation methods and is in the process of standardising its methodology. The voluntary carbon offsets market has recorded impressive growth over the last years to near UDS 2 billion in 2021,quadruplating from 2020, according to the latest State of the Voluntary Carbon Markets report from Ecosystem Marketplace."

"""Blue Beauty"", the new formula kit by Seppic for responsible beauty","During the Cosmet'Agora show on January 10 and 11, 2023, Seppic presented its new collection of seven formulas inspired by the ""Blue Beauty"" trend. Blue Beauty offers beauty products sourced from marine resources while being respectful of nature, in particular the oceans. The formulas Seppic presented at Cosmet'Agora 2023 have been developed to inspire formulators through three axes: Use less water. For this, Seppic offers an oily formula and an anhydrous balm. The balm has been proposed to the Cosmet'Agora formulation contest for its multipurpose moisturizing, purifying and deodorant potential with high naturality (> 99% according to ISO 16128). This melting formula is composed of just over 50% Emogreen L19 and 10% Sepifine BB, two texturizing agents that provide a light and non-greasy feel, despite an anhydrous composition. Preserve the oceans from pollution. To address this, Seppic has come up with two formulas. The first, a powder shower gel to be reconstituted, composed of easily biodegradable ingredients including Proteol APL EF, a mild anionic surfactant, inspired by the characteristic aminogram of the apple, and generating a creamy foam. The second, an SPF 50 sunscreen with fat-soluble UV filters and formulated with Sensanov WR, an emulsifier with film-forming and water-resistant properties. Have more transparent sourcing. The three formulas offered feature active ingredients sourced in Brittany at the Seppic site in Pontrieux. Codiavelane BG PF, a green algae extract with moisturizing properties, is indeed sourced and produced in this same region and is integrated to a transparent bluish gel formula evoking the ocean. Furthermore, Celtosome Crithmum maritimum and Celtosome Eryngium maritimumare derived from the plant cell culture technology, Celtosome. Developed respectively from sea fennel and sea holly, they help target skin regeneration as well as radiance and fit perfectly into a texture for mature skin. Finally, a spa treatment formula with Breton seaweed flakes completes this kit. ""Over the past few decades, the beauty industry has evolved and begun to better address consumer concerns about safety, health and the environment. Blue Beauty is the latest step in this evolution. More information on this trend and formulas are available upon request,"" said Seppic in a statement."

Silab adapts its governance to ensure its independence,"The French manufacturer of natural cosmetic active ingredients, which until now was a limited company with a board of directors, has become a limited company with a management board and a supervisory board, effective January 1st, 2023. For Jean Paufique, founder of Silab in 1984, the goal is to allow the company to maintain its independence, which considered the key factor of its success. ""This independence gives Silab a large freedom of decision in terms of innovation and investments and places it as a strategic supplier to its main customers,"" said the company in a statement. Mr. Paufique has therefore decided to entrust the operational management of the company to the five members of the former management committee: Brigitte Closs-Gonthier, Jean-Philippe Cosson, Xavier Gaillard, Florence Giner-Meilhac and Dominique Muller.

Estée Lauder launches AI-powered beauty app for visually impaired users,"The Estée Lauder Companies (ELC) UK & Ireland has launched what they called ""a first-of-its-kind"" Voice-Enabled Makeup Assistant (VMA) application. Powered by artificial intelligence, the mobile app helps visually impaired users to apply makeup more easily and confidently. ""ELC's ambition for the launch of VMA is to support the visually impaired community by further enabling self-expression and self-empowerment through their relationship with makeup,"" said the company in a statement. VMA uses voice instruction technologies to assist the user in makeup application; users receive audio feedback and tips on whether their lipstick, eyeshadow, or foundation is evenly applied. Using Artificial Intelligence, ELC's VMA identifies makeup applied on a user's face and assesses the uniformity and boundaries of application and coverage. VMA identifies any areas on the face that may require more accurate application and audibly describes where touch ups may be needed. In the UK alone, the National Health Service estimates that more than 2 million people are living with sight loss, of whom 340,000 are registered as blind or partially sighted. The VMA App will initially be available via the Apple App Store in the UK and esteelauder.co.uk. The Estée Lauder brand in the UK will be the first to adopt and promote this technology. It is targeted to launch on the Google Play store within the year and across other ELC brands and markets in the near future. The launch is the first iteration of the app, intended to be continuously optimized and improved over the coming months. Future versions of the application will offer expanded services, with the goal of providing new features, including looks to choose from, and makeup education tools to help visually impaired users better utilize ELC's products and services."

"Le Galion revives L'Astre, Ava Gardner's mythical perfume","The French perfume house bought and relaunched in 2014 by Nicolas Chabot has signed an exclusive license agreement with The Ava Gardner Trust [1] to relaunch L'Astre, a legendary fragrance created for the personal and exclusive use of the Hollywood star by Paul Vacher (co-creator of Arpège and Miss Dior), which at the time was the perfumer and owner of the brand. Indeed, the actress and Le Galion were inextricably linked at the end of the 1950s, when she became an ambassador for the brand and the face of Sortilège, a perfume tribute to extravagant parties and the signature scent of 1950s high society. At the end of their collaboration, Paul Vacher composed L'Astre, a tailor-made fragrance that remained private for decades. The licensing agreement covers the creation, production (with Givaudan) and distribution of a contemporary reedition of L'Astre. The project was made possible thanks to the contribution of the Ava Gardner Estate and its heirs who offered access to their archives. Created by Rodrigo Florès-Roux, this new version of L'Astre is, according to the perfumer, a ""large, exuberant and magnetic floral."" After a catchphrase made of sensual spices, the perfumer worked on ""a spectacular floral accord"" made of white flowers, before continuing with an amber, warm and enveloping background. Born in 1930, Le Galion soon met international success thanks to several iconic perfumes composed by Paul Vacher, including Sortilège (1936), Special For Gentleman (1947) and Eau Noble (1972). L'Astre will be unveiled to the public on February 1, 2023: www.legalionparfums.com"

Neopac launches new range of robust rHDPE caps with high PCR Rates,"Hoffmann Neopac recently launched a new range of post-consumer recycled (PCR) caps suitable for a wide variety of the company's tube solutions in the personal care and beauty markets. At its inception, the new series will include recycled high-density polyethylene (rHDPE) screw caps from 19-40 millimetres in diameter, a flip-top cap 35mm in diameter, and an octagonal cap for sample tubes. Each is fully recyclable in existing HDPE streams. The range offers a remarkably high content in PCR material – approximately 70%. Combined with Neopac's various eco-designed tubes, the result is a capability to create packaging solutions comprised of up to 77% recycled material. According to Neopac, the new rHDPE caps comply with the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC+) requirements, and can come with food-grade light statements from government entities like the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and US Food & Drug Administration (FDA). Neopac's new rHDPE caps can also help brand owners save on extended producer responsibility (EPR) fees in markets where they are have to be paid. The rHDPE caps are produced using 50% green electricity in Neopac's Switzerland and Hungary manufacturing facilities. ""As tube manufacturers have continued to make progress toward true circularity, caps have always presented a significant sustainability hurdle,"" said Cornelia Schmid, Head of Marketing for Neopac. ""Rooted in research and materials science, our new rHDPE caps, which contain 70% PCR material, represent a substantial step in the right direction, and we look forward to adding to the series in the coming months."" The rHDPE are the latest in Neopac's portfolio of EcoDesign packaging solutions. Earlier this year, the company introduced Eco-Stripped Tube, which combines a significantly reduced sleeve wall thickness with a comparable materials reduction in the shoulder and cap. The result is a 30% reduction in overall virgin materials without sacrificing product protection, haptics or aesthetics. According to Neopac, four Eco-Stripped Tubes can be made with the amount of materials it takes to produce three conventional tubes of the same size. Trimmed-down tubes therefore help to substantially reduce the carbon footprint of packaging solutions. Other solutions in Neopac's EcoDesign portfolio includes Polyfoil MMB, whose mono-material barrier brings vastly improved recyclability; Sugarcane Tube, made from renewable raw materials; and PICEA wood tube, comprised of 95% renewable material in the tube body and shoulder – including 10% of spruce wood from wood waste in sawmills."
"Vivienne Westwood, punk queen turned fashion dame, dies aged 81","Doyenne of British design Vivienne Westwood, who brought rebellious politics to the catwalk, died on Thursday aged 81, her family said. Westwood made provocation itself into an art form — from the leather bondage gear she popularised in the 1970s to the time she went without underwear to Buckingham Palace to receive her damehood from the late Queen Elizabeth II. ""Vivienne Westwood died today, peacefully and surrounded by her family, in Clapham, South London. The world needs people like Vivienne to make a change for the better,"" her fashion label's Twitter account said. Leading tributes, London's Victoria and Albert Museum described Westwood as a ""true revolutionary and rebellious force in fashion"", while Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan said she had been a ""towering figure"". ""Her punk style rewrote the rule book in the 1970s and (she) was widely admired for how she stayed true to her own values throughout her life,"" she wrote on Twitter. In an ever-colourful career, Westwood sent a bare-breasted Kate Moss down the runway munching on ice cream, and almost broke Naomi Campbell's ankle when the supermodel failed to stay upright on a pair of her nine-inch platform heels. And she held on to her edge even as she was embraced by the establishment, thanks largely to her energetic activism for environmental causes. It was all a long way from the village of Tintwistle in northern England where Vivienne Isabel Swire was born on April 8, 1941 to a mother who worked in a cotton mill and a father who mended shoes. She made her own tailored suits as a teenager and studied jewellery in London, but quickly dropped out, later saying: ""I didn't know how a working-class girl like me could possibly make a living in the art world."" She became a teacher, married factory worker Derek Westwood and had a son by the time she was 22. Her life took a major swerve when she left her husband for Malcolm McLaren, manager of the Sex Pistols, a few years later. Together, they opened a clothing store on London's King's Road that became the epicentre of the punk movement. The shop morphed over time, but at its peak, under the name ""SEX"", the ripped T-shirts, latex and leather bondage gear became the provocative uniform of a generation set on tearing down the last cultural taboos. ""We saw it as a question of youth against age. Who needs leaders who are a total rip-off, who create war and torture?"" she told L'Officiel magazine in 2018. Chrissie Hynde, who worked at SEX before going on to form the band the Pretenders, tweeted on Thursday that ""the world is already a less interesting place"" without Westwood. Westwood later claimed she had no interest in becoming a fashion designer — that she had only done it to support McLaren's ambitions — but she knew where her talents lay. Her first proper fashion show came in 1981. Remembered as the Pirate Collection, it was an instant hit, modelled as much on Native Americans as nautical miscreants. ""No designer had ever done this before, they'd been inspired by historical clothes, but I actually copied them,"" she told L'Officiel. She continued to plumb British and French history to great acclaim, creating the Mini-Crini (combining Victorian crinoline with the modern mini-skirt) in 1985. Her ""Witches"" collection, a collaboration with graffiti artist Keith Haring, was beloved by Madonna at the height of her stardom. In 1992, she married Kronthaler, an Austrian former student of hers, 25 years her junior. He became her creative director and increasingly took over the design work in later years. By the 2000s, she was a full-fledged celebrity — designing wedding dresses not just for the elite, but for iconic TV characters including Carrie Bradshaw in ""Sex and the City"" and even Miss Piggy. In 2014, Westwood designed glamourous new uniforms for Virgin Atlantic's flight attendants, with the airline hailing her on Thursday as a ""true British icon and... visionary"". Westwood's political activism became ever more pronounced in later years, advocating against arbitrary detention, nuclear weapons and especially supporting environmental causes and groups like Greenpeace. Critics have pointed out that Westwood hardly stuck to the pledges in the ""Climate Revolution Charter"" she issued during her 2013-14 fall-winter collection. Advocacy group Remake gave her brand a failing score of 21 out of 100 on its sustainability index. Few, however, could deny that she brought a unique form of engagement and humanity into the world of fashion. She was also a staunch supporter of jailed WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, protesting on his behalf and even designing his wife's dress for their wedding at Belmarsh prison outside London earlier this year. WikiLeaks tweeted news of Westwood's death along with side-by-side photos of her and Assange wearing the same Westwood-designed T-shirt, adding ""Rest in Power""."
Stoelzle Masnières makes the bottle of Parfums de Marly's new fragrance,"Parfum de Marly has entrusted French glassmaker Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie for the production of the bottle of their latest female fragrance, Oriana. When creating Oriana, Julien Sprecher, founder and Artistic Director of Parfums de Marly, intended to regenerate the brilliant balance between tradition and innovation. This new and refreshing scent was developed by two incredible perfumers, Nathalie Lorson and Hamid Merati-Kashani. Together, they blended a mix of fruity and floral aromas; using the undertones of mandarin, grapefruit and bergamot to complement the more exuberant perfumes of orange blossom, raspberry and blackcurrant. In addition, hints of marshmallow, whipped cream, musk and ambrette are found to subtly ensue. Parfum de Marly uses the same shaped bottle for all their women's perfumes. Men's products also come in the same shaped bottle, the only difference is the colour For Stoelzle Masnières Perfumerie, the challenge was to bring to life a unique design with very refined engraving. Oriana's scent is available in 75 ml and 30 ml bottles and the glassmaker had to maintain the same finesse with each bottle size, ensuring the smaller bottle didn't lose any of the intricate detail."
Which social network ranked highest among Gen Z and Millennials in 2022?,"As we head into 2023, it's time to take stock of which social platforms took the lead in this year's popularity stakes. Between TikTok, Twitter and Meta, social players have done everything to seduce younger generations, but which ones won their favour? With more features, more ways to earn money, or even more freedom, some platforms have managed to attract new users compared to 2021. So reports a study from YPulse, conducted among 1,500 young users, ages 13 to 39, in the United States and Canada. While Generations Z and Y are using each platform for a specific purpose, they are still most likely to use YouTube. The video streaming site remains the most popular platform for young people at 72%, despite a slight drop in use from 74% in 2021. Despite repeated scandals and controversy, Meta manages to hold its own with two of its social networks in the top three. Facebook and Instagram, respectively second and third in the ranking, also show a decline in usage among young people of Generations Z and Y. Just like Facebook Messenger, which has suffered the biggest drop in usage at 10%, dropping from 53% to 43%. WhatsApp, another platform belonging to Mark Zuckerberg's Meta group, takes ninth place with 26% of respondents saying they currently use this application. Despite being placed at the bottom of the ranking, WhatsApp is among the six platforms that have seen an increase in usage among the young people surveyed in the space of one year. The platform gains 10 percentage points compared to 2021. A feat that Reddit has also managed, going from 17% to 27% usage among young people. On closer inspection, the YPulse Social Media Monitor report shows differences between Generations Z and Y. Millennials are more likely to use Facebook, at 69% compared to 37% for Gen Zers. On the other hand, TikTok is a must-have for 69% of the younger generation versus 49% for their elders. The success of WhatsApp and Reddit is mostly driven by Millennials, while Discord is more popular with Gen Z. For its part, TikTok continues to impose itself among the favorite platforms of the young generation, but it has seen its growth slow down significantly in 2022, reaching 55% usage in November 2022 compared to 48% a year earlier. Top social platforms that young people currently use: 1 - YouTube November 2021: 74% November 2022: 72% 2 - Facebook November 2021: 65% November 2022: 59% 3 - Instagram November 2021: 61% November 2022: 57% 4 - TikTok November 2021: 48% November 2022: 55% 5 - Snapchat November 2021: 47% November 2022: 48% 6 - Facebook Messenger November 2021: 53% November 2022: 43% 7 - Twitter November 2021: 30% November 2022: 33% 8 - Reddit November 2021: 17% November 2022: 27% 9 - WhatsApp November 2021: 16% November 2022: 26% 10 - Discord November 2021: 20% November 2022: 24% 11 - Pinterest November 2021: 25% November 2022: 21%"

Founders of first sustainable castor bean program unveil impact analysis,"Arkema, BASF SE and Jayant Agro-Organics, the founders of the Pragati project for sustainable castor beans, along with implementation partner Solidaridad, have published the latest results of the world's first sustainable castor program. Initiated in May 2016 in Gujarat, India, where the majority of the world's castor supply originates, the goal of the project has been to enable sustainable castor crop production by: – Using good agricultural practices to increase yield and farmer income; – Efficiently using water resources and maintaining soil fertility; – Driving adoption of good waste management practices; – Enabling better health and safety practices and respecting human rights. After six years, the program has allowed to train, audit and certify over 6,200 farmers and over 50,000 tons of certified castor (Ricinus communis) seed have been cultivated. In addition: – On year 6, lands included in the program have reached a yield 22% higher than the average yield published by the local government for the region. – Over 6,000 hectares are now being regularly farmed in accordance with the SuCCESS sustainable castor code [1] - more than 19,000 hectares cumulatively; Pragati farmers are increasing their land dedicated to castor farming as it is seen as a profitable crop. – Approximately 6,300 safety kits and crop protection product boxes have been distributed free of charge. – Water consumption has been lowered by approximately 30 percent in the demo plots where accurate measurement and control is in place. – Farmers from more than 80 villages in North Gujarat now participate in the program. – In 2021, more than 260 individual training sessions were held with farmers. Heavy emphasis is also put on improved personal safety and chemical hygiene (with the use of disposable respirators, safety glasses and gloves, as well as easy-to-understand, picture-based instructions that show where, when and how to use each personal protection item, along with instructions on how to handle chemicals safely). Considering the successful implementation in the previous years, the Pragati members said they are ""further committed"" to program."

Tokyo exhibit showcases Dior's passion for Japan,"A hit exhibition showcasing Christian Dior's work opens in Tokyo this week, with a focus on the French designer's fascination with Japan and the country's influence on his pieces. After drawing huge crowds in Paris, London and New York, ""Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams"" is opening today in Japan, the exhibition features 350 haute couture dresses — including Japan-inspired gowns displayed in settings intended to pay tribute to Japanese culture. Architect Shohei Shigematsu created structures, including a room covered with an undulating three-dimensional facade constructed from translucent traditional washi paper pasted over wooden frames. ""When Dior makes a skirt, there is a structure and then the fabric is laid on top of it,"" he told AFP. ""I was asked to create a Japanese traditional structure, so I thought about shoji screens, for example, which have a wooden structure and are covered with paper."" Each section features a different interior design intended to show various parts of Japanese culture. ""There is a section inspired by an orderly tatami room separated by sliding doors. But not everything in Japan is simple and minimal. […] We have different designs like Japanese gardens and flashy kimonos. I wanted to show the sides of Japan people don't know,"" said Shohei Shimegatsu. The Dior house first presented a show in Japan in 1953, and the designer had a well-known fascination with the country. «Dior had a lot of respect for traditional Japanese culture, and he wrote about it in his memoir», curator Florence Muller told AFP. «I think there is a mutual fascination between France and Japan».Starting in the 1950s, Dior also collaborated with Japanese companies, giving them the rights to adapt and reproduce Dior looks to cater to local tastes. In a sign of the brand's popularity, Japan's former empress Michiko chose a Dior gown made from Japanese textiles when she married then-prince Akihito in 1959. The Tokyo show, which runs until May 28, includes archive pieces as well as works by more recent creative directors, and showcases several items inspired by Japan. Among them is a John Galliano coat with ""The Great Wave Off Kanagawa"" print emblazoned on the base of its full skirt, and robes cinched with Japanese obi-style belts created by Raf Simons. Dior's austere jacket dress named ""Rashomon""— the name of a Japanese novel and film directed by the legendary Akira Kurosawa — is also on display. ""This exhibition shows the mutual respect between Japan and France in their approach to crafts, fashion, design and art"", said Shigematsu."

UK airports to relax aircraft liquid rules from 2024,"The UK government announced on Thursday that it will significantly relax limits on taking liquids in carry-on luggage at airports from June 2024. Currently, only containers of less than 100 ml are allowed in the aircraft cabin at international airports, provided they are placed in clear bags at security checks. Larger containers have to be checked in the hold, and electronic devices such as laptops must also be removed from bags. But under a new bill to be presented to parliament on Thursday, limits for liquids will be raised to two litres. Electronic devices will also no longer have to be checked separately, the Department for Transport said in a statement. The rules, introduced in the early 2000s to prevent the use of liquid explosives on planes, have become a bind for travellers, regularly holding up queues. The relaxation comes as a result of new technology being deployed at major airports in the UK over the next two years, the department said. The ""cutting-edge"" machines will give security staff more detailed three-dimensional images of what people are carrying in their bags. Similar CT X-ray technology uses ""highly advanced threat-detection algorithms"" and is being rolled out at other airports around the world, said Transport Secretary Mark Harper. ""By 2024, major airports across the UK will have the latest security tech installed, reducing queueing times, improving the passenger experience, and most importantly detecting potential threats,"" he added. Rules on liquids were tightened after a British man, Richard Reid, tried to blow up a transatlantic jet in December 2001 using homemade explosives hidden in his shoes. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents airlines, said it hoped the industry and passengers would be given ""plenty of notice"" of any changes. It also called for it to be ""coordinated globally""."

Avatly: A new hybrid shopping mecca designed for avatars,"The first shopping mall, dedicated mainly to fashion is opening in the metaverse. Called Avatly, this digital mall will allow our virtual counterparts to indulge in highly realistic shopping sessions in order to fill their closets with digital clothing. And, if they have some money left over, they might even buy you one or two real-world clothing items. This new shopping destination spans 300,000 (virtual) square meters, and spread over three (virtual) floors, this new kind of shopping mall, mainly dedicated to fashion. The building takes the form of a giant diamond, symbolizing, according to its founders, ""independence, wealth and exclusivity."" The mall is set in the middle of an island in the tropics. Built with the Unreal Engine 5 creation tool, and based on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain, this shopping mall of the future already promises a host of activities and applications, even though it is still in its early stages. ""Avatly will provide the best real-time 3D experience and avatar solutions, taking the shopping experience into a completely new dimension. Avatly will also integrate Metaverse 3D boutiques with e-commerce, dedicated to premium fashion brands and designers,"" reads the website dedicated to this new virtual fashion hotspot. Concretely, visitors will simply be able to enter a store to visualize a brand's contents, and to buy products directly on its e-store, whether these be virtual or real-world clothes. Thanks to a simple application, users will first be able to create their avatar(s), which the company promises will be ""ultra-realistic,"" before accessing a wide range of clothing and accessory collections. Not content with browsing, users will be able to try on items virtually before buying them (or not) in the various Avatly spaces and even on 3D catwalks. Last but not least, they will be able to buy clothes in two versions, in 3D for virtual use or in physical form via integrated traditional e-commerce platforms. The mall is also expected to feature entertainment areas, including fashion shows and virtual reality parties, catering for those who less keen on shopping — or waiting tirelessly for avatars capable of spending hours locked in a fitting room. It remains to be seen whether fashion brands — as well as users — are ready to take the plunge."
Nearly half of Brits shop online outside the UK to find cheaper products,"Almost half (48%) of British consumers say that they shop online outside their domestic market because it is cheaper than shopping locally, reveals a new survey of 9,000 global consumers commissioned by Global-e, the leading cross-border ecommerce solutions provider, and carried out by Censuswide [1]. The survey of cross-border ecommerce shoppers across nine markets, reveals the UK (25%) is the third most popular market for global consumers to make an international purchase from, behind the US (46%) and China (42%). Meanwhile, among UK shoppers, China (57%) and the US (47%) are the most popular markets for cross-border shopping, followed by Germany (11%), Spain (10%) and France (9%). Affordability was the top reason driving Brits to shop online internationally, slightly higher than the global average (47%). For UK respondents, this is closely followed by the brand having a wide variety of products (33%) and offering low shipping costs (28%). In contrast, expensive shipping (59%) and a lengthy or costly delivery time (43%) are the top reasons for Brits to abandon a cart when shopping internationally. As the busy retail peak shopping period takes hold, retailers looking to maximise their profits this quarter can expect consumers to look online for the best deals. The survey also revealed that 62% of British respondents prefer to shop directly from the brands website, compared to only 33% of respondents preferring to shop on a marketplace. Those aged between 25-34 year-olds are the most likely to purchase from a brand directly (71%) followed by those aged 16-24 (66%). Social channels also play a large role in driving international sales with 46% of British consumers purchasing from an international brand after coming across it on social media. For Brits, social is more prominent in driving cross-border sales than both online search (42%) and online marketplaces (34%). Of those British consumers that have gone on to purchase due to the influence of social media, Instagram (58%) is by far the most popular followed by Facebook/Meta (42%) and TikTok (32%). More than half of those ages 16-24 cite TikTok (69%) as the most popular platform to discover brands on, with Instagram (55%) coming in second. Whilst older platforms like Instagram and Facebook come out on top for the older age groups, 27% of 35-44 year olds have made a purchase because they engaged with the brand on TikTok, showing it isn't only the youngest demographic that brands can reach on the platform. Clothes, Shoes & Accessories (74%) is the most popular category for UK shoppers when making a purchase online internationally. This is followed by Health & Beauty (29%) and Jewellery & Watches (23%). Globally, Clothes, Shoes & Accessories (61%) are by far the most popular cross-border ecommerce category, followed by Health & Beauty (30%) and Consumer Electronics & Technology (30%). ""Amidst the cost of living crisis, it is unsurprising that many consumers around the world are looking for affordable alternatives online, and looking to international markets to make some of these purchases. This is predominantly happening directly from a brand's website, demonstrating the crucial need for brands to not just streamline domestic platforms but ensure that their international direct-to-consumer offering is tailored and localised to individual markets so consumers are able to shop with ease no matter where they are in the world. Moreover, British retailers can use these insights to level the playing field, by first localising international direct-to-consumer channels then investing in the right channels, such as via key social media platforms, with to drive traffic and ultimately revenue growth,"" said Nir Debbi, Co-founder and President at Global-e."

Givaudan Active Beauty: A retinol alternative with a high tolerability profile,"Givaudan Active Beauty is strengthening its well-ageing portfolio with the launch of Siliphos, a natural alternative to retinoids. The new active ingredient is extracted by green fractionation from milk thistle fruits and powered by Phytosome technology. According to Givaudan Active Beauty, Siliphos outperforms bakuchiol - the current plant-based retinol alternative benchmark. Thanks to a high tolerability profile, Siliphos challenges retinoid efficacy by reducing wrinkles without side effects. It is therefore suitable for delicate skin. ""Siliphos is the first natural alternative to retinoids and bakuchiol capable of providing well-ageing benefits comparable to retinol. Extracted from Silybum marianum Gaertn fruit, it acts directly on collagen production to provide a natural, safe and efficient skincare solution, suitable for even most delicate skins,"" said Giada Maramaldi, Botanical Actives Category Manager for Active Beauty. The well-ageing performance of Siliphos was tested in a clinical study on volunteers presenting crow's feet and forehead wrinkles. According to Givaudan, all tests demonstrated Siliphos to significantly outperform bakuchiol and act as efficiently as retinoids by reducing: – Crow's feet wrinkles by x2 (at D56 versus placebo), – Overall facial wrinkles by x2.3 (at D56 versus placebo) – Number of forehead wrinkles by 21.2% (at D56 versus bakuchiol) – Circumference of forehead wrinkles by 17.4% (at D56 versus bakuchiol) – Redness by 22.9% (at D56 versus retinoid). Siliphos was developed to address the growing demand for efficient natural cosmetic alternatives. According to Givaudan's global CMI study [1], 77% of the consumers across six countries declared that they would be very interested in a natural version of retinol: enjoying the multiple skin benefits without worrying about the potential side effects, such as redness, dryness and irritation."

Gattefossé focuses on pleasing the senses with new sun care formulas,"The French-based manufacturer of cosmetic ingredients has unveiled eight new sun care formulas containing organic UV filters, mineral or a combination of both and created from four key ingredients of its portfolio. Developed by Gattefossé's application lab, the new set aims to combine performance, stability, and sensoriality in order to respond to both the challenges faced by formulators and the needs and requirements of consumers.

Addition of UV filters to cosmetics brings greasiness and stickiness that are difficult to hide and unpleasant to the consumer,"" explains the company in a statement. Gattefossé has developed four ingredients (three emulsifiers and a texturizing agent) that respond to the major issues encountered in the formulation of suncare products: – Emulium Illustro, a W/O emulsifier compatible with organic and mineral UV filters to create stable formulations with a comfortable feel. – Emulium Dolcea MB, an O/W emulsifier, to create stable textures with an ultra-soft and non-tacky afterfeel. – Emulium Mellifera MB, another O/W emulsifier that makes it possible to formulate suncare products with a light and non-greasy finish. – Finally, Acticire MB, an active texturizing agent that improves sensoriality of suncare products by reducing the greasy and tacky afterfeel. It also improves durability of the protective film on the skin, as observed with the UV camera. Focus on two formulas 2494-1.13 Powdery Stick SPF50+ Some body areas are particularly prone to UV damage and deserve a foolproof sun protection: nose, cheekbones, scars, tattoos...

""We have been working on suncare for eight years now. Our ingredients enable to create innovative textures with all kinds of UV filters. Our expert sensory panel helps us to optimize the sensory profiles of our suncare products. Performance being a priority, we test our formulas to guarantee the protective efficacy (SPF in vitro and in vivo, UVA), the water resistance and the photostability of UV filters. We offer help to our customers for any suncare related questions, or to provide expertise and assistance for their formulation projects,"" explains Malorie Duvent, Cosmetic evaluation manager and Suncare expert at Gattefossé."

Two other Clariant products on the market based on this advanced technology are Rootness Energize and Prenylium. Prenylium is a white mulberry tree root extract that is a sustainably sourced active ingredient for premium well-aging skincare. It won the PCHi 2020 Fountain Award due to its significant effect on ""anti-aging"", while Rootness Energize is an extract of the roots of Luffa cylindrica which promotes skin elasticity to tonicity and firmness. For its innovative production process and its clinical results, Rootness Energize won the bronze prize at the BSB Innovation Awards 2020 in the category ""Skin Benefits""."
in-cosmetics Asia celebrates the most innovative personal care ingredients,"The organisers of the in-cosmetics Asia trade show — which took place in Bangkok from 1-3 November 2022 — have announced this year's Innovation Zone and Spotlight On Formulation Award winners.

""I am always curious and amazed to know what nature has developed to evolve, survive and defend itself. Indeed, nature is extremely powerful and offers us its incredible capacities to produce molecules of interest,"" says Frédéric De Baene is R&D Biotechnology Director at the Croda Group.

"71% of adults have sensitive skin, finds recent study by Aveeno","A recent review of published literature showed the proportion of individuals with self-reported sensitive skin to some degree was 71% in the general population [1], an increase of 55% in just two decades [2]. However, in their recently published State of Skin Sensitivity Report, Aveeno points out that ""sensitive skin"" – usually defined as as ""unpleasant sensory responses to stimuli that should not provoke such sensations"" — is not a clinical diagnosis by itself. It can encompass a range of skin issues from a reaction to external environmental stressors, a product or ingredient, to a symptom of an underlying skin disease. In order to better understand the causes of sensitive skin, and explores the connection between body, mind, and skin, the Johnson & Johnson brand conducted an online survey of 1,000 participants (800 females, 200 males, aged 18-65) among self-declared sensitive skin consumers of varying ethnicities. The research validates the relationship between emotions and perceptions of sensitive skin. Results show that consumers believe stress and ingredients cause the majority of skin reactions. Furthermore, those who identified as extremely sensitive were 200% more likely to have been diagnosed with eczema, rosacea, acne, or allergies than those who identified as slightly sensitive. And one-third of patients with skin diseases like acne, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and rosacea are estimated to struggle with emotional disorders, including anxiety and depression [3]. Additionally, 50 percent of adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis reported that it puts a damper on their social functions, sleep, work productivity, leisure activities, and family relationships [4]. ""Treating patients goes well beyond simply analyzing their skin. It's about how their skin impacts their overall emotional well-being, which is something I consistently see with my patients,"" said Dr. Mara Weinstein Velez, Board Certified Dermatologist and paid Aveeno consultant. ""The mind-skin connection is a powerful one, and the Aveeno brand's ability to assemble this in-depth report examining the impact of skin sensitivity provides much needed visibility for the dermatology community."" ""Our brand heritage is built on leadership and expertise in the sensitive skin state, and this report illustrates the meaningful impact sensitive skin has on people's lives,"" added KC Hagin, Commercial Leader for Aveeno at Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. ""We have an obligation not only to provide product solutions but to help de-stigmatize the word 'sensitive' and to turn a common struggle into a strength. Aveeno wants to be front and center of the conversation and is encouraging everyone to be proud of their sensitive skin."" To further encourage conversation around what it really means to have sensitive skin, Aveeno is calling on consumers to share their #ProudlySensitiveSkin stories on social media. The campaign aims to highlight various consumer experiences with skin conditions and showcase how people have learned to love their sensitive skin."
LVMH and Hang Lung sign a partnership to reduce energy consumption,"LVMH pursues policy to reduce energy consumption, signing first partnership with a leading shopping mall owner, Hang Lung Properties, creating a framework for energy efficiency collaboration. Hang Lung Properties, which owns a hundred malls in China, has notably committed to cutting its energy consumption by 18% by 2025, to turning off shops' lights outside business hours, and to ensuring the presence of electricity meters. For its part, LVMH's commitments include sourcing 70% of its materials from within a radius of 500 kilometres, along with measuring and tracking energy consumption at its stores. The two partners' objective is to reduce their environmental impact while at the same time ensuring the health of customers and employees, with special emphasis on indoor air quality, for example by installing air quality sensors in all stores. This cooperation with a major landlord will enable LVMH to achieve more quickly its environmental objectives thanks to swift and effective implementation of the standards set by the LIFE 360 roadmap. This includes progress at stores whose premises are owned by third parties outside the Group. This initial agreement is groundbreaking in scope and consolidates efforts to achieve the LVMH Group's announced target of a 10% cut in energy consumption worldwide by October 2023.

Rémy Cointreau Group to tap into the fragrance market with Maison Psyché,"Combining the ancestral know-hows of expertise of the perfumery and spirits worlds is not that new. Killian Hennessy and Frapin are good illustrations of niche fragrance brands with deep roots in the world of spirits. Rémy Cointreau is taking the plunge with the creation of a luxurious perfume house: Maison Psyché. The brand was born when Baptiste Loiseau, Cellar Master of the Maison Rémy Martin, met Sophie Labbé, Principal Perfumer at Firmenich. The two creative souls have selected perfumery's finest raw materials and have left them to age in Maison Rémy Martin cellars in Cognac, France, within tonnelets (small oak casks) specially designed by Seguin Moreau, to allow them to expand their range of expression. ""Time has done its work and the result is striking, just like for our eaux de vie,"" said Baptiste Loiseau. According to the brand, this unique combination of high end fragrance ingredients and wood gave birth to five new fragrance whose longevity on the skin and olfactory richness have ""no equal"". Maison Psyché's fragrances are available in Baccarat crystal bottles, adorned in gold - some with diamonds, numbered and only available in very limited quantities. For Francesco Riosa, CEO of Maison Psyché, ""the creation of Maison Psyché is the fulfilment of a wonderful dream. The dream of reinventing La Grande Parfumerie in the 21st century and restoring its prestige by connecting it to the traditional and time-honoured expertise of Exceptional Spirits."" According to Eric Vallat, CEO of Rémy Cointreau Group, high-end perfumery is a natural extension of the group's spirits business. ""The Maison Psyché range is based on the special blending and ageing expertise specific to the world of spirits to elevate the finest raw materials from perfumery and create innovative fragrances. Maison Psyché is a bridge between two worlds, that of luxury fragrance and that of spirits, and a bold venture with terroirs, people and time at its very heart."""
Woman sues five companies over claim hair straighteners spurred uterine cancer,"Civil rights and personal injury attorney Ben Crump and mass tort counsel Diandra Debrosse Zimmermann have filed a lawsuit on behalf of Jenny Mitchell, a 32-year-old Missouri resident, claiming that her uterine cancer ""was directly and proximately caused by her regular and prolonged exposure to phthalates and other endocrine disrupting chemicals"" found in hair straightening products sold by L'Oréal USA, the maker of Dark & Lovely products, and other companies including Namaste Laboratories, Godrej Consumer Products and Dabur International. According to the lawsuit, Mrs Mitchell was diagnosed with uterine cancer at the age of 28, and underwent a full hysterectomy at Boone Hospital Center in Missouri on September 24, 2018. She attended mandatory medical appointments every three months for two years and now has appointments every six months. At a news conference, Mitchell said that she started using chemical hair relaxers around 2000, when she was about 8 years old, ""as most young African-American girls."" She continued using hair-straightening products until March 2022. She claimed to have no family history of cancer or uterine cancer. The lawsuit comes on the heels of a study published last week in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute that found the risk of developing uterine cancer in women who use chemical hair-straightening products frequently was 4% by age 70, compared to 1.6% in those who hadn't used any of the products in the previous 12 months. The study was conducted by the National Institute of Health's National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences among 33,497 American women aged 35 to 74, over a period of nearly 11 years. ""Black women have long been the victims of dangerous products specifically marketed to them,"" said Ben Crump in a statement. ""Black hair has been and always will be beautiful, but Black women have been told they have to use these products to meet society's standards. We will likely discover that Ms. Mitchell's tragic case is one of countless cases in which companies aggressively misled black women to increase their profits."" ""The fact that these companies targeted Black and Latin women for their own profit motive and without regard to the serious health risks that these hair-straightening products cause is a serious wrong that needs to be corrected,"" emphasized Diandra Debrosse Zimmermann. ""We have commenced this important litigation to seek and obtain justice for those women and their families."" Commenting on the study conducted by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Kimberly Norman, Senior Director, Safety and Regulatory Toxicology, at the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC), the trade body representing personal care and cosmetics manufacturers in the US, said it failed to establish a causal link with any specific ingredients in hair products or any specific chemicals. Mrs Mitchell is seeking compensation in excess of USD 75,000, according to the lawsuit."
Nivea adds recycled coffee grounds to latest face cream,"The German skincare brand has joined the upcycling movement: for the first time in its history, a recycled ingredient, coffee grounds, was used in a face cream, in the Naturally Good range. The company is making an effort to emphasize its status as a player committed to preserving our planet, making another step in the circular economy world. One kilogramme of coffee generates 1.2 kilogramme of waste. Every year, on the global level, we consume billions of kilogrammes of coffee, whose residues end up in landfill or, at best, in a compost bin. In addition, as they decompose, coffee grounds release methane, a gas that is harmful for the environment. Thanks to its partnership with Kaffe Bueno, a company which transforms coffee from the hotel and catering industries into cosmetic actives, Nivea offers a second life to coffee grounds. The oil extracted is contained in the new energizing face cream in the Naturally Good range available in supermarkets since late September 2022. Coffee is widely known as an excellent antioxidant, in particular in cosmetics, thanks to the caffeine and chlorogenic acid it contains. These actually help calm the skin, protect it from external aggressors, and prevent redness. To go even further, Nivea has packed this face cream, a formula produced thanks to 100% renewable power, in a jar made from ISCC-certified materials. The FSC-certified cardboard is derived from sustainably managed forests."

Mr. van der Laan (54) will take the lead of the company as of November 1, 2022. Sander van der Laan most recently steered the fortunes of Dutch non-food retailer Action as CEO for more than six years. Under his leadership, the company's sales increased from 2 to over 5 billion euros. He also played a key role in driving Action's international expansion in ten European countries, further developing the brand and product range and establishing the company's digital interface. Prior to joining Action, he spent over 16 years in various management positions at the retail company Ahold Delhaize - progressing to the position of CEO of the leading Dutch retail chain Albert Heijn, from 2011 to 2015. During this time, he was responsible for the transformation of Albert Heijn into a multi-channel brand and headed the company's expansion into new markets. ""I am delighted that we have won Sander van der Laan as CEO of Douglas. He is an excellent manager with proven experience in the retail industry and a strong leadership personality. I would like to thank Tina Müller on behalf of the entire Supervisory Board for her outstanding contribution to the company's success and regret her departure,"" said Henning Kreke, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Douglas.

Douglas offers nearly 300,000 beauty, health and lifestyle products though a retail network of around 1,900 online and physical stores. In fiscal year 2020/21, Douglas generated sales of 3.1 billion euros."
Huhtamaki and Milliken create mono-material HDPE tube for personal care,"Milliken & Company, a specialist in plastics additive and colorant technology, has partnered g with Finnish flexible packaging company Huhtamaki Group to develop a mono-material laminate for use in tubes targeting cosmetics, toothpaste and other personal-care applications. Milliken said they were able to improve the barrier properties of HDPE film by up to 50 percent thanks to their UltraGuard Solutions that slow down the transmission of oxygen and moisture in polyethylene. According to the manufacturer, these improved barrier properties contribute to packaging sustainability by enabling more mono-material construction of popular products — such as stand-up flexible pouches and tubes — and making them ultimately more recyclable. In addition, they allow for downgauging of the polyethylene (PE) film, resulting in a lighter-weight end product and a reduction in the amount of resin needed to achieve the desired result. ""The tube resulting from this joint development work is opaque with a silver shine, making it ideal for beauty product applications,"" said Dr. Detlev Schulz, Senior Manager - Sustainability and Business Development for Huhtamaki's Global Tube Laminates business. ""White would work as well, offering outstanding moisture barrier and improved oxygen transmission for all who don't need a shiny silver option."" Milliken thinks the most likely end uses will be in 40 to 200 ml tubes. The results of this joint effort will be on display at the K 2022 trade fair in Dusseldorf from October 19-26. Milliken will display high-density polyethylene (HDPE) tubes produced using Huhtamaki laminates optimized with the UltraGuard Solutions technology."

Credo Beauty acquires rival Follain to scale up clean beauty retail,"Clean beauty retailer Credo Beauty has acquired Follain, a Boston-based retail brand who, alongside Credo, was an early leader in the clean beauty movement in the U.S. Follain was founded by Tara Foley in 2013, one year before the creation of Credo by Shashi Batra and Annie Jackson in in 2014. As part of the acquisition, Credo will absorb Follain's online retail business and storefront in Beacon Hill, Boston.

Ex Nihilo expands internationally with new outlets,"Ex Nihilo is continuing its international expansion. The alternative brand, which totalled 135 points of sale in 25 countries last year — a figure that it has almost doubled today — recently opened three new flagship stores. A way of consolidating its global presence by moving eastwards. After establishing its first shop at 352 rue Saint-Honoré, in Paris, at the end of 2013, the brand has established itself in the most prestigious venues of the niche perfumery. At Galeries Lafayette Haussmann, Champs-Elysées, and La Samaritaine in Paris, at Harrods in London, Tsum in Moscow, Bergdorf Goodman and Saks in New York... Undeniably a hotbed of technology, California is very attractive for the brand, whose strength lies in part in its Osmologue. An innovative and exclusive tool, designed to personalise the brand's creations with beautiful ingredients. For instance, Ex Nihilo opened a store in Los Angeles last February, in the trendy and arty Sycamore Avenue quarter. But Asia is also a major stake for Benoit Verdier, Sylvie Loday and Olivier Royère, the three founders. After starting to lay the foundations with two corners in South Korea and Singapore, Ex Nihilo opened a store in Taiwan in September. This is a key step in Asia, with mainland China remaining an ambitious project in a complex geopolitical context. Ex Nihilo is also asserting its presence in the Middle East: after Dubai, the brand recently opened a store in Qatar, in the brand new Vendôme Mall in Doha. This is a strategic spot as the Football World Cup will soon take place in this country. In early September, it also inaugurated a flagship store in Saudi Arabia, at the Nakheel Mall in Riyadh. Though they follow the codes of the iconic Parisian boutique, each of these three new venues offers a personalised atmosphere, to provide a unique experience to customers on the go. As far as new products are concerned, the brand just launched Santa Calling on September 1st. A creation signed by Antoine Maisondieu, which stages the idea of a Parisian sandalwood, where the wood's mystical whiff meets the city's contemporary pulse. Australian sandalwood, hemmed in with milky notes and Bourbon Vanilla absolute, with an addictive trail. True to its distinctive customisation approach, Ex Nihilo will be offering for the holidays three of its fragrances with a musky base, to enhance their staying power, comfort and depth. Next year, new additions are expected to join the Ex Nihilo Collection, which currently consists of 40 creations proposed in 250 outlets worldwide, including six flagships."

Aptar: A new centre of excellence for luxury custom packaging,"Aptar beauty + home will officially open their new Be One production facility in July 2023 in Oyonnax, France. Covering 25,000 m2, this state-of-the-art plant will centralize all of the group's know-how (technological, logistical and decorative capabilities) for the premium and luxury custom packaging markets. Gathering four sites and five workshops into one, the new facility will be dedicated to delivering agile and competitive solutions to brands, through improved and adapted processes, while minimizing the impact on the environment and the carbon footprint. At the very heart of the ""Plastics Vallée"", Be One is also expected to deepen Aptar's territorial roots by relying on the unique local skills and expertise of the region's sub-contractors and technical partners. ""This will facilitate the delivery of a wide range of increasingly innovative and technically sophisticated products, while being geographically close to its European partners and customers,"" explains the group in a statement.

Sephora is launching online in the UK ahead of a physical return in 2023,"Going online today, the sephora.co.uk website replaces the Feelunique.com store acquired last year. This launch was announced last week as a prelude to the opening of brick-and-mortar stores in the UK, with a first flagship that mgiht open in London for spring 2023. At that time, Sephora's CEO said the transaction was ""a key step"" in the retailer's European growth strategy and ""a first step for Sephora's presence into the United Kingdom."" Indeed, Sephora had exited the U.K. retail market in May 2005 after opening just six stores in five years, the first of which was in the Bluewater shopping centre outside London. In any case, Feelunique's reward programme will stay in place, under the name Sephora Rewards, with customers receiving £5 off for every £75 spent, as well as other benefits. The United Kingdom is one of the top 10 biggest prestige beauty markets worldwide, with a very high level of digital adoption. However, Boots' strong positions in this market has long been a big hurdle for the French group. The Walgreens-owned chain claims that its UK market share is above 40 per cent for skin, makeup and premium beauty. Boots also claims that beauty makes up 50 per cent of sales on Boots.com. Other competitors include luxury retailer Space NK and e-tailer Cult Beauty. To celebrate their UK launch, Sephora has partnered with creative agency AKQA with a campaign focusing on the UK's ""living tapestry"" of cultures and identities. Dubbed 'Express All of You', the campaign, which has been directed by London-born photographer Felicity Ingram, tells the story of relatable expressions of British beauty through the portraits of five individuals. The beauty retailer, said the campaign sets out to authentically connect with the hearts and minds of British audiences by inviting viewers to unleash their beauty power."
Consumer Goods: Strong demand for chemically recycled materials by 2030,"Consumer goods manufacturers will need large quantities of chemically recycled plastics! This is what member companies of The Consumer Goods Forum's (CGF) Coalition of Action on Plastic Waste are stating in an open letter addressed to suppliers, regulators and investors. The twelve companies - Amcor, Barilla, Colgate Palmolive, Danone, Ferrero, Haleon, Henkel, Mars, Incorporated, McCain Foods, Mondelēz International, PepsiCo, Unilever - estimate their needs and those of the other members of the coalition are about 800,000 tons of chemically recycled material per year by 2030, in addition to their needs for mechanically recycled materials. According to the Consumer Goods Forum system-level emissions would be approximately 40% lower in certain geographies and under certain conditions if at-scale chemical recycling was available to process hard-to-recycle plastics, rather than sending these plastics to waste-to-energy incinerators. The Coalition recognises that although chemical recycling technology is not a silver bullet, it will be an important technology which can serve a vital purpose for the recycling of unavoidable plastic waste which cannot be otherwise recycled mechanically. By expressing their interest in procuring these materials, the member companies of the Coalition are sending a strong signal to regulators and investors of the need for scale in plastics chemical recycling infrastructure while meeting the necessary environmental safeguards laid out in the Coalition's Vision and Principles paper. According to the Consumer Goods Forum, the demand for chemically recycled material does not reduce the need to continue the scale-up of mechanical recycling infrastructure. It is primarily focused on demand which cannot be met at scale by mechanically recycled materials today (e.g., food-contact flexible packaging applications). The Consumer Goods Forum (""CGF"") Coalition of Action on Plastic Waste was founded in 2020 with the aim of developing a more circular approach to the development and processing of plastic packaging in the consumer goods industry. The development of the Coalition builds off the CGF's 2018 endorsement of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's New Plastics Economy."
Armani Code: An aluminium cap produced and assembled by g.pivaudran,"For the guided magnetic collar cap of their brand-new refillable men's fragrance Armani Code, L'Oréal has chosen to entrust g.pivaudran, a French expert in aluminium components. Thanks to its vast experience coupled with its technological expertise, g.pivaudran has anodised the aluminium cap [1] in intense black offering a sleek black shine, coupled with deep engraving of the Giorgio Armani monogram, on the top of the cap. For a wonderful magnetic open-close mechanism that instantly spells out luxury, g.pivaudran used their magnetised guided technology, which was patented in 2000, allowing a perfect alignment of the monogram and the bottle. The high-speed assembly was achieved using a brand-new machine installed on the g.pivaudran premises in the Lot region of France. The seven components of this high-end cap required an extremely precise design to meet the requirements set out by Armani whilst adapting to the use of a screw-action pump. ""For this new collaboration between L'Oréal and g.pivaudran, particular attention was placed on user comfort when handling the lid whilst working on a subtle curved edge,"" outlined Marion Kergoat, Commercial Engineer at g.pivaudran."
Smurfit Kappa to invest USD 100 million to drive down emissions in Colombia,"The global producer of paper-based packaging has announced an investment of almost USD100 million in a sustainable biomass boiler in Colombia, which will reduce its global Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2 emissions by approximately 6%. The boiler, which will be constructed at its paper mill in Yumbo, Colombia, will replace the fossil fuels currently used with different types of organic waste to generate cleaner energy. The organic waste will be comprised of pine and eucalyptus bark from the company's own forestry plantations, waste from its wood treatment plant, and ashes and sludge generated during the paper-manufacturing process. The project is part of Smurfit Kappa's circularity program under which the group has already implemented biomass boilers at several other locations including the Nervion, Piteå and Sangüesa paper mills in Europe. When the new boiler is operational, the mill will significantly reduce the site's fossil fuel usage and deliver significant cost savings. Laurent Sellier, CEO of Smurfit Kappa in the Americas, said: ""This investment reinforces our commitment to Colombia, a strategic growth market, and to our sustainability targets. The commissioning of this state-of-the-art biomass boiler is a further material step towards our 2030 and net zero emissions targets and to protecting the environment and creating a greener world."" ""The construction of this boiler reflects the circularity that is the foundation of our sustainability strategy and runs through all of our operations, as we are finding another use for our own waste. It is also a very important project for the region, as it will contribute to expanding the use of renewable energies and is a timely response to the increased global demand for paper,"" added Alvaro J. Henao, CEO of Smurfit Kappa Colombia. The new boiler is expected to be operational by the end of 2024."

Luxe Pack: Wheaton Brasil shifts to biogas and lightweight glass,"At Luxe Pack Monaco, held on 03-05 October, 2022, the Brazilian manufacturer of glass packaging presented its latest innovations and investments in sustainability. Among other things, Wheaton Brasil detailed its recent investments in renewable energy. In particular, the company is the first glass manufacturer in the world to use biogas to replace part of its consumption of natural gas. Obtained from the decomposition of organic matter, biogas will allow Wheaton to reduce their annual CO2 emissions by approximately 7,000 tons, which is equivalent to more than 50,000 trees planted over a period of 20 years, according to the company's estimates. ""Being the first company in our industry to use biogas for glass production is a source of great pride for us and demonstrates how Brazil is a country that increasingly stands out in the promotion and development of sustainable solutions,"" emphasizes Renato Massara Junior, commercial and marketing director of Wheaton. Wheaton also presented its latest Ecoglass range to the international public attending Luxe Pack Monaco. This eco-designed collection offers lighter bottles requiring a reduced amount of glass material compared to traditional bottles. According to Wheaton, the collection allows a reduction in water and energy consumption, and a reduction of more than 30% in CO2 emissions. In addition, the thread of the bottles' neck allows the pump to be unscrewed to facilitate refilling of the product and facilitates the separation of the pump and the glass for recycling operations. ""Taking into account the environmental question is an integral part of our business,"" emphasizes Renato Massara."

Givaudan and LanzaTech want to create fragrances from recycled carbon,"LanzaTech's carbon recycling technology could see new applications in the beauty industry soon. The carbon capture and transformation company has partnered with fragrance and beauty ingredients manufacturer Givaudan to develop new generations of sustainable ingredients. With over 15 years scale up experience, LanzaTech's approach to carbon transformation is based on the conversion of emissions to ethanol and the subsequent conversion of ethanol to the building blocks necessary to make a wide range of consumer goods, such as laundry detergent, clothing, shoes, and food packaging. In addition, thanks to its synthetic biology and modelling capabilities, LanzaTech can introduce new pathways into their biocatalyst to produce a variety of different chemicals through this process. Multiple commercial facilities are already licensing LanzaTech's technology, converting various waste carbon sources to ethanol, including the conversion of industrial emissions in China, thanks to the power of industrial biology and a proprietary biocatalyst. The research collaboration with Givaudan is one that is expected to leverage this synthetic biology capability and go beyond the production of ethanol, with the companies working together to establish novel pathways to create sustainable fragrance ingredients used across the Givaudan portfolio. Both companies have been longstanding members of the Renewable Carbon Initiative, an organisation whose goal is to support and speed up the transition from fossil carbon to renewable carbon for all organic chemicals and materials. LanzaTech has previously joined forces with L'Oréal to create a plastic bottle made from renewable carbon [1] and, more recently, with Coty to replace the ethanol used in their fragrances with recycled carbon."

Afyren inaugurates its first biorefinery for perfumery and food,"The French green chemistry company inaugurated, on September 29, its first large-scale plant in Carling Saint-Avold, in the East of France, on the Chemesis industrial platform. Named Afyren Neoxy, the biorefinery has reached production start-up phase and should gradually increase volumes to produce 16,000 metric tons of carboxylic acids within two years. At this stage, 70% of the plant's target production of organic acids has already been pre-sold, according to Afyren. Based on natural micro-organisms and protected worldwide by ten patent families, Afyren's biomimetic technology produces seven 100% biobased organic acids. These acids have several applications in various sectors: human food, animal feed, flavours and fragrances, lubricants, materials science and life sciences. Transformed on the Saint-Avold platform through fermentation, extraction and purification steps, the carboxylic acids produced by Afyren are directly derived from sugar beet co-products and offer a low-carbon alternative to their traditionally petro-based equivalents. Thanks to its location in the centre of the European beet-producing basin, the Afyren Neoxy production unit has been able to commit to respecting short supply chains through a contract that provides for the delivery of co-products from sugar-beet crops located within a maximum radius of a few hundred kilometres from the factory. As it is close to its main customers in Northern and Eastern France, the Benelux countries and Germany, the plant can offer secure, low-carbon delivery to its partners. Afyren has raised a total of more than 80 million euros in funding to complete this industrial project. Afyren chose to partner with Bpifrance, through its Société de Projets Industriels (SPI) fund. Afyren Neoxy is thefore a joint venture, 51% owned by Afyren and 49% by the ""Société de Projets Industriels"" (SPI) fund managed by Bpifrance. ""We are convinced of the potential of Afyren's technology in terms of the decarbonization of industry and its ability to promote a strong, competitive and job-creating bioeconomy,"" said Magali Joessel, Director of the SPI fund at Bpifrance. The commissioning of the site involved the recruitment of 60 people, covering the whole range of industrial professions (production, maintenance, quality control, security, and administration). ""On the strength of this first success, we are already studying two scenarios for the establishment of a second plant in North America or Asia. We are obviously evaluating the structuring of the financing, but we are also carefully studying the environmental components so that this second plant will also benefit from access to local biomass and short supply chains,"" said Nicolas Sordet, CEO and co-founder of Afyren. This new production site could therefore be the first step toward a circular low-carbon industry providing biobased solutions."

"U.S. Black and Hispanic consumers wear more fragrances than others, found NPD","Hispanic and Black consumers wear perfume more often than other ethnicities in the U.S., according to The NPD Group. While fragrance usage in the country remained flat this year, compared to 2021, it grew among both Black and Hispanic consumers. According to the market research firm, over 85% of Hispanic and Black consumers wear perfume and other fragrance products, compared to 78% of the total U.S. population. ""Compared to other ethnicities, Black and Hispanic consumers are more engaged not only with fragrance products, but across all beauty categories,"" said Larissa Jensen, beauty industry advisor at NPD. ""Understanding the nuances of how Black and Hispanic shoppers interact with the beauty industry by category can help to uncover the opportunities with these very tuned-in consumers."" Black and Hispanic consumers generally wear fragrance products more often than other ethnicities and self-gift more frequently, according to the latest findings from the 2022 ""Fragrance Consumer Report"" from NPD. Over 60% of Black and Hispanic consumers report they do not leave the house without wearing fragrance and it is part of their daily routines, which is significantly higher than white and Asian users. Among these two groups, demand is also rising for stronger scents. Black and Hispanic consumers are wearing stronger scents more frequently, a behavior that is in line with a broader shift happening in the U.S. prestige fragrance market. Eau de parfums (EDPs) and parfums, which have a higher percentage of fragrance oils, continue to gain market share in 2022, at the expense of cologne, eau de toilette (EDT), and other products with lower concentrations of fragrance oils."

Sederma wants to simplify skincare formulation with an encapsulated retinol,"To address the market demand for stable, easy-to formulate, highly bioavailable and well-tolerated vitamin A, Sederma is launching an encapsulated retinol. Indeed, while having demonstrated its benefits on wrinkles, stretch marks, skin blemishes and scars for decades, retinol is also known for some drawbacks, including possible skin irritation and chemical instability.

Protection of the active and enhanced delivery into the skin thus reinforce its efficacy and allow to minimise its use level, while offering excellent skin tolerance. ReVitAlide is IECIC [1] compliant and is made of 95.50% natural content (according to ISO 16128). It is 100 % readily biodegradable in 28 days, RSPO approved and can be stored at room temperature."
Gattefossé completes the ERI 360° certification process of two new ingredients,"The manufacturer of cosmetic actives has completed the ERI 360° certification process for two new major personal care ingredients in its portfolio: Gatuline RC Bio and EleVastin. Both ingrdeients have reached the Silver level of the ERI 360° seal. Gatuline® RC BIO is a hydrating skincare active, naturally extracted from beech buds harvested in areas close to the production site of the Gattefossé group in Saint-Priest, France. Buds are manually handpicked on the lower branches to avoid any damage to future development of the tree and respect its natural balance.

It is COSMOS certified and reaches 96.8% natural origin content according to the norm ISO 16128. EleVastin was design to strengthen skin elasticity and fight gravity-induced skin sagging. It is extracted from the leafy stems of the Murraya koenigii tree, that are manually harvested from pesticide- and fertilizer-free plots in the preserved environment of La Reunion island. Obtained using a mixture of natural solvents belonging to the family of natural LTTM (Low-Transition Temperature Mixture) and gentle extraction process (NaDES), the ingredient is COSMOS approved and reaches 100% natural origin content according to the norm ISO 16128. Co-created by cosmetics industry players and developed by Innov'Alliance and a panel of scientific experts, ERI 360° is a very stringent seal. It allows to accurately assess the sustainability performance of the entire value chain and to measure the ethical, social and environmental performance of concerned ingredients, from harvesting to the factory gate. In 2021, the Gattefossé group had already certifed three active ingredients of its personal care portfolio, Gatuline Link n Lift, Gatuline Renew and EnergiNius under the ERI 360° seal. ""Our responsible and sustainable development strategy, at the heart of our CSR roadmap, begins with the development of our ingredients. We see the ERI 360° label as a key tool for our research and development teams to optimize the sourcing of our raw materials, to integrate the principles of eco-design at each stage of the development of our personal care ingredients and to manage their implementation right up to production. We will therefore pursue ERI 360° certification for other products in our current portfolio and for future developments,"" explains Paula Lennon, Group Director Personal Care at Gattefossé. The Gattefossé ingredients that are ERI360 certified: Bronze: EnergiNius Silver: Gatuline Renew, Gatuline Link n Lift, Gatuline RC Bio, EleVastin"

Greentech taps into the Brazilian biodiversity and cutting-edge technologies,"Brazil is well known for its extraordinary biodiversity. It is the largest area of biodiversity in the world; it is made up of unique ecosystems: seven distinct biomes, each with a singular richness that represents an inexhaustible source of inspiration, innovation and biotechnology development. Pioneer and expert in biotechnologies for 30 years, it was therefore a clear evidence for Greentech to set up their first factory outside Europe in Brazil, in the heart of all this natural wealth. The French designer and producer of high-tech active ingredients extracted from natural botanical, marine or microbial sources, thus chose to locate its facility within the Diadema Cosmetics Hub, close to São Paulo. ""The proximity of local communities that develop fair and socially and environmentally responsible cultivation work, as well as the fact that Brazil is the fourth largest Beauty and Personal Care market in the world, just behind the United States, China and Japan, were also key factors in this choice,"" explains Damien Lamquet, General Manager of Greentech Brasil. Thanks to their own industrial tool and state-of-the-art laboratories in Brazil, the company has begun to produce several ingredients locally. At the heart of these active ingredients, all the performance of nature, enhanced by cutting-edge processes (bioguided extraction, enzymatic bio-purification, fermentation, bioconversion...), natural alternatives with proven effectiveness. The knowledge of Brazilian biodiversity has enabled Greentech to develop ingredients that concentrate the full power of the Brazilian biomes. Dandrilys is a natural active ingredient titrated in saponins (jujubosides) obtained from Ziziphus joazeiro bark, acting at different levels to effectively and durably reduce dandruff. It targets the dysbiosis observed in the scalp affected by dandruff (one of the major causes), modulating in vivo the bacteriobiont and mycobiont, towards a healthier scalp. Dandrilys offers a complete solution to dandruff through a systemic approach, modulating both the scalp microbiota and biological pathways for a healthy scalp. A healthy and natural alternative to Zinc Pyrithione 1%. Zoryalys is a natural active ingredient developed through a biomimetic approach, combining highly antioxidant and photo-protective molecules (Shogaol & Gingerol from ginger, and Magnolol & Honokiol from magnolia) with long-chain lipidic fatty acids from Brazilian pracaxi oil, to mimic hair lipids. Thanks to its penetration into the hair core, it protects against protein carbonylation, tryptophan and cystine degradation and maintains the keratin structure, thus restoring hair strength, shine and colour. These ingredients have been presented at the in-cosmetics Latin America show, which was held on 21-22 September 2022 in São Paulo, Brazil. The show was also the occasion to discover Greentech's 2022 innovation, Myralys, a natural active ingredient COSMOS-certified, highly purified in gentiopicroside, sourced from organic wild yellow gentian roots, to lift droopy upper eyelids and rejuvenate the under-eye contour (dark circles, eye bags and tear trough), offering a total eye contour rejuvenation from 14 days of use, for a time-defying look."

Energy efficiency: LVMH commits to a 10% decrease in consumption,"To address the current tensions on the electricity market, which are likely to increase this winter during consumption peaks, the LVMH Group has decided to reduce its electricity consumption as of October, first in France and then worldwide throughout the Group. Two key measures will enable a 10% reduction in energy consumption between October 2022 and October 2023: – Turning off the lighting of the Group's Maison stores between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. and of the administrative sites at 9 p.m. – The modification of indoor temperatures in all industrial sites, administrative sites and stores: -1°C in winter compared to the usual temperature setting; +1°C in summer compared to the usual air conditioning trigger temperatures. These measures constitute a framework for the Group's Maisons upon which they build their energy efficiency plans according to their specificities. As an example, Moët Hennessy efficiency plan aims at a 15% reduction in energy consumption worldwide in 2023 vs 2021, at constant perimeter, says LVMH. In addition, LVMH will mobilize its 34,000 employees in France around new energy consumption behaviors: a major awareness campaign around the New Energy Gestures will be launched to turn off (lighting, screens, computers, etc.), unplug (chargers, electric cars, etc.), choose alternatives (to the elevator, to the printer), and manage consumption peaks. In France, the Group's employees will be encouraged to use the EcoWatt app, which allows them to manage their energy consumption at home according to peak demand. Finally, investments to complete the Group's energy transition will be increased and will cover both energy management (sensors, meters) and renewable energy across the world. A reflection on new lighting methods and the use of colours' thermal qualities has been engaged. As a reminder, LVMH's energy consumption in France is 354,000 MWh, equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of a city of 150,000 inhabitants. The Group had already announced in 2021 as part of LIFE 360, its desire to achieve 100% supply of renewable or low-carbon energy for all its sites (workshops, stores, offices) by 2026. Today, the Group uses 100% green electricity in France and 39% renewable energy globally. These measures will be implemented according to the applicable laws and regulations of each country. LVMH was recently at the heart of a controversy in France because of the carbon emissions linked to the flights of the group's private jet for sometimes very short routes."

Plastic waste in the Pacific could mostly come from a handful of nations,"According to a recent study published in Scientific Reports, 90% of the thousands of tonnes of plastic waste that form what's known as the North Pacific Garbage Patch – a huge pile of floating trash that covers an area of 3.5 million square km in the middle of the North Pacific Ocean — could come largely from fishing equipment originating from five industrialized nations. Researchers from the Ocean Cleanup project and Wageningen University in the Netherlands collected 6,093 pieces of trash measuring less than 5 cm from the garbage patch and analyzed them one by one. The most common plastic objects were unrecognizable plastic fragments. However, fishing and aquaculture equipment was the second-largest category of trash. The researchers were able to identify a total of 232 plastic objects and their country of origin based on elements such as language, text, company names or brand logos. A significant portion of this waste was found to come from Japan (34%), China (32%), South Korea (10%), the United States (7%) and Taiwan (6%). The study highlights the important role that the fishing industry plays in addressing the global issue of plastic pollution in the ocean: ""While recent assessments for plastic inputs into the ocean point to coastal developing economies and rivers as major contributors into oceanic plastic pollution, here we show that most floating plastics in the North Pacific subtropical gyre can be traced back to five industrialized fishing nations,"" the researchers conclude. However, the study, only concerns floating plastics larger than 5 and not microplastics that may have a different origin and are not specific to the North Pacific Garbage Patch. ""The compositional differences of plastic pollution between coastal and offshore waters therefore suggest that plastics originating from land are predominantly trapped in nearshore areas and may be eventually released to the open ocean as small, degraded plastic fragments,"" the authors suggest."

For this project, Texen managed the production and assembly of several components: the cap and collar, engraved and metallized in gold, the brush holder and the wiper, the bottle with an ultra-premium thick bottom that guarantees formula protection thanks to a specific treatment. This development required particular vigilance. This was particularly true for the wiper, which need to be adapted to the ergonomics of the applicator chosen by the brand so that exactly the right amount of oil is extracted, resulting in ""an optimal application with a voluptuous gesture"". This was possible thanks to the collaboration between the marketing and development teams at Clarins and Texen, right down to application tests and the adjustment of the wiper in real time. The brand's décor is engraved directly in the mould on the collar and the top of the cap with precise indexation of the motifs and lettering on both parts so they are perfectly aligned for maximum brand visibility. Available in eight standard shades, Lip Comfort Oil is also available made-to-order with a concept dubbed ""Lipgloss Factory."" This allows the consumer to create her own shade and to order it online."

"USA: Higher income consumers boost sales of beauty products, NPD reports","Higher income consumers with annual household incomes of over USD 100,000, spent nearly USD 9 billion on beauty products in the first half of 2022, up 14%, year over year found NPD's Checkout Omnichannel Tracking. According to the market research firm, higher income U.S. households account for over 40% of beauty sales revenue. This double-digit growth was spurred by a combination of more buyers in the market and consumers spending more compared to last year, with Generation X and Millennials leading the charge. Elevated spending from higher income beauty consumers is tied to their above-average engagement with the industry's two largest categories: makeup and skincare. While 74% of U.S. women use facial skincare products and 67% use makeup, those in higher income households significantly over-index in each category, with usage over 80%. Based on findings from their Facial Skincare Consumer Report, The NPD Group highlights that Generation X (born between 1966 and 1976) is an untapped opportunity in the skincare market. While facial skincare product usage from other generations declined, Generation X is the only cohort whose usage remained steady compared to last year. They use nearly as many products as Millennials - who use the most - and they are also more likely than any other generation to purchase products that carry higher price tags. In the makeup market, women in higher income households showed the most significant usage increase, rising by 8 points since last year, according to the Makeup Attitudes and Usage Report from NPD. ""During this critical time when retail recovery is forced to coexist with mounting economic pressures, it is imperative for beauty brands and retailers to understand which consumers are most engaged and willing to spend,"" said Larissa Jensen, beauty industry advisor at NPD. ""These behaviors can vary by beauty category but getting it right and acting on it can provide the competitive advantage necessary to succeed."""
"British supermodel Kate Moss launches wellness and beauty brand, 'Cosmoss'","The British supermodel on Thursday launched the website cosmossbykatemoss.com selling her own beauty and wellness products called Cosmoss, that she unveiled a few days before on social media. Kate Moss thus becomes the latest star to venture into branded e-commerce, following celebrities such as US actress Gwyneth Paltrow who has forged a second career marketing wellness products on her Goop website. With her sculpted cheek bones, grungy style and famous boyfriends including US actor Johnny Depp and British musicians Pete Doherty or Jamie Hince, Moss epitomised the 1990s-era fashion scene and its hard-partying lifestyle. But in an interview on BBC radio's ""Desert Island Discs"" in July, Moss said that she now prefers trips to the garden centre and meditation to clubbing, and is ""not into being out of control anymore"". According to Vogue magazine, the development of the new brand took two and a half years. So far the cosmossbykatemoss.com website sells a small range of vegan-friendly products including tins of herbal teabags for £20 ($23), facial oil containing CBD (£105) — an active ingredient in cannabis — and perfume with essential oils (£120). Moss recommends using the products in combination in ""rituals"" that ""balance body and soul with the natural environment and the circadian cycles"". Cosmoss is not Moss's first venture into personal branding. She designed a line of clothing for teen fashion chain Topshop - which closed its physical stores during the pandemic - and gave her name to lipsticks by Rimmel. In 2016 she launched a talent agency, Kate Moss Agency (KMA), signing her own daughter, Lila Moss, as well as other offspring of stars such as Ella Richards (granddaughter of Keith) and artists such as Rita Ora."
Stella McCartney and LVMH announce the launch of a new beauty brand,"Following a successful partnership with LVMH which began in 2019, Stella McCartney has collaborated with the LVMH Beauty division to develop her new skincare line, STELLA by Stella McCartney. After pioneering the conscious luxury fashion industry, Stella's ambition is to offer an alternative to luxury skincare. Dubbed ""Alter-Care™"", the concept is based on ""an approach that supports caring for ourselves and Mother Earth in perfect harmony"" with the aim to combine nature, efficiency, and responsibility. If the idea, in itself, is not wildly innovative, its credibility rests on the personality of the designer, who is well known for her vegan and cruelty-free activism. ""I am delighted that Stella McCartney, after pioneering a sustainable and responsible luxury fashion, is now partnering with LVMH, committed to change the codes of cosmetics, the packaging and the ingredients. The launch of STELLA by Stella McCartney perfectly resonates with the Group's longstanding commitment toward sustainability and we are proud to support it,"" said Antoine Arnault, Image & Environment, LVMH. ""We set out with an idea, and because we didn't want to compromise – on outstanding results, the origin of our ingredients, and, of course, ensuring we minimised our impact on Mother Earth – we kept on trying. We worked hard for almost three years with LVMH constantly evolving and aiming for what I felt was possible: rooted in nature, truly effective and responsible skincare,"" added the designer. Based on Stella McCartney's personal philosophy of using 'only what you need', the range consists of three essential products: Reset Cleanser, Alter-Care Serum and Restore Cream. Offering ""impressive clinically-proven results"", in the words of LVMH, the new range has been formulated and challenged to minimise its footprint at each stage of the product lifecycle: from the ingredients to the packaging, to operations all the way through to consumer usage. All product formulas are made with at least 99% natural-origin ingredients, and each is available in a unique eco-conscious refill. The line has a uniquely beautiful scent, 'High Cliff', created in collaboration with renowned perfumer Francis Kurkdjian, Founder and Artistic Director of Maison Francis Kurkdjian and Perfume Creation Director of Parfums Christian Dior.

Quadpack: A 100% wood cap for Shiseido's new fragrance collection,"Challenged by the brand, Quadpack has developed a 100% wood bespoke cap for Shiseido's new fragrances: ""L'Eau d'Issey Eau & Magnolia"" and ""L'Eau d'Issey pour Homme Eau & Cedre"". ""The unique 100% wood bespoke caps were a result of intensive research and development, motivated by its desire to answer Shiseido's dream: to have mono-material, biobased caps for its fragrance collection,"" said Quadpack in a statement.

Fasten introduces a mono-material refillable skin care jar,"Dubbed ""REfill REuse Repeat"" Fasten's latest innovation combines elevated aesthetics with sustainability. Entirely made from recycled polypropylene (PP), the jar is available a standard 50 ml size. All parts are fully recyclable. The concept comprises a lightweight, open outer jar base in conjunction with an ultra-light, thermoformed refill cup. The refill is inserted inside the base with one click, and removed just as easily. To distinguish between creams, differing colours can be used for the refill cup. The open structure of the jar base not only shows consumers which cream refill they are using visually, but also reduces the material needed for the jar. This reusable jar design can save up to 80 percent on material usage compared to conventional 50 ml jars. The IBG [1]'s subsidiary designed its REfill REuse REpeat jar to be 70 percent lighter than comparable standard cream jars, and the refill units were made stackable. The result is a substantial reduction in shipping weight. Combined, these factors lead to a significantly reduced supply chain CO2 footprint. The jar is made even more sustainable by replacing ink with debossing, eliminating the use of glue and utilizing fast-growing elephant grass in the cardboard box that houses the jar. ""Our REfill REuse REpeat jar is a unique packaging concept created to satisfy all aspects of sustainability from its reduced material usage, refillable design and full recyclability,"" said Ilja Zutt, Managing Director of Fasten."

YouTube is the platform most used for podcasts in the US,"Between social networks and music streaming services, users have a host of options for listening to their favourite podcasts online. And yet, it's YouTube that stands out, ahead of podcast giants Spotify and Apple in the US. According to a study conducted by the agency Luminate on podcast consumers aged 13 and over in the United States, 78% of them have used the streaming platform for listening to podcasts. A significant proportion that places YouTube ahead of Spotify and Apple Podcasts, explains The Verge, which relayed the study. This success is notably linked to the growing number of podcasts filmed and broadcast on the platform. If 83% of the respondents indicated that they listen to them, some 59% watch them and 42% do both. If the video aspect is becoming increasingly important for podcast consumption, Spotify and Apple have also understood this issue and now offer video content for podcasts on their platform. In addition to video, nearly two-thirds of users emphasized the importance of subscription price in choosing their platform, and 56% emphasized ease of use. This is not the first time YouTube has been named the platform the most used for listening to podcasts. Back in May 2022, the Cumulus Media and Signal Hill report indicated that the video streaming service had become the number-one platform to access podcasts, ahead of Spotify and Apple Podcasts (16%). Therefore, it's no surprise that YouTube has now launched its own page dedicated to podcasts, only accessible in the United States for the moment."

Created by master perfumers Nadège Le Garlantezec, Antoine Maisondieu and Shyamala Maisondieu (Givaudan), Paradoxe is an amber floral scent that has benefited from an innovative technology for extracting the fragrance from the neroli bud, before the flower blooms. Tunisian orange blossom and sambac jasmine complete the heart note. Paradoxe is packed in a triangular refillable bottle (available in 30ml, 50ml, 90ml). A 100ml refill bottle thus makes it possible to reduce the environmental footprint of the packaging as it is refilled."

Japanese fashion designer Issey Miyake has died aged 84,"The Japanese designer famed for his pleated style of clothing and cult perfumes, and whose name became a global byword for cutting-edge fashion in the 1980s, died on August 5 in Tokyo at 84. The death was announced today by the Miyake Design Studio. Issey Miyake shook up Parisian style with his highly wearable avant-garde designs, saying he was driven to create clothes that ""bring beauty and joy"" after witnessing the horrors of Hiroshima. Alongside Rei Kawakubo and Yohji Yamamoto, Miyake was part of a wave of young Japanese designers who made their mark in the French capital from the mid-1970s, following the lead of fashion greats Kenzo Takada and Hanae Mori. Throughout his global career spanning more than half a century, he pioneered high-tech, comfortable clothing — side-stepping the grandiosity of haute couture in favour of what he called simply ""making things"". Among his inventions were the ""Pleats Please"" line, permanently pleated items which do not crease, refreshing an old-fashioned concept to exude fluidity and comfort. The much-copied futuristic triangles of Miyake's geometric ""Bao Bao"" bag complemented countless chic outfits, and he made more than 100 black turtlenecks for Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Miyake also wowed runway audiences with his ""A-POC (A Piece Of Cloth)"" concept, using computer programming to cut whole garments with no seams. Born in Hiroshima in 1938, Miyake was just seven years old when the United States dropped an atomic bomb on the city in August 1945, obliterating everything he knew. He survived the blast, which killed an estimated 140,000 people on impact and led to the end of World War II after the bombing of Nagasaki three days later. Although the bombing left him with a lifelong limp, he rarely spoke of his trauma, once breaking his silence in a 2009 New York Times article calling for nuclear disarmament. ""When I close my eyes, I still see things no one should ever experience: a bright red light, the black cloud soon after, people running in every direction trying desperately to escape,"" he wrote. ""I remember it all. Within three years, my mother died from radiation exposure."" In the article, he urged Barack Obama to visit Hiroshima, a wish realised in 2016 when the then US president made a historic trip to the city. ""I have never chosen to share my memories or thoughts of that day. I have tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to put them behind me, preferring to think of things that can be created, not destroyed, and that bring beauty and joy,"" Miyake wrote. Having graduated from Tama Art University in Tokyo, Miyake moved to Paris in 1965, where he studied at the elite Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne. As a cub designer he worked under Guy Laroche and Givenchy, but his outlook was also influenced by the huge student-led uprising of May 1968. Seeing protests engulf the French capital made him realise ""the world was moving beyond the needs of haute couture for the few and towards simple more universal elements such as jeans and T-shirts,"" Miyake told CNN in 2016. He established the Miyake Design Studio in Tokyo in 1970, and soon afterwards opened his first Paris boutique. By the 1980s, his career was in full swing as he experimented with materials from plastic to metal wire and even artisanal Japanese paper. Teamwork was essential to Miyake, who preferred the anonymity of his research and development lab full of textile scientists and engineers to the bright lights of the catwalk. ""You always see things in a different way when you allow others to become part of a creative process,"" he told the New York Times. He pulled back from designing his Paris collections at the turn of the century and has since given a series of talented young designers their big break. But he continued to oversee the brand, and his obsession with technology endured — with everything from fabrics to stitching explained in minute detail in the notes of every catwalk show."
IMCD to distribute Quintis' sandalwood for personal care in Australia,"Quintis, the global leader in the supply of premium and sustainable Indian and Australian sandalwood raw materials, has appointed IMCD Australia as the new distributor of its sandalwood ingredients for the personal care industry in Australia. The partnership will see IMCD distribute Quintis Sandalwood's Santalum album (Indian sandalwood) oil and powder, and Santalum spicatum (Australian sandalwood) oil across its extensive trade client list in Australia.

IMCD's wealth of expertise, executional capability and commitment to sustainability is a perfect fit for our business,"" said Carmel Power, Chief Sales Officer at Quintis Sandalwood. Beyond its well-known use in the fragrance industry, Indian sandalwood oil is a multi-functional cosmetic ingredient that provides multiple benefits to a cosmetic preparation.

The distribution agreement provides that Quintis will be sharing its cellular and clinical trial data, along with its internal technical expertise, with IMCD Australia to support formulation offerings and claims for its customers. ""Australian brands can take a lot of inspiration from the latest trends in the industry, and we look forward to connecting our clients to the benefits of sandalwood within Beauty and Personal Care products,"" said Tasha Spicer, General Manager of Beauty & Personal Care at IMCD Australia. ""The active component in sandalwood oil, alpha-santalol, targets myriad skin issues, including well-ageing, acne, and inflammation, as it has been proven to be a natural anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anti-pigmenting ingredient, along with being a powerful antioxidant. An ingredient we encourage formulators to consider,"" Power continued. IMCD Australia is currently preparing for its NeoTech Beauty event showcasing a selection of its partners' ingredients and state-of-the-art formulation expertise. The event will demonstrate how high-tech science and innovation are essential to support the movement for clean and sustainable beauty. Quintis Sandalwood ingredients will be included at the NeoTech Beauty event in the category of pure and natural, nodding to its eco-designed processes and proprietary method of distillation that reduces the company's water and energy requirements by 75%."

Texen adapts its production tool to make an XXL ecodesigned compact for Chanel,"For the launch of a 10x10cm compact, one of the largest in their Les Beiges line, Chanel has chosen a food-grade recycled PET. In order to meet the brand's demanding aesthetics requirements and design codes, Texen had to reinvent its productions tool, in partnership with Roctool. Taking into account the technical constraints of the raw material, it was important to be especially attentive to the aesthetics of this thin-walled compact with a hinge that is particularly difficult to assemble. Texen has been investing in R&D, industrial capability and in rebuilding conventional logistics capabilities for 18 months. This optimization work concerned the full value chain: from the sourcing of the recycled material, the use of a high-solid varnish and the group's investment in the BESST (Beauty Experience Sensation Surface by Texen) technology, which allows the sublimation of the material to give super-premium aesthetics and absolute shine to manufactured parts, including ultra-thin ones. The Texen Lab has a dedicated equipment for creating prototypes in conditions that resemble industrial ones, allowing the material to remain fluid and thus manufacturing a flawless packaging solution. ""Among other things, this technology helps to overcome some of the main impediments linked to recycled materials,"" highlights Texen."
Brazilian stakeholders agree on a Federal ban on animal testing for cosmetics,"Brazilian manufacturers of personal hygiene products, perfumes and cosmetics, represented by ABIHPEC (Associação Brasileira da Indústria de Higiene Pessoal, Perfumaria e Cosméticos), and Humane Society International (HSI), an animal rights advocacy group, have reached an agreement to work together on the passing of a federal law that would prohibit the testing of cosmetic products on animals in Brazil. The two organizations are now seeking for public support in order to push for the amendment and the vote, on the basis of the consensus, of a bill from the House of Representatives (PLC 70) that has been under discussion in the Federal Senate since 2014. ""This vote will make it possible to align legal requirements in terms of animal experimentation with the needs of the industry and the requirements of consumers and society in general"", explains ABIHPEC. Several bans on animal tests for cosmetics are already in force in 12 Brazilian states and in the Federal District. According to ABIHPEC, this situation is a source of legal uncertainty for this sector while a robust federal legislation would harmonize requirements across the entire country. ""With this law, Brazil - which represents around 50% of the market for personal hygiene, perfumery and cosmetic products in Latin America - will join a growing number of countries that have already passed similar laws"", highlights the association. professional. The original PLC 70/14 has been adapted so that the current wording reflects technological advancements that have taken place since 2014, as well as international best practices. These practices involve: – A ban on marketing in the country cosmetics and ingredients intended for the exclusive use of this sector when they have been tested on animals; – A definition of criteria that would allow using data from tests carried out on animals for other purposes; The two organizations therefore ask member of the Congress, as well as the federal government, to support the text during its discussion, so that a federal law be passed quickly."
Clariant launches biodegradable opacifier for shampoo and liquid soaps,"Plantasens OP 95, Clariant's new natural-derived, readily biodegradable opacifier, was designed to support personal care formulators in minimizing the impact of shampoos, conditioners, handwashes and other rinse-off shower and bath products on marine and river life. According to Clariant, the new ingredient is a microplastic-free option which delivers powerful opacifying performance even at low concentrations, for a creamy white appearance with luxurious, caring consumer appeal for shampoos and liquid soaps. Plantasens OP 95 is an alternative to the most traditionally-used opacifiers, which are not biodegradable, are considered as microplastics and will therefore be banned in rinse-off formulations if restrictions take effect as expected in 2022 [1]. ""Because rinse-off formulation ingredients will usually end up in waterways and oceans, providing readily biodegradable solutions to this cosmetics sector is an important focus of our product development,"" comments Hermann Bach, Head of Strategic Marketing and Innovation, Clariant BU Industrial & Consumer Specialties. ""This 95% natural origin, microplastic-free opacifier extends options for developing more environmentally-compatible Personal Care. By answering formulators' needs on multiple fronts, it enables an easy switch from water-dispersible acrylate copolymers without compromising on visual appeal."" Plantasens OP 95 offers formulators an easy-to-use, sulfate-free drop-in solution for opacifying a wide range of hair and body care applications and for supporting eco-conscious consumer behaviour. It also helps to reach ideal viscosity without adding rheological agents, which means less formulation complexity."

L'Occitane finds innovation avenues in the history of perfumery plants,"Pascal Portes, who leads the R&D department of the fragrance and natural ingredients division at L'Occitane en Provence, presented at the 2022 World Perfumery Congress in Miami Beach, Florida, the outcome of a study on forgotten perfumery plants, conducted in partnership with the Chemistry Institute of Nice and the International Perfume Museum in Grasse, France [1]. ""As Nature is the largest R&D laboratory on the face of the earth, at L'Occitane, we're like explorers who set off towards unknown lands with boundless enthusiasm, never knowing what we're going to discover,"" said Pascal Portes. According to L'Occitane, this R&D project seeks to rediscover and explore forgotten perfumery plants, and to evaluate the possibility of reintroducing them as present-day ingredients. Hundreds of books were studied, and a variety of experts were inter-viewed. Data was collected regarding identity, history, symbolism, uses, smell, medicinal properties, and hypotheses as to the reason plants may have been forgotten, and with the information obtained, a database containing more than eight hundred perfumery plants was created. The interest of L'Occitane en Provence to respect biodiversity led to a closer look into Hawthorn and Sweet Clover, both identified as forgotten perfumery plants, and each having ecological benefits in terms of biodiversity regeneration. Indeed, the R&D project not only revived precious historical heritage but offered insights into the link between ingredient sourcing and biodiversity regeneration."
India's fine fragrance house Lilanur Parfums launches exclusively with Harrods,"The luxury fragrance house, which offers attar perfume oils and eaux de parfum celebrating the India's abundant flora and olfactory riches, has made its debuts at Harrods in-store and online in June. LilaNur Parfums introductory collection of seven eaux de parfum include: Malli Insolite, Rajni Nocturne, Gul Rouge, Vettiver Mousson, Agar Épicé, Davana Cèdre, and Incarnation. LilaNur is also launching a trio of Attar Absolus - scented oils, made from single-origin floral absolutes steeped in sustainably sourced sandalwood oil for over 100 days: Jasmin Attar Absolu, Rose Attar Absolu, and Tubéreuse Attar Absolu. These perfume infusions are the result of a collaboration between LilaNur Parfums and Firmenich's Naturals Innovation Group in Grasse. The brand was founded by Anita Lal, Founder and Creative Director of Good Earth India, and fragrance and brand expert Paul Austin, previously Senior Vice President for the Fine Fragrance division at Givaudan. To help bring the fragrances to life, the two founders began their work in the flower fields near Madurai in Southern India, forging a deep relationship with Jasmine CE - India's largest source of floral absolutes to the international fine fragrance industry - and its community of 5000 farmers and flower pickers. Each of LilaNur's seven eaux de parfum and three Attar Absolus have been composed around India's array of iconic flowers, spices, herbs and woods. The three attar perfume oils use Indian-grown rose Centifolia - cultivated and processed exclusively for LilaNur Parfums. For the launch collection, four French perfumers - Honorine Blanc, Olivier Cresp, Fabrice Pellegrin, and Clément Gavarry - were invited to compose a scent using iconic Indian ingredients as their muse and starting point. Many of these ingredients were borne from the joint venture between Firmenich and Jasmine CE aimed at developing unique and innovative extractions of Indian flora. ""Each fragrance is an evocation of India. From the jasmine and tuberose fields of Madurai, the spice gardens of Kerala or the forests of Assam, each scent is a vivid olfactory portrait of our diverse and rich land,"" says Anita Lal, co-creator of LilaNur Parfums. ""India has long been a perfumer's Garden of Eden, and with LilaNur our goal was to have India's iconic ingredients play the starring role in each fragrance. We wanted to let them shine,"" adds Paul Austin. Prices range from £225 (for a 100ml Eau de Parfum) to £340 (for a 30ml Attar Absolu)."
Evonik starts a revolution in personal care with rhamnolipid production plant,"Evonik has started construction of the world's first commercial rhamnolipid production facility in their biotech hub in Slovenská Ľupča, Slovakia. With this new biosurfactant plant - a triple-digit million-euro investment - Evonik aims to become a pioneer of high-quality, sustainable biosurfactants. Indeed, rhamnolipids are a class of biosurfactants which are sustainably manufactured via a fermentation process using European corn sugar as the main raw material, they are essential constituents of cleaning and personal care products. The production of rhamnolipids from biogenic carbon requires no petrochemical feedstocks or tropical oils. In addition, rhamnolipids are fully biodegradable, and their low-impact life cycle means they are a sustainable alternative to conventional surfactants. Rhamnolipids' exceptional foam-forming properties make them suitable for use in household cleaners and personal care products like shampoos and micellar waters. Their pleasant taste also enables the formulation of oral care products, such as toothpaste, without strong taste masking components. ""Today is an important day for our partnership with Unilever, our employees in Slovakia, our Nutrition & Care division, and for our planet. We are delighted that the construction of our new biosurfactant plant is now underway,"" says Yann d'Hervé, head of Evonik's Care Solutions business line. The Evonik Fermas plant was founded in 1992 as a joint venture between Degussa AG and the Slovakian company Biotika a.s. Evonik Fermas originally used biotechnology to produce amino acids for animal feed but quickly became adept at manufacturing a range of fermentation-based products for applications in animal nutrition, pharmaceutical products and the cosmetic and personal care industry. Over the years that followed, the site continued adding new products and investments, improved technologies and infrastructure. In 2016, Evonik Fermas ran the first pilot plant for the manufacture of sustainable biosurfactants via fermentation."

Smurfit Kappa invests to significantly reduce CO2 emissions of paper products,"Smurfit Kappa has completed a large-scale sustainability project at its Zülpich paper mill in Germany, which significantly reduces the plant's CO2 emissions. The EUR 11.5 million investment included a major redesign of the plant's multi-fuel boiler to provide a more sustainable fuel source for the generation of steam and electricity. The mill, which produces approximately 500,000 tonnes of paper annually, is now powered by a combination of its own biogas, which is a by-product of its circular water treatment plant, natural gas, and the residual materials or so-called 'rejects' which occur in the paper recycling process that would otherwise be considered waste. The project reduces CO2 emissions at the Zülpich paper mill by more than 25% and saves 55,000 tonnes of CO2 annually, which represents a 2% reduction in Smurfit Kappa's global CO2 emissions. Smurfit Kappa has the goal of achieving a 55% intensity reduction in fossil CO2 emissions by 2030 and at least net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The packaging leader has also had its 2030 emissions reductions targets validated by the Science Based Targets initiative as being in-line with the Paris agreement. The Zülpich circular approach also extends beyond its own operations to create loops with Smurfit Kappa's Parenco and Roermond paper mills in the Netherlands. The rejects from Parenco and Roermond are a valuable source of fuel for Zülpich's boiler. Commenting on the Zülpich project, Pim Wareman, CEO of the Smurfit Kappa Recycled Paper Cluster, said: ""The unveiling of this state-of-the-art multi-fuel boiler is yet another example of how, at Smurfit Kappa, sustainability is part of our DNA. The project shows that economic efficiency and sustainability are by no means mutually exclusive but can go together hand in hand taking the mill on a very positive journey."" Andreas Zeitlinger, Managing Director of the Zülpich paper mill, added: ""We are delighted to have this high-performing new boiler up and running. This investment has reinforced our commitment to a circular business model. By turning side streams from the paper manufacturing process such as the rejects and biogas into steam and electricity, we are well on track to meet our sustainability targets."" The Zülpich mill is currently planning a series of initiatives over the coming months to further enhance its sustainability performance."
Fragrance Creators makes entry into the metaverse and unveils research results,"During its panel session — ""Fragrance Stewardship in a Digital Age"" — at the World Perfumery Congress in Miami, Florida, Fragrance Creators President and CEO, Farah K.

The trade association representing the majority of fragrance manufacturing in North America also announced new research, sponsored by the association, that explores why humans have consistently relied on scents and what makes fragrance an essential part of household products. Published earlier this year in Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications, this study was formally introduced to the public at the World Perfumery Congress during a panel titled ""Benefits of Fragrance in Daily Life."" Using a three-factor benefits framework, this research aims to explain the attraction to scent in household products. The novel framework focuses on functional benefits (malodor mitigation, base odor coverage, freshening), in-use experience benefits (cleanliness, efficacy, pleasure), and emotional benefits (increase in confidence, mood, and nostalgia). Also during their panel session, speakers Farah K. Ahmed, Cynthia Reichard, Co-Chair of Fragrance Creators' Board of Directors and Executive Vice President at Arylessence, Inc., and Sumit Bhasin, Fragrance Creators Board Member and Senior Vice President, Innovation, Product Development, Corporate Research and Development at The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., emphasized the importance of value chain collaboration and supplier diversity, and how digital can continue to enhance collaboration and meaningful transparency. The speakers reinforced the association's commitment to advancing marketplace policies that allow all responsible businesses opportunity to create, innovate, and thrive while also delivering good for people and the planet. The association also used the World Perfumery Congress as an opportunity to survey perfumers from around the world, asking attendees to predict which scent will trend next in home care and in fine fragrance. Of the over 275 attendees surveyed, the results were: Sandalwood for Home Fragrance and White Musk for Fine Fragrance [1]."

Meiyume launches a new collection of sustainable packaging for face and lips,"Meiyume, the beauty arm of the Fung Group, launches Canvas, its latest sustainable packaging range for the face and lips. The line is designed to be simple, so it leaves room for brands interpretation. Drawing parallels to a blank canvas brought to life with a splash of paint, the outer packaging is purposefully minimalistic to allow the colour formulation within to take centre stage. The Canvas range integrates simple, sustainable materials such as paper, aluminium, and PCR. Amongst the curation, a few of the highlights include mono-material PCR PET and aluminium lipstick tubes, paper and moulded pulp push-up sticks, dual-function refillable sticks, and slim-sized options. In addition to primary packaging, the range also includes secondary packaging for lipstick refills. The refill packs are made of two simple parts – a moulded pulp front and a cardboard backing. Moulded pulp offers flexibility and can be shaped to accentuate the contours of the product within. The flat cardboard on the back provides a place for product information to be printed. Alongside these product packaging options, the Canvas line offers vanity clutches to complete the consumer's beauty experience. Brands can opt for sustainable materials such as RPET or Piñatex, a low-impact material largely made up of pineapple plant leaves, to create go-clutches that can hold a lipstick and up to two refills. Meiyume can decorate the range to fit with the brands' DNA and the story they want to tell."

Beekman 1802 launches facial scanning tool for microbiome education,"The goat milk-based skincare company has launched My Skin Biome, a facial scanning tool that assesses the skin and educates around microbiome health. The AI-powered tool was developed in partnership with AI and AR tech solutions provider Perfect Corp. My Skin Biome assesses skin attributes and then offers a custom skincare routine based on skin's redness, wrinkles, dark spots, hydration, and texture scores, while teaching users all about the microbiome and why it is important to overall skin health.

The skin's microbiome is a community of good and bad bacteria that live on the epidermis, that when unbalanced by the external environment - air pollutants, sunlight, harsh cosmetic chemicals, over exfoliation, hormones, stress, etc. - can lead to skin issues like inflammation, acne, wrinkles, rosacea, eczema, dark spots and other problems. The microbiome is quite complex, so with the help of the brand's mascot Goatie, the tool will provide Beekman 1802's customers with a basic understanding of how healthy skin is linked to a healthy microbiome. After assessing the skin, Goatie will also recommend a personalized skincare regimen based on skin's needs and curate a list of the brand's clinically proven goat milk formulas that will best feed and balance their microbiome."

Ecovia Intelligence to host masterclass on veganism and clean beauty,"Ecovia Intelligence is hosting its first Natural Cosmetics Masterclass in over two years. Taking place in London on 13th July, the event will cover two of the fastest growing sectors in the cosmetics industry: veganism and clean beauty. The event comes as demand for clean beauty products has strengthened during the pandemic, driven by rising consumer concerns regarding the potential health risks of synthetic chemicals in cosmetics and toiletries. In parallel, according to Ecovia Intelligence, the growing popularity of the vegan lifestyle is generating demand for plant-based cosmetics; many brands are re-formulating to market their products as vegan. The Vegan Society, the world's largest certifier of vegan products, says that cosmetic products now represent the largest share of its 52,000 certified products. The Masterclass comprises various seminars and a training workshop. Industry experts will give an update on market trends and developments. The latest data on the UK natural and organic personal care products market will be presented. Since the UK's departure from the EU, there is high interest in the UK market from North American, Australasian and Asian brands. Representatives from NATRUE and COSMOS will give an update on their certification schemes. Almost 40,000 cosmetic products are now certified according to these two standards. Elsie Rutterford, Co-Founder of BYBI Beauty, will give details on how it has developed its clean beauty product range. The BYBI brand is using superfood ingredients in its formulations. It has also created carbon negative products by using sugarcane-based plastic packaging. A leading organic food retailer will share its experiences with clean beauty products, whilst a research agency will present marketing and consumer trends. The second half of the programme comprises a formulation workshop. Judi Beerling, a chartered cosmetic scientist, will discuss the issues when re-formulating clean beauty products. Technical advice and guidance will be given to brands looking to formulate with green functional ingredients, such as preservatives, surfactants, emulsifiers, etc. The Natural Cosmetics Masterclass aims to help operators develop and market clean, natural, organic and / or vegan cosmetic products.

Faiveley Plast Beauty (VPI) transforms Sulapac's biomaterial for Shiseido's Ulé,"Launched in France on the 20th of April 2022 by Japanese beauty giant Shiseido,Ulé is and eco-conscious skincare brand, inspired from the nature and environmentally-friendly. For their jars and vials made from lightweight glass (Bormioli Luigi), Ulé has chosen the biomaterial created by Finnish start-up Sulapac. This is where Faiveley Plast Beauty (VPI) was able to assist with its expertise. The expert in the transformation of bios-sourced materials, worked alongside the R&D and Purchasing divisions at Shiseido to develop and produce all of the caps for the new range including: – Two caps of different sizes for the Je suis chill cream (15ml and 30ml caps), – A cap for the balancing floral mist Le beau Reset. The caps comprise two parts made from Sulapac's organically-sourced alternative to plastic. This material offers a host of eco-responsible benefits – organically-sourced FSC wood, sustainability, compostability, eco-design, low carbon impact, European manufacturing – as well as in terms of quality and functionality. For Faiveley Plast Beauty, there were several technical challenges for the production of the Ulé caps. It was necessary to have control of the injection and assembly of two Sulapac materials – the premium material and barrier material – and to do so in harmony with the clean and elegant design of the brand. The caps also had to match the specifications for packaging approval. These require, on the one hand, perfect production of the formulas (oxygen barrier) and on the other, degradability (compostable in industrial settings). Together, Faiveley Plast Beauty and Sulapac undertook a considerable work on the colours of the caps, so as to blend perfectly with the brand's product range. Finally, the brand's logo was inlaid on all the caps. ""Faiveley Plast Beauty is proud to release its second full range of products made using Sulapac. The challenges proposed to us by brands are a source of inspiration and innovation for our teams. They motivate us to always go one step further and push the boundaries of our expertise,"" said Marc Beltrami, Commercial Director for the packaging manufacturer. Let's also mention that wher a spray pump was required, Ulé opted for Silgan Dispensing's SP22 Maximist fine mist sprayer, incorporating a high percentage of post-consumer recycled (PCR) resin."

From waterless to holistic: Beautystreams identifies eight beauty trends,"In its annual Cosmotrends report, based on the analysis of the most innovative products chosen among the exhibiting companies at Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna, Beautystreams highlighted eight key beauty trends: – Lash it Up! places the focus on eyelashes (and brows) as men and women get more creative, colourful and bolder, combining self-expression with fun and experimentation. – Derma Nerd highlights the surge of AI-boosted intelligent delivery systems that boost the power of active ingredients and make products more efficient, for example through smart encapsulation, nanosome technology or micro-dosing. – Beauty by Numbers is another tech-driven trend; with product customization reaching new heights as ever more sophisticated forms of AI allow detailed diagnoses and tailored product recommendations and formulae for a truly personalized beauty solution. – No to H2O refers to the increasingly popular water-conscious cosmetics, such as anhydrous (water-free) dry products or solid cosmetics. As water shortage is slated to be one of the biggest global problems in the near future, cutting down on the water footprint in beauty manufacturing will be key. – Tribute to Ancestral is highlighting the recent surge in traditional ingredients and age-old beauty rituals. These confer a sense of stability and reassurance in a time of uncertainty, as well inspire curiosity and a desire to experiment. – Surprise me, Delight Me is all about embracing sensation and pleasure of use; a renewed focus on tangible touch-points and tactile sensations after several years of everything becoming more digitalized. This trend focuses on surprising sensorial benefits, interesting textures and formats to turn product application into a fun experience. – Mind, Body, Soul reflects how people increasingly view well-being through a broader lens, incorporating every aspect of life. A new generation of beauty products are not only delivering skin care benefits but also helping to create a holistic experience of well-being, sparking joy and boosting the mood. – Eventually, Lab-Born Naturals is another sustainability-driven trend, focusing on the possibilities of biotechnology to create powerful actives and natural ingredients without negatively impacting the planet. Developing natural ingredients through synthetic processes increases the use of renewable natural resources and is more environmentally friendly."

AMA Labs owner sentenced to 5 years in prison for falsifying test results,"Gabriel Letizia Jr., the owner and executive director of AMA Laboratories, Inc. (""AMA""), a consumer product testing company based in Rockland County, New York, has been sentenced to 60 months in federal prison (5 years) for fraud scheme involving fabricated test results. ""For three decades, Gabriel Letizia defrauded AMA's customers and jeopardized the safety of millions of consumers, all in the name of greed,"" said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams. Letizia began operating AMA in the early 1980s, and became its sole owner in approximately 2003. AMA purported to test the safety and efficacy of cosmetics, sunscreens, and other products on specified numbers of volunteer panelists for consumer products companies. Clients of AMA used the test results to support their claims that their products were safe, effective, hypoallergenic, or provided a certain Sun Protection Factor (""SPF""), including after exposure to water. AMA clients that manufactured sunscreens used the test results to comply with FDA regulations requiring sunscreen manufacturers to have their products tested and to maintain the test results for possible review by the FDA. From 1987 through April 2017, Letizia and AMA personnel operating at his direction defrauded AMA's customers of more than USD 46 million by testing products on materially lower numbers of panelists than the numbers specified and paid for by AMA's customers. According to AMA employees, the majority of AMA's tests contained fraudulent results, for two reasons: First, at Letizia's instruction, AMA personnel rarely tested products on the number of panelists requested by AMA's clients. Instead, AMA tested products on a far lower number of panelists, typically 20 or less, rather than the 50 for which the clients had paid. AMA's fees for tests were based, in part, on the number of panelists that were to participate in the study. At Letizia's direction, AMA sent its clients fraudulent test results in which AMA personnel included fictitious data for ""phantom"" panelists who had not actually participated in the tests. Second, at Letizia's direction, AMA personnel routinely falsified test results relating to its clients' products, which included suppressing adverse reactions and deviating from testing protocols. According to the court, from 2012 through April 2017, AMA received USD 46.2 million in revenue from the fraudulent reports. In addition to his prison term, Letizia, 72, was sentenced to three years of supervised release, restitution in the amount of USD 1,440,238, and forfeiture in the amount of USD 46,200,000."

Maison Berger Paris entrusts Stoelzle Masnières for its new glass bottles,"To complete its collections, French heritage brand Maison Berger Paris has renewed its collaboration with the French subsidiary of the Stoelzle group, which produced the glass bottles for the its latest launches. Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie thus produced the curvaceous bottle of the Lampe Senso Verte, designed by Rozenn Mainguené. Produced in N°1 Luxe glass, the aesthetics of this 300 ml bottle with hollowed facets is enhanced by a peacock green lacquering. Another recent creation: the Duality 300 ml bottle, by designer Anthony Gambus, explores the multiple facets of femininity. Its original shape reveals a harmonious pleats, highlighted by a plum shade. The entire artefact is outlined by a black silicone band embossed with the name of the brand. This textured material effect contrasts with the rest of the glass bottle. This new collaboration with the Maison Berger Paris teams was also another big challenge for Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie. ""Indeed, the striations made it necessary to make adjustments to the model at the parting line, in order to avoid any alteration of the design during the removal from the mould. In addition, the place where the silicone (and therefore deformable) accessory is located required a very special adaptation work related to tolerance and dimensions,"" said the French glassmaker. Eventually, in the wake of the nude and the white bottles released in 2021, the brand's Glaçon (Icecube) collection was completed by the Glaçon Gingko (silver grey) and Glaçon Mountains (gold) bottles. The know-how of Stoelzle's teams made it possible to obtain total flatness on all four sides of this 250 ml cube with rounded corners. This flatness is essential with regard to the complexity of the decorations, which are repeated identically on each of the sides, in order to guarantee the colours after several annealing sessions."

The Consortium is working with the experienced sustainability consultancy Quantis to help ensure a robust and scientific approach to co-build an assessment methodology and scoring system that are guided by: – A common method for measuring environmental impacts throughout the lifecycle of products, backed by the principles of the ""Product Environmental Footprint"" (the European Union's PEF scientific method based on life cycle assessment (LCA) for quantifying the environmental footprint of products). – A common database of environmental impact of standard ingredients and raw materials used in formulas and packaging, as well as during product usage. – A common tool that enables the assessment of the environmental impact of individual products, usable by non-experts. – A harmonized scoring system that enables companies, on a voluntary basis, to inform consumers about the environmental footprint of their cosmetic products, using a methodology, data base, tool and scoring system that can be verified by independent parties. In 2019, Nu Skindeveloped its own internal scoring system to improve the customer sustainability journey. Nu Skin plans to bring key learnings from this implementation as an active participant in the development of a globally recognized standard."

"Keys Soulcare launches Make You, color-skincare line of hybrids","A year after launching her brand of skincare, Keys Soulcare, the singer of ""If I Ain't Got You"" unveiled her first collection of makeup during Monday night's Met Gala, in New York. The artist's new hybrid line goes beyond a makeup collection and intends to bridge skincare and makeup. In 2016, Alicia Keys was one of the first public figures to opt to go makeup-free, preferring to care for her skin rather than cover it with artifice, a statement of self-affirmation. However, the singer now intends to fuse skincare and color. This first 'color-skincare' collection, simply called ""Make You,"" consists of a handful of products formulated to take care of the skin, while giving it that touch of pep that is sometimes missing for those who have given up on makeup. The aim is to allow women — and men — to define their own beauty standards. Key products include a transparent gel for smoothing and defining eyebrows, a nourishing and moisturizing blush, and a nourishing lip balm in vitamin-rich shades. ""Our path into color care started with the Let Me Glow Illuminating Serum,"" said Kory Marchisotto, Chief Marketing Officer, e.l.f. Beauty & President, Keys Soulcare. ""This vegan, hydrating, illuminating complexion and makeup priming serum helps brighten, plump, and smooth the look of your skin with antioxidant-rich rose water and niacinamide."" Hybrid make-up is a growing phenomenon in the cosmetics industry, capitalizing on the trend for holistic beauty, with a host of eyeshadows, lipsticks, foundations, and other blushes formulated for skin health. If over a decade ago, the emergence of BB creams paved the way for this phenomenon, the pandemic has clearly accelerated the shift to the all-in-one concept in the world of makeup. Complexion creams, tinted serums, complexion enhancers, and lip oils are all a product of this trend, which permits a growing number of consumers to no longer have to choose between makeup and (natural) skin beauty."
"U.S. beauty market to grow as fragrance and makeup drive sales, finds Kline","The U.S. beauty and personal care market surpassed $85 billion in retail sales in 2021, an increase of $7 billion from 2019 sales levels, according to Kline. This is the market's strongest performance in the last 10 years but growth is expected to continue as the market research firm forecasts a 6% CAGR [1] through 2026. Some categories, such as fragrance and makeup, are back on the radar for consumers and retailers alike, with escalating sales of these products fueling total industry growth, wrote Dana Kreutzer, Project Lead, Consumer Products, at Kline, in a recent blog post. "" Makeup , which jumped 12% in 2021, is moving in a direction where hybrid experiences, or skin-improving makeup, are becoming more common when it comes to product innovation,"" said Kreuzer, mentioning recent launches such as Kosas' Revealer Skin-Improving Foundation SPF 25, with brightening and plumping claims, and Chanel's new N°1 de Chanel Revitalizing Foundation, with moisturizing and plumping claims. Fragrance recorded an even higher activity last year, with an increase of 25% within the luxury segment. The category also witnessed an influx in male consumers. According to Kreutzer, the importance of makeup and fragrance is further supported by recent results from market leaders; for instance, L'Oréal's recently released Q1 2022 sales report showed that makeup was a top growth contributor and its fragrance portfolio continued to drive the performance of its Luxe division in North America. More broadly, the growth of beauty sales is driven by consumers coming back to stores. Based on foot traffic data from SafeGraph, Kline found that Q1 foot traffic was up 25% versus year ago and up 14% from 2019 levels for select beauty retailers such as Sephora, Ulta, and Bath & Body Works. In such a context, big retailers are now transforming their beauty operations to keep shoppers coming back. According to Kreutzer, mass retailers like Target and Walmart are tapping further into beauty via store remodels and partnerships with premium beauty retailers, including Ulta (Target) and Space NK (Walmart)."

Available to all Iberchem's customers worldwide, the new fragrance technology consists of a minimum of 60% bio-based materials. Vernovacaps meets ECHA's (European Chemical Agency) proposed 2022 legislation on microplastics and 2027 ban on non-biodegradable microplastics due to its high level of biodegradability.

""Our new Vernovacaps offer stable and robust fragrances that are not affected by the encapsulation process.""

The first variant of Vernovacaps has been formulated for fabric softeners but the technology will eventually be extended to other ranges of products such as personal care, Iberchem added. Last year, French perfume manufacturer Sozio launched a new natural and COSMOS-certified encapsulation technology for personal care dubbed Cosmocaps. This alternative to synthetic microcapsules aimed to eliminate micro-plastics from formulations while providing cosmetic benefits."

In order to secure its supplies, the French group has signed a multi-year capacity reservation agreement with Origin Materials.

Origin's bioplastic technologies are playing a crucial role in helping LVMH achieve our sustainability targets without any compromise on quality,"" said Claude Martinez, Executive President & Managing Director LVMH Beauty.

Procos produces Patyka's new eco-responsible boxes,"The Paris-headquartered organic cosmetics brand has chosen Procos for the development of its new digital marketing box. With this packaging, Patyka has made the choice of a resolutely eco-friendly solution: a 100% mono-material box made from FSC certified recycled paper. Patyka approached Procos with a brief to reproduce an existing folding box, with a laminated coating and a construction with magnets and stickers. The Procos experts responded to this request with two alternative options: the first one, matching point by point with the brand's specifications, and the second one, thought ""out of the box"", by taking an alternative eco-responsible way. This ""eco-friendly"" box, based on an innovative construction without magnets nor stickers, and made of 100% PCW (post-consumer waste) FSC certified recycled paper, immediately impressed and seduced Patyka management. Patyka thus entrusted this project to Procos and proposed to them to deepen their approach. ""Procos is a partner of choice for our high-end packaging with reduced environmental impact,"" said Mélia Roger, CSR Director at Patyka. Patyka's cosmetic products are part of a naturalness, eco-responsibility and quality approach, continuously reinforced. This research also applies to the brand's packaging, gifts and communication media. Convinced by Procos' proposal and by the relevance of its ""eco-friendly"" box, Patyka has extended its request by entrusting Procos with its institutional boxes as well as its shopping bags, which are now 100% paper and therefore 100% recyclable."

TNT Global Manufacturing continues cooperation with Penhaligon,"TNT Global Manufacturing adds The World According to Arthur's cap to the Penhaligon's family portrait collection, a tribute to the good old English spirit: stiff upper lip, caustic humour, and a knack for provocation. The cap is made of five gold electroplated zamak pieces, like the whole collection. The technical challenge lies in the realization of the inside of the mouth which required the addition of two zamak parts (among the 5), and the delicate assembly. ""Fineness and attention to detail are highlighted, thanks to a perfectly controlled production process: die-casting, unmoulding, assembly.

Lumene partners with Sulapac for a sustainable plastic-free skincare jar,"The Finnish cosmetics brand has collaborated with material innovation startup Sulapac on a pilot project to sustainably package two of its most popular skincare products Nordic-C [VALO] Glow Reveal moisturizer and Nordic Hydra [LÄHDE] Intense Hydration 24H moisturizer.

The inner lining of the jar consists of the world's first barrier technology for cosmetics made of industrially compostable material that protects the sensitive cosmetic product.

Through this pilot, we are making an investment towards the future of innovation in the cosmetics industry,"" says Essi Arola, Head of Research and Development, Packaging at Lumene. According to Sulapac, four years of scientific development and testing were required to create an innovative jar made of industrially compostable material that would be able to host a water-based formula.

Exsymol bets on silanols for invisible pores and a perfect complexion,"With age, pores enlarge, doubling in diameter between 25 and 50 years due to a loss of skin elasticity. But, with the selfie phenomenon and the growing importance of self-images on social media, the pore has become the new wrinkle. Thanks to its expertise in silanols, Exsymol has developed Adenosilane, an active ingredient composed of bio-functional Silicium and Adenosine obtained by fermentation. By acting on the pore sheath, it improves skin firmness and therefore helps to prevent pore dilation. By optimizing fibrillogenesis, it allows the reconstruction of the sheath (collagen, MMP1) and densifies the network of fibers around the pore for a better quality of this sheath (MAGP1: Microfibril Associated Glycoprotein 1). It increases the level of available energy (ATP) and allows recovery of the pore's elasticity. After 28 days of use, 75% of volunteers (clinical tests) have fewer visible pores and 70% observe a reduction in their size.

BASF and Henkel focus on renewable raw materials in consumer goods,"BASF and Henkel have commit to replacing fossil carbon feedstock with renewable feedstock for most products in Henkel's European Laundry & Home Care and Beauty Care businesses over the next four years, said the two companies in a joint statement. The move follows a successful pilot with Henkel's cleaning and detergent brand Love Nature in 2021. Through the cooperation, the fossil feedstock for around 110,000 tons of ingredients per year will be substituted with renewable feedstock using BASF's certified biomass balance approach. As a result, Henkel's core brands like Persil, Pril, Fa and Schauma will come with a reduced carbon footprint, avoiding around 200,000 tons of CO2emissions in total. ""We are delighted to build on our ongoing cooperation with BASF and significantly increase the share of biomass in our value chain for our products used by millions around the world every day,"" said Carsten Knobel, CEO of Henkel. ""To foster a regenerative planet, we are on a journey toward an environmental transformation of our business model. We intend to continuously enhance our processes, products and use of raw materials for a resource-efficient, carbon-neutral future. Integrating BASF's biomass balance approach into our supply chain as an early-mover is a right step in that direction."" The replacement of fossil feedstock is possible through BASF's biomass balance approach: renewable resources are used in the very first steps of chemical production. The bio-based feedstock amount is then attributed to specific products by means of the certified method. BASF has established a closed chain of custody from the renewable feedstock it uses through to the final product. TÜV Nord, an independent certification body, supports the practical implementation and confirms according to the REDCert2 certification scheme that BASF replaces the required quantities of fossil resources for the biomass balanced product with renewable feedstock."
Aptar achieves new milestone in the use of PureCycle recycled plastic,"The packaging manufacturer has announced that it has successfully converted prototype material from the PureCycle Feedstock Evaluation Unit into multiple colours of hinged closures with performances similar to conventional resin for food, beverage and cosmetic applications. The progress achieved in testing and transforming PureCycle Technologies, Inc.'s Ultra-Pure Recycled (UPR) plastic are an important milestone in the efforts Aptar and PureCycle are making to determine the right material combination to create hinged closures made with this recycled material. Aptar and PureCycle have partnered in 2019 with the aim to achieve a more circular economy through an innovative portfolio of rigorously tested sustainable materials. PureCycle is actively working to begin commercial production of UPR at its first commercial facility in the United States. ""Aptar believes that the packaging industry must move beyond the 'make, use, dispose' behaviours of the past and actively work toward a circular economy. By circulating used plastic and packaging, we keep it in the economy and out of the environment,"" said the company in a statement. As a signatory of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, Aptar has set itself the objectives to incorporate more recycled content into its product offerings and have its dispensing solutions for the beauty, personal care, home care, food and beverage markets be 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025."

Cosmetic Victories: Innovative gelation and epigenetic tests in the spotlight,"The winners of the 7th edition of The Cosmetic Victories, the international contest dedicated to innovation in the cosmetic industry, were unveiled on 22 March, during a ceremony broadcast on Cosmetic Valley TV. Organised by Cosmetic Valley, the competition aims to spotlight the most promising cosmetics industry research conducted by start-ups, SMEs, and university laboratories, around the World. For this 2022 edition, more than 80 projects from 18 countries were examined. Then, the six teams having reached the finals stood before a jury [1] presided by Cosmetic Valley's president, Marc-Antoine Jamet. As every year, two prizes were awarded: The Academic Prize was awarded to Dr Sami Halila, Researcher in Glychochemistry at the CNRS [2] for the project : CARBOGEL, a Simple and Eco-Friendly Carbohydrate-Based Gelling Agent for Oily Phase. The project relates on the supramolecular gelation of organic liquids, such as organic solvents or oils, with monosaccharide derivatives that self-assemble into hierarchical 3D network of nanostructures. The sweet gelators are made from an eco- friendly and efficient method (reaction in water). Gelation could be performed by sonication, or by heating/cooling, or by dilution. The gel is considered as a stimuli- responsive and controlled delivery matrix for cosmetic agents. Finally, our project contributes to ""green"" and sustainable cosmetics by limiting our environmental and social impact The Industry Prize was awarded to Stefan Mazy, CEO & Founder of Australia's Derma Health Solutions Pty Ltd. for their project: SkinRNA Micro-cell Test. A world-first, this repeatable, epigenetic diagnostic skin patch and laboratory test quantifies skincare effectiveness via real- time gene expression activity. A device collects more than 15,000 genes, while algorithms provide gene expression activity scores for skin functions including collagen and elastin production, and skin inflammation. After product intervention, a second test is performed measuring new gene activity against initial benchmarks. Consumers can then repeat testing at intervals to track and monitor skin improvement at a genetic level without waiting for visible signs."

"BASF obtains certification on sustainable castor products, an industry first","BASF has been certified according to the SuCCESS (Sustainable Castor Caring for Environmental & Social Standards) Code, successfully finishing the whole certification process by an external body, a first in the chemicals industry, said the company. The production site in Düsseldorf-Holthausen, Germany is also the first site in the personal care industry to be certified. BASF has now started supplying its first sustainable castor ingredients to the personal care industry. ""Sustainability in general and sustainable sourcing specifically are gaining increasing importance within large parts of society and among industry stakeholders. For this reason, responsible sourcing is a key element of BASF's sustainability strategy. With the SuCCESS certification of the Düsseldorf-Holthausen site, BASF continues to strive to creating chemistry for a sustainable future,"" said the company in a statement. BASF, Arkema, Jayant Agro-Organics Ltd, and the international civil society organization Solidaridad launched project 'Pragati' [1] in May 2016 to improve working conditions, create awareness for sustainable farming and increase yields thanks to more efficient farming practices. The Pragati project was driven by a baseline survey of more than 1,000 castor farmers in Gujarat, India, where the majority of the world's castor supply originates. The goal is to support the sustainable production of castor beans to establish sustainable supply chains that amongst others increase the yields and income of the farmers. Since the project was initiated, more than 5,800 smallholders and over 13,300 hectares of land have been certified for sustainable castor cultivation. The Code SuCCESS is designed by multiple partners and stakeholders to ensure the objective of Pragati project and to develop sustainability principles for castor seeds that will guide and further allow castor producers to offer certified sustainable castor in the global market. The SuCCESS Code adopted 11 principles of ownership and provides smallholders with on-field support for ensuring monitoring and compliance with 41 mandatory and 25 non-mandatory control points. Only SuCCESS-certified Sustainable Castor Association (SCA) members can claim to supply sustainable castor products. As a wide range of natural ingredients are now used in cosmetic and personal care products, ethical sourcing is becoming the norm in the cosmetics industry. Cosmetic companies and raw material suppliers are investing massively in ethical sourcing programmes. According to market research firm Ecovia Intelligence, palm kernel oil is the most widely used vegetable oil in the cosmetics industry. About 20 percent of palm oil is now produced according to RSPO or related sustainability schemes. Large cosmetic firms, including Unilever and L'Oréal, have committed to source only sustainable palm oil. Over 20 operators have joined the Action for Sustainable Derivatives, an industry-led collaboration that encourages responsible production and sourcing of palm oil derivatives. Sustainability charters and certification schemes are extending to other types of vegetable oils, including castor been oil with the Sustainable Castor Caring for Environmental & Social Standards (SuCCESS) Code, and coconut oil with the Sustainable Coconut & Coconut Oil Roundtable, which introduced its first charter in 2020."

Orlandi makes an eco-friendly single-dose sample for Caron's scented hand gels,"In order to diversify our perfuming rituals, French fragrance brand Caron has created a hand sanitizing version of six of its iconic perfumes. Jean Jacques, Caron's on-house perfumer, has adapted the formulas of the brand's perfumes to compose the new range, which is now available in a box of 6 small-sized bottles (45ml) and in a 200ml format. To promote this collection, Orlandi has produced an exclusive eco-responsible mono-dose sample in partnership with V-Shapes. Designed to be recyclable, the new V-Shapes single-dose is entirely made of polypropylene (PP). The difficulty of this single-material choice was to design an aluminium-free barrier that was sufficiently air-tight to accommodate and preserve the alcohol in the scented gel solution. This 100% mono-material single-dose has recently benefited from the TOMRA verification and the Interseroh certification, two leading organizations focused on recyclability in the industry. With this major innovation, Orlandi is strengthening its offer of eco-responsible products. So far limited for use in skincare sampling, the V-Shapes mono-dose can now offers a new eco-responsible sampling solution to the world of premium perfume."

""With a unique and inspiring brand story and global fan base, Grown Alchemist is poised for international scalability and rapid growth while immediately broadening our international customer profile and market reach,"" said André Hoffmann, Vice-Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of L'Occitane, in a statement. L'Occitane said it intends to support and share its expertise with Grown Alchemist while granting its co-founders the autonomy to lead and drive growth and retain ownership in the company. A strategy in line with the group's previous acquisitions. The group recently became more proactive and strategic in adding both new and established premium beauty brands to its portfolio, with the aim to becoming ""a truly global, multi- brand group"" and to become a more geographically-balanced business, and appealing to health-conscious consumers and influential Millennial and Gen Z customers."
Hair product sales expected to post double-digit revenue growth in the US,"With nearly 50% of US consumers willing to spend more on hair product that works for them, The NPD Group expects hair product sales to post double-digit revenue growth in the US through 2024. According to the market research firm over 90% of U.S. consumers continue to show strong purchase interest for hair-related products and are even taking their routines to another level. This category is expected to continue along its positive sales trajectory through 2024, averaging 15% growth in the U.S. over the next two years. Compared to the previous six months, more consumers plan to purchase more targeted hair-related products, including hair and scalp treatments, relaxers, chemical straighteners, hair gummies, and vitamins, according to the latest ""Future of Hair"" report from NPD. The heightened demand for hair care, coupled with consumer allegiances to products with high efficacy, are factors contributing to the category's continued success. Just over half of hair product consumers say that when they find something that works for them, they stick with it — and, in fact, found NPD, 49% are willing to pay more for it. ""Both functional and fun, the hair category is winning with consumers in more ways than one,"" said Larissa Jensen, Beauty Industry Advisor at NPD. ""Since the onset of the pandemic, consumers have taken more of their hair routines in-house, sought ways to treat themselves outside of the salon, and have grown more educated on hair conditions and product ingredients. We can expect the category to continue to show strength, as consumers strive to look more polished re-entering society, and product innovations continue to capture their interest."""
"Singapore to lift travel curbs, in 'major milestone' to live with the virus","Singapore will lift restrictions for all vaccinated travellers from next week, with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Thursday hailing it as a ""major milestone"" in the aviation hub's efforts to live with Covid-19. The city-state is the latest Asian country to ease travel restrictions in a region that has generally been more reluctant to lift barriers than Europe and North America. A gateway for many travellers arriving in the Asia-Pacific, Singapore had already started quarantine-free travel schemes with some countries in recent months. From April 1, fully vaccinated adults and unvaccinated children will be allowed to enter the country without quarantining, as long as they take a pre-departure test, officials said. Easing travel curbs will ""reconnect Singapore with the world,"" said Lee Hsien Loong in a televised address. ""It will give a much-needed boost to businesses, particularly the tourism sector, and it will help Singapore reclaim its position as a business and aviation hub."" Only travellers on a ""restricted list"" will face curbs in entering Singapore, although there are currently no countries on the list. A raft of other coronavirus measures were also eased, with people in Singapore no longer required to wear masks outside, and limits on group sizes raised to 10, up from five previously. The pandemic plunged Singapore into its worst-ever recession in 2020 as the trading hub closed its borders. International visitor arrivals dropped to just 2.7 million that year from more than 19 million in 2019. The country of 5.5 million initially kept Covid-19 cases low through border closures and a tough lockdown. However, it has faced sizeable outbreaks since last year but, with some of the world's highest vaccination rates, authorities have shifted to a policy of living with the virus. Singapore's approach stands in contrast to rival financial hub Hong Kong, where arrivals are still required to undergo lengthy quarantines in hotels. Following Singapore's announcement, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam was forced to defend her administration's approach, insisting the Chinese city remained an ""attractive"" financial centre. ""The policies and measures to be adopted by each government in combating Covid differ,"" she said. Like mainland China, Hong Kong has stuck to a zero-Covid policy, but the approach has led to an exodus of foreign and local residents, and failed to stop a fierce Omicron outbreak in recent months. Taking into account these different approaches, BolognaFiere Group and Informa Markets, the organisers of Cosmoprof Asia have announced that the 2022 edition of the leading trade show dedicated to the cosmetics industry in Asia-Pacific will be relocated from Hong Kong to Singapore, from 16-18 November 2022. Other countries in the Asia-Pacific that have recently announced an easing of travel restrictions include Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and Malaysia."
Estée Lauder dives into the metaverse with free NFTs,"Estée Lauder is entering the metaverse through the front door. As an exclusive partner of the very first Metaverse Fashion Week, scheduled from March 24 to 27, the cosmetics giant will unveil its first NFT inspired by one of its iconic products — the brand's Advanced Night Repair serum. The the virtual event will kick off in tomorrow in Decentraland, a 3D virtual world browser-based platform, which will host some of the world's biggest luxury houses as they present their new collections, between virtual shows and online after parties. But this fashion week will not only take place on the catwalk, with events and surprises planned by brands from other horizons. Such is the case of Estée Lauder, which is due to present its first NFT, Women's Wear Daily (WWD) reports. And it's the cosmetics giant's famous Advanced Night Repair serum that will be the starting point for this NFT. It's hard to imagine avatars applying a face cream in this parallel world, you might think, but here, users will be able to go inside the product bottle to retrieve the said NFT, which will then give their avatar(s) a ""glowing, radiant look,"" according to the specialist site. Designed by virtual creator Alex Box, the NFT will be available in several thousand copies and will be free. Even more than offering its customers a first experience in the metaverse, this first foray will help Estée Lauder make itself known to those who are already used to spending time in these virtual worlds. It could also be a way for the cosmetics brand to test out this parallel world in order to potentially join others in adopting it as its new playground. L'Oréal Paris USA, Clinique, Givenchy Beauty and Gucci are among the beauty brands that have already entered the metaverse, showing keen enthusiasm for what looks like a new El Dorado for the luxury world."

""These two acquisitions represent another step forward in strengthening Symrise's fine fragrance business and are fully in line with our strategic objective to accelerate our growth in this business area"", said Ricardo Omori, Global SVP Fine Fragrance of Symrise AG. ""With the transactions, we increase our access to high-quality natural ingredients, expand our customer base and strengthen our competitiveness through greater agility as well as a significantly enlarged fine fragrance team in the historical birthplace of perfumery in Europe, Pays de Grasse."""

VPI creates a 100% recycled polypropylene refill for L'Occitane,"Reusable or refillable solutions have been at the core of L'Occitane en Provence's strategy ever since the brand launched its first eco-refill in 2008. For their latest project, L'Occitane entrusted VPI, a French specialist in injecting plastic parts for the luxury industry market, to make a refill from 100% PCR (Post-Consumer Recycled) polypropylene (PP) material. The 100% PCR PP cup of the Ultra Rich Body Cream Shea Butter refill thus helps to preserve natural resources, to support recycling sectors while reducing the environmental footprint of the whole supply chain thanks to the lightness of the material. ""The use of 100% recycled PP and the creation of the cup represent genuine technological strides through which VPI has demonstrated its ability and commitment. It has been a truly impressive feat by VPI, on behalf of L'Occitane, to manage and ensure the traceability of batches of recycled material and expertly produce a 200ml container all within a tight turnaround time,"" said the supplier in a statement.

It also helps us to fulfil our ambition of using Post-Consumer recycled plastic. VPI's teams rose perfectly to this challenge,"" said David Bayard, the Packaging R&D Manager of L'Occitane en Provence."

L'Oréal and Texen develop a new generation of caps made from 100% recycled PP,"For Biotherm's new skincare collection, L'Oréal continued with its drive to reduce the environmental footprint of its packaging. As a historic partner for the iconic 'Blue Beauty' brand, Texen rose to the eco-design challenge, using a new material that takes decoration well. Texen thus replaced conventional materials, ""still rarely managed effectively in their recycled version"", while providing decoration solutions and securing the supply chain. In line with strict specifications, notably on the sourcing of raw materials, the optimization of the industrial process and conformity with norms and regulations, Texen has put all of its industrial experience and know-how into the transformation of sustainable materials and their decoration to help develop this strategic project. Its success is the fruit of a close collaboration between both companies' teams. This cap can be adapted for different shapes of jar and for men's and women's skin care formulas like Cera Repair and Blue Therapy. The visual aspect of the development was particularly important: the pieces are hot-stamped across their whole surface without any overlap, a challenge when using this type of material. The same is true for the brand's logo, created in reserve, voluntarily leaving the raw material visible in the center. To reduce the environmental footprint, the excellent adherence of the hot stamping on the rPP allowed Texen to avoid the application of protective varnish. ""This global eco-design approach, for which the use of rPP is the cornerstone, benefits from the agility of a dedicated automated production line,"" added Texen in a statement."
Carbios partners with Indorama Ventures to build PET bio-recycling plant,"French green biotech company Carbios ultimately chose Indorama Ventures, the world's largest producer of recycled PET (polyethylene terephthalate) for beverage bottles, to build the very first plant using its PET bio-recycling technology. The plan for the reference plant is to be operational in 2025 at Indorama Ventures' PET production site in France (Longlaville, Meurthe-et-Moselle) with a processing capacity estimated at ca. 50.000 tons of post-consumer PET waste per year, equivalent to 2 billion PET bottles or 2.5 billion PET trays. It will help to meet the growing needs of both demanding consumers and large consumer goods companies including Carbios' partners and shareholders (L'Oréal, Michelin, L'Occitane, Nestlé Waters, PepsiCo, Suntory Beverage & Food Europe) for more sustainable packaging. After having successfully started-up its demonstration plant in Clermont-Ferrand, Carbios is thus moving one step further towards the industrialization and commercialization of its technology. The capital investment required for the project is expected to be around EUR 150 million for Carbios core technology, including in particular an additional purification step, which has been integrated into the process. In addition, an estimated EUR 50 million investment will be allocated for the infrastructure preparation of the site. Indorama Ventures plans to co-invest in this project and will consider expanding Carbios' unique biological recycling process at other PET sites for future developments. Named C-ZYME, Carbios' technology allows to convert PET (the most abundantly used plastic in circulation today, with an estimated global production of 82 million metric tons per year [1]) into its core monomers, which can then be used to manufacture 100% recycled and infinitely recyclable PET. Last year, L'Oréal unveiled the first plastic bottles made from enzymatic recycled material through the techinolgy developed by Carbios."
Avery Dennison launches the first certified portfolio of vegan labels,"Avery Dennison has launched a certified portfolio of vegan labels, which are therefore free from any animal-derived components. Additionally, every item in the portfolio was created without animal testing, or the use of GMOs of animal origin. Because of this, the collection has received approval from Eve Vegan, an independent organization created by Vegan France, which works to promote vegan alternatives in different industries. At the time of launch, there are six paper facestocks, three adhesives and two liners in the collection, and they can be mixed and matched according to customer needs. According to Avery Dennison, each item offers a similar level of performance to non-vegan alternatives in both converting and application. Based on converter and end user needs, there are plans to expand the range with new paper facestocks. ""Veganism goes beyond diet,"" says Luuk Zonneveld, product manager at Avery Dennison. ""It's a philosophy and way of life centered on avoiding animal exploitation for food, clothing and everything else you can think of. Naturally, this extends into the world of packaging, and we're excited to help brand owners take their dedication to being cruelty-free to the next level with these innovative labels developed by our R&D team."" The new labels are suitable for the beauty, wine and spirits and food and beverage sectors.
