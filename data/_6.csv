Weckerle: unbridled innovation,"Premium Beauty News - You have industrialized the process of filling center core lipsticks – lately even a 'Triple Core Lipstick'. Thomas Weckerle - Yes, the Triple Core Lipstick is an extremely successful launch for us this year. It features the benefits of a lipbalm, and also a lipstick and lip gloss. The triple injection filling technology now allows us to introduce new products in other categories. Thus we have developed a Smart Triple Core Concealer which has a super soft blendable texture, lightweight and creamy. It is a multi-benefit concealer designed to satisfy consumer needs for convenience and efficiency. Premium Beauty News - And this surprising product combining lipstick and lip gloss a single packaging? Thomas Weckerle - We always look in other areas and industries to get inspiration for new concepts and innovation. Constantly we challenge ourselves and question conventional products or production processes. By realizing that a regular lipstick and a lipstick with a hole in the middle show the same application on the lips, we had the idea for a new kind of duo packaging - the so called Twinstick. This Twinstick integrates a lipstick with a built-in gloss applicator in the centre. In the case of the Crystal Twinstick which we introduced in our latest trends presentation, we combined a clear lipstick formulation for shine and color and a special gloss to boost color and shine. Products can be used individually or even together. For sure, there will be much more room for product concepts and ideas for this unique packaging. Premium Beauty News - What other interesting products do you have in your latest portfolio ? Thomas Weckerle - From a formulation approach I would like to point out the Powder Sensation Lipstick. It uses a double injection filling technology and has a XL-center core. The center core features a formula with a significantly higher concentration of pigments compared to a regular lipstick and the outer layer is a creamy lipstick base. The result of this lipstick for pay-off is superb - intense colour with a matt finish. Other developments to meet the customers' demand for easy application and handling is the Line & Shadow with a special square cut tip and the Pocket Duet - a double ended packaging with a round or tapered mine and a wide range of formulations for customized products."
"Reverso, a hinge-free make-up case by Jackel","Brand new and very clever indeed! Reverso, the new make-up case developed by Jackel, has no hinges. The cover can operate a 360°rotation. The connection between the two parts is achieved with a variable number of interlaced strips of paper, fabric or faux leather, which are used in replacement of hinges, offering at the same time an easily customizable double decoration surface. The case can also be maintained in a stable position and opened by the means of a magnetic system. It is also equipped with a mirror and a 4 pan layout with an applicator recess."
Plasticum launches a one-piece tube with integrated closure,"Plasticum, a Netherlands -headquartered supplier of plastic packaging products specializing in the Personal Care, Food and Home Care markets, is launching a one-piece tube with an integrated closure: the Clube (a contraction for ""closure"" and ""tube""). This innovative packaging is produced by a patented bi-injection moulding process requiring a specific material formulation and innovative tooling techniques. In contrast with the traditional extrusion process, the production process developed by Plasticum enables to manufacture the complete product, including an in-mould-labelling decoration, in just one single production step. According to Plasticum, the concept offers substantial advantages. Since the tube shoulder has been eliminated, up to 40% material is saved, which is quite positive for the environment. Material and weight reduction also means less waste and less rejects during processing, as well as less energy consumption. In addition to a reduction of the carbon footprint, these improvements hence result in overall cost savings. Furthermore, Plasticum claims that the efficient production process of the Clube guarantees flexibility and short lead times. ""Commercial delivery times can be reduced considerably. In addition, there is a high level of flexibility thanks to easy changeovers of colours and labels. Even small custom projects are feasible."" The production of the Clube will be demonstrated for the first time at the K 2010, the international trade fair for plastics and rubber, which will be held in Düsseldorf from October 27 to November 3."
Promens presents an eco-friendly airless,"Ecolution is a 100% plastic-made system (100% Polyolefin) and 100% recyclable. It contains no metal or glass or non-recyclable plastics. The COTREP (French Technical Committee for the Recycling of Plastic Packaging) issued a favourable opinion on the recyclability of the AirFree bottle in the flow of recycled HDPE. The system does not need to be disassembled because all the bottle and pump components are recyclable. The system has also been developed using an Eco-design process: the weight of each part was optimized, materials used are standard materials, and suppliers were all selected in a radius of 200 km from the production site to streamline the movement of equipment and personnel during the system's development. ""With its pump designed with only 4 parts,"" explain managers at Promens, ""the system helps reduce CO2 emissions by 30% (Results of a Life Cycle Analysis System - a comparison made with an airless piston pump with 12 parts)."" Ecolution is also very compact [1]: compared to a piston-operated airless system, according to Promens, it represents a 30% gain in volume of packaging. Finally, the bottle can be produced from recycled plastic, thanks to the AirFree technology. The co-extruded multi-layer bottle can contain up to 85% of recycled material (Post Consumer Recycled HDPE). The exterior of the bottle is therefore composed of recycled material, while the pouch - which is in contact with the formula - is made from virgin material. EVOH [2] contained in the pouch acts as a barrier between the recycled material and the formula to guarantee its preservation. ""Women's needs and more generally, consumer needs,"" explain designers of the system, ""have evolved during the last decades; now, their choices are shifting to natural, preservative-free and environmentally friendly products. Ecolution addresses these changing needs, because it is eco-friendly and helps reduce preservatives contained in the formula (EVOH contained in the pouch features barrier properties against oxygen, to help increase the content's shelf life)."" Two versions of the actuator are available, with short spouts and long spouts, to meet all market requirements. The range of standard bottles is available in 5 sizes: 50 ml, 100 ml, 200 ml, 400 ml and 500 ml. ""Ecolution combines smoothness, ergonomics and usability. The diameter of the bottle has been designed to offer a perfect grip. And with its intuitive locking, Ecolution can be carried safely,"" underlines Isabelle Orhan, Innovation and Marketing Director. Ecolution delivers a dose of 1.5 ml, of the most liquid to the most viscous formulas."
"With Floraluxe, organic cosmetics enter in hotels","ADA Cosmetics International, a leading supplier and producer of hotel cosmetics, now features FloraluxeBIO, a new certified natural cosmetics line that complement its ""Green Collection"" range. Over 98 percent of the ingredients are from natural origin, and half, at least, are plant-based raw materials. Furthermore, a minimum of five percent of all plant ingredients come from organic farming. All these factors have led to the award of the natural cosmetics seal from EcoCert. The new body care series FloraluxeBIO features a wide variety of products for daily use. In addition to shower gel, shampoo and body lotion the assortment also includes conditioner and creamy soap. All formulations have been enriched with trendy caring ingredients. The shower gel, for instance, cleanses the skin gently with cotton flower extracts. The body lotion is rich in almond oil, the shampoo contains vitalizing mint extracts, while the conditioner boasts bamboo extracts, among other ingredients. As far as the soap is concerned, it contains cucumber extracts to clean the skin. All products are free of dyes, parabens, silicones and mineral oils. Additionally, neither genetically modified ingredients, nor animal-based extracts or artificial fragrances are used. The formulations have a neutral pH factor and, the fragrance of the new series also is made from natural essential oils. The dispensers have been designed to look modern and clear. The body care products are available in 30ml and 150ml, and the soap in 15g and 40g sachets. Incidentally, to be fully consistent with its ecological principles, the packing fully recyclable. In addition, liquid soap and shampoo hair + body are available in the press+wash dispensers made of 100 percent recyclable PET. ""The demand for purely natural products has been on the rise for years. Nature has become an integral part of a modern lifestyle, a trend also noticeably affecting hotel cosmetics,"" explains Claudia Raatz, the ADA's chief developer."
Pumpart launches a brand new 10 ml airless tube with the technical backup of the Sothys Group,"This patented airless tube developed in 2007 by the young French firm Pumpart System, is undeniably, a clever system! ""The initial idea is in fact quite simple, explains its inventor Jérôme Boumnso. As often in such case, someone just had to think of it!"" The tube comprises the tube itself, which can be purchased from any supplier, a tube in which engineers at Pumpart System from their factory in Limoges, ""placed"" an inserted inner pouch. When the tube is pressed, the inner pouch containing the product is crushed at the same time and when pressure is released a vent hole lets the air enter between the tube and the pouch, which not only allows the tube to take its original shape but also fills in the volume, which was partly cleared, between the pouch and the tube. A second pressure on the tube and the pouch is a little more compressed under the combined effect of the pressure and of the air, which has been introduced between the pouch and the wall of the tube... ""Until full retraction, in a ball shape, of the pouch,"" underlines Jérôme Boumnso. ""This retraction allows us to obtain an almost complete product release (98%), by far the largest evacuation rate on the market of airless containers!"" ""Actually, explains Jérôme Boumnso, it's the pressure on the tube that releases the product. There is no need for any specific mechanical system. I suppose it could also work with a single outlet valve."" As a result, 25% to 65% less plastic and, consequently, a cost of about 30% lower than that of a conventional airless system. The challenge for Pumpart System, together with the Sothys Group, was to design a small volume container of 10 ml. ""The system appeared to be sufficiently innovative and promising, for our group to want to invest time and expertise,"" explains Jean-Claude Ducruezet, Industrial Director at Sothys. ""Our teams have worked for several months in close collaboration with those of Pumpart System to manage to develop this new 10 ml airless tube. And we're all quite proud of the result."" A ""plus"" in the now well-tested range (up to 200 ml) of the young French start-up which is beginning in 2010, to reap the fruits of these last three years development efforts. ""Of course the trend on organic products is helping us a lot,"" explains Jérôme Boumnso. ""Because our Tubairless meets the exact specifications for this kind of product. No pump, less plastic, 100% recyclable, Ecocert and Cosmebio compliant, providing an excellent protection to sensitive formulas, an almost complete restitution, lighter, easily transportable, usable in all positions and ultimately, an eloquent C02 balance!"" The Mass is ended!"
L'Air du Temps by Starck: a technical challenge,"It's finally for L'Air du Temps, the iconic fragrance by Nina Ricci, that Philippe Starck has signed its first perfume bottle. Few areas have remained unexplored by this prolific designer who signed furniture, houses, motorcycles, yachts, hotels, restaurants, lights, and of course several useful or decorative daily-use objects. The new bottle of L'Air du Temps created by Starck is emblematic of the uncluttered, intelligible and affordable style of the most well known contemporary French designers. ""I am a man in search of the minimum,"" he says. Thus reduced to the essential, the bottle concentrates purely on the lovingly entwined doves. The airy transparency and velvety softness of the frosted glass accentuate the effect, right up to the galvanised white-metal cap, which takes the place of one the wings the two birds. Reduced to this airy concept, the L'Air du Temps bottle takes on another modernity, while remaining surprisingly in the line of the previous ones. It was an audacious bet since the ""twin dove"" bottle made by Marc Lalique in 1951 had become a hit, and was even voted bottle of the year in 1999. Created in 1948, the ""Sun"" bottle made by the Catalan sculptor Joan Rebull had a cap engraved with a dove. But the symbol of femininity was missing in the 1968 version of the bottle, which was marketed during the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s, until its successful return in 1986 with a delicate and engraved vision of the ""embossed doves"". The twin doves were so "" are emblematic of L'Air du Temps, that it could have seem impossible to modernise them without disappointing fans. The Verreries Brosse, a subsidiary of the Zignano Vetro group specializing in high-end perfumery vials, were entrusted with the difficult task to give birth to the bottle designed by Starck. According to the French glassmaker, the industrial production of the bottle required to push back the technical frontiers of automatic glassmaking. The technical feasibility of the vial was not sure and implied a unique mobilization of development teams. In order to achieve the production of a bottle conformed to the original design, the glassmaker successfully adapted a drilling method. A meticulous work on the shape of prototypes was also required for the glass to spread as homogeneously as possible. The cap placed was made by Qualipac in moulded, polished and galvanized Zamac. If the bottle of L'Air du Temps was regularly updated, the fragrance, on the contrary, remained surprisingly unchanged. In spite of fashion variations and regulatory changes, the formula has stayed intact for more than 60 years. That's probably why Philippe Starck says: ""I dislike old perfumes and I dislike new perfumes; what I like are eternal perfumes."""
Natura to launch a line for men in France,"Building on its success in Latin America, where it took up the challenge and attract many males, Natura will launch Homem, a complete line of skin care products for men on the French market, the only where the brand is represented in Europe. Above all, this short line is intended to be practical. It features five multifunctional products for the skin and the hair: a refreshing gel, a face and body cleanser, a refreshing shampoo and three basics for the shaving and after shaving (shaving gel foam, shaving cream, aftershave gel). Just like all Natura products, the Homem line is rich in ingredients from the Brazilian biodiversity, and features soft textures and fragrances that are like sensual and invigorating dives in the well-being, bem estar bem in Brazilian. Among the botanical ingredients in which the Homem line draws its benefits: the cupuaçu betain, and essential oils of candeia, mint, sage ... The Homem aftershave gel, for example, contains 74.4% ingredients of renewable botanical origin. As for the packaging, it is meant to be both sober and practical while remaining faithful to Natura values by being recycled. The Homem line will be available in France from September 7, and be promoted and sold by the 18,000 Natura beauty consultants and at the Maison de Natura Brasil, in Paris. It may be surprising to sell a men's line through a network of women consultants. At Natura, they concede that ""It is not necessarily an asset, even if the advisors say they need this range that will probably be offered to men."" Anyway, Natura now seeks to recruit male consultants. The brand also formed a partnership with the Comptoir de l'Homme, so that the line will be available for 6 months in their shop in the Rue de Tournon."
Mascaras like crazy,"Premium Beauty News -You have developed together a whole series of truly original mascaras which are obviously drawing everyone's attention. Could you explain what your approach consisted in exactly? Franco Lucá - The motivation to innovate in this direction is that we strongly believe that the segment of celebrities will become more and more important in the future. On top of that we want to demonstrate that with the experience and expertise that Geka has, we are able to manufacture very complex shapes as an example the ""Sexy Lady"" leg mascara. In addition to that we have introduced a new closing system which we call ""Snap-In closure"" which leads to cost savings in the filling process. This is a patented and protected system as well as the bended solution for the stem of the mascara leg. For the ""Sexy lady"" corsage mascara Geka wants to show that we are able to work on an improved return on investment that our customers has done. That exactly means, that with our ""click system"" of the packaging, designed by Enrica Ancorotti, we are able to use existing moulds and change the appearance and perception of the consumer and the pack. As we emphasized in different interviews we strongly believe that Geka is able to transform creativity into industrial solutions with a high productivity. Enrica Ancorotti - Every woman loves to take care of her beauty and wishes to reinvent it every day according, why not, to her mood. With this collection, I tried to change the classic bottle of mascara we used to have in our make-up bag. We will never leave this classic bottle, but our idea is to accompany it with a new and personal touch, an object that could be a collectible item for our beauty. As a matter of fact, I think that art and beauty are keywords of our woman being. Our eyes are the deepest source of beauty: they express our true self. This is the reason why, when I create collections, I imagine woman as the artist of herself, as she can decorate, embellish, but also mask her own glance. Premium Beauty News -These new mascaras could become collectibles to start with? Franco Lucá - You are right. We are working with different celebrities. The leg mascara as an example will be launched in the near future and shows that we have identified a new trend and niche market. Premium Beauty News - Industrially speaking could these mascaras be produced in large quantities? Franco Lucá - It is mandatory that everything Geka develops is produced in large quantities. According to Franco Lucá, CEO of Geka World, ""MakeUp in Paris is an event really worth to visit. Geka will showcase trendy new products which are non-exclusive and offer a great price-performance ratio. The Geka showroom can be described with a single word: Hollywood!"" Precisely, Michele Burke, Geka's make-up artist is flying in from Hollywood to do live make-up demonstrations and product presentations. ""Michele is the winner of two Academy Awards and Geka has a very close cooperation with her. She gives us input on tips and tricks that she has developed during her twenty years experience working with top actresses and actors in the film industry,"" says Franco Lucá. Franco Lucá considers MakeUp in Paris as an occasion to share Geka´s expertise and Michele Burke's experience in creating such flawless makeup needed in Hollywood movies. One outstanding product out of the Geka - Michele Burke cooperation is the ""Lip Definer Max"" applicator, which was presented during the latest Cosmoprof in Bologna. The secret of this applicator is that its shape was inspired by the ""pinky finger"" of Michele. Now, the tool yields a very tactile quality to the application that feels like touching your own lips. The flexible, soft flocked applicator is a patented creation of Michele Burke, exclusively produced and distributed by Geka. This eye-catching lip applicator will be launched on the market within the next months."
Cosmetic pencil sharpeners become green with Eisen,"First of all, Eisen will highlight the Multi-Purpose Sharpener, a true beauty tool. ""Our customers who are the true experts can also tell the difference at the sight of it, because after sharpening the pencil with the Eisen sharpener, in the end, only the mirror was missing to apply the product perfectly… well now, the mirror is built right into the sharpener which makes it the perfect beauty tool right at your fingers"". Furthermore, Eisen has been striving to become still ""greener"", both in its factory in Baiersdorf and with its products. ""At Eisen, we are aware of our responsibility towards our customers and towards our planet. The fourth generation heading this family company founded in 1921, (60 staffs, 8 injection machines in total working for the cosmetic line) wants to pass on a healthy planet and an environmentally conscious company to the next generation."" Thus, in its green offering Eisen offers an extensive range of sharpeners that can be produced in a variety of biological friendly and biodegradable resins such as PLA (Polylactic Acid) or WPC (wood plastic composite) to name a few.

A stylish design that fit the latest trends of the cosmetic industry is the perfect fit for your pencil and therefore for your customer."" Come and visit Eisen at MakeUp in Paris, on June 24 and 25, Espace Pierre Cardin."
"Alcan's make-up strategy focuses on ""the three WOWs""","Premium Beauty News - You put in place a proactive approach in the make-up segment with, since the early 2000s, the active cooperation of make-up artist Michel Limongi. But the process has clearly gained momentum in recent months. At Cosmoprof, your stand was very much looking like a ""make-up workshop"". Olivier de Saignes - Quite true! But what we want is to innovate differently, in other words, focus on the real benefit for consumers. We also want to enhance the dialogue with our direct customers and offer innovations which are really in line with their true brand identity. Finally, innovation is also the result of a real partnership centered on a new concept, with or without exclusivity, for one or more customers. Premium Beauty News - Where does innovation come from and how does it come true? Olivier de Saignes - There isn't really any special recipe! Our Creative Director, Michel Limongi holds regular meetings to work with consumers in order to understand their problems and needs. He then translates the results into new packaging concepts which become through the work of our innovations and development teams, tomorrow's products providing real benefits to end consumers both in terms of make-up but also care. This is what we call at Alcan Packaging Beauty the third ""WOW effect"". PremiumBeauty News - Precisely, what do you call the third ""WOW effect""? Olivier de Saignes - It's a wink of course but based on a sound reality. We just wanted to say that ideally we needed to generate three moments of satisfaction (the WOW) from the end-consumer. The first, when she sees the packaged product. The look of it must be attractive. The second one, when she opens the package and discovers an interesting formula with an effective applicator. The third one is simply when she has satisfaction using the product. If we get the three, it means we've hit the bull's-eye! Premium Beauty News - You are in a full service approach? Olivier de Saignes - We can actually offer turnkey solutions to our customers by integrating the pack, the applicator and the customized formula, but it does not stop there. Actually, our offer includes 4 stages: First of all, our core business is truly packaging (stage 1) and if the ""plus"" on this make-up segment is actually the applicator to get the expected result (stage 2), it is clear that we'll never propose the applicator without the packaging but ""with"" the packaging. Then, the formula is obviously fundamental. And our Beauty Solution Services Department working with suppliers selected for their know-how, is in a position to offer the ""right"" formula, i.e. the appropriate one for the desired make-up effect. That's the third stage of our offer developed with our suppliers. Of course, our range of propositions doesn't stop there. We even offer customized promotional products. The fourth stage is our ability to generate new concepts. This is what we achieved with ""Roll On Accord Parfait"". We are, of course, ""a proposal force"" and for example we regularly organize in our premises at Gennevilliers near Paris, presentations of new product concepts. Our approach is undoubtedly to know and understand market trends, to find the right formula, the right applicator and, of course, the appropriate packaging. All this is only conceivable if we also keep in mind concepts related to rapid implementation, globalization of our markets and customer markets as well, and of course, of cost optimization. Premium Beauty News - In terms of innovation, you have been quite busy! In particular regarding mascara. Olivier de Saignes - You are right, we have been very active in the mascara segment and we are not stopping there! This was actually one of the strong points of our presence at Cosmoprof Bologna where our visitors were ""welcomed"" at our booth with huge mascaras in the middle of which Michel Limongi was working. It's impossible to detail them all, but we can single out a few models like the one called ""APB1"" with the crowned teeth at the tip of the applicator allowing lash-by-lash application and providing very good combing. There is also ""Threaded Rod"". This applicator with no teeth allows a good loading of formula, with no combing at all. The results will very much vary depending on the kind of formula used. The main goal of this applicator is the curling effect, perfect to push the lashes up and towards the eyelid, without making stains on the eyelid skin. While ""Dual Comb"" is another range of mascara applicators with short spread teeth for quick loading to optimize volume, longer tight teeth for improved combing, to shape the lashes and flat sides to curl the lashes, pushing the lashes upward with no risk of stain on the eyelid skin. And there are still a lot, under development!"
Oekabeauty: a new series of applicators for lip gloss and mascara,"Premium Beauty News - Is it still possible to innovate with regard to mascara and lip gloss applicators? Frank Bierkandt (Oekametall's Assistant to the General Management and Sales Manager) - Of course, it still possible to innovate! Obviously, things had to be done wisely. Which is precisely how we operated with ourlip gloss applicators. Because for instance the use of a traditional ""flock"" covering the core remained almost unavoidable for a proper application of lip gloss. We tried everything but doing without it didn't offer any good results. However, it was necessary, to improve the ""storage"" capacity of gloss on the applicator so that the consumer would not wast her time dipping her applicator ceaselessly in and out of the vial. There were already one or two existing systems but the trick used for our two new applicators Boost-your-lips! and Double-boost-your-lips! lies in their tank-shaped applicator. It was a simple enough idea, somebody just had to think of it. And it works! We also propose Smooth-lips, which is a flocked applicator with a very soft and particularly supple touch. Premium Beauty News - And a new mascara too? Frank Bierkandt - Indeed, we are launching What-a-brush!, a new plastic injected mascara applicator. The shape of the brush is very special with its curved central portion which allows loading greater quantities for an optimum high volume delivery. Premium Beauty News - A series of new products at a time when the activity is strong again? Frank Bierkandt - The activity is much stronger, obviously! And the market is eager to discover new products, which is very exciting. It's an opportunity for us to continue our international development and I can tell you beforehand that we have reached a trade agreement with the company ABA Packaging in the United States to better penetrate this huge market."
Kosmoda: The latest in make-up powders,"Premium Beauty News - Kosmoda is not really a start-up, is it? Dario Moretti - No, not strictly speaking! It was created in March 2007. It is the result of the acquisition of Planet, a company which already had an experience of over ten years in the production of cosmetics. Of course, Kosmoda has nothing to compare today with what Planet wasin the past. Needless to say that since its takeover, we have heavily invested. Premium Beauty News - What is Kosmoda's offer? Dario Moretti - In order to offer our customers optimum service and to keep track of requests and constant market requirements, we started by setting up a team with strong experience and invested in product research and development but also in the production tool. Currently, we are able to offer a variety of compact powders, meteorites, loose powders, lipsticks, lipgloss, foundations, mascaras. Actually, almost the entire range of make-up products. In particular, we have gained experience in the manufacture of cooked products. An exclusive and patented process allows us to propose powders with a degree of finish and varieties in shapes never seen before. You will have to excuse me for not telling you more on the subject but on the other hand we will be delighted to welcome our visitors at Cosmoprof Bologna to tell them more. More generally, and thanks to the significant investments made by Kosmoda in production, we have a production capacity of about 1,500,000 pieces per month. Not to mention other investments carried out in filling and packaging machines, allowing Kosmoda to offer a truly comprehensive service. Premium Beauty News - How far does Kosmoda extend its operations nowadays? Dario Moretti - Currently, our sales are achieved on the Italian, German, Spanish and Middle East markets, but we obviously hope to extend our influence to French and North-European markets."
L'Occitane debuts peony-inspired makeup line,"A legend tells that a beautiful nymph named Peonia was so adored and cherished by the gods that a jealous goddess turned her into a flower with a thousand petals, a peony. This flower then turned to be a symbol of beauty and femininity in the Mediterranean area. In order to better understand the secrets of this flower and transpose them into the world of make-up, L'Occitane consulted French peony expert and lover Jean-Luc Rivière, who comes from a rich family history of having cultivated and studied the flower for 160 years. ""The extraordinary range colour palette of peonies grown by the Rivière family, inspired a make-up line with fresh and natural colours, reflecting the variety of the flowers and bearing their names,"" says L'Occitane in a release. For each product, L'Occitane created an original decoration inspired from a specific flower, and the products are sold in a kind of ""seed sachet"", with an image of a specific family of peony flower that best captures that product's shade. For the development of the cardboard primary packaging, L'Occitane called upon HCT's know-how who had to deal with several challenges: – a textured and laminated paper was proposed to give the cardboard range a specific touch, as specified by L'Occitane's marketing team, – the development and harmonisation in a short time of 17 different decorations, each of them highlighting a specific type of peony. In order to reduce the environmental impact of the products, all the sachets and packaging are printed on paper from sustainable forests. For the formulation of this make-up line, L'Occitane has prioritized naturalness without abandoning the rationale for the make-up: the variety of colours, the pleasure during the application and product performance. ""All the products in the collection contain an exclusive natural peony extract with softening properties and a mica coated with mimosa from Provence that brings smoothness to the formulations and adds comfort during the application,"" the company said. All products are paraben free and L'Occitane claims that the use of synthetic pigments was restricted to 2% of the formula and that of silicone to 5%. The makeup range features eye, cheek and face colours, as well as a bronzer, lip colours and gloss."
Eternelle : perfuming is an art,"""Eternelle introduces an innovative technology that revives the elegance and tradition of a timeless gesture to spray luxury fragrances,"" says Aptar. While some perfumery brands are trying to get back to their roots, Aptar beauty+home is bringing ""exceptional technology to enhance the art of perfuming"". Indeed, this perfume atomizer, which is apparently very traditional, brings the assurance of a simple and effective locking mechanism. This patented innovation allows for locking the bottle with a simple quarter turn and guarantees with absolutely certainty that it is perfectly leak-proof. Furthermore, the bulb is designed so as it can be mounted directly onto the perfume bottle on the production line. This will allow consumers to discover the object in its entirety when they open the box. Eternelle has been designed with total respect for the fragrance. It adapts to FEA 15 (Seal Tight) and Europa 4 bottle necks and allows the same bottle to be used for both a classic spray version as well as a bulb spray version without any adaptation. ""Eternelle is an innovative perfume atomiser, the first of its kind on the market demonstraing that the art of perfuming is all about the gesture… the timeless gesture of Eternelle,"" says the company in a release. Enhancing this launch, in tune with Eternelle's ""spirit of luxury"", Solev, the specialist in packaging decoration design for perfumes, cosmetics and spirits, has created a silvery metal veil that descends over the bottle, gradually revealing a deep purple tone. A silk-screen print provides the finishing touch."
Womanity.com: towards a new generation brand?,"Thierry Mugler seized the occasion of the international women's day, on the 8 of March, to unveil its new concept of virtual community dedicated to women: womanity.com The website is articulated around the word that names it. It is precisely the name ""womanity"" which is supposed to enhance the visitors' creativity. ""Members are invited to reveal their own definition of Womanity, and their curiosity is awakened by dynamic, changing content (video, photography, articles, and posts) that is in turn inspiring, entertaining, profound, lighthearted, and even provocative,"" says the brand in a release. The site's content may still evolve and all of its functionalities will be available in June. Womanity.com currently features a mosaic of diversified contents: literary, artistic, journalistic... In the wake of the Blogalaxy, launched in 2007, which offered its members the opportunity to share their ideas and thoughts about the world of Thierry Mugler by creating their own personal blogs, and following the creation of the Island of Dr. Muglerstein on Second Life, and the launch of an on-line boutique in September 2007, Womanity.com continues Thierry Mugler's innovative communication initiatives throughout the web. ""A brand must seek to break away from the elementary notion of broadcasting a message. Through UGC (User Generated Content), we place customers at the core of our thinking about the brand, sparking interaction through constant exchange,"" notes Joël Palix, president of Clarins Fragrance Group and the Thierry Mugler brand.

Blue Marble Energy and Sweet Anthem Perfumery partner to launch carbon neutral fragrance,"Named for the Greek goddess of the dawn, the Eos fragrance line contains only biochemical and organic materials. The range, which comprises a feminine scent and a masculine/unisex scent, is said carbon neutral since it does not contain any petroleum derivative. Actually, Eos scents feature a special selection of Blue Marble Energy's carbon neutral bioester as the top note, while the heart notes and low notes have been blended with Sweet Anthem's custom product, which are locally sourced from distributors of organic, sustainable, or wild harvested materials. To make these bioesters, BME utilizes cellulosic biomass - in this case, certified organic spent brewery grain [1] - reclaiming the useful material through a patented conversion technology. The results of this process are refined to produce bioester fragrances that are ready for blending and, according to BME, can replace various petrochemicals already in the market. ""The potential outlets for our biochemicals are vast,"" says BME's Chief Science Officer, James Stephens. ""Fragrance is just one of many examples in which carbon neutral, renewable biochemicals can directly replace polluting petrochemicals in high value products."""
Parfums Corolle: design for little emperors,"The launch of Parfums Corolle should represent a new milestone in the development of the still recent segment of selective perfumery for children. For the first time, a renowned designer, Serge Mansau was asked to develop an original and innovative bottle for children. In a few simple ideas, he managed to transpose to the universe of perfumery the identity of a singular brand. Created in 1979, Corolle is currently the leading brand for high end dolls in France. Designed by a French company based in Langeais, near Tours, and incorporated since 1989 to the Mattel Group, Corolle dolls are distributed in 29 countries. ""For thirty years, Corolle dolls have been vanilla perfumed and distinguish themselves with a wide range of clothing. This doll dressing game has been recreated in an original way adding the perfume product"" explains Frédéric Beaulieu, CEO of The Millennium Essence Company, which has a worldwide license for the exploitation of the brand in Perfumery. Ten years after the launch of Kaloo parfumes, which still remains a best-selling product in the segment (nearly 16% market share in France, behind Tartine & Chocolat and Jacadi) and the launch in 2003 of Clayeux Perfumes, Frederic Beaulieu wanted to rely on ""best talents to design an exceptional product."" Serge Mansau's key idea was to create the shape of a little girl embossed on the bottle, a shape that little users can dress up in different outfits, just like they do with their Corolle dolls. A plain idea, but demanding a technical achievement that proved more difficult than expected, as to comply The Millennium Essence Company to delay the launch. ""The design of the three small thermoformed plastic clothes that come with the bottle was a real challenge"", explains Frederic Beaulieu. ""Manufacturers skilled in the sheet by sheet thermoforming no longer exist in France, and to find one in Europe was not easy, especially with our technical requirements. Eventually, it's a Spanish company specialized in the manufacturing of relief maps that took up the challenge and managed the blanking of the product as we wanted it"". A patent was even filed for the system implemented to lay plastic parts on relief glass. Corolle perfumes exist in three fragrances: Vanilla, Cherry, Rose et Fleur (Rose and Flower). They are available in bottles or in gift boxes with a Corolle doll, following the concept that made the success of Kaloo perfumes. The design of the 60 ml bottle was entrusted the French glassmaker Pochet. The Surlyn stopper was manufactured by Codiplast, the pump and pump cover by EMSAR. The fragrances are signed Mane, Robert and Expressions Parfumées. With the launch of Parfums Corolles, The Millennium Essence Company intends pursuing the route leading to the position of market leader for children fragrances. A niche that still represents 1% in market value and 2% in volume, and which is particularly strong in travel retail where The Millennium Essence Company achieves nearly 25% of its turnover. ""These are ideal gifts on a trip return, the guilty gift par excellence,"" explains Frederic Beaulieu. The segment also benefits from the advent of the spoiled child from new family models and the standard of two children per couple. ""A newborn baby, at birth, receives an average of 32 presents and thereafter children continue to be pampered, not just at Christmas or on birthdays."" Many reasons to be optimistic for the future, especially since this family model is globalizing itself."
Qualipac presents an antibacterial polymer for fit its dispensing jar,"The ""dispensing jar"" recently developed and marketed by Qualipac has made further progress in its conception. The dispensing principle associated to the jar was already a clever one. Once the lid of the jar is removed a simple finger push on a piston releases a dose of cream through a dispensing orifice (membrane). This dispensing jar allows simple gestures with no outside contaminants. As far as security is concerned, the jar was already equipped with tamper-evident indicators. ""The elastomeric membrane incorporates a first use indicator"", people at Qualipac explain. But today, the piston is made from anti-bacterial polymers to help protect the cream in contact with it. The capacity is 1,7oz/50 ml, with an evacuation rate above 95% Filling is achieved through the bottom of the jar (bottom base opened), piston being in the up position and lid closed. The packaging operations are reduced to filling and connecting (hook-ups) the bottom base. All other operations, namely heat sealing of the membrane, screwing of the lid and finishing are carried out upstream by Qualipac."
Samples : 3D sachet with cap,"The French contract packer and sachet spécialist LCE SA has produced new stand-up sachets with resealable cap for Lancaster Sun Sport new product range. The advantage of this 3D sachet, used here as a 10ml sample dose, in addition to the stand-up position on the shelves, is the ability to pack more product in a reduced amount of packaging. Alcan Packaging Montreuil-Bellay, specialised into flexible packaging for pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications, printed and laminated the multilayer structure with an aluminium foil. This laminate brings to the sachet the right combination of flexibility and resistance, and preserves the active ingredients of the sun gel, even in extreme climate conditions. The large surface for communication and high quality sandwich rotogravure printing are key for the promotion of the brand image and the product range colour codes. The 3D sachet with cap can be opened and reclosed any time, and restitute easily the product until the last drop. Handy, resistant, funny, he will follow the consumer everywhere and is perfectly adapted to an active and nomadic lifestyle. Lancaster customers can try and adopt this new product range in real life conditions."
Samples bring innovation,"Premium beauty News - Eventually, the current crisis may have a positive impact on innovation, in particular in the samples and promotional items industry. Ludovic Anceau [1], you are directly concerned by this evolution, how do you explain it? Ludovic Anceau - As far as promotional items are concerned, it is clear that consumers buying expensive products in a beauty shop are expecting to receive gifts such as unit dose items, for instance, which are increasingly considered as interesting gifts rather than as a cheap imported gadgets. Regarding samples, they perfectly fulfil their function, which is to help people to try a product, before buying it, or to help to recruit new consumers by offering additional opportunities to test a product in good hygienic conditions. Premium beauty News - Actually, your customers are seeking for new and confirmed concepts that are easy to display, with the aim to facilitate the discovery of the most expensive products? Ludovic Anceau - Exactly! In particular as innovation is easier in the samples industry because of the processes we use and because of the geographic proximity between the various operators. Furthermore, required tooling investments are not expensive, in particular as we propose a full service that includes the product fill-in. Moreover, this innovation is affordable. It is possible to seduce or to grant gifts to consumers, and to differentiate one's products at a very low cost, and that is very welcomed in current times. Premium Beauty News - In such a context Socoplan-Biopack was able to demonstrate its creativity. Ludovic Anceau - That's true! Our development teams made a good job. Our Mascarapack and our Glosspack can attest that! So far, mascara was the only make-up product that was almost impossible to test at the beauty counter. Our system is highly hygienic and uses the same brush as the real product and its formula corresponds to the one of on-sale products. Let's also name the Etuidose. A very competitive combination of a perfume sample between two small pockets that can contain assorted products. And, of course, the Self-warming Unidose, for warming up formulaes that require heat before being used."
Samples not like the others,"Indigo by Valois and Cofatech have joined their respective know-how to present Cosm'in, a flat sachet with a resealable and customisable cap. The product is dispensed at the centre of the cap by simply squeezing the sachet. The base of the cap is transparent and allows to see the colour and the quantity of product left. ""Cosm'in is perfectly suitable for cross sampling, mailings or magazine insertion, but also on points of sale. The sachet, which perfectly addresses the needs of travellers, and of those with a lifestyle correlated with a fragmented consumption. Thanks to its size, quality and solidity, it is also a real portable mini packaging, that can be transported and used several consecutive times,"" claim the two companies. As far as its patented dispensing system is concerned, the new MDS could transform the way final consumers are using pumps and products. For the development and the sale of this product of this product in Europe, Sicofor is partnering with the US company Poly-D, who owns the patent. The MDS is engineered with only a few parts. First, there is a button that can be customized for size, push pressure and exact amount dosed per full stroke. Then there is the valve that is designed for your specific viscosity and dose. And last, there is the pouch, made from a plastic film that is designated based on the chemistry of the product. Then, just put the sample in thehand and push. The dose comes out and the package automatically seals up tight. So easy, so neat, so economical."
Prestigious launches for Axilone,"For the new Boss Orange fragrance, Axilone made a U shaped envelope from a single block of anodised with a mirror effect metal. This envelope where the brand name is engraved was sculpted and forcibly moulded to perfectly marry the contours of the bottle. Axilone also designed and produced the cap for the bottle of Lacoste's new perfume for men, Challenge. The cap and collar are made using an overmoulded bi-injection process. An elastomer polymer was used to provide a soft touch effect, similar to that of a tennis racket grip. Axilone overcame the technical problems of production by using PP and bi-injection. For A Scent, by Issey Miyake, Axilone created a cap, which takes on the aspect of a block of ice. The juxtaposed polished and frosted rectangular faces, punctuate the pure and raw lines of the bottle. As a whole, the artefact looks as if it is frozen. The cap is made from Surlyn and produced in three sizes. Even with the cap off, the bottle loses none of its feel and look of transparency. The spray pump cover is also made from a translucent material so as not to detract from the « pure and infinite beauty » of the crystalline object as a whole. Eventually, for Zen for Men by Shiseido, Axilone designed a cap with a sophisticated combination of refined, pure, angular lines and reflections. ""The shade of blue evokes the infinite power of time and space. Silver adds sophistication and confidence. And when brought together, the two colours symbolise spiritual energy"". The cap is made up of a number of parts manufactured from galvanised plastic: an insert in black PP ; an extra element to provide weight and an air of solidity; a metal, mirror effect sheet covered with a piece of polished SAN."

Roll' on Accord Parfait by L'Oréal Paris: an innovation from Alcan Packaging Beauty,"No more brush or sponge required to apply the compact foundation but a mini roller of 10 mm in diameter that can just take the right amount of product and apply it in a perfectly uniform way, creating what specialists call a flawless effect with no overloading. An innovation that we owe to Michel Limongi, esthetician, makeup artist, teacher and creative director for Alcan Packaging Beauty. ""In fact, he explains, this new concept is really a concentrated approach of what I have always followed since the day I developed a passion for the beauty of women."" According to Michel Limongi, it is essential to create makeup products that are in perfect harmony with the needs of women. And to achieve this, ""we must listen, study, propose, test... , and test again. We must also and above all, teach women how to apply makeup. It is in my training center, that this whole process is set up to give life to our new concepts, centered on the real needs and expectations of consumers."" While brands have now achieved an excellent quality control of their formulas, ""we must now associate the proper applicators to obtain the makeup effect desired by women"" And the Roll 'on Accord Parfait is certainly the best outcome of this theory. It is the symbol of the ideal combination between an efficient applicator tool and a formula, created by L'Oreal Paris, perfectly adapted to this new application technique. ""In this case, you simply roll out the formula. So a new gesture is created, but also and above all a professional result within consumer reach… this is what guides my everyday-work"", explains Michel Limongi, It is easy to guess that for teams working under his leadership at the Research and Development Center for Alcan Packaging Beauty in Gennevilliers, this is a daily… but yet exciting challenge.

The alchemy of nail polish according to Fiabila,"Premium Beauty News - Fiabila has presented its new collection of nail polishes for this winter. Estelle Miasnik – Our collections are always inspired by trends issued from trends offices, fashion and indoor-decoration professionals and various exhibits. The expression of color is nonetheless subjective, intuitive, it springs from our memories, our emotions.

Creating new colors, means to borrow some from the past to reveal the colors of tomorrow, all the better. It is expressing the transparency of water, the freshness of a rose petal, a journey through time, the brightness of a precious stone, the softness of velvet... Premium Beauty News - What is the particular inspiration of the season? Estelle Miasnik - The inspiration of this season is that of a woman who transforms herself each day according to here fantasy.

Plastics: innovation against the crisis?,"Even in the context of the current economic slowdown, manufacturers of flexible plastic packaging are holding out and are implementing new strategies that enable them to propose innovative solutions to their customers. Most of these innovations aim at combining positive impact on the environment with economic performance. ""Permanent innovation and saving resources seem to be the keys that enable our industry to adapt to the crisis; working as catalyst for the new order to come,"" explains Dominqiue Paul Vallée, ELIPSO's president. ""Reduction at source, packaging optimization from the design step, improvement of our technologies, evolution of materials, and consumers safety, contribute to the creation of packaging products that perfectly match with the expectations of all customers that use it throughout the chain, as well as the final consumer,"" he adds. The latest issue of Futurs, ELIPSO's newsletter, showcases new products proposed by French manufacturers of flexible plastic packaging and designed to meet the needs of a wide scope of industries, including the beauty business. Thus, regarding neutral lotions pumps, Rexam's Nea pump is designed for the most sophisticated bulks. It offers a unique solution that combines a totally neutral dispensing system, peerless user comfort and a modern design. The new dispensing system's neutrality is guaranteed by a spring located on the outside of the dosing chamber and the use of a glass bearing. At no time is the formula in contact with metal or elastomer. Regarding the cosmetic pumps segment, Valois' T10 is an innovative tip designed to equip the Evolux pump range, which prevents the cream from drying out in the push-button nozzle, thus avoiding external contamination to ensure the optimum preservation of the product. As it only opens under pressure from the cream, it remains tightly sealed before use and closes again automatically. Total product protection is guaranteed. As far as customized pumps are concerned, enhancing customization and differentiation options for pumps is still possible. That conviction is reflected in the Clikit™ IP pump by MWV Calmar, a high-end, resin-injected version of the company's market-leading Melodie® Clikit™pump. A wide array of decorative finishes and attractive high-end coatings such as Iridescence, Sparkle, Soft touch, Metalized lacquering and Custom printing (of any pattern or image through Sublimation) is now available. In the jars segment, Promens' EasyLock is highlighted. In snap-on mode, this jar delivers maximum efficiency for the filler. In screw/unscrew version, it provides beauty and healthcare professionals with optimum user comfort. Airtight and tamper-proof, it ensures total product protection. Once the tear off band is taken off, EasyLock is to be used like a normal screwing jar. In volumes from 30 to 1250 ml, the jar is suitable for every pharmaceutical form (powder, gel, cream, tablets, etc.). Eventually, in eye shadow applicators, the Banana Maker proposed by Alcan Packaging Beauty is an innovative applicator that lets consumers make up their eyes with an irresistible ""banana"" shadow effect. Its spherical shape perfectly hugs the hollow around the eyelid and its flocked tip helps applying just the right product quantity at the right place."

Transparent Packaging adds fragrances to packaging graphics,"Transparent Packaging's scented boxes allow brand owners and consumer product manufacturers ""to attract consumers with another of their product's key attributes, its fragrance, without the addition of a secondary paper scratch and sniff sticker, which can have a denigrating effect on the packaging image,"" explains the company in a release. Various product categories from hair and body care to perfume product companies may find this packaging augmentation a great leap in their branding efforts. According to David Dennison, Transparent Packaging's President, several application methods already allows for large scale production runs, as well as relatively low volume specialty product applications. ""The response from our clients that have seen the product and its shelf impact potential has been terrific,"" he added. The use of transparent plastic folding cartons for product visibility with optional opaque, translucent or holographic print, coupled with the ability to encapsulate any fragrance onto the packaging graphics, does indeed invigorate a the concept of ""Multi Sensory Packaging."" With its manufacturing plant in Montreal, Quebec, Transparent Packaging Inc. focuses strictly on the specialized non-paper packaging converting business."
"Zèbre Rouge, products on the go!","The brand's founders, two experienced professionals with a substantial background in the fashion and beauty industries, partnered with Cosmalia, a French cosmetics designer specialised in natural products free from chemical preservatives. They created an extensive range of products, easy to carry in a moving world. The brand's motto ""Travel light in Beauty, It's our idea"" perfectly describes their offering which features products manufactured in a soft admixture, at room temperature, in order to preserve the original qualities of the ingredients and actives. Zèbre Rouge's products are based on two main active ingredients the red clover and the mallow, which are renowned for their astringent and soothing properties as well as emollient and antioxidant effects. Products follow the new customer's habits, men and women in developed countries living in societies where travelling has become quite common for a large part of the population. Zèbre Rouge subsequently offers products that perfectly comply with the latest safety standards, such as their ""Round trip kit"" or the ""Long-haul aircraft kit,"" featuring airless dispensers. The range, made up of 5 hygiene products and 6 care products, is available on the brand's web site, which was entirely redesigned on the occasion of its second anniversary."
Plastic bottles for nail polishes by EMS-Grivory,"Premium Beauty News - The cosmetic industry is increasingly seeking for high-tech plastics? Richard Courtois - That's true. For instance, our range of transparent amorphous polyamides, Grivory G21, is now a reference as a packaging material for the perfumery industry. Actually, Grivory G21 fills the gap between glass and traditional plastics. Glass has better barrier properties, but it can be broken, and is heavier than plastic. On the other hand, traditional plastic materials, lack the good barrier properties that allows glass to protect formulations from oxygen, aromas, oils, waxes, solvents or UV rays. With Grivory G21, we successfully combined in a single high-quality material the performances of these two substances. But Grivory 21's best assets is certainly its barrier property: our new product efficiently protects high-end cosmetics from external contamination, and also prevents the evaporation of volatile ingredients, subsequently improving products' durability. Thanks to its very good barrier properties, Grivory G21 is also a good protection for vitamins that are increasingly part of cosmetic formulations. The amorphous polyamide made by EMS-Grivory also complies with designers' requirements for the making of original shapes. High brightness, easy to print on and good resistance to scratches add up to the list. From design to production, our customers can also benefit from the help of Ganahl, a Switzerland-based company that has developed specific tools adapted to Grivory G21. Premium Beauty News - Among the recent developments, there are also bottles for nail polishes. Can you tell more about that? Richard Courtois - All nail polish manufacturers have tested Grivory G21 for the replacing glass as a material for nail polish bottles. Provided that it can successfully comply with the specifications, I think that a leading French cosmetics maker will propose such a product by the end of 2009. However, the Chinese company Shyahsin moved faster and showcased seven plastic bottles for nail polish using Grivory 21 during the latest edition of Cosmoprof."
Yves Rocher opts for Unicadose,"Designed by Eskiss Packaging, a French SME, the Unicadose phial [1] features several product benefits: – possibility to drink its contents directly, – unbreakable and recyclable material, – easy open container, – product adapted to travels, – hot filling and sterilization possible. Another interesting benefit is the corresponding filling machine that Eskiss Packaging designed, which is able to fill in 25,000 units per hour (liquids or granules). The phials are entirely made of transparent or coloured polypropylene. Of course, screen printing decoration is also possible. Eskiss Packaging aims at conquering a significant market share of the huge glass phials market, and paving the way for the development single-dose products on export markets. ""Several cosmetics makers and pharmaceutical companies are already testing the Unicadose,"" comments a spokesperson of the company."
MGS offers plant-based plastic solutions,"MGS is a family-owned company located in Plastics Vallée closed to Lyon and Geneva. MGS is a pioneer in the plastic injection mastery and has been operating in the high-end perfumery and cosmetics markets since 1972, with specific and standard (jars, lids, boxes) products. As most of the companies in this industry, most of its products are manufactured with oil-based fossil raw materials. However, considering the growing demand for ""green"" solutions, MGS now proposes a cosmetic jars from 100% GMO-free vegetable materials."
"Ahrt, clothes turn into cosmetics","To take care of one's skin simply by wearing clothes, that's what Ahrt Cosmetics is proposing, with the aim to make cosmeto-textiles technologies more accessible. Contrarily to the companies that pioneered this segment, such as Skin'Up, Cosmetic Wear, or Lytess, Ahrt does not offer cosmetic clothes, but lotions to apply on one's own textiles: jeans, tee-shirts, stockings, … By the way, no more concerns regarding the durability of the cosmetic properties given to textiles! The range of cosmeto-textiles solutions proposed by Ahrt Cosmetics is the result of a common venture between MicroCapsules Technologies (MCT), a specialist of micro-encapsulation, and Nobex, a manufacturer of perfumed slippers. When Nobex launched its first perfumed slipper in 2003 (the ""cavaricci"") Richard Biernack, its manager, decided to invest further in the associated technology, with the conviction it had a huge potential. Micro-encapsulation is a process in which tiny active particles or droplets are surrounded by a coating, in that case a silicone coating, that allow them to spread around when the coating is crushed, during the contact between clothes and the skin, for instance. That's only in 2008 that the new generation of cosmeto-texile products is available. Several years of research and development, as well as stringent sensitivity tests have been necessary. There are three lotions in the range, respectively with slimming, moisturizing and refreshing effects. The lotions are to be used during machine or hand washing, as if they were mere fabric conditioners, linen thus becoming soaked with the microcapsules. The lotions also contain hemp oil, caffeine or menthol in order to leave a pleasant contact sensation and a delicate fragrance on clothes. The products are available online, through Ahrt's website (www.ahrt-cosmetics.com). Products will soon be distributed in mass retail and speciality stores in France."
"Nominoë, when cosmetics act local and think global","As many other young cosmetic brands, Nominoë - named after a historical character who participated in the foundation of the old Duchy of Brittany - offers organic-certified formulations. However, the brand also wants to demonstrate that ""it is possible to make high end products, simultaneously simple and organic, and based on botanicals that have not been imported from the other side of the world,"" says Jeremias Martins, Nominoë's founder. With the aim to protect the environment, Nominoë also tries to limit supply chain induced transports by using a maximum of local ingredients. Products are formulated with actives extracted from plants grown in Brittany and strictly selected. Formulations mix substances as unusual as gorse water, artichoke or buckwheat extracts, or broom, or rock samphire extracts, with more common ingredients such as strawberry akenes, bees-wax or sesame oil are also. Products offer anti-oxidizing, purifying and moisturizing actions. Nominoë products are certified by Ecocert, they are free from parabens and aluminium and only contain natural preservatives. The brand's commitment to environmental responsibility also covers products' packaging. All bottles are made of easily recyclable plastics and sold without secondary packaging. Black and White labels are obviously a wink to Brittany's flag. A round-shaped opening in the label allows to see ermine spots printed on the inner side! On each label a triskelion underlines the Celtic roots of the brand. Eventually, as nothing was made by chance, a yellow border remains the colour of gorse flowers. For its labels as for its packaging, the brand claims to work only with « French SMEs having a human size », with the aim to provide customers with high added value products only. Initially available in selected points of sale in Brittany, the young brand carries on its extension and can now be found in about twenty shops all over France, in organic retail shops, beauty salons specialised in organic beauty products and in concept stores. This Brittany-rooted brand does not hesitate to target foreign markets. ""Britanny ranks second among French regions that tourists visit the most, it is mostly visited by Northern Europeans and Japanese and Americans. It's a region with a strong identity,"" underlines Jérémias Martins. The Nominoë range currently features a shower gel, an exfoliating body scrub, a body oil, and a gentle foam cleanser. Several creams are expected to complete the range."
A new airless dual mixer,"Pulvorex, a French specialist of foaming dispensing systems, presented a new airless mixer during the latest edition of the Pharmapack tradeshow in Paris. The new device allows consumers to mix together two components, two liquids or a liquid and a powder, just before using the product. Actually, the system is made of two parts fitted together, each part containing either a liquid or a powder. Before using the product, the consumer turn the upper part through 180° thus letting its content to flow out in the lower part. The main advantage of this technology is that the entire operation is processed in an airless environment, the final mixture remaining ""airless"". At the end of the operation, the final user just has to press the pump to dispense the product. The system is currently available in a 15ml format."
Babor targets the young and active,"Specially formulated to remain active for 24 hours, supplying essential substances for the skin around the clock, the philosophy behinds Babor Basic Care aims to fit with modern and active urban life. The new line has been designed to meet the needs of young women with unproblematic skins but constantly on the move, often with insufficient time for sleep and few time to devote to beauty regimes. ""Even this kind of skin likes to be pampered every now and then, particularly when exhaust fumes, air-conditioned offices and changeable weather conditions take their toll,"" Babor explains. Babor Basic Care line features a Lipid Balancing Cream (50 ml) for dry skins with aloe vera, panthenol, macadamia nut and sesame seed oils, and a Moisturizing Cream (50 ml) for mixed and oily skin types with panthenol, polysaccharides and rice starch. Both products are free from mineral oils. Babor's other January launch is devoted to the skins of teenagers and young adults that sometimes react sensitively to skin care products and are affected by the variations in hormone levels. The Babor Pure line features ""natural ingredients that are custom formulated for the needs of problematic skins,"" the company claims. Babor Pure comprises five products to help youngest skins to maintain their natural balance. Both new lines are launched on the German market in January and shortly after in the sixty other counties where Babor is represented."

Chanel seeks to expand the frontiers of innovation through virtual design,"French fashion and cosmetics house Chanel, through its Research and Technology Unit, apparently carries on working on the technological innovations that will continue to set the brand apart. The Paris-based company is partnering with Dassault Systèmes, the world leader in Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) software solutions powered by 3D, and sister company of French aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation, within the Dassault Group. First used to design complex shapes, 3D now makes it possible to design and manufacture products creating digital mockups, it helps companies to digitally define and simulate products, as well as the processes and resources required to manufacture, maintain and recycle those products and improve the environment. ""By combining their expertise, in cosmetics for Chanel, and in 3D technologies and virtualization for Dassault Systèmes, the partners aim to develop unique concepts and explore new territories in life sciences,"" Dassault Systèmes said in a release. The first joint project, which is based on the analysis of light and already under way, is co-developed by Chanel Research and Technology and the Dassault Systèmes Design Studio. The aim is to validate new hypotheses and concepts in the beauty sector using virtual software solutions. The project will be finalized in 2010. Other opportunities are also being explored, with an emphasis on virtual simulation and modelling that, according to the two companies, will pave the way for innovative breakthroughs in skin biology and cosmetics."
Eden: 100 % recyclable airless packaging by Airlessystems,"An innovative product, Eden, a 50ml piston system (47 mm diameter), represents a new step forward for Airlessystems. This new launch required an important industrial investment for the Aptar subsidiary, renowned for its know-how, technical knowledge and experience on the market. Eden is dedicated to cosmetic products for both men and women; it matches softness and performance in use with a retaining strength of 2kg maximum for a viscosity of 30,000 cps. It features a 1ml progressive dosage. But above all, not only it is 100% leak proof, Eden is also 100 % recyclable and therefore addresses current ecological concerns. Eden is fully customisable, offering Airlessystems' customers freedom of design and providing an answer to all aesthetical demands. Attention has also been given to the decorative options with the choices of labelling, silk-screening, hot stamping and offset printing. Vacuum filled or atmospherically filled, Eden provides a maximum protection for the most elaborated formulas by preventing air from entering the barrel. Eden also works perfectly with high viscosity formulation, giving the customers great flexibility."
Bâton Rouge aims to become the standard for tailor-made lipsticks in Europe,"Premium Beauty News - Bâton Rouge celebrated its second anniversary last December. What is your take on the early stages of this adventure? Christelle Percheron - The results are very encouraging, with growth of +200% between 2022 and 2023 and a six-figure turnover. We sold more than 10,000 lipsticks in 2023 and more than 4,000 gift cards between the end of November and the end of December 2023. As we have seen, Bâton Rouge is an experience that can be shared: we welcome many duos, groups of girlfriends and even professional events. Today, our tiny 24 sq. m. boutique, although perfectly optimised, is saturated, as is our booking calendar. There is a two-month waiting list. But as we have some no-shows, it is always possible to try your luck without an appointment and be looked after. We have recently hired an additional make-up artist to meet growing demand, but indeed, it is the opening of a second outlet that will unclog the books and enable us to welcome even more people. Premium Beauty News - What progress! And so in 2024, a second boutique is due to open in Paris... Christelle Percheron - Absolutely! We are actively looking for premises in the Saint-Germain-des-Prés district that would be three times the size of our first shop in the Marais district. We are hoping to open it this summer, before the 2024 Olympics, otherwise, it will be for next autumn. With this second outlet in Paris, we will be able to welcome a lot more groups of more than five people - for hen parties or birthdays - for which requests are constantly increasing. Today, we have to turn them away. This new venue will also enable us to develop business events (team building, press relations...), which currently account for 10% of our sales. Premium Beauty News - What is your analysis of lip make-up trends? Christelle Percheron - What I can say is that in 2023, we sold as many liquid lipsticks as solid ones. We noticed a preference for gloss during the spring-summer season and for matte liquid in autumn-winter. Satin, on the other hand, enjoys constant success all year round. For their creations, around 80% of visitors choose a scented version. The strawberry-blackberry fragrance is by far the most popular! As far as colours are concerned, it is a bit hard to say. What I have noticed is that there are two major trends: on the one hand, red, which is available in an infinite variety of shades, and on the other, nude, to enhance the natural colour of the lips, which is unique to each person. Premium Beauty News - Are there any innovations in the pipeline? Christelle Percheron - We will be launching new pearlescent and glitter pigments in September. In addition, ready-to-use lip pencils are under development for release at the end of 2024. We aim to offer pencils with ultra-clean ingredients, just like the rest of our range. We pay particular attention to the sourcing of our ingredients to guarantee formulas with a high percentage of naturalness. Castor oil is the main ingredient in our lipsticks and our fragrances are 100% natural, allergen-free and Ecocert certified. Finally, in terms of service, we are planning to introduce an engraving system for our cases to take personalisation one step further. Premium Beauty News - What are your future areas of development? Christelle Percheron - Our ambition is to become the standard for made-to-measure lipsticks in Europe. To this end, we plan to open our first boutique outside France next year, in London; we will start looking in September, focusing our efforts in the Covent Garden area. Milan is also a priority for us and it will probably be the city chosen for our fourth opening. In addition, we are currently working on the design of a moulding machine with 500 cavities, to offer series of hand-made lipsticks to a B-to-B clientele. We have already received several requests from brands in the ready-to-wear, hygiene and food sectors to create a series of lipsticks personalised with their brand image in small quantities. Our packaging suppliers are very agile, which means we can offer, in addition to the choice of the grape or liquid colour, a customised pack by changing its colour, for example, or by integrating a logo to take co-creation to the limit."
Adopt Parfums to open 15 stores in Spain by December 2024,"""Adopt Parfums did not exist ten years ago [2], and five years ago, the brand-chain was almost unknown,"" reminds Frédéric Stoeckel. Today, one Adopt fragrance is sold every two seconds worldwide, in around 40 countries: 10 million bottles sold in France in 2023, 15 million in the rest of the world. According to the CEO, this success is embodied in ""a concept that meets consumer expectations. Some people are total fans. In France, a Facebook group for 'fans of Adopt perfumes' was even created. It currently counts over 13,500 members"", explains the brand's chairman. The brand' major strength is that it offers fragrances at highly affordable prices: a 30-ml bottle sells for 10.95 euros. ""It makes it possible for consumers to change fragrances according to their moods and desires. It is a way of consuming that is totally in tune with the times, and without breaking the bank. To achieve this, we mainly focus on the quality of the juice and offer it in simple containers with no frills and no overpackaging, which helps cut costs considerably"", says Frédéric Stoeckel. The brand, which currently has 240 stores in France, has just opened a subsidiary in Spain to replicate its business plan across the Pyrenees. ""Today, we have one store in Barcelona and one in Madrid, and they are both doing really well! We aim to open 15 in Spain by the end of 2024"", says the CEO. Belgium will also welcome its first Adopt Parfums stores in 2024. ""As for Asia, we have been pursuing our digital strategy in China and duplicated it in Taiwan. Finally, this year we are testing the arrival of Adopt Parfums in Canada"", he adds. ""Juice above all: that has really been our top priority since 2019, when I became the head of the company. Today, we work with major perfumers to create our fragrances. We launch about 20 every year,"" explains Frédéric Stoeckel. The next three launches will feature Indian jasmine and tiare flower, both sourced from sustainable ingredient chains that the company supports through partnerships, including with perfume creation companies. The former will be at the core of L'Or Blanc, an eau de parfum created by Firmenich perfumer Amandine Clerc-Marie, due for release for Mother's Day, in May 2024. Two more fragrances will follow in June: Tahiti Paradis for women, and Blackstone for men: both feature Firmenich's unique tiare flower absolute. These two olfactory creations were designed by Coralie Spicher and Fabrice Pellegrin. Finally, since the end of 2023, Adopt Parfums has been offering customers a new 50-ml bottle to offer intense versions of the brand's best-sellers."
"""Our customers are strongly concerned about packaging"" Annie Jackson, Credo","Leila Rochet - How did your journey into Beauty unfold, leading to your role today as CEO of Credo? Annie Jackson - We started on the concept for Credo back in 2013 and opened our first store in 2015. We just opened our 16th location. We are a physical retail concept. While digital is very important to any business today, Credo was created by meeting customers where they are, in neighborhoods where people are living a healthy lifestyle, exercising, and investing in their health. We want people to be able to explore and find new brands, try the products, and work with our estheticians and makeup artists. And that's our continued focus. Back in 2013, we took the cue from the organic food movement. So we were curious, could we find enough brands to fill our first store in San Francisco. We started with about 60 brands and we have 105 today. About a quarter of those brands we started with are still with us a decade later. Leila - There must have been a lot of challenges when you started. How do they compare to the challenges you face today? Annie - When we started we had this ecosystem of brands which were really celebrating finding a retail partner and wanted to grow alongside us. The customer base has now grown so much that these brands are scaling and growing into bigger retailers. The fact that retailers with a larger footprint than Credo are committed to putting safer products on their shelves is an amazing thing. But from a business standpoint, it becomes quite challenging because that hurts our market share. It's a tricky one. Yet, it hasn't made us any less passionate about what we do. We are striving to make a positive impact in the beauty industry and so we're often shoulder to shoulder with our competitors - Sephora, Ulta, Detox Market, and others. But you know, we're all in this together. And I think the more we can band together to make better choices for human health, it's a good thing. Leila - How do you make sure that the products that you sell in your retailers are the safest ones? Annie - Before, we were manually checking products against our standard, but today we use a technology platform called Novi. We've also invested in a rock star team of impact specialists who come from environmental, toxicology, and science backgrounds, to help guide us. Today, what we're doing as an organization is questioning if there could be a better way. For us, the secret sauce is finding brands that are not just meeting our standards, they're exceeding them, or they have a path to exceed. What makes me so proud of the brand community that we have is that these people have rolled up their sleeves and done the hard work - they're paying more money, and they're taking more time to bring products to market. And they're challenging the contract manufacturing community to look at other ingredients and explore other options. Leila - How do you help your consumers navigate all these changes and what are you seeing as their priority? Annie - From the outset, our customers have always been concerned about packaging. In the early days, while we vetted brands against a restricted substance list, consumers were always saying, ""I hate all this plastic!"". Customers are absolutely invested in being part of the solution. We co-founded the packaging collection program Pact Collective along with other stakeholders, but we also have the conversation on the selling floor about what is recyclable. The next thing that's top of mind for us is looking at ingredients that have no data and examining the assumption that they're safe or good for you. So we're starting to dig into that with Chem Forward, who are a non-profit partner. It may mean that some products at Credo go away, but, you know, that's why we're here and that's the work that we're doing today. Leila - According to Nielsen IQ - 61% of US consumers associate sustainability with benefiting the planet, while just 26% associate it with societal contributions. Credo has been active on matters like ethical sourcing of mica, do you see ethical transparency as the next step for the industry? Annie - Yes, I do. I think whether people are buying beauty products, or beer, or cars, they are much more invested in finding out information before they choose a product. And so it could be a source of ingredients, it could be packaging, it could be what a founder says on social media… it could be all of those pieces together. Gen Z has the highest bar of any customer out there, and they expect you to have all these things in place. They want the product to be all those things, with an entry-level price point, and a cool look and feel. They want it all. And that generation is growing up, they've got more spending power, and those are the brands that they're looking for. So I think it's a super exciting time. Leila - What tools and techniques do you use to educate consumers? Annie - We want our sales associates to know our brands intimately, so we spend most of our time on education, in terms of brand and product knowledge, but also on what our standards are. Leila - In a previous interview, you talked about moving ""beyond clean beauty"", can you explain what you mean by this? Annie - It's really about moving beyond the restricted substance list, and understanding that the customer has embraced a much more holistic view of what clean or green beauty means to them. It involves packaging, people, ethics… just real transparency. I can say from experience that Beauty is a pretty opaque industry, and it's not inherently forthcoming about what's in products, and who the people are that these brands are working with. By no means does Credo have everything figured out perfectly, but we're digging into things that should be very transparent to the customer. That's what people expect today. When I was talking about going beyond clean, it is because people tend to hear ""clean beauty"", and they just think of ingredients, and that's it. But we're embarking on meeting our first sustainable packaging milestone this year, where our brand partners needed to reach 50% or greater PCR content. We put that out in the universe in 2020 and that's where we've been spending most of our time. From an ingredients standpoint, it's much more cut and dry, like, do you have these ingredients, or don't you? But on the packaging front, it's really been us linking arms with our brand partners and saying, we got to do better. We have to at the end of the day. The reality is we're in an industry where we sell products, and so if you're going to do that then let's invest in things that are just better for people and the planet."
"""Coty brought perfume into the modern age"", Jean Holtzmann, CBO, Coty","Premium Beauty News - How do you define the notions of boldness and innovation at Coty? Jean Holtzmann - This year, Coty is celebrating 120 years of unique expertise in the perfume market. It is worth remembering that it was Coty that really brought perfume into the modern age. By combining the first synthetic molecules with the finest ingredients of natural origin, Coty unleashed creativity, opening up new, yet unexplored olfactory territories. Coty's Ambre Antique (1905) or Chypre (1917) fragrances are at the origin of two of the largest contemporary olfactory families, which now account for almost two-thirds of the women's fine fragrance segment in key markets: the oriental-amber family and the Chypre family. Our extraordinary heritage has never ceased to guide us in innovation, and we express it through the creativity and boldness of our fragrance formulas. Since then, Coty has always endeavoured to create a portfolio of iconic fragrances, including CK One, Chloé Signature, Gucci Bloom, Boss Bottled, and the very recent Burberry Goddess, which stands out with its three powerful vanillas. More than ever, the launch of Infiniment Coty Paris reflects our vision of tomorrow's perfumery, where nature, science and art intertwine to reinvent the exceptional heritage on which we and the entire industry are founded. Premium Beauty News - Why choose a bold formula? Jean Holtzmann - At Coty, innovation is present throughout the value chain of perfume creation. In the formulas, of course, and in the quality of the juices developed by our olfactory studio and the greatest noses on the market: they can render into scent the great aspirations that run through society, while revealing the identity of each of our brands. Then comes the bottle, which mirrors the essence of our fragrances, as evidenced by La Rose Jacqueminot, Coty's first perfume (1904), sublimated in a magnificent Baccarat bottle; Chloé Signature, a glass representation of the fashion company's iconic pleated sunburst; or Daisy by Marc Jacobs, with its novel fantasy cap, shaped as daisy petals of different sizes. We are also working on bold campaigns in the vein of the group's raison d'être – Undefine Beauty – which are aimed to break free from beauty and olfactory archetypes, and in particular to review the very definition of the word ""beauty"" in dictionaries, to better reflect the deep aspirations of all individuals. The Goddess campaign, for Burberry's latest women's perfume, highlights a powerful, inspiring woman who is the subject of her own life. It is an eloquent illustration of this. Premium Beauty News - How do you work on innovation, in-house and with your suppliers? Jean Holtzmann - Innovation infuses each of Coty's high skills. Our collegial organization helps us anticipate and meet key consumer expectations, thanks to the constant interactions between each of our areas of expertise in perfume creation. It gives us great agility in managing projects and expressing our innovation. We collaborate and co-create with the best suppliers and partners to support the major stages of innovation. For example, thanks to our partnership with LanzaTech, we can now include alcohol derived from carbon capture in our fragrance portfolio. This strong commitment emphasizes the fact that sustainable development is a major driver of innovation. Premium Beauty News - How do you see the perfume market evolving? Jean Holtzmann - The fragrance market is in turmoil and the trend we call the ""Fragrance Effect"" at Coty is still going strong. The successive lockdowns have changed the game, and countries such as China, which until now was not a key perfume market, are becoming the new growth drivers. The market is becoming more premium. It is time to create powerful, signature, high-performance formulas. Perfume is also a vehicle for positive emotions in a difficult, often anxiety-provoking global context. Innovative, authentic, quality brands capable of positively fuelling the global conversation on this increasingly popular category will come out on top. Premium Beauty News - How does the use of recycled alcohol derived from converted carbon fit into the Coty portfolio? Jean Holtzmann - Innovation to transform CO2 emissions into ethanol, which we purify to add it to our fragrance formulas, is a technological revolution exclusive to the Coty Group. It is part of our Beauty that lasts sustainability roadmap. Today, the 14 fragrances of the Infiniment Coty brand, as well as Gucci The Alchemist's Garden's Where my heart beats perfume, contain 100% of recycled alcohol derived from this new technology. Within two years, the majority of Coty perfumes will incorporate this new ethanol, in part or in full. This is in response to consumer demand for increasingly environmentally-friendly products. Premium Beauty News - What about Molecular Aura, the technology behind the new Infiniment Coty Paris collection? Jean Holtzmann - Infiniment Coty Paris, the group's new eponymous high perfumery brand, embodies all the great advances of Coty's research. For example, the fragrance formulas incorporate a new Coty patent-pending technology, Molecular Aura, which modifies the evaporation profile of raw materials and preserves the fragrance's character for up to 30 hours. Acting like a magnet, Molecular Aura slows down the disappearance of certain notes or intensifies others. A jasmine note will keep its fresh facets for longer, as if in full bloom. It is a radical change compared to the traditional definition of the ""olfactory pyramid"", and a new approach to composing with perfumers. Premium Beauty News - Do you think the perfume industry can reinvent itself through technological innovation? Jean Holtzmann - Coty has been revolutionizing the beauty industry for over a century. Proud of our pioneering and avant-garde spirit, we are convinced that passion and science are formidable levers of innovation. Thanks to our international R&D Centre of Excellence, based in Switzerland and focused on perfume, the Coty Group is pursuing its mission: constantly opening up new olfactory horizons. We are currently working on a wide range of subjects to meet the expectations of our consumers, always on the lookout for ever more innovative, high-performance, environmentally friendly fragrances. With over a century of expertise in perfumes, we are committed to being the most innovative olfactory creation platform on the market."
Eau Thermale Jonzac strengthens organic dermo-cosmetics positioning,"Driven by the dynamic hygiene and beauty market, which is particularly strong in pharmacy channels (+10.2% in value in 2023), and despite the slowdown in organic market sales, the Eau Thermale Jonzac brand has maintained its growth at +38% over the past five years, with a turnover of EUR 22 million – and forecasts predict EUR 40 million for 2027. Against this backdrop, the company is migrating its product offering towards the world of dermocosmetics, particularly in pharmacies. ""We have already embraced all the codes of dermocosmetics, and we are moving our shelf positioning from the organic to the dermocosmetics pharmacy departments"", says Sales Director Elie Saad. ""Dermatologists are much reassured to know there is an offering that provides the same efficacy and safety as other dermocosmetics brands, but with an extra argument, that of naturalness. That is what is driving pharmacists to make a change to their shelves"", continues Fanny Spriet, Cosmetics Communications Director. Eau Thermale Jonzac currently has 1,600 pharmacies as part of the 4,000 points of sale in its distribution network in France, and aims to reach 3,000 within the next two years. The brand's positioning combines three key elements: the Jonzac thermal spring water and its skin benefits, naturalness, with 99% of ingredients of natural origin and an organic certification, and the codes of dermocosmetics. And to be even more in tune with this world, they started to revamp the visual identity in 2023. ""We wanted to boost the perception of our technical expertise and efficacy through recognized market codes to fully express our dermocosmetics positioning"", says Fanny Spriet. The new product design is currently being rolled out across all ranges and comes with a revamping of the communication visuals. ""We still have plenty of potential to increase the brand's visibility and recruit new consumers, in particular through investment in communications"", adds the Director. Over the past 13 years, the brand has developed ranges for all types of skin problems, including skin repair and atopic conditions. It has also positioned itself in the anti-ageing segment with the Sublimactive range, created in 2012 and now completely revamped, with new formulas and test results. The concept of the 2024 version of the Sublimactive range is based on a dual action on both wrinkles and the microbiome, through a patented complex, the thermal microbiome, combining a postbiotic contributing to the skin's microbial balance, lactobacillus acidophilus, and Jonzac thermal spring water, as well as a red algae with anti-wrinkle functions. The Sublimactive routine is made up of six products: a serum, a rich cream, a light cream, a night cream, an eye contour cream, and micellar water in small and large sizes, with prices ranging from EUR 3.90 to EUR 33.90 for the Concentrated Firming Serum, a new product in the range. The launch will be supported by a series of actions in pharmacies, as well as a TV and digital campaign, starting from April 23rd. Currently present in 29 countries, mainly in Europe, Eau Thermale Jonzac, which currently generates less than 10% of its turnover outside France, aims to conquer new markets. ""As part of our strategy, it is a very important area of development for the next three to ten years, because this offering has a lot of potential, in particular in Asia"", remarks Fanny Spriet. Some of the references were launched a few weeks ago in the United States. ""While our domestic ambitions are 10% a year, we are aiming for 30% to 35% globally, so we should reach approximately 9 to 10 million over the next seven or eight years"", concludes Elie Saad."
Evoluderm celebrates 20th anniversary and transitions towards naturalness,"Premium Beauty News - In 20 years, Evoluderm has become a leading brand in the affordable hygiene and beauty industry. What is the recipe for success? Gabriel Aiach - Since we founded Evoluderm in 2004, our top priority has remained unchanged: offering consumers French hygiene and beauty products at reasonable prices. We achieve this by optimizing all purchases: raw materials, packaging, a limited number of suppliers, etc. And we innovate! Evoluderm now counts over 225 products, divided into four categories – hair, face, body, and baby – and structured around key ingredients. In 2006, we launched our argan range and its shampoo, which is one of our best-sellers now. In 2014, to speed up the pace of our launches, we set up our own R&D laboratory, which we expanded in 2023. Then, 2015 saw the arrival of our micellar waters. Today, we sell one every 30 seconds worldwide. In 2020, during the pandemic, we made a major contribution to the production of hand sanitizer gels. Finally, in 2023, we launched our first serums, including the vitamin C serum, which was the fifth best-selling serum at the end of the year. Lastly, as soon as 2019, we decided to provide consumers with the naturalness rate of our products. By 2025, we intend to offer at least 95% of ingredients of natural origin in 90% of our formulas. In addition, since 2020, 85% of our catalogue has been vegan, and we aim for 100% by 2025. Premium Beauty News - How are you going to celebrate the brand's 20th anniversary? Nathalie Aiach - Evoluderm's 20th anniversary is a great celebration that will take place throughout 2024. We have created a special logo that can be found on our communication materials. Until the end of the year, our eight bestsellers will be adorned with illustrations featuring Evoluderm women. Our advertizing campaign will start in April with a TV ad, followed by a poster campaign in Paris, in the metro and on buses, during the first half of 2024. We are currently finalizing the logistics for our flagship event: it will involve setting up trailers in different parts of Paris to meet our consumers. We also want to open the company's doors, so they can see behind the scenes how their favourite products are made. Premium Beauty News - What does Evoluderm have in store for us in terms of product launches? Nathalie Aiach - At Cosmoprof, we showcased our brand new vitamin C range consisting of a serum released last year, a micellar water, a fabric mask, a cleansing gel and a micellar foam with a brush applicator. We are also expanding our Monoi range with two products much popular among our most loyal customers: a pure oil and an after-sun balm. In addition, we have been working hard on a format that we did not previously offer: our skincare sets will be available in April 2024 from our supermarket partners. We have designed some superb displays to show them off. We have also developed ""ready-to-sell"" displays for our 30-ml hand creams in pharmacies. Ultimately, we cannot wait to tell you about the launch of a new range in a completely new segment. It is planned for 2025. Premium Beauty News - What are your next goals in terms of growth? Gabriel Aiach - In 2023, Evoluderm generated 37% of its turnover in France, in supermarkets and pharmacies, with the latter accounting for 10% of the overall turnover. In addition, 15% of our sales in France are achieved online, on our website launched in 2019 and on several marketplaces. We want to strengthen our presence on the global level. We are distributed in over 30,000 points of sale worldwide. Our number one export market, the United States, is our priority, along with Europe. We have been negotiating to integrate two major retail chains in the UK, and we aim to cross the borders with our German and Italian neighbours. That is a real challenge for us. We would also like to set out again to conquer Asia, where we were starting to be well-established, particularly in China and South Korea, before the pandemic. To achieve this, we need to continue to expand our teams, particularly our sales force, as well as our industrial equipment. Within the next two years, we want our turnover to exceed 50 million and, within five years, we aim to double that figure."
"""Safe, Sustainable, Sensational,"" Essentia Beauty's innovation credo","As pioneers in full-service beauty solutions 25 years ago, what are our main strengths today? Katia de Martino - From our earliest beginnings, Essentia Beauty has remained true to its mission: to develop distinct concepts aligned with the DNA of our clients' brands while meeting the real expectations of consumers. For Essentia, this means investing upstream in R&D to anticipate innovations that can meet market expectations for each brand. While packaging producers and formula manufacturers have more recently started offering full service, Essentia on the other hand was born as an authentic full-service provider. This means that we have adapted to handle all stages of development and guarantee quality and consistency at every step. One of our pillars is to involve the quality team at the beginning of development to ensure 360° compliance, anticipate potential quality risks, and maintain control of lead times. Last but not least, our selected and qualified manufacturing network capabilities deliver responsive and flexible solutions, seamlessly scaling from low MOQs of 5K to high unit production runs of 500K+, according to customer demand. Additionally, we co-invest with some of our manufacturing partners on processes, certifications, and product innovations based on our analysis of market needs. With our recent exclusive partnership with MAD, an Italian specialist in fashion accessory decoration, we leverage their exceptional know-how to propose special effects on cosmetic packaging, allowing us to offer amazing three-dimensional materials and textures that we've given an original name to: Metamorphosis, signifying a groundbreaking potential for transforming standard packaging. What is your response to increasing demands for sustainability? Katia de Martino - To optimize the environmental impact of a product, Essentia advocates for a global approach. Providing solutions with genuine ecological value requires consideration of both how the consumer uses a product and its life cycle. Take makeup palettes as an example; they are increasingly popular but generate significant waste because once the consumer has used its favorite colors, these palettes quickly become unusable. That's why we came up with the idea of our patent slide palette features, which have two refillable pans, each containing 3 to 5 eyeshadow colors. Consumers can easily refill the colors they use most and change out the products in line with trends. What's essential is to bring added value to consumers who are concerned by ecology but are not willing to sacrifice functionality and aesthetic appeal. Our positioning and extensive experience in full service allow us to deliver solutions considering the finished product and its manufacturing process, formula, packaging, and filling. The objective is to provide efficient solutions that meet consumer expectations while lowering the environmental impact of both content and containers. Essentia has been an early promoter of refill systems. How do you continue to step up in this regard? Katia de Martino - We still believe that refill systems are the best solution considering the low percentage of the current effective recycled parts of packaging. The success of refill depends on different equations for each product category and can be complex for brands to manage. Refill should be an easy best choice for makeup products, which unfortunately have one of the lowest recycling rates. Now that many kinds of packaging formats exist, the challenge is to encourage consumers to buy refills. This ethical positioning can help encourage brand loyalty in the long run. To achieve this, we work on both functional solutions that are easily implemented as refills and on eco-desirability that transforms packaging into an object of desire, encouraging consumers to keep and refill it and thus giving it a second life. Our patented Slide palette, for example, has a removable lid that customers can choose when they purchase and renew as they wish, just like a cellphone case. The aim is to preserve the aesthetic appeal without having to change the whole palette, as well as to introduce personalization options, which has steadily become an important consumer expectation, especially in the luxury sector. How do you foresee the future of beauty? Katia de Martino - I believe that we have a duty to help evolve the mindset at all levels; a lot of players are willing and ready to change, but it is very complex because the market is fueled by a continuous flow of new products. We must preserve market dynamics but by responding more to consumer expectations. For this we should invert the development process, starting from their needs as the main driver of innovation. This is what we did for OZMEE, the brand incubated by Essentia, which addressed the need of consumers to identify the right mascara for their eye morphology based on real time, breakthrough digital technology. Indeed, personalization should be one of the main driver for conscious beauty as it has an undeniable positive impact on sustainability by reducing waste related to bad purchases."

"Ulike, the world leader of hair removal at home, expands in Europe","Founded 10 years ago, Chinese group Ulike soon conquered the Asian market by offering a unique home hair removal solution using Intense Pulsed Light (IPL). This top-of-the-range electrical device is claimed to offer safe, high-performance, precise application. ""Every year, we developed a new, more powerful, better-designed generation, as Apple did with the iPhone, for example. And it is now the 6th generation. This helped us get 70% market shares in China and 50% in South Korea. In North America, where we have been present for two years, the brand quickly got ranked number one"", says Wanfen Xia, Director Europe and Middle East. Ulike's success is based on a patented skin cooling technology called Sapphire Ice Cooling, which guarantees the safety and efficacy of hair removal. The synthetic sapphire and its system diffuse the pulsed light and disintegrate the hair bulb, while dissipating the heat with a cooling effect. ""The aim is to bring professional quality to your home"", notes the Director. ""We are the only brand to integrate this salon technology into a small machine. Thanks to our sapphire part, which has very low thermal conductivity, the temperature on the skin surface is maintained at 20°C, whereas it can go up to 70°C with other devices"", she adds. In recent years, Ulike achieved a strong turnover growth, reaching EUR 1.3 billion in 2023. There are now three brands: Ulike accounts for half of the sales volume, Gemo has adopted a high-end, anti-ageing positioning based on the radiofrequency technology, with products between EUR 1,200 and EUR 1,600, and Jmoon offers more affordable hair removal and anti-ageing devices for a younger public. Since 2023, it has been present on the European market with the Ulike long-lasting hair removal device, priced between EUR 300 and EUR 400. The group counts 1,800 employees worldwide, with four factories and two R&D centers, a team of 44 researchers and more than 300 innovation patents. 30% of annual profits are invested in R&D. ""The aim is to cover Europe as a whole, focusing on three key countries, i.e. France, the UK, and Germany, to reach the third rank by the end of 2024, with a sales target of EUR 50 million. We have set up a multi-channel distribution strategy, because as a beauty tech expert, it is important to get to department stores and beauty chain stores to strengthen our positioning"", says Wanfen Xia. For the time being, the Ulike Air 2 and Air 3 IPL hair removal devices are available from the brand's official website and from Amazon. The group aims to be soon available in large specialist stores, such as Darty, Fnac and Boulanger in France, as well as on platforms like VeePee and Showroom Privé. The partnership signed with DFS Travel Retail, owned by LVMH, led to a presence in the Hong Kong Beauty Collection area last December, and Macao will soon follow, while a pop-up at La Samaritaine is being discussed in the near future. ""Our job consists in differentiating channels with different products and offerings"", specifies the Director. To establish its own credibility, Ulike will invest two million euros in a communication campaign in France, including TV advertising, PR, and the digital channel, and 10 million in Germany and the UK."
An experiential café for the launch of Nina Ricci's new fragrance,"Launched at the end of February 2024, Nina Illusion eau de parfum follows on from the original Nina fragrance created by Olivier Cresp in 2006. For this new take, the dsm-firmenich Master Perfumer, in collaboration with Nicolas Bonneville, created a floral, fruity and chypre juice. This sparkling version combines yuzu, orange blossom, pink pepper, raspberry, vanilla, and patchouli. This vegan fragrance contains 90% natural ingredients and includes upcycled lemon. Since its creation, the Nina fragrance has been revisited several times through multiple interpretations: Le Paradis in 2010, La Tentation in 2014, Les Délices in 2015, Les Gourmandises in 2017... In 2019, it was associated with the launch of Bella and Luna, in a conniving trio. In 2024, Nina Illusion wants to explore another facet of its universe and encourage people to live life to the fullest. The opening of the Nina Illusion Café in the heart of Paris is part of this seductive strategy. The Nina Illusion apple-shaped bottle features shades of iridescent pink, a special grade of glass developed by Verescence. It boasts 20% recycled glass and the case is made from FSC-certified paper. Designed in 2006, the Nina bottle was inspired by Nina Ricci's legacy, and more specifically by the perfume Fille d'Ève dating from 1952, which refers to the forbidden fruit of a lost paradise. Nina adopted this symbolic shape for the bottle. For Nina Illusion, the metal jewel tied around the cap was created in collaboration with jewellery artist Hugo Kreit. This accessory can be worn as a ring or bracelet. An eye-catching piece that appeals to Gen Z. ""I like the fact that the apple is present in so many different ways. We have created a gem in the image of a universal flower that graces the bottle. It is very fluid, very contemporary,"" explains Harris Reed, Nina Ricci's new Artistic Director. A 300 m2 pop-up café decorated in the colours of the bottle opened its doors from 7 to 10 March under the Canopée des Halles, a major passageway and shopping area in Paris. This immersive, highly Instagrammable space offered a range of experiences. In partnership with EL&N the London patisserie shop, the pop-up café proposed - among other delights - signature drinks and an exclusive sweet in the shape of an apple. A ""locker game"" allowed visitors to win perfume or fashion gifts (berets, T-shirts, tote bags...) after subscribing to a newsletter. An olfactory discovery display was set up at the entrance, opposite a giant Nina Illusion bottle. There was also an engraving workshop where visitors could personalise the perfume bottle available in the Séphora partner shop opposite. Finally, an ""Infinity Room"" allowed visitors to immortalise their journey through an endless game of mirrors, and to post their impressions on social networks using the hashtag #NINAILLUSION. Around the apple-shaped bottle, a core element of every advertising campaign since 2006, Nina Ricci has built a fairytale-like storytelling underpinned by the duality of innocence/transgression, and candour/temptation. These codes are aimed at young girls ready to make their mark and are personified by ingenuously seductive muses. The price positioning of Nina Illusion eau de parfum is in line with the purchasing power of this target, with an entry price of 70 euros for 30 ml. Similarly, the prices of the treats in the pop-up café have been deliberately kept down. The new campaign, shot at the Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte, France, features actress Kiernan Shipka as she goes after the coveted bottle as if in a dream. She is wearing a dress designed by Harris Reed and the bottle's flower jewel. The atmosphere is poetic but moves away from fairytales. A subtle evolution. The Maison Nina Ricci (fashion and fragrance), owned by Puig, the Spanish Group, has refocused on two fragrance franchises: L'Air du Temps and Nina. The Nina line currently includes Nina Illusion, Nina Le parfum, Nina L'eau de toilette and the versions Nina Rouge and Nina Extra Rouge. L'Air du Temps, launched in 1948 just after the war, has retained the shape of Lalique's original bottle, which features two intertwined doves, symbols of love and peace. The fragrance still has a loyal customer base in the older age bracket. Every year, Nina Ricci releases a new edition in collaboration with an artist. This year, at the end of March/beginning of April, a bottle adorned with delicate golden flowers created by Anne Brun will mark the launch of the fragrance, revisited by Givaudan's Perfumer Sonia Constant."
Granado opens its first store in New York and focuses on perfume,"In the global beauty and personal care market, companies are constantly challenged to innovate, adapt, and grow amidst fierce competition. Among these contenders is Granado, an iconic Brazilian brand that has not only stood the test of time but has also carved a niche for itself in an increasingly crowded market, appealing to consumers looking for products with a sense of history and authenticity. In 2023, the group achieved a record turnover of BRL 1.4 billion (approximately EUR 333 million euros or USD 360), an increase of almost 35% compared to 2022. Behind this success, a father-daughter duo: Christopher Freeman, CEO, and Sissi Freeman, marketing and sales director. The first bought the brand in 1994 from the last heir of the Granado family, the second joined the company in 2005. With the help of a French consultant, they renovated the identity of the sleeping beauty by building upon its heritage, developed new lines and opened their first own stores in Brazil. They implemented a similar strategy with Phebo, a historic perfume brand, originally from the north of the country, that was acquired in 1998. Today, Phebo accounts for 40% of net sales. The group's retail footprint spans 93 stores in Brazil, including 4 Phebo outlets, and 7 international locations, the last of which was inaugurated in New York on February 2, in midtown Manhattan on Madison Avenue. However, if store openings enabled the brand to reconnect with its identity, to diversify its offering and move upmarket, the major part of its sales are made in drugstores and supermarkets in Brazil, where Granado is renowned for its soaps, toiletries and body care products. Entering into the perfume category was part of this diversification and upscaling strategy. In a very competitive Brazilian market, the brand opted for quality, choosing to macerate their fragrances, which was not a widespread practice in Brazil. The company has collaborated with foreign perfumers to create innovative fragrance, garnering attention from both existing and new consumers in Brazil and abroad. A profitable strategy since perfumes already represent 24% of sales in the brand's own stores. Perfumes also lead sales in stores outside Brazil. ""This led us to rethink our concept of international stores, to give more space to this category,"" Sissi Freeman told Premium Beauty News. At the end of 2023, Granado reopened its first Parisian boutique, in the Marais district, after renovation work intended to enhance its lines of perfume and scented candles in a vintage universe mixing Art-Deco and a tropical atmosphere. ""While international sales are still a fraction of our global turnover, we see a huge potential for the brand. International expansion helped us to wider our mind with collaborations that were also instrumental in Brazil,"" highlighted the Marketing and Sales Director. ""For instance, thanks to our collaboration with French perfumer Cécile Zaorkian, we were able to develop a fragrance with coconut notes that appealed to both Brazilian and international consumers,"" she continued. In an ever-changing market landscape and international expectations that differ from those of its domestic market, Granado chose to innovate and introduce new products continuously while staying true to its roots. So far, it proved to be a recipe for success!"
"Infiniment Coty Paris, how Coty combines innovation and luxury perfumery","The Infiniment Coty Paris brand was born from the vision of two creators, Sue Nabi, CEO of the Coty Group, and Nicolas Vu, Founder of the ultra-luxury skincare brand Orveda. A duo with a passion for the world of beauty. African-born Sue, is a keen scientist, who aspires to create a ""desirable future"". Nicolas, Asian-born and steeped in urban culture, places the socio-cultural dimension at the heart of his creative thinking. Rather than a heritage range of re-editions, Sue Nabi and Nicolas Vu wanted to launch a brand in its own right. A collection inspired by the pioneering spirit of François Coty to lay the foundations for the ""perfumery of a new era"". So it's no coincidence that this collection is being launched on the 120th anniversary of Coty, whose legendary creations have shaped modern perfumery, sublimating natural ingredients with the help of synthetic molecules that were new at the time, in particular the famous Chypre (1917), which gave birth to the chypre olfactory family. The creator also elevated the container to the level of art, with bottles designed as beauty objects. It is from this visionary spirit that Infiniment Coty Paris now takes its name, ""with a new generation of fragrances whose longevity and sillage have been augmented by science."" This new brand is the result of a three-year collaboration exchange between Sue Nabi, Nicolas Vu and the perfumers at dsm-firmenich, Symrise and IFF. Guided by the expertise of Séverine Dallet, Senior Manager Fragrance Design at Coty, this work has resulted in a range of fourteen fragrances with evocative names: Entre Genres, Les Mots Doux, Soleil d'Ikosim, Matin de Jade, Après l'Amour... Ultra-concentrated [1], the fourteen fragrances feature a new process that enhances the olfactory effect of certain ingredients over time. This innovation is called Aura Moléculaire, a fragrance diffusion technology based on a sugar-derived molecule that acts on the volatility and natural evaporation of ingredients. According to Coty, the molecule interacts like a magnet with a significant proportion of olfactory ingredients to modify their evaporation profile. As a result, these ingredients remain perceptible for a much longer time, beyond their natural volatility. This innovation means, for example, that the presence of jasmine absolute in a fragrance can be stretched into base notes, as in Les Mots Doux, where the fresh, floral and petal-like facet of jasmine extends well beyond the heart notes. Coty also points out that Aura Moléculaire prolongs the radiance of top notes for up to 30 hours. This new technology challenges the traditional codes of formulation. To make the most of it, the perfumer no longer uses the head-heart-base structure, but instead focuses on specific facets of a formula. Like the floral notes at the heart, or the woody-amber notes at the base. Aura Moléculaire encourages perfumers to work with ingredients differently, to achieve a new balance. Since 2018, Coty has filed several patents for Aura Moléculaire. A patent has also been filed for the use of this technology for Infiniment Coty Paris. The collection is divided into three phases, from the freshest to the most intense fragrances: Aube, Jour and Crépuscule. It's a way of covering a broad olfactory spectrum and, of course, embracing the olfactory habits of Gen Z, who appreciate having a specific fragrance for different times of the day. For this collection designed by Symrise, dsm-firmenich and IFF, Coty has benefited from the technological innovations and eco-responsible materials of each of the fragrance houses. The fourteen fragrances in the collection explore or revisit perfumery standards. Like the bouquet of white flowers in Mots Doux, where the freshness of jasmine lingers on for hours. Or the solar orange blossom of Soleil d'Ikosim, where an SFE absolute, refreshed with neroli, settles on a woody base with gourmand and almond accents. Aristochypre returns to the chypre register, where delicate patchouli blends with rose and geranium. L'Amour Pourpre revisits the fougère accord in a sensual style, with lavender Diva hemmed in with balms, vanilla and incense. Finally, Après l'Amour plays an intimate card with a warm, amber tobacco note, conjuring up the image of a shared cigarette. For this collection, Coty has given priority to minimalist formulas, with no added colouring agents or UV filters. Furthermore, the Infiniment Coty Paris collection is made entirely from 100% carbon-captured and recycled alcohol, using a tried and tested process developed by LanzaTech. As part of an eco-responsible approach, Coty has chosen to fit this collection with bottles that should not be thrown away. Endlessly refillable, the bottle is designed to be kept, never thrown away. A hymn to minimalism, conceived and designed by Nicolas. Extremely complex to create, with a perfectly flat asymmetrical face on one side and bold facets on the other, it captures the spirit of the entire collection. At the end of their life, the bottles can be stacked and assembled to create works of art, in line with an Artcycling concept for which a patent application has also been filed. The range was presented to the public at an international launch in Paris on 2 March. Each fragrance is available for 230 euros for a 75 ml bottle and 330 euros for 150 ml refills."
"With the global birth rate falling, Mustela continues to reposition itself","""With 94% of parents surveyed saying they are familiar with the brand and 50% saying they use it, [2] Mustela is seen by consumers as an expert brand in the hygiene and care of babies and children,"" explains Clémence Ménez, Mustela Marketing Director, France. ""The brand's two flagship products, the Gentle Cleansing Gel for Babies and Children and the Cleansing Water, recorded strong growth in 2023, with an increase in value of +11% for the first and +13% for the second, in a shrinking French market,"" she continues. Today, the brand wants to capitalise on its expertise in infant skin care to build a family-friendly cosmetics range. ""That's what we've achieved with our suncare range designed for the whole family, from babies to parents, grandparents as well as children. Consumers trust Mustela, as the figures show."" Indeed, despite stiffer competition in the suncare market, Mustela recorded growth of +33% (editor's note: compared with +23% for the global market). ""The excellent ratings of our suncare products on apps such as Yuka and INCI Beauty, as well as in the specialist consumer press (UFC-Que Choisir and 60 Millions de Consommateurs) have reinforced this confidence, as well as brand loyalty and preference. In addition, we have taken strong initiatives, such as the decision to definitively stop producing wipes in 2027, which illustrate our desire to be ever more transparent and respectful of the environment. In the meantime, we are launching a range of certified compostable wipes scheduled for the first quarter of 2024, to offer a cleaner than ever before solution,"" states Clémence Ménez. At the heart of the brand's repositioning strategy, the suncare offer will be supported by a rather unexpected launch for the second quarter of 2024: a sunglass collection for young and old (editor's note: four sizes, in three colours, will be offered from babies to adults). ""Launched last year by our Spanish subsidiary, this range, designed and produced by the Parafina company and branded Mustela, has been very well received by Spanish consumers. These eco-friendly glasses are made from recycled rubber from tyres, giving them excellent flexibility and resistance, which can prove very practical with small children. We plan to roll them out to 1,500 pharmacies in France by 2024. We're convinced that this type of offering, which is seldom seen in pharmacies today, has a real place, as long as it's backed up by sound advice from the pharmacist,"" explains Clémence Ménez. The mosquito repellent range launched two years ago was a runaway success in its first year, selling out after just three weeks on the market. ""This clearly shows that parents are interested in anti-mosquito products that are suitable for the whole family, including infants. I think they've found the reassuring response they needed in Mustela,"" pointed out Clémence Ménez. The Stelatopia range for atopic skin is also a fine example of the development of a family range; atopy being generally hereditary. This range grew by 14% last year, compared with 12% for the French market. ""Finally, we are committed to continuing to support and develop our zero waste offer with our reusable eco wipes, our universal balm, our eco-refill washing gel and our solid shampoo, to name but a few. These products aim to build the future of the brand and gently guide consumers towards changes in habits that are sometimes very entrenched."" Mustela's products are now available in more than 10,000 French pharmacies and it partners with a large number of maternity clinics and independent midwives. The CSR innovations aimed at these partners, mainly pharmacies, focus above all on the deployment of furniture to display the brand's bulk and zero waste offering. The bulk offer is split into two experiments. The first is the ""Pharma-Recharge"" consortium, which brings together five French dermo-cosmetics laboratories and which currently has five display units in France. Secondly, the Mustela bulk unit, currently present in 16 sales outlets. The latter aims to ensure the animation and follow-up of the points of sale already equipped and the training of teams. An Engagement unit was created in 2023 to promote the zero waste range. It can now be found in sixty pharmacies. ""Through it, sales outlets show their awareness and commitment to more sustainable and respectful products,"" emphasises Clémence Ménez. Mustela's social commitment was beefed up in 2023 through its collaboration with Enfance et Partage, an association for the protection and defence of children victims of violence. This year, the brand is supporting an awareness-raising campaign on the shaken baby syndrome. In addition to France, its largest market, Mustela is of course also replicating the transformation of its product range throughout the world. The brand now generates 75% of its sales outside France, with a presence in around a hundred countries via its fifteen subsidiaries or distributors. The family offer is being rolled out more widely in promising markets such as Turkey, South America, and Asia."
FRP takes swift action to restructure The Body Shop in the UK,"Nearly 500 people working in stores of the British cosmetics chain The Body Shop will be made redundant in the United Kingdom, announced the administrators of the failed company. Some 75 stores will close within 6 weeks in the country, in addition to 7 closures already announced last week. FRP Advisory, responsible for the restructuring, had already announced the elimination of 270 positions at the London headquarters, tallying the total expected redundancies in the UK between 750 and 800. The company employed around 7,000 people worldwide before filing for bankruptcy, including 2,200 in the United Kingdom. ""After years of unprofitability and following a full evaluation of The Body Shop's UK business, ... administrators have concluded that the current store portfolio mix is no longer viable,"" said FRP in a statement last week. It added that ""a reduced store footprint, will coincide with a renewed focus on the brand's products, online sales channels and wholesale strategies,... supporting a return to financial stability."" In total, 116 stores will remain open out of the 198 that the chain had before filing for bankruptcy in the United Kingdom [1]. ""In taking swift action to right-size The Body Shop UK store portfolio, we have stabilised the business and are providing the best opportunity for this iconic brand to have a long-term, sustainable future. The UK business continues to trade in administration, and we remain fully focused on exploring all options to take the business forward,"" stated Tony Wright of FRP Advisory. These job cuts and the restructuring plan led by FRP only concern the United Kingdom and not the rest of the brand's global network. But since its takeover by Aurelius, several loss-making subsidiaries in Europe and Asia have been sold, many of which have also been declared bankrupt. The Body Shop was founded in 1976 in Brighton (south of England) by British entrepreneur Anita Roddick. L'Oréal bought the brand in 2006 for around 940 million euros, when it was at the height of its fame, before selling it in 2017 to the Brazilian group Natura. Highly in debt after having also acquired Avon in 2019 and hit hard by the rise in interest rates, Natura sold The Body Shop at the end of 2023 for a fifth of the price paid to L'Oréal."
ISDIN banks on daily sun protection to accelerate its growth,"Born in Barcelona under the warm Mediterranean sun, ISDIN aims to establish itself as a force to be reckoned with in the field of sun protection and skin health. Founded in 1975 as a joint venture between the pharmaceutical laboratory Esteve and the Spanish cosmetics giant Puig, the brand now has 15 subsidiaries around the world, a footprint in 59 countries and is enjoying exponential growth. ""Our goal is to continue growing at a double-digit pace in 2024,"" explains Stéphanie Barbier, Global Corporate Marketing Director. ISDIN is making its mark in South America, where it is the market leader in Argentina and Peru. It has also won over Brazil, where it markets the country's best-selling suncare product. Established a few years ago in the United States (online and at dermatologists) and in China (Tmall and specialised chains), the brand is beginning to make inroads in these difficult markets, which are keen to see new products. In Europe, ISDIN is the leader in suncare in Spain and is rapidly gaining recognition outside its domestic market, in particular by partnering with major sporting events, in keeping with its outdoor culture. France, Italy, and Germany are top priorities. The brand intends to build on the benefits of daily UV protection and capitalise on the sensoriality of its textures. ""The links between skin ageing and sun exposure are well established, but there is still a lot of work to be done to raise awareness of the importance of a regular photoprotection routine. Our sunscreen products were completely reformulated in 2023, and we have done a lot of work to create unique, light, non-sticky textures that are outstandingly sensorial,"" stresses Éric Jourdan, Global Corporate Innovation & Development Director. Some new products should help to sustain growth in 2024. After revamping its best-seller FusionWater Magic, with a new combination of sunscreens enriched with an antioxidant micro-algae extract from the Mediterranean, ISDIN will be unveiling FusionWater Magic Glow, an SPF 30 UV filter offering optimum daily protection with an instant radiant glow thanks to a formula enriched with micas. This year, ISDIN is also introducing its very first suncare stick, the result of a complex development, because the brand wanted to combine a high level of protection with its signature sensorial appeal. Finally, the Spanish brand is also expanding its expert Fotoultra line, dedicated to people whose exposure to the sun requires a specific response, with two new products: Fotoultra Redness, for skin with rosacea redness, and Fotoultra Stop Prevent Color, a tinted version of its protector dedicated to preventing pigmentation spots. At the same time, ISDIN is carrying out some awareness-raising campaigns on the importance of photoprotection - in schools in Spain and South America, and on tennis courts with athletes and spectators at major world tournaments - to help eradicate skin cancer. ISDIN, the only Spanish laboratory with B Corp certification, is also involved in many environmental protection initiatives, including a programme to clean up the Mediterranean Sea, in partnership with NGOs. ""Our commitment is to remove as much plastic from the sea as we put on the market with our FusionWater range,"" adds Stéphanie Barbier. As a result, 75 tonnes were removed from the oceans in 2023 and, given the success of the range, 200 tonnes should be extracted by 2024. These actions go hand in hand with major R&D initiatives: firstly, to reduce the use of plastic in packaging, by offering refill solutions (for anti-ageing ranges) and as much recyclable packaging as possible; and secondly, to limit the impact of formulas on the environment, by including an eco-toxicological analysis right from the development phase. ""We want to be a love brand, respected for our products and our actions,"" concludes the Marketing Director."
What is the outlook for The Body Shop after its sudden collapse?,"Last week's announcement that the UK arm of The Body Shop was going bankrupt came as a shock in the country, where the brand was founded almost 50 years ago. Since then, the bad news has continued. Some of The Body Shop's mainland European businesses have begun shutting down. The German stores has entered into administration and the Belgian, Luxembourg, Austrian and Irish subsidiaries might be next. If things are accelerating today, the difficulties are not new for the British channel. Founded in 1976 in Brighton, in the south of England, by entrepreneur Anita Roddick, the brand was a pioneer of environmentally friendly cosmetics, not tested on animals and a supporter of fair trade. But since then, the EU and many other countries have banned the testing of cosmetics on animals, natural or organic cosmetics brands have developed and innovative models focusing on solid products and packaging reduction have emerged. ""In the 1980s, The Body Shop was the place to go for young shoppers to splash out on fresh scented bubbles and beauty ranges, with a deep environmental conscience and a focus on social justice and conserving nature,"" Susannah Streeter, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown told AFP. In the meantime, competitors like Lush, L'Occitane, Neal's Yard, Aesop and a multitude of indie brands have shaken up its model and gained market share. Purchased by L'Oréal in 2006, when it was at a staple of beauty routines in many countries, the brand was acquired in 2017 by Brazil's Natura. However, the South American beauty giant then went on to buy Avon in 2019, a badly timed deal that left it with a hefty debt pile as the Covid pandemic hit and then interest rates began to rise around the world. When Natura decided to refocus on its Latin American business, buyers did not rush, despite a sale price significantly lower than what had been paid to L'Oréal. Indeed, at the time of the acquisition by Aurelius, The Body Shop had 2,500 stores in more than 70 countries, but many of these markets were unprofitable. According to people close to the matter interviewed by the Financial Times, despite significant losses in 2022, operations in the United Kingdom were deemed as the most attractive. Aurelius was also confident about businesses in Canada and Australia. However, damp revenues during the crucial festive period would have overturned the financial prospects, leading the UK business to the slide into administration! The investment firm would therefore have made a serious assessment error when acquiring The Body Shop. And Peter Wood, who was UK managing director of the firm, and the dealmaker behind Aurelius's acquisition of the brand has exited the business, The Telegraph reported. According to The Times, the German firm has solidified its position as the brand's top creditor before filing for bankruptcy. Shortly after buying the business, Aurelius made loans to the group that were secured against intellectual property assets and shares in its (profitable) Canadian arm. ""Just before Christmas, Aurelius released a statement saying they would 're-energise the business' and 'deliver the next chapter of success'. Less than three months later they are putting the brand into liquidation and look like they are first in line to be paid. Did they ever intend to grow the business?,"" questioned Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh. At the end of January, Aurelius announced the sale of part of The Body Shop's Europe and Asia business to what they described as a ""family office"", a term that usually refers to the management of personal wealth. The buyer appeared to be Alma24, a company that was incorporated on 25 January 2024 in London. According to information from The Guardian, Alma24 is controlled by Friedrich Trautwein, an executive who has close links to Aurelius. The exact scope of the acquisition has been the subject of conflicting information; subsidiaries in continental Europe and Ireland would be affected, as well as Japan. The latest news is that France was not included in the operation, for legal reasons. It is also unclear with the subsidiary in the Netherlands is included in the deal. Within subsidiaries in mainland Europe, the lack of transparency on strategy is rising concerns. ""Aurelius' approach to its investments, demonstrated by the recent swift liquidation of LloydsPharmacy in January 2024 - that was once the second biggest pharmacy chain in the UK - just two years after its acquisition, raises concern about a pattern of behaviour that suggests a preference for short-term profit strategies over the sustained stability of acquired enterprises,"" alerted a source pointing tactics that would aim to shift the cost of restructuring to public finances. In any case, the future of the retailer will be decided in the United Kingdom, where the company is headquartered, where are its roots and from where a large part of the products marketed by the subsidiaries around the world are delivered. The administrators from accounting firm FRP Advisory said they would ""consider all options to find a way forward for the business and will update creditors and employees in due course."" The mission of administrators is to assess the financial situation and offers from potential buyers in order to find the best options to save jobs, but they will particularly focus on ensuring as much money is recouped as possible to return to creditors. And it is not excluded that Aurelius buys back The Body Shop after having slimmed it down. According to sources familiar with the situation, the brand is expected to survive in some form, but with far fewer shops. Several branches are also expected to be closed, in particular in Europe."
Schwan Cosmetics combines makeup and skincare with new Glowy Blur Stick,"Launched at the MakeUp in LosAngeles trade show, which was held at the Los Angeles Convention Center on February, 14 & 15, the Glowy Blur Stick combines the benefits of a color cosmetic with advanced active skincare formulations, including ingredients such as jojoba and cocoa butter, and other moisturizing and skin-protecting components, such as hydrasalinol, ginger, sea asparagus, meadowfoam seed oil. ""The Glowy Blur stick is a great choice for makeup lovers who want a perfected look with minimal application hassle. You can use it flexibly as a concealer, highlighter, and for natural contouring. It's quick to blend in and does not feel heavy on the skin. The intensity is buildable – for no-makeup makeup days, you can add just a touch on the high points of your face for a little bit of luminosity, while for more of a statement look, you can dial up the glow much more,"" says Corinna Zeidler, Director, Brand Management at Schwan Cosmetics. The vegan Glow Blur Stick can be applied directly on the skin without any makeup tools. The product can be buffed out with a finger for a sheer to medium coverage result. The product can be manufactured in Schwan Cosmetics' US-based factory, and packaging formats for the North American market will be available. The Glowy Blur Stick is one of several innovations in the company's Color & Care strategy. Schwan Cosmetics says it will continue to include more advanced skincare ingredients as interest in multi-purpose products from both brands and consumers continues to rise. ""The demand for care ingredients in makeup has skyrocketed,"" says Stefanie Strittmatter, Director Global Category Management Lip at Schwan Cosmetics. ""With our Color & Care strategy, we want to demonstrate that with a robust scientific approach and advanced care ingredients, color cosmetics can achieve noticeable skincare results with the same level of efficacy as skin care products themselves,"" concludes Strittmatter."
How Scent of Africa is building a reputation in the global perfumery market,"""Through Scent of Africa, I wanted to pay tribute to Africa and its people,"" explains Tanal Ghandour, the brand's founder. Having lived in West Africa for 40 years, his dream was to celebrate the continent's generosity, to convey the strong sense of belonging, unique to the continent, and shared by its people. At a time when Africa is slowly opening up to niche perfumery - with the entry of brands such as Creed, Amouage and Mémo - the success of Scent of Africa testifies to its rise on the global perfumery scene. Africa has a thousand stories to tell, just like its olfactory terroirs, which Scent of Africa aims to highlight. Black pepper and vanilla from Madagascar, ginger from Nigeria, incense from Somalia, geranium and jasmine from Egypt... these raw materials are all well known to the perfume industry. While others are more rarely used, such as buchu leaves, from South Africa, whose minty, fruity, and sulphurous overtones could conjure up blackcurrant buds. A palette of iconic ingredients that form the backbone of the brand's first collection, Eternal Legends. A range that aims to be accessible, in a market where the big brands are extremely popular. Ultimately, however, Scent of Africa wants to explore more complex olfactory territories. Spices, African cuisine... This potential offers creative possibilities, and the brand is expected to unveil a second, more sophisticated collection in 2025, with a strong focus on African ingredients. A ""niche"" range, in short, that could also appeal to the more mature Western markets. The brand has taken a cultural approach, by supporting events such as the Paris Fashion Week last September. Indeed, local craftsmanship and Afrofuturism - the wind of creativity blowing through the world of fashion - brought to life by daring designers, are winning over fashion houses. Like the Chanel fashion show held in Dakar in December 2022. This dynamism is very present in the region's major cities - Lagos in Nigeria, Dakar in Senegal - and the brand aims to embody it through its trendy products. Because Scent of Africa aims to be a brand rooted in its time, nourished by the creativity of a young and dynamic population. ""Today, we're witnessing an explosion of localities,"" points out Stéphanie Gazel, the brand's Creative Director. ""Beauty is no longer just a Western phenomenon, it can also be Korean, Chinese, Arab or African."" The brand's first collection leaves room for diversity, to adapt to moods and contexts. The brand therefore favours several olfactory universes, chiselled by the leading fragrance houses. Eternal Legends explores African mythology, paying tribute to local divinities in a gendered range that expresses assertive femininity and masculinity. Driven by heady fragrances - a key marker in African culture - the collection is built around duos for men and women, the first of which, Rakh and Nefee, was launched in March 2022. Women's fragrances are dominated by floral and fruity accords. Like Laïka, the brand's best-seller, a fruity floral accord by Nathalie Cetto (Givaudan), featuring orange blossom refreshed with pomegranate and buchu leaves, on a creamy gourmand base. Then there is Nefee (Delphine Lebeau, IFF), in which tuberose, with a twist of red fruits, blends with amber notes in a sensual setting. The opulent trail offers definite freshness, like the floral bouquet with marine notes in Bellua, a nod to island Africa (Nelly Hachem-Ruiz & Delphine Lebeau, IFF). For men, the spicy, peppery notes are quite prominent. In a play of Hot and Cold by Olivier Pescheux (Givaudan), Rakh combines the biting freshness of pepper and pink berries, spiked with cloves, on a dry woody background. Hagé (Jordi Fernandez, Givaudan), with its strong black pepper note, is set against an amber, woody and leathery base. Bellua's masculine counterpart, Bezi, also features marine notes on a woody, mineral base (Olivier Pescheux & Jacques Huclier, Givaudan). At the end of April, Scent of Africa will launch a new duo, Fik, a tribute to the God of Heaven by Nelly Hachem-Ruiz (IFF) and Gleti, Goddess of the Moon (Julien Rasquinet). Today, the brand has developed mainly in Africa, where it reaches an audience of Millennials and trendsetters. The challenge for 2024 is the United States, a high-potential market for Scent of Africa. The brand will launch a second, more sophisticated range in 2025, the right timing to set foot in Europe."
BDK Parfums opens first store in Paris and consolidates brand identity,"312 Rue Saint-Honoré. David Benedek did not choose his store's address by chance: ""Back in 1959, my grandparents opened a perfume shop on the corner of Rue Saint-Honoré and Rue de la Paix. I am very proud and moved to be part of this family heritage"", he explains. The young entrepreneur is quick to point out his attachment to the world of perfume, which shaped his childhood, as well as to the central Palais Royal Parisian neighbourhood, where he set up his company's offices in 2016. Not far from there, the Benlux Louvre perfume shop at 174 Rue de Rivoli is part of this history. It is the story of a family saga that began two generations ago, when a couple of Romanian and Hungarian origin, David's grandparents, moved to France. The brand's first flagship store is thus taking root in a territory that is both familiar and the epicentre of the international clientele targeted. When it comes to the interior design, David Benedek gave their chance to two young architects, Arthur Blanche and Daniele Profita, for whom it was the first retail space concept. The glass front extends over two levels, flooding the interior space and its mezzanine with light. A combination of mineral materials, Burgundy stone and travertine creates a monochrome effect. Longitudinal shelves run the length of one wall, embodying the ""olfactory library"" concept dear to the company. ""We thought of it in terms of a living space, rather than a commercial area. The mezzanine is a place for conversation. And we have been thinking of organizing master classes that would bring together a perfumer and an artist"", reveals the managing director. Alexandra Carlin, who previously worked with the brand on Villa Néroli and Velvet Tonka – which won a Fragrance Foundation France Award in 2022 – supported David Benedek in creating the 312 Saint-Honoré perfume to celebrate the opening of the store. The result is a sensual, mineral, bright musk built on an original chord of woody and amber notes. ""The brief focused on the materials that make up the decoration of the venue. I wanted to use a palette of materials ranging from transparent to off-white and recreate this subtle mineral harmony of white tones. I built up a vertical composition that echoes the high ceilings. The other guiding principle we set ourselves was that of the cocoon: the store actually helps withdraw from the hustle and bustle of the neighbourhood to better connect with the fragrance. For this reason, priority was given to musk, because it is a material that relates to intimacy and to the skin"", emphasizes the Symrise perfumer. Artistic director David Benedek describes the new fragrance as follows: ""It is a comforting scent that anyone would like to smell on someone's neck. It is a rather abstract fragrance that stands out by its great delicacy and goes against what is expected in niche perfumery, whose proposals are often extreme. We are taking a conscious risk, given the type of clientele"". Trained at the well-known French fashion school Institut de la Mode and by Cinquième Sens, David Benedek was just 26 when he set about creating his own company. Here is how he laid the foundations: timelessly chic fragrances that tell a Parisian story, and a focus on beautiful materials. The collections (Parisienne and Matières) are structured around these two creative lines. The Azur collection, with its emphasis on citrus notes, and the Exclusive collection are built on these two pillars. The company currently offers 20 fragrances, as well as a collection of candles known as ""Les Nocturnes"" and a refined detergent water. Today, the bestseller is Gris Charnel, in its eau de parfum and extract versions composed by Mathilde Bijaoui (Mane). Next come Rouge Smoking by Amélie Bourgeois (Flair), and Pas ce Soir by Violaine Collas (Mane). Based in Paris, the company has selected only French partners to promote the excellence of its different skills. The iconic bevelled bottle is made in Normandy by Verreries Brosse. It owes its unique transparency to the re-burnt glass technique. The caps are developed in the Paris region by a traditional goldsmith and jeweller. Their shape is inspired by one of the most emblematic monuments on the Parisian Right Bank: the dome of the Grand Palais. The paper label is produced by the Bordeaux-based printing house New Darmon Étiquettes, and then affixed by hand to each bottle. Just like a book binding, the box is crafted by MPO, a family business based in the western region of Le Mans. Finally, the ink is of natural origin and the paper, dyed in the mass, is recycled. BDK Parfums currently counts 500 points of sale, exports to 58 countries, and employs 16 people."

The products are paired with Aptar's premium packaging solutions."
"""Skin is the mirror of our overall health,"" Barbara Paldus, Codex Labs","Premium Beauty News - After having spent more than twenty years in Silicon Valley, creating two technology companies and registering 40 patents, you decided to venture into cosmetics in 2019. How did an electrical and electronic engineering graduate from Stanford University come to this? Barbara Paldus - Because it was possible to innovate! It was my son, who was ten at the time, who sparked my interest in mainstream skincare products, as he was allergic to many of them. I looked into the matter and discovered that the problem was caused by a preservative: phenoxyethanol. As I continued my research, I discovered that the use of many preservatives could, more generally, upset the balance of the skin microbiome. This is how I came up with the idea of creating a cosmetic biotechnology brand dedicated to supporting the microbiome. I started looking for a skincare brand to take over and chose the Irish company Bia. That is how the Codex Labs adventure began in 2019. Premium Beauty News - What alternative to phenoxyethanol does Codex Labs use? Barbara Paldus - It is a patented food-grade preservative system called PreservX®, which is present in every Codex Labs skincare product. It protects water-based formulas by boosting the balance of the skin's microbiome, but not only that. It also has a moisturising and protective function. It is derived from the fermentation of lactobacillus, coconut oil, propanediol and organic food acids. Premium Beauty News - How is Codex Labs positioned in the cosmetics landscape? Barbara Paldus - Transparency is at the heart of our commitments, both in terms of composition and results. Our products are designed with the support of a team of experts, including scientists, botanists, cosmetic chemists, and dermatologists. By combining their knowledge and insights, we provide consumers with effective skincare solutions that take into account the microbiome, which we believe is essential. All formulas are clinically tested by the Eurofins analysis laboratory in Lyon, France. Codex Labs is a dermo-cosmetics brand offering skincare products - most of which are Cosmos certified by Ecocert - that provide an effective response to skin issues such as acne, the signs of ageing (fine lines and wrinkles), skin sensitivity and dryness, and oxidative stress. From the second quarter of 2024, we will be introducing a range of skincare products and cleansers for eczema, psoriasis, and rosacea. At the end of 2023, we launched our first dietary supplements: one for hormonal acne and another to support the skin barrier. Others are planned for the second quarter of 2024. At Codex Labs, we are convinced that the skin is a mirror of our body's condition, particularly our internal organs. That is why we want to take our expertise much further by offering DNA testing on our new www.sgbnet.com platform, which was recently launched in the United States. We are currently working on adapting it to France and other European countries, to launch it at the end of 2024. Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us more about this platform? Barbara Paldus - At Codex Labs, we are convinced that many health issues can be solved by correlating solutions for the skin, the intestine, and the brain. In other words, we take a close interest in the diet, lifestyle, and mental health of each individual to provide them with personalised solutions to their skin problems. We offer two kits: DNA Decode My Skin, which focuses on the skin, and DNA Decode My Health, which looks at the absorption, transport, and metabolism of vitamins A to E and folic acid. Afterwards, the person who has taken the test can schedule a consultation with an expert who will help them analyse the results and provide advice on their lifestyle and diet. We provide recommendations on which professionals to consult to deal with a given problem, whether it be a dermatologist, a nutritionist, a naturopath, a psychologist... Premium Beauty News - The idea behind this testing platform is also to make a link with Codex Labs products? Barbara Paldus - Not explicitly, but necessarily yes. Let me explain. We are convinced that our products - food supplements and skincare products - are highly effective. In certain countries such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the United States and even England and Ireland, we are already present in a large number of pharmacies and health and beauty stores, and professionals - dermatologists, naturopaths... – who recommend our products. Premium Beauty News - And in France, where is the brand distributed? Barbara Paldus - At the moment, we have a 100% online presence in the French market on the Nocibé.fr, Blissim.fr, Slolie.fr and Ecco-verde.fr websites. In 2023, we ran a communication and awareness-raising campaign for healthcare professionals in France to help them discover our products, their composition, and their effectiveness. As a result, we have established several partnerships with dermatologists and naturopaths. Our presence in pharmacies and health and beauty stores in France is scheduled for 2024. Pharmacy outlets are our primary channel, in complete harmony with our values."

Pierre Miasnik will remain involved in the company, both as a minority shareholder and a Board member."
Six key beauty players launch the Value of Beauty Alliance,"In a report entitled What is the Value of Beauty? How beauty & personal care shape our economy, society and wellbeing, the six founding members highlight that the European beauty market generates 74.1 billion euros per year and that 80 percent of consumers, within the European Union, consider beauty products as an essential part of their daily lives. The sector is also a cradle of scientific advancement, investing EUR 2.35 billion in R&D and nurturing over 30,040 scientists in diverse fields. The cosmetics industry also strives to improve its environment footprint, from green energy usage to eco-friendly packaging. In 2022 five out of the thirteen companies that globally achieved a 'Triple A' CDP Rating for their sustainability efforts were in the beauty and personal care sector. ""The aim of the Alliance is to highlight the role and importance of the cosmetics industry, particularly among lawmakers. The six founding members represent the different facets of our sector,"" L'Oréal Groupe CEO, Nicolas Hieronimus, told Premium Beauty News. ""We want to put the value chain of the cosmetic industry and its main players under the spotlights. European lawmakers have little knowledge about the cosmetics industry, the weight of which is nevertheless very important in the trade balance of many countries, including Germany,"" added Vincent Warnery, CEO of Beiersdorf. The coalition is open to all actors contributing to the cosmetics value chain in Europe, keen to help providing a better understanding of the economic and social contributions of the ecosystem. Albéa and Puig already have committed to join this collective effort."
UPSA enters the gummies market with British startup Rem3dy Health,"Already present on the food supplements market, in particular with vitamin C, UPSA aims to turn this dynamic, fast-changing segment into a sustainable growth driver. ""The market of food supplements in the form of gummies has achieved a double-digit growth in France for over five years. In the pharmaceutical channel, the main distribution network for these products, growth reached +15% in 2022, compared with the previous year. Today, in the US, 50% of food supplements are delivered in the form of gummies"", explains Anthony Lallier, Managing Director of UPSA France and in charge of UPSA Global portfolio development. To gain a foothold in this market, the Southwestern French laboratory has acquired a stake in the British startup Rem3dy Health, which invented the first gummies using a patented 3D printing technology. The aim is to offer a holistic vision of wellness through an attractive range, without compromising on pharmaceutical quality or efficacy. ""The 3D printing technology makes it possible to separate the actives without mixing or heating them. Their quality is therefore not altered over time. They are better preserved and the different layers contribute to the organoleptic pleasure. The result is a unique texture and taste, and gums that do not stick to your teeth. Plus, the formulas are vegan, sugar-free and gluten-free, and only based on natural colorants"", adds Anthony Lallier. The UPSA x Nourished 7-in-1 Gummies come in five formulas combining vitamins, minerals, and plants: sleep, energy, beauty, immunity, and slimming detox. They have been available exclusively in pharmacies in France and Italy since November 2023, but will be gradually rolled out in other countries, mainly in Europe (Belgium, Spain, Greece, Switzerland, etc.), in 2024. This launch, which is part of UPSA's growth plan, is supported by a communication plan combining TV and digital channels, point-of-sale activations and sampling. Since September 2023, the UPSA x Nourished 7-in-1 Gummies have captured almost 10% of the pharmacy market and reached the second rank in France. The products are manufactured in the UK by Rem3dy Health Group, and then they are distributed to pharmacies by the UPSA teams based in the town of Agen. ""In an ever-changing environment, a company like UPSA can only keep growing if it constantly reinvents itself. Our acquisition of a stake in Rem3dy Health is a sign of our agility and desire to continue adapting our offering to new consumer expectations in the food supplements market"", concludes Isabelle Van Rycke, President and CEO of UPSA."
"Seeking to capture a wider audience, luxury fashion brands enter beauty","In October 2023, global luxury titan Kering – the group behind Gucci, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen, among others – closed its acquisition of luxury fragrance house Creed; a deal considered significant in both fashion and beauty because of its scale and the price-tag attached. And transactions like this follow on from other major acquisitions and mergers in the space, such as Spanish fashion major Puig's majority stake acquisition in British beauty brand Charlotte Tilbury back in 2020 and The Estée Lauder Companies' purchase of Tom Ford in April of this year. In September 2023, Richemont announced the creation of a perfume and beauty division. But why had fashion-beauty mergers ramped up? And could fashion truly succeed in expanding into such a dynamic and competitive global beauty market? Financial and market experts weighed in at Beauty Independent's recent Dealmaker Summit EU/UK 2023 in London, UK last month. Sandra Nait-Amer, managing director at independent financial services group Rothschild & Co, said it had certainly been interesting to watch how business ideas had evolved in recent years. In luxury fashion, Nait-Amer told attendees there had been a ""complete shift of strategy"" recently, spurred by ""the realisation that there is a big business to be made within beauty"". What beauty offered fashion, she said, was cashflow with better visibility, free from cycles typical in fashion, along with access to a dynamic and sizeable global market. Via beauty, high-end fashion brands could capture a wider audience in the ""aspirational luxury consumer"", she said. ""...When you look at brands like Chanel or Dior, 40% of the brand sales are from fragrance and beauty. When you're the owner of Gucci, it makes a lot of sense to leverage the value of the brand you've created in this new vertical that is also growing in a more robust way,"" she emphasized. Luxury fashion brands also took ""a lot of time to build"", she said, so when considering growth, it made sense to create a beauty offering within the brand versus acquiring and scaling another fashion house. And this potential for luxury fashion brands to succeed in beauty had already been ""well proven"", Nait-Amer said. Armani, for example, had a strong track record in makeup and Chanel was big across all beauty categories. ""In the past, [fashion brands] would only see the beauty potential in launching their fragrance under the same name, but now you can really build a whole beauty business that's worth billions, beyond just fragrance. The size of the prize is much bigger than people thought initially."" However, the finance expert said stretching into beauty only made sense for scaled and matured fashion brands – the ""mega luxury brands"" – because for younger, growing fashion businesses it made more sense to focus on the core business. Entering into beauty also required ""a lot of investment"" often only available after scaling, particularly for talent-building in-house, she said. On top of this, high levels of investment also made more sense for companies with multiple fashion brands in their portfolio versus mono-brand fashion firms, she said. Angela Chou, investor at UK-based venture capital firm Felix Capital, agreed, stating it was ""a lot"" for founders to take on a second sector in early stages. ""Most of the more important conversations are about geographies, new product categories and going into wholesale,"" Chou said. Obviously, there were exceptions, she said, with some fashion founders entering beauty early, but in these cases, they more likely moved into fragrance; crossing ""that blurry line"" between beauty and fashion. Nait-Amer added that, for the time being, fashion majors were not interested in acquiring parts of the beauty supply chain but instead focused on on-boarding and picking up brands. ""I don't think any of these fashion groups want to build a vertically-integrated supply chain in beauty. The attraction of the beauty sector is that the ecosystem is very strong, the outsourcing is very strong, so you don't need to internalise these capabilities. Across the supply chain, you have lots of experts that do these products very well and it would be very difficult to replicate that level of innovation and agility because the pace is much faster in beauty than fashion."" Asked what beauty categories offered most promise for fashion majors, Nait-Amer said there were only a handful that made sense. Fragrance and colour cosmetics, for example, were two examples of ""well trodden path[s]"" that aligned well with the creative aspect of fashion, she said. Skin care on the other hand was far tougher to enter as a fashion brand because consumers shopping this space tended to look for science, efficacy and credibility versus brand power, she said. For fashion to succeed in skin care, she said acquisitions of verticals made more sense than building in-house capabilities. Nader Naeymi-Rad, founder and publisher of Beauty Independent, said one potential game-changing area where fashion could expand successfully into beauty was in wellness and athleisure. ""Athleisure is to fashion what wellness is to beauty. I may not buy a skin care product from Chanel, but an SPF product from Patagonia or supplements from North Face makes sense. So, I think wellness and athleisure is one area you may be able to get that fusion, where they're both off-centre: they're not core typical beauty, nor core typical fashion and you may be able to create something exciting in both worlds and remain authentic,"" Naeymi-Rad said."
Major beauty players create TRASCE to get a clearer view of their supply chains,"With the support of FEBEA, the French federation of beauty companies, the members of the new consortium [1] have committed to map their supply chains across the entire value chain on a common digital platform, Transparency-One. The latter was selected for its ability to guarantee each supplier the ownership, security and confidentiality of the data they share. Transparency-One has already been used in other sectors of activity, such as the food and automotive industries, for the deployment of large-scale traceability approaches. TRASCE will help respond to three main challenges for the industry by strengthening the understanding of the supply chains, assessing the related social and environmental risks and determining the necessary actions for common progress plans. ""The essential and demanding work of mapping our supply chains carried out in recent years has allowed us to understand the main limits of the exercise. It is sometimes quite difficult for a single client to convince distant tier suppliers to commit to this process, when we do not exchange directly with them or when they do not meet the same regulatory requirements. Based on this observation, we proposed that the actors of the sector join forces to trace our supply chains as far and as quickly as possible,"" explains Julien Garry, International Director of Purchasing and Packaging Innovation Development at Chanel Parfums Beauté. According to Meghan Ryan, Executive Director of Responsible Sourcing at The Estée Lauder Companies: ""Through shared digital tools and close collaboration, we have an opportunity to move the needle in transparency and elevate how we source responsibility, with attention to potential impacts on people and the environment."" ""We are convinced of the need to align the industry on a single traceability tool, and to implement a common methodology,"" shares Karl Hensen, Quality Director Surface Solutions at Merck. According to Gilles Swyngedauw, Vice President CSR and product sustainability at Albéa Cosmetics Fragrance: ""Cosmetics packaging will have to revolutionize in the years to come. We've been working on these issues for years. As a global player in the sector, it soon became clear to us that we needed to create a common methodology to harmonize needs across the industry and achieve our goals by involving as many stakeholders as possible."" This collaborative approach is not a first within the cosmetics industry. In 2022, several international players have joined forces within the EcoBeautyScore consortium, in order to create an industry-wide environmental assessment and scoring system for cosmetic products."
"Rising rapidly, Cosnova aims to join the top 5 global makeup leaders","With 2023 net sales of EUR 817 million (USD 890 million) compared to 617 million euros last year, the Cosnova Group has far exceeded its own targets for the recently concluded financial year. Just one year after crossing the EUR 500 million turnover milestone, the family-owned group now believes the billion euro threshold is now well within reach, as well as entering the world's top 5 in makeup. As the company enters its third decade, this 32% increase in sales, compared to 2022, marks the second consecutive year with a sales surge of over 30%. Cosnova said it has not only increased its market share across all global regions, spanning both brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce platforms, but has also broadened its retail presence and strengthened distribution channels in nearly 90 operating countries. According to the group, the success of the preceding twelve months can be directly attributed to the escalating regionalization of essence and Catrice product offerings, in particular for the USA and the Middle East. In Germany, Cosnova continues to attract consumers, with sales up 36%. The scenario of success is similar in the rest of Europe, with a growth rate of 38%. In the U.S., Cosnova was able to expand its market position, with an organic growth of 29%. Both offline and online retail were key growth drivers. Essence expanded its partnership with Ulta Beauty and successfully entered more than 300 Target stores. Amazon remained the most important e-commerce channel with Cosnova's business growing by 6% in 2023. Results are also rising sharply in the rest of North America, with organic growth of 23%, and in the rest of the world, with sales growth of 24% compared to the previous year. This massive increase in sales is also a challenge for Cosnova, who had to cope with temporary supply chain bottlenecks in 2023. Throughout the year, the company effectively addressed these challenges through strategic initiatives including continuously investing in the capacities of its suppliers. In addition, Cosnova has outlined plans for a substantial expansion of its central warehouse in Germany in the forthcoming years. ""We have reorganized our supply chain and our logistics, and we are preparing to resize our infrastructure to adapt to this growth. But 90% of our products are made in Europe, that eases our operations,"" emphasizes Soazig Le Prince, General Manager of Cosnova France. Although the group does not publish quantified goals for 2024, it claims to be confident in its powerful business model, which made the demonstration of its strength. ""We are the leader in makeup in Europe, and we are gaining market shares in all the countries where we are present,"" adds Soazig Le Prince. Christina Oster-Daum, founder and CEO of Cosnova, the results for the 2023 financial year show the strong affinity of the group's brands with consumers as well as the relevance of its innovations. ""Even though the global economic conditions are currently challenging, we are convinced that we will continue to grow in the future. This applies to both the national and international markets. The substantial investments we have made over the past four years and our sustainable orientation have given us a solid foundation for this. After this sensational financial year, we are extremely optimistic about the third decade of our company's history,"" concludes Javier González, co-founder, and president of Cosnova."
Melvita: the green powerhouse of the L'Occitane group moves upmarket,"Nathaëlle Davoust, who has headed Melvita for just over two years, is leading the overhaul of the forty-year-old brand. ""With this revamp, we aim to strengthen our legitimacy as an innovative, modern brand, although we are one of the leaders in the organic segment"", explains the General Manager. Melvita did not wait for the rebranding to recruit Miss France 2011 and TV presenter Laury Thilleman as its social media ambassador, in order to convey a sparkling, fresh image of its skincare products and to recruit a younger audience. ""We have already felt Laury's impact throughout France. We are already seeing a rejuvenation of our customer base"", smiles Nathaëlle Davoust. Melvita has announced a double-digit growth for 2023. Japan is its biggest market, closely followed by France. In Japan, the brand has succeeded in stabilizing its own stores, which now number twenty, despite the difficult situation related to the Covid-19 pandemic. In France, Melvita intends to focus its investments on pharmacies, with a short-term target of 3,000 points of sale, compared with just over 1,500 today. ""Since the pandemic, pharmacies have come to occupy a prominent place and gained French people's trust, in their minds and daily lives. As a result, we are going to step up our presence in this channel and strengthen our team training and point-of-sale events"", stresses Nathaëlle Davoust. ""Behind Melvita's rebranding, our strong message is meant to show – I would even say prove – that an organic brand can be elegant and glamorous. By 2025, 100% of our packs will have changed identity and will boast the brand's new logo and colours. We have taken advantage of our work on brand image to streamline our range, reducing it all to 120 references, compared to 150 previously"", stresses the CEO. The new dark green logo still emphasizes naturalness, but in a more subtle, premium way. The round letters were designed to express the values of generosity, joy, gentleness, and femininity. Each flagship range will have its own distinctive packaging colour. Also, the new packs are meant to strike the right balance between the codes of expertise, with lots of white, and the drawings of plant shapes, for naturalness. Everywhere are plant veins that resemble skin cells. NectarCalm, Melvita's new skincare range to be launched in February 2024, will be the first to adopt the brand's new colours and logo. With a minimalist composition approved by a toxicologist, this line was designed to help sensitive skin regain its balance. It includes two products: a soothing, strengthening serum and an anti-redness, soothing balm. These compositions got a score of 100/100 on Yuka. A light version of the balm will be available in April 2024. ""One of the biggest challenges for us as an organic brand is to minimize our carbon footprint"", continues Nathaëlle Davoust. With this in mind, starting from 2024, all cream jars will be refillable. As a reminder, the brand's bottles are made from 83% recycled plastic. Melvita has committed to replacing all controversial ingredients in its formulas, if any, and even to discontinuing the products concerned, in certain cases. That is why the company has made the decision to stop producing its global anti-ageing range Nectar Suprême, based on royal jelly, for ethical and animal welfare reasons. ""We are currently working on a new skincare line to replace it. It should be launched at the end of 2024"", she explains."
ACT Beauty boosts its CSR commitment with the acquisition of Bien Faire,"ACT Beauty is stepping up significantly its CSR strategy! The Lille-based company, which specialises in beauty and fashion accessories, small bags, and luxury packaging, has recently acquired Bien Faire, to strengthen its eco-responsible offering. Bien Faire is a spin-off from Fairly Made Impact, the start-up created by Laure Betsch and Camille Le Gal to enhance the sustainability of the fashion industry, notably by using SaaS software to trace the production chain and analyse product life cycles. ""Fairly Made Impact wanted to concentrate on its core business. For our part, we were interested in the supply chain set up by the company, with partners selected for their social and environmental commitments and robust traceability. For us, it was an effective way of accelerating our CSR commitments and strengthening our offering to our customers,"" explains Julien Briand, ACT Beauty's Managing Director. Since 1 December 2023, the Bien Faire teams have been relocated to ACT Beauty's Paris premises, enabling the company to offer eco-responsible or upcycled solutions, guaranteeing traceability from yarn to finished product. The approach is based on a rigorous selection of suppliers throughout the value chain, and on raw materials certified to internationally recognised standards such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) and the Global Recycled Standard (GRS). Already available for textiles, the offer will be rapidly extended to other types of products, improving the traceability and transparency of industrial processes. Bien Faire's integration adds proven expertise in CSR and end-to-end traceability across the value chain. The company plans to build on this acquisition to offer its customers an additional level of eco-responsibility by working closely with its partner factories. ""Our ambition, for 'Bien Faire by ACT Beauty', is to become our label for a full offer, encompassing textiles, beauty accessories, brushes, and packaging, all of them certified and traceable,"" explains Julien Briand. The company has been awarded the Eco Vadis Platinum label since 2021 and is in the process of obtaining B Corp certification, thereby extending the eco-responsible approach it formalised more than five years ago. The ""Bien Faire by ACT Beauty"" certified eco-responsible offer reinforces ACT Beauty's strategic positioning as a key player in the top-of-the-range accessories and gifts sector. With a team of 30 employees based in Lille, Paris, New York and Shenzhen, and sales divided equally between beauty accessories, packaging solutions and textiles, the company is continuing to expand on the European and North American markets."
Biopack Arcade Beauty invests to meet growing sample demand,"Located in Normandy, in the North-West of France, the Biopack factory, one of the five European manufacturing sites of the Arcade Beauty group, is facing a surge in demand for its core business: the filling and packaging of samples and mini perfume and cosmetic products. Over the past three years, the company has invested 3.5 million euros to increase its production capacity. After the installation of five new machines between late 2023 and early 2024, combined with the implementation of a vast operational efficiency program, Biopack should have around 25% additional capacity this year. Enough to take the heat off, after a year 2023 marked by production tensions. Between 2017 and 2023, Biopack's turnover doubled to pass the 60 million euro mark. This growth was supported by a strong recruitment plan, with the workforce increasing from 100 staffs in 2017 to 200 staffs in 2023. Furthermore, 3.5 million euros have been invested in the expansion of the site, rationalization and new machines, over the last three years. ""In 2023, additional volumes had to be produced even though all the machines had not yet arrived. We have therefore implemented a performance strategy to get the most out of our production tool. This lean production program allowed us to ramp up production in good conditions,"" explains Mathieu Guilluy, the plant manager. According to Biopack Arcade Beauty, the rapid growth in demand is explained by the strengthening role of samples. ""Of course the strong growth in the global perfume market has driven our volumes, but the trend is more general and is linked to less brand loyalty, leading consumers to test more products,"" underlines Mathieu Guilluy. Consumers' desire that samples provide an experience as close to that of full-size products leads to an increased sophistication that benefits mini products, the production of which has tripled since 2017, while that of mini sprays increased by 20% over the same period. For its part, the production of traditional sample cards has stalled. However, the success of mini products and the trend towards premiumization require production to be adapted to a wide variety of formats. ""We need very flexible machines, which we can adapt very quickly to industrialize products,"" says Mathieu Guilluy. The Biopack plant can respond to requests from large groups as well as small brands with minimum quantities varying from 5,000 to 10,000 units depending on the type of product. ""But we remain flexible, our strength is in finding solutions,"" insists the plant manager. Depending on the brands' requests, Biopack can carry out packaging, its core business, but also, ensure the sourcing of formulas and packaging, in addition to managing decoration and assembly operations. Finally, let's note that the investments in additional production capacity were concomitant to the implementation of a plan to reduce the environmental footprint that enabled Biopack to reduce electricity consumption while increasing production."
Galénic aims to strengthen its footprint on the luxury skincare market,"Organized at the end of December at the Hôtel de la Monnaie in Paris, the Galénic Dermatology Research Fund awards ceremony was an opportunity for the brand, which celebrated its 45th anniversary in 2023, to reaffirm its ambitions after having joined China's Yatsen group in 2020. ""Galénic was created by visionary pharmacist Pierre Fabre in 1978. From the outset, the brand's mission has been to bring science into the world of luxury beauty. The launch of the Galénic Dermatology Research Fund is part of this heritage,"" said Sarah Michel-Stevens, Managing Director of Galénic Cosmetics Laboratory. Precisely, the creation of an endowment fund and of a scientific committee [1] are intended to consolidate this identity strongly rooted in dermatological research. ""Galénic is a genuine scientific brand built on rigorous research and scientific evidence. I'm extremely pleased to be part of this collaboration, which will play an important role in the development of improved knowledge of skin physiology. Their support of innovation and scientific discovery is in perfect harmony with the needs of biomedical research. For over a year now, we have been working together to push even further the boundaries of dermatology, research and scientific progress,"" highlighted Professor Jean-David Bouaziz, President of the Galenic Dermatology Research Fund Scientific Committee. Coming from different areas of science, the seven members of the committee* have the mission of evaluating and choosing the most innovative research projects. During the ceremony on December 19, 2023, four projects were awarded: Dr Corinne Leprince for her researches on the importance of autophagy in the barrier function of the epidermis; Dr. Elodie Labit's for the exploration of neuro-immune interactions in skin repair; Dr Muriel Cario Andre, for a research project focused on a new method for improving the bioavailability and penetration of active ingredients into the skin, specifically for the treatment of skin cancers; and Dr. Fabien Chevalier for a research project focused on the role of small molecule called miR-30a in skin aging regulation. A grant of 100,000 euros, divided into four financial allocations of an individual amount of 25,000 euros, will provide the winners with the financial means allowing them to push their research projects forward. Thus, Galénic aims to perpetuate its heritage as a pioneering brand of innovative skincare and collaborations with experts in dermatology seen as a complement to the scheduled launch of a dedicated R&D Center in Toulouse, France."
"Facial sheet masks, and patches: FSKorea's offer strong asset","What are the benefits of a facial sheet mask? J.K. Hwang - A facial sheet mask is a skin care treatment that provides the skin with all the elements and active ingredients it needs to maintain its balance. Before using a facial mask, it's important to know your skin type to identify your needs and choose the one that's best suited to you. This means that each skin type requires its own special care? J.K. Hwang - If your skin is prone to imperfections, it's best to use a purifying mask that focuses on deep cleansing. This mask will absorb the excess sebum, leaving you with clearer skin with purified, tighter pores. Hydrating and soothing masks are ideal for reinforcing the hydrolipidic film that protects the skin and obtaining a radiant, plump complexion. All skin types need this kind of treatment. A mask is also much richer and thicker than a day cream, making it possible to target certain skin conditions immediately. How is your offering of facial masks organised? J.K. Hwang - Our range is very broad. It ranges from non-woven to cotton, which has a soft, uniform surface, to rayon, where different natural substances are used for the fibre. It looks translucent when pre-moistened. The texture is soft and adheres easily to the skin. By 2030, all plastic packaging in the European Union will have to be recyclable or reusable. As a result, our mask sachets are made from a single material (polypropylene) and recyclable. Beyond facial masks, you also propose patches? J.K. Hwang - Patches are a very effective technique for treating wrinkles, for example. The main cause of skin ageing is the decline and shrinkage of muscle and elastic fibres in the dermis. The dermis consists of dense collagen and hyaluronic acid. In ageing skin the connection between collagen and hyaluronic acid is less effective. And, wrinkles form as the skin's elasticity diminishes. Ultra-thin and very comfortable, hydrogel patches provide a moisturising and revitalising effect. They are thin and ergonomic for optimal comfort and do not lint."
A dealmaking rush? European beauty braces for 'super dynamic' 2024,"Nader Naeymi-Rad, founder and publisher of Beauty Independent, said: ""A lot has changed in the beauty industry over the last ten years, and one of the things that has changed is dealmaking."" Referencing data from various sources, Naeymi-Rad said it was clear the volume of beauty deals worldwide had increased year after year in the last decade, coming ""back with a vengeance"" post-COVID. And whilst dealmaking had slowed in 2023, the overall value of deals in the space broadly followed the upward trajectory of volumes, he said. Carving up dealmaking geographically, he said, there were interesting trends to be seen. The US, for example, remained ""very very strong with early-stage dealmaking"" whereas European deals tended to happen ""in the middle"", at private equity (PE) investment or merger and acquisition (M&A) stages. So, why was investment at early-stage less frequent in European beauty? Vasiliki Petrou, group CEO of beauty major Unilever Prestige, told attendees: ""Obviously, we are in a very volatile period of high interest rates, there are a lot of geopolitical tensions and strategics have bought quite a bit (…) I can definitely see a stress on what we call 'indie' brands because funding is much more difficult versus what it used to be."" Michael Brousset, founder and CEO of beauty and wellness funding and incubator platform Waldencast, added: ""There's also been the factor of the ability for brands to scale – it's just become a much more competitive market. There are less of those breakout starts, there are still some, but beauty is a business where there are more brands than buyers."" ""...I think there are also a lot more options for venture capital (VC) funding in the US beauty space than there are in Europe: there are dedicated funds. And the VC ecosystem is evolving in Europe but it's probably five to ten years behind the US, so that would explain why there are more PE deals than VC deals,"" Brousset said. Emily Bullman, investor at UK VC investment fund JamJar Investments, said European founders also tended to be ""slightly more cautious"" with fundraising approaches than their US counterparts. Dominic Hawksley, founder of UK luxury beauty oils company Olverum, self-funded since 2015, agreed: ""Americans have a greater appetite for risk generally; they are perhaps influenced by the tech sector more. There are also far more funds."" Hawksley said the barriers to growth in Europe due to varied taxation laws, patchwork regulations and the diversity of beauty and retail cultures across the continent might also be a factor. ""The situation is that caution extends to the retailers too; you have to prove yourself [as a brand],"" he said. Evan Merali, managing director at US independent investment bank Raymond James, said 2023 had also continued to see some uncertainty around consumer spending in beauty, describing it as a ""wait and see"" year for the true outcome of pattern changes. However, Merali said fewer, albeit strategic, beauty deals had also created a rising desire to invest amongst the financial world. ""The interesting thing about mergers and acquisitions, driven by private equity more than strategics, is that as time goes by without any deals, there is a lot of pressure to do deals. And so, things started to pick up on the front half of the year,"" he said. Looking ahead, he said even more dealmaking was expected in the first half of 2024. Brousset said the future of beauty – particularly the next 12-18 months – looked ""exciting"". ""There are a lot of brands coming to market; there is a lot of growth; a lot of consumer excitement. So, I think it's going to be super dynamic."" ""...The beauty business has always been an acquisition business; we're still talking about substantial, healthy numbers."" Unilever Prestige's Petrou agreed: ""I'm very bullish; I've signed up to double-digit growth internally. Beauty has always been very resilient. Beauty is part of our self-confidence [and linked to] self-esteem, and that's why I think it's such a beautiful category to be a part of."" So, what categories were set to see more financial dynamism than others in Europe? Jane Carlson, managing editor at Beauty Independent, said fragrance had been ""the dark horse"" of beauty for the past three to four years, ""growing at rates no-one really expected to see"", and would continue to be important in growth terms. It had also seen some ""high profile"" and ""high value"" deals in Europe already made, including Creed-Kering Beauté and Aesop-L'Oréal, Carlson said, with ""a lot of white space"" remaining for growth in Eastern Europe and across prestige. Hanadi Al Hamoui, managing director at investment management firm Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said luxury fragrances could be described as ""the really hot category of the moment"", though warned there were probably only ""a handful of openings"" in this space from an investment point of view. Thomas Buisson, managing director at Natura &Co's corporate venture investment arm Fable Investments, said growth in this category also took time, so it wasn't a beauty space that offered ""quick-wins"" for investors. ""It's a category that has immense potential but I just want to reiterate that you need to accept that it takes time,"" Buisson said. Petrou said Unilever Prestige would be looking closely at fragrances when considering future investments, though any deals in the category would be with ""really rare"" brands that already had some level of scale. Beauty Independent's Naeymi-Rad said that, beyond brand investments, dealmaking would likely continue across industry's global supply chain in 2024 – following plenty of deals made across packaging, product development, ingredients and more in recent years. Hui Chan, managing director for private equity at global private investment major Bain Capital, said drivers behind beauty supply chain investments were no different to why companies chose to invest in beauty brands. ""Beauty is a phenomenal space; I think it's incredibly dynamic. But when you step back, if you compare to other consumer spaces, it's a very growth-filled space. As an investor looking to deploy capital in parts of the market that are attractive, one of the ways to expose yourself to beauty headwinds is investing in the suppliers to these brands,"" Chan said. Investing in the ""ecosystem of enablers"", she said, offered strong diversification for investors via exposure to multiple brands. Sara Hudson, partner at global management consulting firm McKinsey & Co, said that for now, however, there remained more supplier dealmaking in the US versus Europe, likely due to the European market being made up of smaller, family-owned businesses less keen to sell. Chan agreed, stating this supplier market fragmentation was also likely being maintained because European beauty brands recognised the benefits of working with a plethora of smaller specialists."
Greek dermocosmetics brand The Skin Pharmacist expands to Europe,"""Citizens confronted to minor health problems, in particular skin problems, usually turn to their pharmacists to find a solution. And this behaviour has become more widespread since the Covid-19 pandemic. Consumers see pharmacists as trustworthy health professionals,"" explains George Bakas, President of the group Good Brands & Cosmetics (GBC), the French distributor of the brand The Skin Pharmacist. ""As The Skin Pharmacist is about to enter the French market, the GBC group has committed to putting more emphasis on pharmacists' expertise and advice, by offering efficient solutions to frequent skin problems on a daily basis. The brand will provide a first, immediate answer to consumers, before they go see a dermatologist,"" adds George Bakas. The Skin Pharmacist's product offering is composed of five basic face ranges, plus an SOS line of five products designed to relieve the skins that suffer from different disorders (pimples, stings or bites, burns...). The products are available for 17 euros on average, so they are affordable. The formulas are free from silicone, alcohol, mineral oil and colourants, and they are soaked with well-known actives highly popular among consumers, like vitamins C, E, and B12, hyaluronic acid, panthenol, medicinal plant extracts... Launched in January 2022 in Greece, its country of origin, The Skin Pharmacist will expand its presence to several European countries, starting from the end of December, and it will all start in France. Then, Laboratoires Intermed will gradually launch the brand in Spain, Belgium, Germany, Italy, and the UK throughout the year 2024. ""In France, we would like to be established enough on the national network in two years to be accessible to as many people as possible,"" says Georges Bakas. ""The Skin Pharmacist's DNA involves our being as close as possible to humans, i.e. pharmacists and their customers. That is what we focus our investments on, through face-to-face and continuous training in the form of an e-learning programme and animations at points of sale. We will not develop much on the Web, but of course, a French website will be available by the end of the year."" The Skin Pharmacist's offering was designed to provide targeted solutions to various skin problems. The products in the Hydra Boost range were developed to deeply hydrate the skin and visibly enhance its texture. As for the formulas in the Sensitive Skin range, they are hypoallergenic and meant to meet the needs of sensitive skins of all ages. The Age Active range was devised to prevent and treat fine lines and wrinkles, while the Restore & Renew line helps intensely regenerate the skin. The City Detox skincare range helps detoxify and protect the skin from premature ageing caused by pollution and UV rays. Lastly, ""the SOS line is a unique category in pharmacies, as these products offer fast, immediate relief by treating various skin disorders,"" concludes Georges Bakas. The brand The Skin Pharmacist will attend the PharmagoraPlus show in March 2024 in Paris."
"""We are aiming to regain the sense of community,"" Annabelle Baker, Lush","It's been two years since Lush left social networks. Any regrets? Annabelle Baker - It hasn't been without its challenges. However, how can you regret a decision to try to make your customers safer and one that was made in the light of damaging evidence that platforms like Instagram drove young people to suicide? Over the last two years we have seen significant momentum both with the public and with governments to tackle the issues and force change. It's encouraging to see new regulations coming into effect across Europe to protect the safety of those on the platforms — what we'd also like to see is more accountability for Big Tech. Our latest campaign — that launched on Black Friday — challenges the power and abuses of Big Tech and raises money for a decentralized movement called 'People vs Big Tech'. Has this decision had an impact on sales and the brand's reputation around the world? Annabelle Baker - Determining the impact on sales has been difficult for a number of reasons. Our withdrawal from social networks coincided with a period of unforeseen global turbulence, with an increase in Covid cases, followed by the invasion of Ukraine and, more recently, a cost-of-living crisis with significant inflation. We are fortunate to have a strong community, which means that our reputation is not determined by our presence or absence on certain social platforms. In fact, we've seen other brands try to run a similar active campaign on social networks, only to be asked by their customers why they didn't do the same as Lush and actively withdraw from these platforms. Have you had any negative feedback from some customers? Annabelle Baker - Our customers have generally been behind what we did and appreciate us taking a stand. We did a report with foresight consultancy The Future Laboratory this year to investigate the digital landscape, now and in the future. With leading experts in the tech sector contributing, and over 12,000 consumers across the UK, US and Japan surveyed, the aim was to investigate the rapidly shifting digital landscape, its impact on consumers, and existing barriers to digital transformation. The results were insightful, for example: almost seven in 10 adults (69%) believe that if a social media platform is unethical then brands should step away from it; 65% don't want social media platforms to use their data for commercial benefit; whilst a huge 70% are calling for global legislation that protects the safety of users online. So your departure from social networking went smoothly? Annabelle Baker - It hasn't all been that way though, we definitely did receive comments from people not appreciating our stance but this was two years ago when the dangers of social media were not as well known or as well documented as they are today. Just this week, the BBC published a story about Gen Z turning their backs on social media and you can also see waves of legal action in the US from families accusing these platforms of being harmful to teens, in particular. It's important to note that these social media platforms are not the only space to build connection and community and we are likely to continue to see a decentralized approach to community building and how and where a brand can show up. A few months ago, there was a bit of a viral element on social media that saw some users claiming to have (almost) forgotten that Lush existed. Isn't that a problem in a sector that is subject to ever-increasing competition? Annabelle Baker - You have to keep yourself relevant, and we are fortunate to have a lot of creativity and innovation in our business. If you make bold moves, tap into popular culture, invent groundbreaking products that are effective and really change lives, and interact with your community consistently and authentically, then a brand can stay relevant. Remembering that people buy from people. What has the brand done to remain visible to consumers despite this absence on social networks? Annabelle Baker - Lush is still present in the digital world — yes, we've moved off of Meta platforms and TikTok as a brand, but we've been experimenting with other web3 technologies and platforms. We are aiming to regain the ""sense of community"" in online spaces, when social media was really social and when our Lush community was organic — before the algorithm took over the direct connection between Lush and users. There're other ways to meet communities where they are, that isn't dependent on these platforms. For example we've been dipping our toe into the metaverse this past year, with a replica of our SXSW House activation on Decentraland and taking part in the first Metaverse Beauty Week. As part of our 'Big Tech Rebellion,' we are keen to divest money away from the likes of Google and instead invest in our community, people over platforms. This ranges from looking at how we collaborate with influencers and creators, to offering our super fans a first look at product drops. Have you initiated other forms of 'meetups' with your community? Annabelle Baker - We've been participating in more IRL events and activations, showing up at events like Afro Punk in Brooklyn; Happy Place Festival in the UK; SXSW in Austin and Womad in the UK. We have physical retail spaces all over the world, and have continued to invest in redesigns and refits, as well as new concept stores — such as a new hair salon in the UK and spas in Dubai and NYC. We've been collaborating with lifestyle and entertainment partners more over the past 12 months and our community has jumped on these, creating many viral moments across all launches (including the ""Super Mario Bros Movie,"" ""Stranger Things,"" ""SpongeBob"" and most recently ""Barbie""). When you do something cool that excites people, we've found that our audience will organically share it and that's more authentic. So that's our job, create those products and experiences that our community wants to share! We've also been building our community on Discord with the intention to make more ""conversational"" interaction with customers online. Discord is a decentralised platform and allows us to have more control within the server. In the fashion world, Bottega Veneta has left Instagram, but very few brands seem to be able to go without a social network presence. Why do you think this is? Annabelle Baker - I can't comment on what other brands do or why, I can only talk about why we made the decisions we did. Coming off of the platforms we did made sense to us, as a lot of our customers fall into the group most negatively affected by them. We are in the business of well-being, and we attract a lot of young girls … we simply couldn't continue to ask them to find us on platforms [that push us] into giving our ""consent"" to grow their vast empires of personal data extraction and surveillance. They then leave us to deal with the detrimental effects of this business model, which can mean a devastating impact on mental health and well-being. These platforms are literally the antithesis of what we stand for and are themselves anti-social. That's why we are currently working with an organization called People vs Big Tech, to raise money for them to continue their work to rein in the Big Tech companies. We're selling a bath bomb called The Cloud, with all the sales price (minus the VAT) going towards starting a global youth network to reclaim social media from Big Tech. Would you say today that Lush will never return to social networks, whatever the consequences? Annabelle Baker - We would potentially, however we would need to see a complete change to the social media landscape. For us we would need to see accountability of these Big Tech companies who seem to act without regard for users' welfare despite overwhelming evidence that their services are doing a lot of harm. It would be a change of mindset and design on these social media platforms."
"""We want to become the makeup expert"", Gianluca Toniolo, Dolce&Gabbana Beauty","Premium Beauty News – What is your strategic objective with direct management, compared to the license system? Gianluca Toniolo - These two approaches involve different objectives. Direct management will help to elevate the beauty category to the same level of the other brand's products and build up a brand, whereas the license follows a more commercial approach. Dolce&Gabbana is the first Italian fashion company to have decided to directly manage its beauty category. And that is what Domenico and Stefano wanted; for them, it is a 30-year dream come true. Already at the beginning of their career they wanted to develop a beauty line, but they couldn't afford it. They see beauty products as essential fashion accessories, the finishing touch - of perfume or make-up - to enhance an outfit. Premium Beauty News - How are you planning to build up the Dolce&Gabbana Beauty brand? Gianluca Toniolo - We have defined a very clear strategy. We want to elevate the category with new products. For example, we launched the Devotion fragrance only a few months ago, and it is already among the Top 3 best-selling products. With a name as evocative as its composition, this perfume is a powerful expression of the brand's DNA, that is a great asset. We have the unique opportunity to work alongside the fashion division, create a direct link between these two territories, and shape up a unique, strong brand for consumers. As a result, for example, Devotion, characterized by the sacred heart, is a whole family of products: fragrance, make-up, bags and accessories, and a fine jewellery collection. So, our different categories will speak the same language and share the same codes. Lastly, another important objective is to engage with new, younger consumers. They will be able to enter the world of the brand through products with a lower price point to then discover other categories and, potentially, purchase them. Premium Beauty News - How would you define Dolce&Gabbana's DNA? Gianluca Toniolo - The brand embraces different values and codes, the most important being Italianness. Just like fashion, beauty products have Italian know-how; we only work with the best local artisans and producers. Premium Beauty News - Dolce&Gabbana Beauty is 100% made in Italy, then. Who are your partners? Gianluca Toniolo - For perfumes we mainly collaborate with two Italian companies: ICR Cosmetics, which boasts 70 years of experience in this category, and Cosmint, which belongs to the Intercos group, for make-up. Intercos is not just an industrial partner, in fact Dolce&Gabbana holds 8% of the floating capital. Among other partners, Ancorotti, leader in mascara. Lombardy has many excellent suppliers in the segment! Premium Beauty News - Which categories would you like to put forward? Gianluca Toniolo - We are targeting two segments, namely perfumes and cosmetics; we aim to become a best-selling global cosmetics brand. Starting from March 2024, we will relaunch the catalogue of the category with a new quality line that boasts the Italian excellence of our partners, a unique storytelling and the iconic lifestyle embodied by our DNA. The new line will include 180 references by the end of 2024 and will reach 300 by the end of 2025. Our goal is to become the make-up experts with a range that covers all skin types, in all regions of the world. We will enter the skincare category in 2025, but through make-up, and always with Italian partners. Premium Beauty News - How have you structured the company to go global? Gianluca Toniolo - 270 people from 27 different countries were recruited in less than eight months: 130 at the Milan headquarters, and 140 in our subsidiaries all over the world. We set up six subsidiaries, the largest being in Miami, where 70 employees directly manage the North and South American markets which are priority for us, because the brand is very strong there. The second subsidiary is based in Dubai, so we can easily manage the Middle East, and then we have Singapore for the Asia-Pacific region, as well as Paris, Milan, and Spain. Premium Beauty News - What about your retail distribution strategy? Gianluca Toniolo - On one hand there is the network of selective perfumeries and on the other we have the strategy of opening our own boutiques dedicated to beauty. The first has just opened in Hong Kong, at the end of the month there will be Indonesia and beauty flagships are planned in the main capitals of the world. There is also a digital strategy with the e-retail business of perfumeries. Finally, we want to dedicate important beauty spaces, approximately 25-30 m2, in around thirty of our main fashion stores around the world. We have already inaugurated these spaces in two emblematic Milanese shops, Via della Spiga and Via Montenapoleone. Dolce&Gabbana stands out from other fashion houses by dedicating important space to beauty. The founders really consider beauty as an important complement to fashion and want to direct the brand towards a lifestyle profile; we have also launched products for the home and collaborations in the food and drink sector. Premium Beauty News - Can you take stock of your first year? Gianluca Toniolo - The turnover has almost doubled since we will close 2023 with around 1.5 billion euros, while we started from 800 thousand euros. In the thirty years of licensing, the results have never been so good. This project is therefore a success, and it is supported by distributors and vendors who appreciate the strategy. They consider us pioneers. But making such a decision took a lot of courage, as entry barriers are very high. Dolce&Gabbana has invested more than 400 million euros to take over the category and finance it, but it is an investment from which the entire group will benefit."
Alexandre.J makes its mark on the ultra-niche perfume market,"Alexandre.J, it is the choice of a strong visual identity! The brand has opted for an assertive DNA, with bottles crafted and shaped using noble materials. It is a way of giving the object a touch of sensuality and desirability. Alexandre.J also relies on a clear olfactory bias, to open the doors of a prestigious and confidential perfumery to the public. The brand's strong visual identity is promoted via social networks, thanks both to the expertise of a creative team trained at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and to a community of dedicated followers. In 2016, the brand was distributed in 37 countries and 1,000 points of sales. Today, it is present in 85 countries and 3,000 points of sale, with a fairly even distribution, since the brand is active in the Middle East, Europe, Eastern European markets, and Latin America (Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Colombia). In Europe, Alexandre.J has 116 points of sale in Italy, around 40 in Spain and 10 in Germany. In France, it is distributed in 25 boutiques and plans to reopen its own shop in Paris in 2024. Alexandre.J is a family-run business, but it is also very close to its distributors, attentive to the specific characteristics of each market to which the brand adapts its offer. This agility is due in particular to the size of its range. Since 2012, Alexandre.J has launched around 200 products, a wide range that enables it to cover different segments of the confidential perfume market. The brand features products priced at 133 euros in its The Collector range, as well as more costly perfumes in its Art Nouveau Collection, and an extensive range of amateur pieces in the Atelier d'Artistes Collection. With the Art Nouveau Collection, launched last year, Alexandre J. is celebrating a time of great modernity. Hence the desire to explore new accords without turning its back on traditional perfumery. True to its original partners, the brand called on Studio Flair and perfumer Vanina Muracciole to work on original, addictive notes: date, a patchouli-raspberry accord, and oud freshened by jatamansi wood. Five eaux de parfums in hand-chiselled, sculpted 100 ml glass bottles with magnetic caps, priced at 370 euros. The Collection will soon be joined by a new floral fragrance. The brand has created some Extraits for each of its fragrances. A new 50% concentration for each fragrance, in which certain facets have been enhanced. These extracts are available in a 25 ml format, for 270 euros. The same care has been taken with the bottle, with the case signed by designer Lola Mercier. For the end-of-year festivities, Alexandre.J unveils its Art Nouveau Case. The epitome of luxury, a limited edition of 250 pieces worldwide, priced at 2,600 euros. This unique presentation case, specially designed for perfume collectors, contains the entire collection - eau de parfum and extracts. Alexandre.J has established itself as an accessible luxury perfumery but is now extending its offering to include upmarket products for a demanding clientele. It is a way of targeting every stratum of confidential perfumery, from Haute Parfumerie to Ultra Niche Perfumery."
"""Zero-waste will require cooperation,"" says The Body Shop's Georgie Coppin","The Body Shop began rolling out its refill concept in 2021. After two years, can you say whether this is a viable concept in terms of demand? Georgie Coppin - We've long been leaders in the ethical beauty sector, so our customers expect these kinds of innovations and packaging solutions from us. I think customers want brands to help them live more sustainably, and our refill stations are all about making it easier for people to reduce their impact on the planet, by making refilling convenient and easily accessible. We're definitely continuing to see a demand for these alternatives — 29.5% of customers have returned to re-purchase a refill since the launch of our refill stations, which is a higher repeat purchase rate than our plastic bottles (24.3%). We were also getting a lot of feedback from customers that they wanted more products to be available as a refill. So, this year we expanded our refill offering from shampoos, conditioners and shower gels to also include our makeup range. We now offer a refillable lipstick and a refillable foundation powder too. The brand is present in over 80 countries, so are refills available everywhere? Georgie Coppin - Yes! We are rolling out our refill stations globally. And our aim is to have a station in all of our eligible stores around the world by the end of 2024. However, refilling has not yet completely replaced plastic bottles, which are still available in stores. Georgie Coppin - We know that as a business we need to do more to help our planet, and our refill stations are just one part of our mission to help build a circular economy. This desire to be the best ethical, sustainable, inclusive company that we can be is at the very heart of everything we do. It's what guides us as a business. Currently, half of The Body Shop's plastic packaging comes from pre-existing plastic waste, with part of it coming from our partnership with Plastics For Change, one of our Community Fair Trade partners. Through this partnership we work with 2,000 waste collectors in India who receive fair prices for the plastic waste they collect, as well as access to better working conditions, and other social benefits. We've now collected 100 million plastic bottles (and counting) from the streets of India. Solids, refills and the banning of single-use products are among the solutions being considered in France to move towards a zero-waste bathroom. Are other solutions being considered elsewhere? Georgie Coppin - In some countries, customers can return their used cosmetics bottles to be cleaned and either re-used or recycled anywhere that it is possible to purchase beauty products. This makes refilling even more accessible to consumers. However, this would require collaboration between brands, either voluntarily or enforced by legislation. The concept of a zero-waste bathroom is only possible through a collaborative effort between businesses, governments and consumers. Why aren't things moving faster? Georgie Coppin - When we were developing our refill program, we carried out a survey to get a sense of consumers' attitudes towards refill solutions. We found that one of the main things preventing customers from switching to refills was convenience. That's why we set out to make refilling a convenient and easily accessible option that people could make part of their daily life, by aiming to have a refill station in all our eligible stores globally (even the smaller, more remote shops) by the end of 2024. Customers still want to enjoy the experience of using beauty products and aren't always willing to sacrifice this for the planet. So, for us, it's about making the product that creates the least waste easy by providing education on why refills are the best option. Can inflation be a brake on this ecological transition? Georgie Coppin - Inflation can definitely have an impact on developing and implementing these sorts of sustainable innovations for businesses. For The Body Shop, this is no different. However, our purpose; to fight for a fairer and more beautiful world, is our North Star, and reminds us that these efforts to reduce our impact on the planet are even more important during difficult times. For customers, those who engage in our refill scheme actually save money. So whilst inflation could be a blocker to them, we are doing what we can to make refilling financially attractive to consumers. When you buy a refill from us, you pay the same price as our standard 250ml plastic bottle version, but you get an extra 50ml of product for free each time. Is the zero-waste bathroom a utopia or the future of beauty? Georgie Coppin - Refills and packaging solutions are certainly a step in the right direction but getting to zero-waste can only be achieved through a collaborative effort between businesses, governments and consumers. All parties need to reach a common understanding and work together with this shared goal in mind if we are to achieve this."
Coelho Beauty joins the holistic scalp care band-wagon with new range,"Long before the scalp skinification trend, as hair care formulas were just starting to get more natural, in 2017, Adrien Coelho decided to create products meant to be at the root of hair beauty. ""As a trained hairdresser, I have always been passionate about hair beauty and health. As part of my job, I realized everyone had the same problems with dull, brittle, weakened hair. And since they did not know how to treat their hair properly, they blindly trusted the industry, although it targeted the symptoms, not the causes,"" he says. ""Consumers are much better educated about skincare than scalp care, and yet the latter ages six times faster than the face skin,"" he adds. Back from a training course in the United States, he started to develop natural formulas with a pharmacist specialized in skin problems to offer both efficacy and sensoriality. ""To me, it was essential to formulate products free from aggressive and controversial ingredients. I wanted to work on natural formulas and treat the scalp like we treat our skins, with essential oils for their emotional dimension, because our hair reflects our emotions,"" explains Adrien Coelho. His work resulted in four products composed of at least 95% of multifunctional ingredients of natural origin, like the serum-oil for the scalp, hair, face and body, which offers relaxing, antioxidant and anti-ageing benefits. Coelho is claimed to be a high-end, holistic brand which supports consumers in a comprehensive way. ""I felt like combining sensoriality – with woody, spicy fragrances – and efficacy. It took four years to develop these very pleasant, foaming textures,"" explains Adrien Coelho. Other than the serum-oil, the range boasts a micellar cleanser which can be used as a shampoo, a peppermint-based 4-in-1 cleansing, defining, conditioning moisturizer which can also be used as a mask, and a texturizing memory mist. The multifunctional approach is in line with an urban lifestyle that lacks space and time, and it minimizes waste. These minimalist formulas suit all hair types, and both men and women. ""We aim to go back to basics, with simplified routines, but optimum results, while preserving nature and hair health,"" he says. Launched last September, the range is available on the Coelho Beauty e-shop as well as in Oh My Cream stores. Prices range from 68 euros for the oil to 38 euros for the shampoo. Adrien Coelho aims to enter new markets soon, in particular the US and Brazil, and to broaden the range by targeting specific hair concerns. ""To be differentiating, I intend to develop highly targeted products focused on particular problems: eczema, hair loss, and thin or coloured hair. Of course, it is a booming segment, but everyone has pretty much the same offers, for curly and textured hair. We need to stand out by exploring and specializing in other areas. The pandemic made consumers feel like taking care of their hair again, and their expectations have got increasingly precise. It is time to satisfy them. My approach is meant to be educational, so that we go farther regarding hair treatment. The idea is to provide a highly customized solution to each hair problem, thanks to a targeted, expert range"", concludes Adrien Coelho."

Fragrance Creators looks towards the future during its 2023 Annual Meeting,"The main trade association representing the U.S. fragrance industry gathered members and industry stakeholders to celebrate its achievements and to anticipate what is coming around the corner during its 2023 Annual Meeting, held on November 14, at The Chart House in Weehawken, New Jersey. ""We focus on helping our members future proof their businesses,"" said Farah K. Ahmed, President & CEO, Fragrance Creators Association. ""I am proud that the association is at the forefront of using and developing new tools that optimize data and technology; our first-of-its-kind Data Insights Program will continue to deliver unique insights that empower our future focused agenda for people, perfume, and the planet."" Launched at the beginning of the year, the Fragrance Creators Association's Data Insights Program has been designed to track, monitor and harvest disparate data points, news, scientific developments, and other information from around the globe with the goal of unmatched forecasting of public policy, regulatory, and consumer and marketplace trends. Other key achievements celebrated at the Annual Meeting included: – prioritizing sound science, including through the publication of a white paper on the importance of comprehensive assessments in evaluating fragrance ingredients; – advocating for risk-based regulatory systems, including through the submission of dozens of comments to state and federal regulatory bodies; – providing access to key leaders at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Congress through exclusive meetings with individuals in the EPA Office of New Chemicals and Safer Choice, the FDA Office of Cosmetics and Colors and Office of the Chief Scientist, and in dozens of meetings with Members of Congress during the association's 2023 annual fly in; and, – advancing whole-of-industry stewardship by launching the Responsible Industry Stewardship pledge and advancing policies that support bringing sustainable innovation to market.

Anjac expands into luxury fragrance with Stephid acquisition in France,"After two acquisitions in Canada — Pillar5 and Apollo, in 2022 — the manufacturer of cosmetic products, medical devices, drugs and food supplements is expending its portfolio by taking over Stephid, a French company specializing in the manufacture of luxury perfumes, and high-end custom filling and packing. Founded in 1989 and based in Pont-Sainte-Maxence, in northern France, at about 50 kilometres from Paris, Stephid has a unique expertise in small production runs and luxury products that resembles craftsmanship and tailoring. The company benefits from strong relationships with luxury fragrance houses and designers, thanks to its mastery of cutting-edge techniques that are crucial to preserving the most fragile top notes. The company carries out the entire perfume manufacturing process, from maturing the concentrate to glazing the fragrance in polished stainless steel tanks from 100 to 3,000 litres, with a total capacity of 20,000 litres. Stephid also has the know-how to fill bottles and assemble the packaging and accessories relying on very precise manual skills. The company is therefore able to process small series (few dozen of units) as well as thousands of units. ""The teams also are also recognized for their distribution expertise of finished goods throughout the world and from every aspect of the logistical value chain,"" says Anjac in a press release. Stephid partners with more than 60 well-known fragrance brands and should achieve a turnover of nearly 15 million euros in 2023, with a double-digit growth compared to last year. With this operation, Anjac strengthens its offering on the luxury markets providing cutting-edge and tailor-made services and processes services with high added value, in particular for the high-end and niche perfume segment, which is extremely dynamic. ""Anjac will be able to benefit from Stephid's cutting-edge expertise in top-of-the- range manufacturing, packaging and kitting, with unique, tailor-made services of the highest quality. The Group is thus expanding its offering, providing additional expertise to support its customer portfolio regarding their cosmetics and perfumes ranges,"" highlights the company. Furthermore, Anjac's support will enable Stephid to expand its investment and production capacity and thus meet the growing demands of its customers. After Cosmetix West and Feltor in 2019, Roval Cosmétiques in 2020, Apollo and Pillar5 in 2022, Stephid is Anjac's 10th acquisition within the span of 6 years, doubling its turnover in 5 years. Anjac now includes 15 companies, with 22 R&D and manufacturing sites, and a turnover approaching EUR 700 million. Financial terms have not been disclosed, but Anjac said that Stephid's management team and governance remain in place."
Sephora seeks to boost business expansion in India with new partner,"Sephora, which made its first foray into India in 2012, today counts 26 stores across 13 cities. To boost its operations in a country, which is widely seen as the next growth hot spot for the cosmetics industry, the prestige beauty retailer has tied up a new partnership with Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (RRVL), the largest retailer in India, owned by billionaire Mukesh Ambani. As part of the partnership with Sephora, Reliance Beauty & Personal Care Limited – a wholly owned subsidiary of RRVL — will take over Sephora's current India operations from Arvind Fashions Limited, which was Sephora's partner for the last eight years. The transaction is valued at INR 990.2 million, about EUR 11.1 million. The buyout gives Reliance Retail Ventures exclusive rights to build and enhance Sephora's presence in India across all channels. ""Rising affluence, increasing urbanisation and the proliferation of social media have driven greater awareness of self-care and beauty, unlocking major opportunities for prestige beauty. It is an opportune time for us to invest in expanding our presence, and bring new, exciting, and exclusive brands to delight our growing community of beauty enthusiasts,"" said Alia Gogi, Asia President, Sephora. The Indian beauty and personal care market pegged at USD 17 billion (EUR 15,8 billion) and set to grow at a 11% CAGR [1], is still believed to be in its infancy; positioning India as one of the largest untapped consumer markets globally. According to a recent study by Kearney and Luxe Asia, prestige beauty markets in Southeast Asia and India are poised to enter a decade of double-digit growth, and the market could triple in size. These perspectives have trigger a strong struggle among beauty retailers in India, including Nykaa, Tira, Sephora and Shoppers Stop. The attractiveness of the market also sparkled recent high-profile moves in the country by brands such as Shiseido and Nars. ""The burgeoning Indian beauty market is being propelled by a new generation of customers with a strong desire to express their individuality, rising aesthetic refinement and a growing number of women in the young workforce of India. The Indian consumerism journey is at a tipping point, providing the perfect tail wind to this partnership,"" said V Subramaniam, Director, Reliance Retail Ventures Limited."
Pigmentarium puts the Czech Republic on the world perfume map,"The name of the brand, Pigmentarium, refers to the world of painting and to the Latin inscriptions that dot the façades of Prague's main buildings, and the brand's concept involves capturing the richness of the city in a fragrance. ""Each fragrance is related to an artist or a cultural discovery. Pigmentarium does not see itself as a perfume brand, because it is focused on the art of living; it is a platform that also connects Czech artists and craftspeople to highlight the treasures of Prague. Through our collaborations, we also play a curatorial role with regard to young artists"", explains Tomas Ric, the founder. ""Our path is related to human encounters and artistic affinities."" Pigmentarium is actually stepping up its collaborations with young international artists: poet Michaela Fenkl, sculptor Pauline Hagant, or fashion designer Arturo Obegero, all of whom have become ambassadors for the brand. The young perfume company has built itself a visual universe that is easily identifiable and influenced by the fashion world, which is where the artistic director comes from. This is conveyed by the aesthetics of the campaigns associated with the fragrances. Imagery is one of the pillars on which Pigmentarium's communication is based. ""During the Covid pandemic, the work we did on imagery opened new doors for us, by generating interest before even smelling the perfumes,"" says Tomas Ric. His stint in fashion also enabled him to unveil the limited edition of the Azabache perfume at the Paris Fashion Week, in 2021, reaching new targets. ""Right from the start, we were supported by major global magazines like Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and Elle... And also by Ingredients, the leading niche perfume store in Prague [1]: they believed in us from our very first fragrance"", he explains. Right now, the bottles are available in niche perfume stores in Prague, alongside French and global high-end perfume names. It has been a great journey for the founder, who says he initially invested his own money in the creation of the first opus, Ad Libitum. He collaborated with Czech independent perfumer Jakub F. Hiermann (co-founder who recently left the company), who created the series of the brand's first six perfumes. ""At first, we developed these fragrances at a fast pace to be able to build up a portfolio. Now, we are following a different tempo with one launch a year"", says Tomas Ric. ""The company doubles its turnover every year and our workforce has grown from three to seven employees. Also, I recently turned down several investment offers. We want to control our growth and keep our independence and initial state of mind, which is conveyed by the name of our first fragrance Ad Libitum"", he emphasizes. Right now, the Pigmentarium brand is present in 14 countries and 40 points of sale, in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, of course, but also across Europe. It is distributed by the Burmunk chain in the Armenian capital and has begun to conquer the Far East, starting with Uzbekistan. In Paris, it is available at Nose and Elevator. Tomas Ric explains that ""For each fragrance launch, we make a point of organizing a presentation in Paris, because this capital is essential for international recognition. We are supported by the Czech Embassy and Cultural Centre."" Pigmentarium also boasts a dedicated table at the Prague International Airport, which provides visibility alongside new local brands emblematic of the Czech art of living and creativity (fashion, design, fire arts, etc.). But the company aims to go global. ""We have just signed an agreement with distributors based in Dubai"", Tomas reveals. ""Pigmentarium's olfactory style is in line with the tastes of the Gulf countries,"" confirms Théo Belmas, perfumer-creator at Symrise. ""This new fragrance marks a transition. It is part of a new dynamic,"" says Tomas Ric, who chose to partner with French perfumer-creator Théo Belmas for his seventh fragrance, Oratorio. Invited to take an outside look at the city of Prague, Théo Belmas suggested immortalizing a poetic moment experienced during the visit of a magnificent Baroque church: the vision of a cloud of incense pierced by a ray of light. The fragrance takes shape around dualities: light and shadow, spiritual contemplation and urban effervescence. Théo Belmas delivers an original incense/pressed mandarin chord which crystallizes these sensations by reconciling contrasts. ""It is a simple, but very structured formula. A material-oriented fragrance I reworked until it really conveyed a story: that of an almost mystical vision mixed with the city's energy. The incense is concentrated at 10%, so it fully expresses its richness and complex facets in three oil forms: essential, pyrogenic, and resinoid. The hand-pressed mandarin extract brings out light and joy."" This structure is articulated with Egyptian neroli, both honeyed and animal-like, and with cedarwood from the Atlas mountains and Virginia. The base notes are opoponax and patchouli, with balsamic accents. The Oratorio fragrance reflects the symbiosis of two complementary creative energies. It also marks the strategic rapprochement between the Prague-based brand and Paris."

Shiseido and Nars expand into India with the opening of standalone boutiques,"As the Indian market continues to attract beauty brands looking for new growth drivers, the Shiseido group is accelerating its development in the country with the launch of Nars and the opening of a first standalone store for Shiseido Ginza Tokyo.

IL Cosmetics: from a single product to a global offering,"In 2023-2024, over 12 million euros have been invested in expanding production and filling capacities across all their product categories. For makeup, a second bulk production plant is under construction and will be ready by summer 2024, effectively doubling production capacity in that segment. As for the nail category, investments are primarily focused on the new semi-permanent technology. Regarding the turnkey offering, the company has implemented a plan to increase makeup filling capacities with a strong focus on process automation. The goal is to increase capacity by 30-40 million units between 2023-2024. The company's continued globalization will be achieved through both organic and external growth in two main directions: Product offering expansion This will be achieved through organic growth, including the introduction of semi-permanent products to cover the entire nail category as well as expansion in the make-up category with the arrival of complexion at IL Cosmetics. Additionally, external growth will accelerate the development of new product categories. Geographical expansion Starting with a commercial and industrial presence in North America. In this regard, IL Cosmetics has appointed Christine Rezagholi to lead business development in the USA. The second step in the group's geographical expansion will be Italy. Ultimately, the goal is to offer a complete range of makeup products to satisfy brands seeking a trusted partner capable of supporting them in all their developments."
Pulpe de Vie: the French upcycling pioneer brand expands in Europe,"Founded in Marseille by Julie Ducret in 2009, Pulpe de Vie initially promoted cosmetics made from unsold, inglorious, or incorrectly sized fruit sourced from regional producers. Perfectly in line with the current trends, the concept of upcycling has since been widely adopted: it reached a 30% growth rate in 2023, compared to last year, and a turnover superior to 3 million euros. Available in over 2,000 mass distribution points of sale in France (Carrefour, Casino, Lidl and Intermarché networks) and on its e-shop, pulpedevie.com, the brand now offers 40 organic-certified face care and body hygiene references, all made from downgraded fruit. And they cost less than 12 euros each. ""From face care to toothpaste, from solid deodorants to hair care products, we almost cover all bathroom needs now. Every product contains two fruit types, usually combined with two patented actives – in skincare formulas – and prebiotics. Our whole range offers prebiotics to help the skin naturally defend itself. We are the only ones to do that on the mass distribution skincare segment"", explains Julie Ducret. The products are 100% made in France, in one of the brand's four partner plants. In March 2023, the company raised 1.1 million euros to further boost its growth. This achievement helped double the number of employees, in particular by recruiting sales representatives, reaching 15 employees. Another part of the budget is dedicated to the digitalization of the concept, in the mainstream and social media, and to export. ""We opened to export this year, mainly in Europe, with Germany ahead, followed by Italy, Spain, Belgium, and Switzerland. And we are also considering expanding in the UK. We will gradually widen the circle, but we are looking to adopt the most positive model possible in terms of greenhouse gases – and it is not that simple"", says Julie Ducret. The third part of investments is focused on the brand's ecological transition. ""We aim to push our model further, not only to be less polluting, but also to become more regenerative, in particular by taking care of our farmers even better"", explains the entrepreneur. Pulpe de Vie has worked with about 20 local producers for 14 years: the brand has committed to buying two years of stock of unsold fruit to secure their income, which represents 20% additional revenue for them. ""We are not just a cosmetic brand. We have a real, extremely strong bond with the land and the living: we have a territorial pact, so we aim to strengthen our local concept. I strongly believe that we will get through all these global warming crises with this local approach, this local cooperation and support"", concludes Julie Ducret."
"How Snow Group revitalised Algotherm, a pioneer in marine cosmetics","Founded in 1962 with the ambition of using natural active ingredients extracted from seawater and seaweed, in cosmetics and beauty dermatology, Algotherm equipped itself in 1970 with a Research & Development Laboratory that was a pioneer in algotherapy and the cosmetic development of ocean resources. Over 60 years, dozens of species of seaweed have been studied and then adopted for use in the composition of high-performance complexes. After a spell with the Gilbert Group and a rather unsuccessful attempt to break into the pharmaceutical sector, the brand is getting back to basics under the aegis of Snow Group, its new owner. Under the Group's impetus, Algotherm aims to fully reintegrate the professional circuit — institutes and spas — by combining its historical expertise with the development of marine cosmeceuticals based both, on state-of-the-art active ingredients and a clearer definition of its DNA. As the European leader in the creation and management of spas (60 outlets in France and abroad), Snow Group is taking advantage of the combination of three brands with complementary identities: Cinq Mondes, Deep Nature and Algotherm. Within the Group's cosmetics division, Algotherm intends to become the benchmark in Marine Cosmeceuticals, a crossroads where the brand's marine expertise (now extended to all the oceanic riches), the innovations of pharmaceutical science and the achievements of cutting-edge medico-aesthetic cosmetology come together. The brand puts the spotlight on its ability to combine bio-assimilable natural marine extracts with market-leading dermatological active ingredients (hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, AHAs, niacinamide...). In 2022, two ranges were reformulated. The Ocean Life range, highly concentrated in the Algogene complex, which was supplemented with various active ingredients such as Bisabolol, Adenosine and Infra-Skin, and the Ocean Time line featuring a retinol-like active ingredient. This reformulation drive will continue in 2023. Eventually, it will cover the entire range, i.e. around sixty products. Paraben-free since 2004, the formulation is now silicone-free, with a minimum of 90% ingredients of natural origin in each formula. The brand boasts many responsible commitments, both in terms of product composition and the manufacture of packaging: short distribution channels, greater use of recycled plastics and glass, FSC-labelled paper and cardboard, double-sided printing on boxes to avoid inserting a leaflet... The brand has adopted a new identity in line with its repositioning. The new logo reflects the brand's scientific expertise and its move upmarket, while the curves of the lettering suggest the movement of waves. The ocean's depths are reflected in a colour palette that evokes marine life and naturalness. These shades, in harmony with the packaging, are visible in the interior design of the urban spa recently opened in Lyon. The surroundings combine sandy colours with blue-green spirulina shades. Finally, four colour codes were used to identify each of the product categories: anti-ageing, face expert, body expert and face all-rounders. Finally, the return to basics also entails a reassertion of the brand's presence on the professional circuit, with Thalasso Deauville Algotherm, the historic flagship where people come to indulge in the benefits of the ocean, and as an emblem of the brand's revival, the newly opened Dermo Ocean Spa, which has taken up residence near Place Bellecourt in Lyon. Located on two floors, the spa has six treatment rooms, including one double room. Algotherm spas are also opening up to biotechnology with new-generation equipment (LED treatment, cryotherapy or oxygen diffusers) and delivering hyper-personalised treatment protocols: thanks to the Dermoscan, skin therapists carry out an intelligent diagnosis of the needs of each skin type. Protocols are also evolving, with a wide range of face and body treatments, ranging from 15-minute flash treatments to 80-minute expert treatments. In short, a complete range designed to meet the growing demand for expert, personalised treatments."
"Cosmetic 360: ""The green transition is an innovation challenge""","Just like every year, the Cosmetic 360 show organized by the Cosmetic Valley will gather decision makers in the cosmetics and perfume industry and focus on a theme intended to delve into a forward-looking issue. The Cleantech theme chosen covers all technologies serving the green transition: decarbonation, waste management, circular economy, biomaterials... ""We are committed to highlighting the inspirations, whether they have already found applications or not, that can be useful to the cosmetics and perfume industry and contribute to its progress as regards environmental protection"", explains Franckie Béchereau. This common theme is vivid in the four-session programme of conferences. The first session will deal with new responsible consumption patterns: refills, bulk products, solid formulas... The trends will be highlighted by Beautystream and Euromonitor, among others. The second session will be focused on packaging ecoresponsibility: players like Aptar, Albéa and Minelli Group will share their own experiences. Then, the cosmetics industry decarbonation will be dealt with at the third session, through solutions like the biomass or the energy transition of manufacturing processes. Lastly, biosourced ingredients and technologies nurturing the circular economy will be addressed as part of the fourth session. Players like L'Oréal, Givaudan, LVMH and the Fondation de la Mer will provide their own visions and innovations. In the exhibition zone, various animation areas – both new and long-standing ones – will also be focused on the central theme, putting forward clean technology solutions. The brand new Innovation Center set up in partnership with IDEC, a company which provides support in implementing an energy transition, will gather a series of startups committed to new solutions. ""It is a new, very strong area, because the industry is highly concerned with this issue. We will provide solutions to the cosmetics industry's environmental challenges. The green and energy transition is definitely an innovation and competitiveness issue now"", says the Director. A Cleantech ""totem"" will help visitors spot the new ecoresponsible solutions showcased by the 250 exhibitors. And this year, a transversal award for the Best Cleantech Innovation will join the Cosmetic 360 Awards that recognize the best innovation in each expert field. The Tech Corner, in partnership with CNRS (The French National Center for Scientific Research), will put the spotlight on a green continuous flow extraction and potentiation technology intended to exacerbate the biological activity of molecules. The Factory will gather suppliers offering solutions to reduce water and energy consumption in the cosmetics industry. And this year, the Startup Station will welcome about 30 young companies developing clean innovations. It is sponsored by Beauty Tech Chartres, which will emphasize the support provided to entrepreneurs in developing their companies. Lastly, Greentech will offer an immersive experience involving a 3D screen technology for the development of sustainable ingredients. ""As the organizers, we are also committed to getting the LEAD label certification attributed to sustainable events"", says the Director. Also, Artificial Intelligence and other digital technologies (Blockchain, RFID, additive manufacturing...) will be introduced in the Deeptech area, through practical demonstrations of their industrial applications. ""We will reproduce a value chain live, so visitors can follow the product, check how it is controlled, identified, and eventually sold to customers. Each partner will showcase a technology at different phases"", explains Franckie Béchereau. As far as trends are concerned, two new zones were created this year. The first will be dedicated to perfumes – the Centdegrés agency will offer a global approach to the market –, the other to K Beauty, with South-Korean brand Elroel. As a complement to the show's business meeting objective, various events will take place during the week of October 16-22, with industrial and cultural visits related to research, innovation, and distribution. These will include a tour to a vertical farm in Tarascon, in the south of France, a Retail Tour, a symposium on sustainable development organized by the Canadian Cosmetic Cluster, and of course, the Gala night, the key networking event of the week. This year's show should be inaugurated by the French Ministers of Ecological Transition and Industry, Mr Béchu and Mr Lescure. So far, with 250 exhibitors, the companies' participation has been the most significant since the event was created. ""There is a resolute return of global companies, after the Covid pandemic, in particular Chinese ones, but also new delegations, such as a Belgian group, and Canadians and Iranians as visitors. We are actually expecting 4,500 visitors this year"", says Franckie Béchereau. These dynamics will be further highlighted with the 2024 show announcement: Cosmetic 360 will celebrate its 10th anniversary next year. ""We will announce special operations to achieve a strong global reach"", promises the Director."

Anne Camilli's Musée à la Carte brings the luxury industry's treasures to life,"Anne Camilli is passionate! Trained as an interpreter/translator, her professional experience began with a perfume raw materials trading company, followed by 18 years with the designer Serge Mansau. ""I discovered the world of perfume and beauty, along with the beautiful objects, associated with these products throughout history,"" explains the founder of Musée À la Carte®, an Agency dedicated to promoting the cultural heritage of brands and the luxury industry. In 2007, to mark the fortieth anniversary of the Cosmoprof trade show in Bologna, she was called on to coordinate the creation of a book, Bellezza, dedicated to the history of beauty objects and it was to be the start of a new life for Anne Camilli! Following on from this, she coordinated the publication of Lèvres de luxe, a book on the history of lipstick by Jean-Marie Martin-Hattemberg, an expert in art objects. At the initiative of the French Consulate, the book was transformed into an exhibition in Hong Kong. ""Then I was asked to broaden my approach to arts and crafts, and I took on one project after another. The challenge was always to stage high-quality exhibitions, often in record time. It became my trademark and what gave me the idea of Musée À la Carte® concept,"" explains Anne Camilli. Altogether, nearly thirty exhibitions and almost as many books and catalogues have been created to celebrate the French savoir-faire around the world: from the art of make-up to perfume, from watchmaking to jewellery, from goldwork to lace, from fashion accessories and French leather goods to the department stores of the Roaring Twenties. And Anne Camilli caught herself up in the game! ""Throughout our projects, my husband and I have built up a real collection of heritage objects for Musée À la Carte®, as well as an extensive iconographic collection."" In addition to cultural venues, brands and players in the luxury goods industry are now seeking her expertise to highlight their heritage and history. ""I aim to promote today's industrial know-how and artistic crafts, drawing on the historical roots of French beauty and elegance. The heritage to explore is so vast that there's no shortage of subjects! In the archives of many companies, or private collections, we often find beautiful little treasures for marketing departments or designers to exploit. Especially at a time when we're looking to reconnect with the roots of luxury,"" she points out. Today, Anne Camilli's Musée À la Carte® delivers tailor-made projects all over the world, to the specifications, budgets and deadlines set by its clients. The agency's latest project, Séduction & Pouvoir, a major exhibition on the art of dressing up at the court of French sovereigns in the 17th and 18th centuries, at the Musée du Domaine Royal de Marly has just closed its doors. ""We can set up an exhibition in a shopping centre, a museum or an industrial site, create a thematic book, a catalogue or a historical film, devise experiments or workshops for the general public or professionals... We design projects from A to Z, with experts, historians, artists, scenographers, translators... and even cooks if necessary! Our photographic archives and our contacts with numerous museums and collectors allow us to save precious time,"" continues Anne Camilli. It is a work that leads her to constantly discover the wealth of techniques and know-how developed in France and Europe since the Renaissance, and right up to the present day, to create an authentic industry of beauty and elegance. ""The setting up of projects always involves a great deal of research and the support of historians and specialists. It's great teamwork, and in the end, a job of passion, sharing and transmission...,"" she concludes."

Paying homage to the brand's founder, Charles-Edouard Barthes, it fusions brand's signature gold and ink-blue colour scheme, along with unique totemic carvings on the ceiling, to create an ambiance reminiscent of a palace of fine craftsmanship. Additionally, the new store boasts a meticulous product display, an exclusive skincare area, and a facial device testing zone. To recreate the essence of a brand unique spa and offer an ultimate skincare experience, EviDenS de Beauté brings La Maison, the brand's flagship beauty parlour in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, to Hangzhou. This secluded spa room, nestled within Intime Department Store, caters to EviDenS de Beauté's esteemed VIP clientele. In the EviDenS de Beauté spa room, the brand treats customers to a luxurious beauty regimen akin to that of royalty. Before embarking on facial treatments, skincare specialists assess each client's skin condition and lifestyle habits to tailor a personalized skincare experience. The room's decor plays a pivotal role in the overall experience, with soft lighting, plush tatami flooring, and a ceiling adorned with subtle bas-relief motif, creating an environment that radiates warmth and comfort. In conjunction with the opening, EviDenS de Beauté also launched a nine-day pop-up store, illuminating the brand's emblem on an exterior wall and a large electronic screen. The 3D-carved emblem showcases the noble family crest of the brand's founder, Charles-Edouard Barthes, while beneath it lies a portrayal of the brand's French elegance in a floral and avian motif, accompanied by the brand philosophy — ""Youth is relative, Love is absolute."" This installation visually reflects EviDenS de Beauté's noble lineage and commitment to quality. ""Our new boutique and brand spa room serve as essential platforms for direct communication between the brand and consumers, enabling consumers to not only enjoy professional skincare services but also gain a deeper understanding of our products. These spaces also allow us to directly capture consumer feedback, understand their needs and expectations, and thereby enhance products and services,"" said Sophie K/vella, Global Marketing Director EviDenS de Beauté. ""Building upon our existing online presence, EviDenS de Beauté is strategically expanding its offline footprint. We aim to provide Chinese consumers with a comprehensive and unparalleled luxury skincare experience,"" Sophie added."

Candles and home fragrances: Denis & Fils speeds up automation,"Premium Beauty News - At Denis & Fils, you recently made investments to further modernize your production tool. What is at stake? Yannick Salaün - With its 121 years of experience, the company boasts a significant pool of machines aged from 6 months to 30 years old. Our 5,000 m2-plant is divided into six different production halls, so we offer a very large range of home fragrances. This investment is the logical continuation of our innovation strategy, which addresses three main issues. First, we need to satisfy our customers' requests on time: speed has become key for them. Now, we can deliver a few of our permanent references in 24 hours! Secondly, we have been working on making our traditional and technical know-how more durable: for example, our skills cover the whole candle-making process, which includes pouring, pressing and extrusion, so we can offer made-in-France products. Plus, our modernization investments help recruit younger staff, in a region where the unemployment rate is very low. Lastly, we aim to remain competitive and keep offering cutting-edge products, although the market is getting increasingly global and candles are negotiated to the nearest cent... Premium Beauty News - In which equipment have you invested the most? Yannick Salaün - We aimed to make our production faster, more accurate, and more efficient... So, the company massively invested in automation: we actually doubled the number of robots in 12 months. Now, what we need is increase our profitability and efficiency, while remaining flexible enough to guarantee a broad product offering. We have a catalogue of more than 2,000 references, so our machines should be as well-adapted as can be. Therefore, we invested in automation to depalletize glass, which now automatically comes on trays, as well as in packaging automation, and in palletization, thanks to ""cobots"", i.e. collaborative robots fitted with sensors. These devices make it possible for operators to safely work around the machine: the tiniest shock makes the robot disengage. This way, arduous, tiring gestures are reduced. Automation also comes with ""semi-automation"". The luxury segment, to which our Denis Private Label entity is dedicated, requires a unique treatment: we can now allocate a single, perfectly adapted line to the fragile containers that need particular attention, so a few tasks are carried out manually, with the greatest care. Premium Beauty News - To what extent are your decisions guided by your CSR policy and the energy crisis? Yannick Salaün - Before the current crisis, our CSR policy was already at the core of our strategy. And it also represented a major challenge for our customers. It is conveyed by our constant search for new, more sustainable materials in relation to sourcing and environmental impact, during transformation, transport... We had already started to radically reduce our use of plastic-based products, which were replaced with cardboard packaging and FSC-certified cases. As for waste management, raw materials are recycled: aluminium (in particular in buckets), cardboard, glass, and paraffin. The energy crisis definitely sped up our action: there is no doubt our trade is energy-intensive, including when heating or transporting paraffin. So, we aim to considerably reduce our energy consumption and carbon footprint, which is why we have had an in-house life cycle assessment tool since 2018. Ultimately, as regards formulation, the share of vegetable wax in poured candles has increased a lot. We have offered an alternative to paraffin since 2012, when we launched the first candle made from plant-based wax! During the crisis, the price of paraffin doubled, and we cannot just systematically pass on price increases to our customers... Also, we have been looking for new bases to best meet our prestigious customers' requirements. This dense programme will go on until 2026, since we have planned to rethink the whole site to comply with the French ICPE standard on installations classified as environmentally friendly. On the occasion of the next Fragrance Innovation Summit, Denis & Fils will present its solutions for combining luxury and performance in the creation of home fragrances.

"Luxury: After Kering, Richemont also creates a perfume and beauty division","The move comes on the heels of a similar announcement by Kering in February, who appointed ex-Estée Lauder Raffaella Cornaggia as Chief Executive Officer of Kering Beauté, before the acquisition of heritage fragrance brand Creed in June. In 2022, Italy's Dolce & Gabbana announced the internalisation of its beauty activities in 2022 through Dolce & Gabbana Beauty, as well as a partnership with Intercos for the production of fragrances and cosmetic products. Effective 1 September 2023, Richemont has appointed ex-Firmenich Boet Brinkgreve as CEO of the new division — named Laboratoire de Haute Parfumerie et Beauté. He reports to Johann Rupert, Chairman of Richemont SA. ""Boet will establish and lead our new Laboratoire de Haute Parfumerie et Beauté to enable our six Maisons already involved in fragrance to reach critical mass in this highly competitive field, where scale is crucial. In partnership with the Maisons, and while respecting their unique high-end positioning, the platform will leverage resources across our Maisons to help develop the most refined creations and promising licenses,"" said Johann Rupert in a statement. Mr Brinkgreve's thirty-year career has been primarily in the chemicals, fragrances and flavour industries spanning the US, China and Europe. He joins Richemont from dsm-firmenich where he held a number of senior executive positions from 2007 till 2023, his latest role being President of Ingredients division & Group Procurement and a member of the dsm-firmenich's Executive Committee. Prior to that, he worked for DuPont in business development roles from 2003 till 2007, and beforehand as an entrepreneur founded several start-ups. A Dutch-born Swiss national, Boet Brinkgreve graduated from the University of Eindhoven/HTS Den Bosch, Netherlands, in Mechanical Engineering (1993) and holds a Masters' degree in Business Administration from Insead, France (2012). Following this announcement, the Interparfums stock had rough time at the Paris stock exchange, with concerned from investors about a possible end of the licenses granted by the Swiss group to its French partner in perfumes. The Montblanc and Van Cleef & Arpels licenses represented 29% of Interparfums' 2022 sales. In February 2022, however, Interparfums announced the renewal of its license with Montblanc until 2030."
Coco & Eve boosts R&D and broadens presence in Europe,"Inspired by the wellness and hair care culture of the island of Bali, Australian entrepreneur Emily Hamilton created Coco & Eve in 2018. Initially focused on hair care, the brand now puts forward the multiple botanical ingredients found in Indonesia and the tropics. ""The first – and now cult – product, our Like a Virgin mask, resulted in 1.5 million units sold. It gave its name to the whole range. Based on natural ingredients, including a fig extract and coconut oil, we created a clean, short formula to restructure the hair fibre. So, the category that launched the brand was hair care: it now represents 50% of our turnover and portfolio"", explains Nassim Belhaq, Director of Innovation of Coco & Eve. Today, the brand boasts about thirty, mainly hair care and self-tanning references, but there are also sunscreens, and face care products will soon be launched as well: the first range is expected this September. If it was always particularly active online, including on social media, the brand gradually opened to retail. By the end of the year, it will count over 2,500 physical points of sale around the world. Just like Australian brand Sand & Sky, Coco & Eve is part of the Supernova group, also founded in 2013 by Emily Hamilton and husband Alex Ostrowski. It has a team of 150 employees at the Singapore headquarters, but the production team is European – mostly Italian –, although sun products are made in Australia. Boasting a 240% growth since 2021 and a soaring turnover which has doubled every year, over the past three years, Coco & Eve is booming. ""Several factors can explain why we were able to appeal to the typology of consumers we wanted to target, i.e. the Gen Z and Late Millennials, who are very fond of social media: naturalness, the brand's aestheticism, with a visual identity easily identified on social media, and the formulation history, focused on the efficacy of ingredients derived from South-East Asia botanicals. It is the convergence of all these key elements that made us successful. Plus, recently, we refocused our strategy on science, to get even better results than in the past two years"", explains Nassim Belhaq. Over the past two years, 300% of additional resources were allocated to innovation, so that the brand launched more than ten new products in 2023, including a sun care range composed of four high-performing SPF products, and about 20 launches are scheduled for 2024. This way, it puts an emphasis on new actives with high, proven dermatological efficacy. ""While we kept a formulation basis inspired from botanical ingredients to preserve the brand's initial signature, for our latest launches, we also worked on a different positioning to instil more science to our actives and make them more technical, for example by using biotechnologies"", says the Director of Innovation. ""Our product development strategy is based on categories. For hair care, we aim to push forward our expertise and achieve more targeted benefits, because treatment is a growth driver in this segment. We will also keep investing in sun care to enhance our self-tanning expertise. And as for skincare, we would like to gain ground by investing in biotech and green tech. Basically, what we are trying to do is make more premium, more ecodesigned formulas"", he adds. The brand is distributed in about 40 countries around the world, mainly in North America and Australia. These markets account for 75% of its turnover. But it is also present in South-East Asia – Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand... Now, it is developing on the European selective network: first, in the United Kingdom, but also in France, Italy, Switzerland, and Germany, where it aims to strongly increase its turnover."
Technature to invest 3 million euros in new production tools,"Founded in 1996 near Brest, in Brittany, west of France, the SME has emerged as one of the world's leading manufacturers of powder masks for the beauty industry. The company, which forecasts an increase of 17 and 20% in its sales this year, anticipates another growth of 40% for the next financial year. To support this expansion, Technature has announced that it is investing 3 million euros to equip its two sites in Relecq-Kerhuon and Dirinon, in France, with a dozen of new machines. With a turnover of 22 million euros, half of which is generated internationally, Technature has been able to develop unique know-how and recognized technological expertise, particularly in the sector of peel-off masks, which the SME custom designs and manufactures for beauty brands around the world. The new investments will make it possible to increase the production and innovation capacity of the company to meet the growing demand of its customers. ""This period of investment and planned growth is further proof of Technature's commitment to providing superior cosmetic products in line with market trends and consumer preferences,"" the company said in a statement. Innovation is at the heart of Technature's strategy, which currently employs 19 people in its research and development department, out of a total of 160 staffs. The company relies in particular on the production of hydrogel masks and patches, a unique technology in Europe that allows it to stand out on the market. As part of its international expansion, Technature, which already markets its products in Europe, North and South America, Asia and the Middle East, also plans to enter the African market, where it currently has little presence."
Coty bets on mass perfumery to expand in Brazil,"Coty already markets in Brazil its portfolio of international brands, which covers all beauty categories such as make-up, fragrances, hair and body care, but also a series of national brands including Monange, Risqué, Bozzano, Paixão and Cenoura & Bronze. Aiming to strengthen its market share in the country, the company will now offer Brazilian consumers a selection of its lines of perfumes intended to be marketed at attractive prices in mass retail channels. ""Brazil is a giant consumer market for mass perfumes and entering the segment is a strong opportunity for us"", explained Nicolas Fischer, president of Coty Brasil and Coty LatAm. According to 2021 data from Euromonitor, Brazil is indeed the world's second largest perfume market and the world's leading market for mass-market perfumery, a segment that accounts for 94% of the entire perfume category in the country, i.e. a turnover of approximately 8 billion Brazilian reals in retail prices. ""This figure should continue to grow,"" said the executive. According to Nicolas Fischer, the strong growth potential of mass perfumery in Brazil is due to still limited distribution. ""We intend to fill this gap, in particular by introducing our products in pharmacies and specialized stores, which lack this type of offer on their shelves. We not only want to enter a new segment, but also act in this market in a different way than what has been done so far."" Popular stores and e-commerce are also part of Coty's strategy. ""Exploring these channels is an opportunity to maximize the availability of our products,"" said the manager. With the aim to select the fragrances that will be part of the portfolio to be introduced in the country, Coty carried out a study of the olfactory preferences of Brazilian consumers. ""We worked hard to understand the preferences of Brazilians and define the product mix according to their tastes. We have decided to highlight floral, woody, aromatic and oriental fragrances,"" highlighted Nicolas Fischer. Five brands were selected for this operation. ""Our David Beckham, Gabriela Sabatini and Katy Perry line of fragrances are likely to resonate with their respective fans. Adidas also has the potential to appeal to sports fans. Good Kind Pure is more focused on Generation Z,"" added Fischer. All these fragrances include male and female versions and will be available in Brazil in different sizes, for an initial launch of 15 new references. Beyond the consolidation of its presence in the consumer segment, Coty will of course continue the development in Brazil of its premium perfume brands such as Chloé, Gucci, Burberry, Calvin Klein and Boss. ""Mass perfumes were the missing piece of our portfolio in Brazil and we are very excited to enter this new segment"", concluded Nicolas Fischer."
Beauty brands creation platform Blanka raises USD2 million seed round,"Blanka has closed an oversubscribed USD 2 million seed funding round led by Dundee Venture Capital, with participation from Storytime Capital, Disruption Ventures and other notable investors including Fatima Yusuf, former executive at Shopify, and Manica Blain, a consumer-focused investor and Founder of Top Knot Ventures. Founded in 2021 by Kaylee Astle, Doug Long, and Adam Chuntz, the North American private label beauty and wellness platform aims to power and accelerate the disruption of the beauty and wellness industry by doing away with high manufacturing minimums, long production lead times, and analogue order forms. The company promises that new beauty brands can debut on the market in under an hour, with just a few clicks and for less than USD 200. ""The industry has seen a fundamental shift in the last decade, from being owned by a few global players towards a more diverse set of direct-to-consumer brands. Independent brands have now captured more than 25% of the global beauty industry,"" says Kaylee Astle, Co-founder and CEO of Blanka, who experienced the challenges of trying to launch her own beauty brand. ""This has created a wave of entrepreneurs, content creators and beauty professionals all hungry to enter the market with their own brand, but there hasn't been anything to support them - until now."" Available to anyone with an idea, Blanka's platform is a one-stop-shop, from product procurement, to personalization, all the way to fulfillment. Supporting both established and nascent brands, Blanka sources and customizes North American-made beauty and wellness products. ""The beauty industry continues to evolve, but one thing that has remained constant is the market's exponential growth over the years, even amidst economic cycles. The success of this fundraising round, especially in this market, underscores that the beauty industry is bulletproof,"" said Glenn Baptiste, former L'Oréal executive and advisor to Blanka. ""Blanka's platform will unlock faster innovation for brands at all sizes. I'm excited about what's to come - for both Blanka and what this means for the beauty industry broadly."" Blanka claims to have subscribed thousands of brands within ""12 months of steady growth"" fueled entirely by organic marketing and strategic integrations with partners like Shopify. The platform curates a large selection of North American-made vegan and cruelty-free beauty products — including lipsticks, skincare, brow kits, and more — that can be customized with the brand's logo. Blanka handles branding, fulfillment and shipping to offer an immediate solution that comes with zero minimums. ""Kaylee's experience in and around launching brands has uniquely positioned their team to develop a platform that is demonstrating impressive and sustained growth,"" said Neil Grunberg, Managing Partner at Storytime Capital. ""As we learned more about the business, it was clear that Blanka was a great fit to Storytime's thesis of supporting early-stage companies that can have a massive impact on the future of work."" ""The beauty industry may be massive and well-established, but it is still shockingly disjointed and inefficient. Blanka is paving the way for the future of the industry,"" explains Catherine Williams, Partner at Dundee Venture Capital. ""By dramatically reducing the barrier to entry for independent brands, Blanka is set to transform the landscape for consumers. We are really excited to be a part of that journey."""
Lush taps into the Barbie craze with a limited-edition collection,"The Barbie x Lush collection offers a complete range of personal and beauty care products in the doll's quintessential pink hue. ""We imagined what Barbie's self-care routine would look like and created this range, meant to be used and loved by all. The collection is for everyone who wants to embrace the power of the colour pink,"" explained Melody Morton, Creative Concepts Director at Lush Cosmetics. The Barbie x Lush collection is available on the Lush app since August 9th and in Lush stores since August 10th.

Products in packaging are part of the brand's closed-loop recycling program, Bring It Back, which encourages customers to bring their empties to a local Lush shop for money off their same day purchase, or five empty pots for a free Fresh Face Mask."
Kao Corporation acquires Australian sun care brand Bondi Sands,"Founded in 2012 in Melbourne, Australia, Bondi Sands specializes in self-tanning, suncare, skincare and body products. Named after Australia's most iconic beach, the brand quickly grew a strong global following by consumers interested in its easy to use products claiming clean and sustainable formulation for a natural looking tan. In addition to their extensive self-tanning assortment, Bondi Sands offers a range of sun and skin care products, including broad-spectrum sunscreens designed to protect the skin from harmful UVA and UVB rays, as well as after-sun products to soothe and nourish the skin post-sun exposure. Bondi Sands suncare products are available in over 32 countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In Australia, where sun care awareness is extremely high, Bondi Sands has a leading share of the self-tanning market, enabling consumers to achieve a tan without the damaging effects of the sun. ""Bondi Sands is an incredible brand and a perfect fit for the Kao Consumer Care Business portfolio,"" said Karen Frank, President, Consumer Care Business, Americas and EMEA at Kao Corporation. ""The addition of Bondi Sands to our consumer family of brands will greatly advance our mission to be the preeminent leader in the global skin protection business and continue our journey of offering diverse products that promote a 'Kirei' lifestyle that is healthy, inclusive and sustainable for all,"" she continued. The Kao Group has positioned skincare as one of the key growth drivers in its mid-term management plan. With the acquisition of Bondi Sands, Kao will put an even greater focus on the skin protection category, with the aim to establish a firm position globally in the sunscreen and self-tanning markets. Kao intends to leverage its expertise in UV care and self-tanning technologies to expand Bondi Sands' global business portfolio and further accelerate its business growth. ""The integration of Kao's renowned scientific and technological resources into our operations is an unparalleled opportunity that will significantly contribute to the exponential growth of our brand, empowering us to further expand our product offerings and advance our research and development initiatives.

Cosmoprof North America achieves 20% increase in attendance over last year,"Attendance at Cosmoprof North America grew by 20% this year compared to 2022, when the main beauty event in the region registered about 32,000 visitors. The event had an unprecedented number of US and international retailers, buyers, distributors, and brands such as Walmart, Nordstrom, Costco, Neiman Marcus, Macy's, Target, The Detox Market, Belk, Thirteen Lune, Sally Beauty, Unilever, Estée Companies, E.L.F.

Cosmoprof North America will return to the Mandalay Bay Convention Center, July 23-25 2024. Meanwhile, Cosmoprof North America Miami will make its debut in Miami Beach, Florida, January 23–25, 2024."
"S'Young International, a new Chinese cosmetic giant?","""In the past, S'Young Group was more driven by the dual business of operating self-owned brands and helping foreign brands to better distribute in China"", says Juliette Duveau, the co-founder of consulting agency The Chinese Pulse. But the group founded in 2018 is no longer content with its role of distribution partner in China. Last year, S'Young purchased French brands Pier Augé and EviDenS de Beauté. ""We can foresee that S'Young will integrate the international channels and R&D techniques of these two French brands, paving the way to the international market for its other self-owned brands in the future"", she adds. These equity acquisitions of foreign brands also contribute to upgrading the group's image, from Middle-Low end to more high-end. S'Young's own brands – such as Yunifang (御泥坊), which has over 10M followers on Tmall – mainly target the Chinese mass market with a huge customer base, especially in lower tier cities. Through the acquisition of foreign brands, the Group could reach more affluent customers in higher tier cities and might develop higher-end products to go global. Last year, S'Young also acquired the Chinese brand Dermdoc (戴摩道克) specialized in skin repair from the group Hangzhou Songyang. Analysts noted it made S'Young enter the territory of Winona (薇诺娜), Chinese group Bethany's brand positioned on sensitive skin treatment, which ranked in the Top 10 of national brands at the recent June shopping festival on several e-commerce platforms. ""Since 2017, the growth rate of China's sensitive skincare market has been higher than the overall skincare market's, and it has strengthened, especially after the epidemic"", observes Juliette Duveau. According to the 2022 Chinese Sensitive Skin Market Trend report, issued by Taobao and T-mall, around 45% of the Chinese population have a sensitive skin, and most of them are women in their twenties living in tier 2 and tier 3 cities. In this field, consumers mainly expect products focused on skin barrier enhancement, skin redness repair, and anti-inflammation. S'Young also introduces itself as the pioneer of the ""CP (Chinese Partner) model"", which consists in helping global brands grow and adapt to the Chinese market, by providing a comprehensive solution for the brand, product adaptation, sales, and distribution networks (online and offline). This approach is different from the ""Tmall partner model"" offered by the Chinese platform to global brands used to cross-border trade with China. ""While the Tmall partner model only focuses on the digital ecosystem of its own group, S'Young can provide diversified online and offline sales channels (shopping malls, select shops)"", explains Juliette Duveau. Last year, the group actually opened a physical store called Shuiyangtang (水羊堂, ""the temple of S'Young"") in Changsha, to offer all its brands and its partners' on a 300-m2 area. Given the brands that trust S'Young with the CP model (Kiko Milano, Fenty Beauty, Liérac…), the group has positioned itself on a rather premium niche segment. ""Niche brands hold a relatively small share of the market and have a relatively low awareness compared to established brands. Competition on China's beauty market is very fierce. But as Chinese consumers become more sophisticated and pursue personality expression, niche brands with sharp brand identities and values ushered in their opportunities. The continued popularity of niche brands challenges the established or mainstream beauty brands who tend to re-examine their brand image to better meet the needs of the young generation."" Still, S'Young's many initiatives have not received much praise from the Chinese financial press, which points at the group's declining profitability (it is listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange) and the need to find growth drivers on the now highly competitive Chinese market. ""For now, the group will remain focused on the Chinese market"", says Juliette Duveau. ""There is still a long way to go before it actually goes global""."
Hilo: 100% plant-based ecocapsules to customize day creams,"The Hilo adventure started from a simple, dreadful observation: the huge waste of cosmetic products in France. ""Almost one woman out of two says they throw products before they are empty, according to an Ifop study conducted for Laboté"", explains co-founder Élise Postil. ""One of the main reasons is that they think these skincare products are not adapted to their skins"", she adds. Passionate as they are about homemade skincare, Élise Postil and Margaux Brunel made their own creams for years, so they were perfectly adapted to their skins' needs, and at the right moment. In 2020, the two friends joined forces to imagine the brand Hilo. Both had studied communication and marketing, so they contacted French laboratories to take care of the formulation, research and development, and production, and started working hand in hand with their new partners to develop the very first natural, anti-waste, customizable skincare product in the Hilo range. The Hilo customizable day cream combines a neutral base composed of 99.7% natural ingredients and three 100% natural vegetable oils to select from a choice of six: hazelnut, sweet almond, argan, apricot, carrot, and primrose oils. Consumers directly select the oils they need according to their desires, and especially on their skin concerns. They can also carry out a skin diagnosis online and get some guidance. Once the order has been placed, they receive a neutral base with a cream-gel texture that suits all skin types, and three ecocapsules to be poured in the base. The ecocapsule sleeve which contains the oils chosen is made from pullulan, a material derived from tapioca. The refillable jar is 100% recyclable, and so is the refill. ""We have two development priorities: increase public attention thanks to the brand's presence in pop-up stores, at physical events, and hopefully at certain selective retailers', and complete our offering by developing a full face care routine"", says Élise Postil. ""As for the first objective, the brand was at the VivaTech show last June, and it will be in the spotlight at the end of November, at the Showroom No Bad Day, in Lyon, France, as well as on December 15-17, at the event space In Sted, also in Lyon. Our presence is also under negotiation in Parisian venues, and we have been discussing possible agreements with selective beauty companies, but it is much too early to talk about it"", she concludes."
Coty raises growth forecasts and details global strategy in Paris,"Coty, which will celebrate its 120th anniversary next year, detailed its strategy and outlook for European investors on Thursday July 6 in Paris. The event follows the company's recently announced intention to explore a dual listing on Paris Euronext. It comes only two months after it presented its ambitions for ultra-premium skincare and scenting at an event in Grasse, France. However, the group's CEO, Sue Nabi, said the project of listing on Paris was still in the ""exploratory phase"". At the same time, she also announced the company is significantly increasing its guidance on Q4 FY23 revenue growth to +12-15% on a like-for-like (LFL) basis, up from its previous outlook for +10% growth. Coty now expects FY23 adjusted EBITDA of USD 965-970 million. Coty, which has an extensive portfolio of brands covering ""all price ranges and all beauty categories and trends"", sees significant growth potential in its prestige division (63% of its current sales). ""Premium skincare and makeup each account for less than 5% of the group's sales"", said Sue Nabi. The success of Lancaster in China and the announcement of new innovations for the ultra-premium brand Orveda go in this direction. As far as fragrance are concerned, the strongest category within the prestige division, the group is engaging a ""luxification"" strategy, with in the launch of the Infiniment Coty Paris collection in 2024. ""Designer brands still dominate the market but niche pure players are performing the best,"" emphasized Caroline Andreotti, Chief Commercial Officer Prestige. As consumers in the United States and in Europe are increasingly buying fragrances for themselves, rather than for gifting, and as the frequency of purchases is increasing, they are preferring more prestige products. In a recent report, McKinsey forecasted a luxury boom in the beauty industry, saying the premium and ultra-premium beauty segments had the potential to double by 2027, from around USD 20 billion today to around USD 40 billion. Present in 125 countries, Coty also believes that it has significant growth opportunities in several geographical areas. The group wants to rely on its prestige brands to expand in China, a country which represents 12% of the global beauty market but generates only 4% of Coty's turnover. Prestige brands will also be instrumental to expand the group's sales in travel retail, which represent 8% of Coty's turnover. Geographically speaking, Coty is also focusing on emerging markets (Latin America, Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Africa), in particular through the rationalization and modernization of its solid portfolio of consumer brands such as Covergirl, Rimmel, Bourjois Max Factor or adidas. In Brazil, for example, Coty has powerful local brands (Monange, Risqué, Paixão, Bozzano) and intends to accelerate its growth by increasing its number of points of sale and developing its perfumery offer. ""Our differentiated business model stands on an innovative Prestige as well as rejuvenated, focused and increasingly strong Consumer Beauty portfolio, global reach in developed and emerging countries, strategically located centres of R&D excellence, award-winning IP, and leading end-to-end capabilities,"" concluded Sue Nabi."
"""We are keeping our 100% digital growth model"", Ning Li, Typology","With one product sold online every 10 seconds and a three-digit annual growth, Typology managed to build itself a comfy place on the French beauty market, in just four years. The DNVB now counts 50 employees and is marketed in the UK, in Germany, and in the US – since late 2022. After the MyFab and Made.com successful experiences in furniture and decoration online selling, Ning Li continued to move forward, by creating Typology as a beauty pure player from the very start. And he is successful again: he claims the company is now the largest online selling skincare brand in France. ""We sell more products than Sephora and Yves Rocher in this niche"", he adds. Given the still low online sales penetration on the global cosmetics market, the brand believes it has a huge growth potential and is not considering broadening its distribution network to physical retail. ""There will not be any physical stores in the near future. Being online only helps keep our communication and margins under control. The direct-to-consumer model is the best way to create a brand, because we manage the customer experience more easily"", explains Ning Li. It also allows for a more flexible access to the global market. Apart from France, Typology is present in the UK, in Germany, and also in the US, where products have been marketed for six months on specialized websites. ""Things are going very fast in the US. It became our second market, after France, in only a few months. We also have projects in other countries, in Asia and Europe"", adds the Director. The skincare-oriented brand counts more than a hundred products focused on different skin concerns, with short, natural, or even organic, high-performance formulas, and high active concentrations. ""Our philosophy consists in investing in the products rather than marketing, and I think we have the strictest ingredient blacklist on the market"", claims Ning Li. If manufacturing is carried out in partnership with third-party manufacturers, the R&D laboratory is integrated to the structure and constantly tries to innovate, with about 30 new products per year. Innovation and agility are obviously the brand's main growth drivers, and Typology never hesitates to explore bold concepts and change directions, if need be. It aims to satisfy its customers' desire for efficacy. ""From this standpoint, our D2C model is an advantage. Since we do not need to pay for distributors, we can offer very high concentrations in actives, most of which are the highest on the market. But the notion of efficacy is subjective, since it depends on each skin. So, we developed a very detailed skin diagnosis to offer targeted product recommendations"", Ning Li explains. Most packs are made from aluminium or glass, so they are recyclable, and plastic – recycled and monomaterial – is reserved for the largest containers. Typology has recently launched a new range of products highly concentrated in CBD to strengthen the skin barrier and reduce inflammation in sensitive skins. Plantes 1007 and Plantes 4006, a night oil combined with six botanical extracts with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties to soothe the skin and soften all types of redness, and a Mask-Salve with Squalane and 240 mg CBD. These fragrance-free, preservative-free, essential-oil-free products are made with 100% of ingredients of natural origin and Cosmos-Natural-certified. Two new sun references will also be launched before summer, as well as an antioxidant capsule collection composed of a mask, a serum-oil, and a day cream. Other developments are expected, in particular in segments close to dermocosmetics, where Typology considers itself absolutely legitimate. ""I want Typology to be a beautiful brand with a long-lasting philosophy that is respected in as many countries as possible"", concludes Ning-Li."

Make-up trends: Faber-Castell creates the perfect punk-grunge look,"After having presented an innovative refillable pencil and a collection rich in soft colours inspired by the Protopia concept at Cosmoprof, Faber-Castell Cosmetics refocused on emerging trends at MakeUp in Paris with the new ""Soft Grunge"" collection. Identified as one of the key trends for 2025, the modern renaissance of the punk-grunge culture is linked to the universal need of expressing one's personality and values in opposition to social standardization. ""People have always felt the need to express their inner beliefs and attitudes. What are my values? What do I want to achieve through my actions? And how do I want to live in what kind of world? Yet it ́s not only about the answers to these questions but moreover about expressing them: through their style, their clothes, the music they listen to and their make-up,"" said Faber-Castell Cosmetics. According to the German manufacturer of make-up solutions, the punk-grunge scene era perfectly exemplified this type of self-expression and its modern reinterpretation by younger generations is not surprising. While dark and bold colours for eyes underline the punk-grunge personality, pearly and shimmery effects as well as metallic shades add a modern twist to the overall look. Combined with a lighter lip makeup, the style becomes suitable for everyday life and is catapulted into the present. To facilitate the application of moody and rebellious eye make-up, Faber-Castell Cosmetics has presented an innovative packaging for liquid liners - a double ender with a brush tip on the one side and a slanted one on the other side. In addition, a new member has been added to Faber-Castell Cosmetics' ""The Texture"" family - featuring a new vegan and ultra-soft formula in a plastic cosmetics pencil, that can be applied to both lips and eyes."
"After a dazzling success in France, La Rosée goes global","The name La Rosée evokes freshness, nature, hydration and transparency to convey the values of this young French brand which has been growing at an extremely fast pace. Ten years ago, two friends with crossed journeys as pharmacists and entrepreneurs decided to revolutionize the natural cosmetics offering in French pharmacies. ""As pharmacists, we thought the offering lacked an affordable brand positioned between dermatology, with the safety and tolerance it requires, and cosmetics as pleasurable products. It also lacked a brand with formulas containing not 85%, but 100% of ingredients of natural origin, which would tell the truth about these compositions, and also use ecodesigned packaging. This concept was new at the time"", says Mahault de Guilbert, co-founder of the brand with Coline Bertrand. The duo first launched five products in 2015 and travelled the French territory in search of interested points of sale. ""The first year, we signed with 250 pharmacies, and now we sell our products in 8,000, all in all, which accounts for one out of three in France. We are the first brand to contribute to pharmacies' growth this year"", adds the co-founder. Right now, the company counts about 100 employees for a turnover of 35 million euros in 2022 – and it is meant to double this year. On average, the 36 references in the current line, which includes skin, face, body, baby, and sun care products, are based on 98% of ingredients of natural origin. A third of them contain 100% and another third contain 99%. ""We have not overlooked beautiful textures and nice smells, which make up the sensorial part of cosmetics. We make consumers enter a more virtuous circle without them even realizing it"", adds Mahault de Guilbert. The products are designed and made in France in collaboration with third-party manufacturers. ""Free from anything superfluous, our brand focuses on skincare essentials. And the range was tailor made for pharmacies. Almost all our suppliers are in France, and a few are in Europe"", she explains. With an average price of 15 euros, the brand targets a large public and includes the whole family. ""We aim to provide a large access to natural, efficient products that offer pleasure. For this price, it is not that easy to make products with such good quality and innovative packaging"", she adds. The baby range launched in 2019 has just been completed with some of the brand's new launches: toothpaste and cleansing water. The sun range, launched in 2022 with four products, boasts a new reference this year: an oil with an SPF50. ""Our sun product sales boomed last year, and yet it was our first year in this category. We were the third or fourth brand on the market. This year, we have been the first brand to contribute to pharmacies' growth, partly thanks to this range"", says Mahault de Guilbert. A pioneer in packaging ecodesign, La Rosée immediately chose not to use overpackaging. ""This choice helped us save 260 tonnes of packaging."" The brand also banks on recycled or plant-based plastic and aims to develop its refillable offering. The refillable lip sticks were launched in September 2022 and new reusable references are scheduled for the post-summer season, in refillable and bulk versions. After a successful launch on the French market, La Rosée aims to gradually export itself over the next few years. The brand already has two subsidiaries in Belgium and Spain, where it is available in 300 pharmacies, in each country. ""We also have distributors in Switzerland, Chile, South Korea, China, and we will soon be in Morocco as well. The idea is not to spread ourselves in too many markets, but to gradually build a long-lasting brand with the best distributor in every country"", concludes Mahault de Builbert."
"Coty initiates the ""luxification"" of its business","Considering the excellent results of its Prestige division, Coty intends to adapt its offer to structural changes in the market, especially with regard to perfumery where more and more consumers opt for longer-lasting and more premium products. ""Against this backdrop, we continue to grow the fragrance category and premiumize our business through our portfolio of icons and leading launches, such as Burberry Hero and Her, Gucci Flora Gorgeous Jasmine and Gorgeous Gardenia, Boss Bottled Parfum and Chloe Atelier des Fleurs,"" said Sue Y. Nabi, Coty's CEO, commenting on the company's latest operating results. To go further in this process, Coty announced in May the launch in 2024 of Infiniment Coty Paris, a new collection of high-end fragrances, that will be to this category what the group's ultra-premium brand Orveda is to skincare. The project was introduced as the ""most ambitious and most premium fragrance project to date,"" for the company. The collection, for which there are patent pending for both the formulation and the packaging (a first according to Coty), will ultimately include a range of fourteen scents. ""Infiniment Coty Paris is a creation that marks a natural progression for the company, fusing beauty, science, and art,"" said Sue Y. Nabi, explaining that much more is set to come in the next months. With brands such as Gucci, Chloé, Burberry and Miu-Miu in its portfolio, Coty has all the means that are required to meet the demand of consumers who are trading up and increasing their spending in more premium products, especially in fragrance and makeup. In the third quarter of its 2022-2023 financial year, Coty published revenues growing up 9%, despite its exit from Russia. Over the period, its Prestige division grew by 10% and generated an operating profit of 102.4 million dollars, against 83.8 million dollars the previous year. It now represents 62% of the group's activity. In particular, the company intends to capitalize on the momentum in its established businesses, coupled with strong savings, to fuel its skincare business the next key pillar in its strategy, again, targeting the top of the segment. ""While we are in the very initial stages of igniting our focus skincare brands, I am encouraged by the positive initial signals we are tracking, whether it is leading social buzz and product reviews for Lancaster Ligne Princière, or step-changes in philosophy's sales fuelled by its new brand equity and newly launched serum, dose of wisdom,"" noted Sue Y. Nabi. The very recent launch of Orveda's OmniPotent Concentrate responds to the same logic of exploring the expectations of the upper segment of the market. At the beginning of May, the group, already listed on the New York Stock Exchange, announced it was considering a second listing in Paris, with the aim of strengthening its presence in Europe and attracting new investors."
China seduced by Swiss brand Méthode Physiodermie,"Premium Beauty News - Since Méthode Physiodermie was purchased in late 2016, you have multiplied its turnover by five, and it is now available in more than 1,000 beauty salons and spas in about 20 countries. Could you please tell us about your growth strategy? Alexandre Vacher - Since 2016, the number of countries in which the brand is present has not increased much, as a matter of fact. There must be three or four more, but that is it. And in fact, it is not our main objective. Méthode Physiodermie is a skincare brand with the absolute promise – since it was founded in 1974 by a biologist and naturopath, Doctor Franco Calato – of improving skin's quality and providing practical answers to skin concerns: signs of ageing, but also acne, rosacea, dermatitis... That is why the brand is only distributed in beauty salons and spas. Méthode Physiodermie consists of expert skincare products potentiated in salons thanks to a technical gesture aimed to enhance results. Plus, anyone who consults a Méthode Physiodermie practitioner gets an accurate skin diagnosis with a customized proposal. That is why our growth strategy mainly relies on our being close to our customers, in particular by opening new subsidiaries. Our subsidiary in France accounts for 25% of our turnover. We also have two in Asia, in Singapore and China. This customer-oriented strategy also makes it easier to train our partners, and that is a priority. We have three specific trainers, only in France. We have been developing an e-learning application to keep improving our customer service and help our partners become better professionals. Premium Beauty News - The Clinical Swiss Organics organic-certified skincare line was launched soon after you came to head the brand. What was your vision? Alexandre Vacher - When I took over Méthode Physiodermie, I gathered the R&D service team to think in depth about consumer expectations over the next ten years. It seemed obvious to us that demand for results, but also for naturalness, would keep increasing, and that there would be no step backward. Starting from there, we designed a full face care range combining naturalness and efficacy. We chose the Cosmos Organic certification by Ecocert Greenlife, the most rigorous standard in Europe, to convey the brand's philosophy based on research discipline and skincare of excellence. To make our green offering ever-more sophisticated, a few days ago (in early June), we launched a two-phase makeup remover containing bisabolol and an anti-ageing peptide for a ""skincare touch"". Contrary to the French, and more generally to Europeans, Chinese customers are less sensitive to natural and organic claims. In Asia, brands focus their communication on results and flagship actives, because these arguments have more impact on these well-informed consumers who know perfectly well which are the latest trendy ingredients and their benefits. Premium Beauty News - China seems to play a key role in your growth strategy. Can you tell us about it? Alexandre Vacher - Méthode Physiodermie is a premium brand which offers efficient, carefully selected actives and a specialized, almost professional communication perfectly in line with the Chinese market's expectations. This population has an increasingly sensitive skin, so anti-ageing, anti-acne and anti-redness products are very popular. China is a very complex market, which is why we chose to open a subsidiary in Beijing (Laboratoire Sintyl Beijing Cosmetics Co. Ltd). Right now, we have three employees working in particular on promoting Méthode Physiodermie products. In the first semester 2023, the sales achieved in China accounted for 40% of our total turnover. It is true that this country is gaining importance in our company's growth. Premium Beauty News - How are products distributed in China? Alexandre Vacher - The most popular concept in China – contrary to Europe, where beauty places are more intimate – is medispas. These are huge, multi-storey facilities up to 500, or even 600 square metres, with a humic area composed of a pool, a hammam, and a sauna, an area focused on technologies, an area for manual treatments, and another for retail products, but also a social club to gather with friends, etc. The Chinese population goes to medispas to get expert advice on its skin issues thanks to skin specialists, like beauticians, but also physicians. Premium Beauty News - What about Singapore? Alexandre Vacher - In terms of distribution network, it is more typically European, with a more traditional approach. Our local subsidiary (Laboratoire Sintyl Singapore Pte Ltd) is doing well. It helps reach consumers and promote our products, and it makes the commercial follow-up more efficient. Plus, we are also very present to train our partners. We have been considering opening new subsidiaries in other countries, but it is too early to talk about it."
"After Singapore, Sephora unveils a new ""Store of the Future"" in Shanghai","Sephora launched its first ""Store of the Future"" in China today. Situated along the frequented East Nanjing Road in Shanghai, this will be the retailer's second ""Store of the Future"" globally after the opening of a similar concept in Singapore late last year. ""The Store of the Future in Shanghai showcases our obsession for experiential retail, where consumers get to enjoy a curated and on-trend beauty offer, tailored and personalized services and classes, as well as digital touchpoints used to unlock consumer journeys within the store,"" shared Ms. Alia Gogi, President of Sephora Asia. ""Specifically customized to the unique preferences of Chinese consumers, we believe this store will set a new benchmark in prestige beauty retail in China."" In tandem with this launch, Sephora is introducing over 220 new products from over 36 global beauty brands to keep consumers apprised of the latest beauty trends. Among these are several crowd favourites such as luxury cruelty-free skincare brand, Tatcha; Pat McGrath Labs, Hourglass, Anastasia, Dr. Dennis Gross and Courrèges. In addition, Cha Ling, Maogeping Light, Wei, and other premium C-beauty brands will feature new assortments that were developed as part of the Sephora C-beauty Program. ""Sephora will continue to introduce new and differentiated products to the market while showcasing new trends,"" said Ms. Maggie Chan, Managing Director of Sephora Greater China. ""Apart from incorporating beauty tech, Sephora's Store of the Future in Shanghai is part of our ongoing commitment to deepen our engagement with the beauty community in China. We are excited to continue learning from our customers and partners to deliver a retail experience that best suit their needs and desires."" In addition of a wide selection of curated offerings, the new store features innovative digital touchpoints, and new beauty services to unlock the consumer journey for a unique retail experience, including : Care Analysis, an advanced skin analysis device powered by big data analytics for a hyper-personalized consultation; Look Analysis, an AI-generated makeup trends for inspiration and tutorials on the latest beauty looks with product recommendations; Lift and Learn, panels and price tags equipped with RFID sensors to educate consumers on various product ingredients and provide access to millions of customer reviews; Mobile POS, allowing to check out anywhere with beauty advisors to skip lines; Personalized Gift Packaging. In addition to incorporating advanced beauty tech and digital tools in the store, Sephora's beauty advisors are at hand to provide 15-minute skincare consultations to discover the most efficacious products for every customer, 60-minute makeup services to help consumers achieve the look suited to their specific features, as well as a 15-minute beauty play service to bring virtual artist looks to life. For the first time in China, Sephora will also have a purpose-built Beauty Live Studio to gather Sephora's beauty community for exclusive celebratory events or frequent and regular masterclasses on the trendiest looks, latest brands, and products."
Multitasking cosmetics expert Jotim invests in a brand new factory,"Premium Beauty News - Jotim has established itself as a benchmark among cosmetics manufacturers in China. Can you introduce us to the company? Ethan Chang - For almost 20 years, Jotim Daily Chemicalhas specialized in ODM and OEM services for all the beauty categories from colour cosmetics to skin care, personal care, hair care and baby care products. We are based in Hangzhou, a major economic hub within China, which has the advantage to be connected to both Ningbo and Shanghai ports. This turned out to be a great advantage in terms of flexibility, agility and delivery time, in particular during the pandemic. Jotim currently employs about 550 staffs, for an annual capacity of some 200 million pieces. Quality has always been our top priority and we can boast a wide array of certifications in this area (ISO 9001, ISO 14000, FDA, ISO 22716 and GMP) but also in CSR and fair trade. And preparing HALA and OTC certification for the new factory. Premium Beauty News - What would you define as Jotim's main difference in the beauty business? Ethan Chang - In China, there are only a few contract manufacturers that can cover as many categories as Jotim. We can serve brands in a large array of categories, help them to create hybrid products and to expand to new categories. Jotim focuses on five pillars: excellence in quality control; top quality equipment made from the best suppliers around world; digitalized systems for a step to step monitoring of development and manufacturing processes; agility in supply chain; marketing driven innovative ideas and formulations. Furthermore, we have made heavy investments in R&D, with 28 people working in our product innovation department to create about 100 basic new formulas a year, much more if we include shade variations. Premium Beauty News - Jotim is currently building a new production site which should be operational in October 2023. What will be the main characteristics? Ethan Chang - This new 50,000 sqm factory will help us to increase our production capacity to more than 300 million units per year. It will be a highly automatized smart facility with state-of-the-art equipment to increase our efficiency and further upgrade quality management. In addition, within our EcoVadis certification project, we are building 8,000 sqm solar panels on the rooftop, which will help us to reduce our carbon emission by up to 360 tons per year. Premium Beauty News - According to you, what are the main expectations of brands in today's global beauty market? Ethan Chang - Brands expect their suppliers to provide a stable quality and to react quickly to their demands. In addition, other criteria are growing in importance today as consumers are changing. In particular, brands need innovation driven products, in line with the latest trends, with short time to market and multi-purpose formulations. Our new factory will allow us to better meet the challenges of agility, speed and sustainability. Premium Beauty News - Jotim will be exhibiting at the next edition of MakeUp in Paris on June 14 and 15, 2023, what are your goals? Ethan Chang - We will present our latest innovations in make-up, in hybrid products but also skin care products. In particular, we will put the spotlight on foundations and concealers, which are among our best-selling products. Our goal is also to reconnect with our customers around the world after the pandemic. Beyond MakeUp in Paris, we will therefore participate in Cosmoprof North America in Las Vegas in July, Cosmoprof CBE ASEAN in Bangkok, Thailand, in September, Cosmoprof Asia in Hong Kong in November and Cosmoprof India in Mumbai in December."
The Body Shop: franchises will soon represent 50% of our French outlets,"Premium Beauty News - For some time now, we've been seeing the widespread use of refill stations in The Body Shop outlets. Can you tell us more? Hugues Laurençon - All our shops in France are now equipped with refill stations! When the first station was tested in September 2020 in London, I had the clear intuition that we had to do it in France, that consumers were ready and that they would be receptive to this system, which was totally consistent with the values and DNA of the brand. When Anita Roddick founded The Body Shop in 1976, the only option for consumers was refills. It's almost like going back to basics! Shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and hand wash, twelve formulas are now available on refill. We've done a lot of work training our shop teams - who have enthusiastically embraced the project - since, for hygiene purposes, the refill is 100% assisted by the sales staff. It was necessary to get the POS staff involved, and that was very easy: they were immediately convinced! They are the ones who raise consumer awareness daily and guide them towards our refillable aluminium bottles for responsible consumption. Refills not only reduce carbon emissions, but they also cut costs, as they offer a 20% discount on the same product in a plastic bottle. To date, we've sold more than 125,000 refill bottles in France! We've noticed that the formulas sell better in refills than their counterparts in individual bottles. It's very encouraging and promising! Premium Beauty News - The roll-out of franchises is one of the big highlights of the year, with the first shop opening in Besançon last March 8. Hugues Laurençon - That's perfectly right. This first opening was followed by a second one in Vannes on 31 March, then Poitiers on 27 April, Calais on 12 May and then Orléans a few days ago! We aim to open around ten franchised shops by the end of the year - which is looking very good - and around thirty in three years' time, which would represent around 50% of our outlets in France. Franchising at The Body Shop is a tried and tested model that enables us to serve our customers better. With our sixty-two shops, we couldn't possibly cover all of France. By teaming up with partners who are well-established locally and who control their catchment area, we can serve new customers in medium-sized towns in France and the Benelux countries. The partners are ready and willing, and the first openings look promising. The Body Shop has been around for forty-seven years and has a long-standing reputation. The weight of years counts and gives credibility to the brand and its products, which have been tested and approved by hundreds of millions of consumers around the world. Premium Beauty News - And what are your ambitions for own shops? Hugues Laurençon - Just because we're expanding our franchise network doesn't mean we're going to neglect our own stores - quite the contrary! Our ambition is to get our products into as many hands as possible and to promote our values which are effectiveness, sensoriality, eco-responsibility and ethical commitment. This is also why we did not hesitate to relocate two of our shops this year to ensure they are in the best possible spots and enjoy the visibility they deserve. We made this choice for the shops in the Aushopping V2 shopping centres at Villeneuve-d'Ascq on the outskirts of Lille and Vélizy 2 in the Paris region. What's more, on 17 May we opened our biggest shop since 2015 (Forum des Halles) at Les Quatre Temps shopping centre in La Défense! This boutique is set to become the number one outlet in terms of sales. Premium Beauty News - What's new in terms of products? Hugues Laurençon - We started reviewing our entire product catalogue nearly three years ago - which represents 900 references - to ensure that they are all certified vegan by the Vegan Society and that all formulas contain at least 85% of ingredients of natural origin. At the same time, we have also worked hard to eliminate over-packaging and packaging wherever possible. For example, our iconic fragrance White Musk, which has been around since 1981, is now sold ""naked"". Finally, to support all these recent initiatives, we have come up with a new brand signature: Changemaking beauty."
MakeUp in Paris takes a fresh look at beauty trends,"For its 2023 edition, MakeUp in Paris will host 150 exhibitors, a 36% increase compared to 2022. About 47 new companies will join the exhibition hall this year, including many North American companies (Allta, A&H Cosmetics, APR, Balance, Crystal Formulations & Packaging, Kirker, OPT Industries) and Asian companies (Beauty Yaurient Cosmetics Accessories, Beukay Cosmetics, Hakuhodo Company, Hwasung Cosmetics, Jotim Daily Chemical, etc.). And among the French suppliers who did not take part in the 2022 event are France Lab Marie Claire Beauty Group, Maprecos, Metapack, Texen and WWP Beauty Europe. In terms of visitors, the organisers expect to welcome more than 4,000 professionals (against 3,580 last year). ""The enthusiasm surrounding this new edition of the show is undeniable: since online registrations began, with constant double-digit growth since March, reflecting the dynamism of our industry,"" explains Aurélie de Boisvilliers, the show's Marketing & Communications Director. While skincare and make-up categories are hybridizing, with increasingly blurred boundaries, for several years now, MakeUp in Paris has adapted its offer with a growing representation of the skincare offer. ""This year, more than 58% of our exhibitors also propose skincare solutions,"" underlines Aurélie de Boisvilliers. This should meet visitors' expectations, where demand is also high, with 64% of visitors already registered saying they were looking for make-up and skincare innovations. To illustrate this shift towards skincare, MakeUp in Paris has chosen as its ambassador, Aïmara Coupet, founder of Be+Radiance, a make-up brand enriched with active probiotics and superfood ingredients with, in the words of its founder, a native multi-racial approach meeting the needs of all skin types, whatever their level of pigmentation. As the show's ambassador, Aïmara Coupet is also a member of the Innovation & Trends (IT) Awards jury, and she will be presenting the awards to the winners at the ceremony on 14 June at 10.30 am. This year's competition saw an explosion in the number of submissions, with a 46% increase in the number of products presented. In total, the jury assessed 117 submissions and selected 32 finalists (against 21 last year). ""Generally speaking, the innovations presented are indicative of the major trends shaping the future of the beauty industry.

Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna announces a more compact format in 2024,"The 55th edition of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna, the giant B2B event dedicated to the global cosmetics industry, will take place from Thursday, 21 to Sunday, 24 March 2024. Unlike previous years, all exhibition areas will open simultaneously on Thursday, March 21. Cosmopack, the area dedicated to the supply chain, and Cosmo Perfumery & Cosmetics, which hosts the brands that are sold in retail channels, will run for three days only and will therefore close their doors on Saturday, 23 March, while the Cosmo Hair, Nail and Beauty Salon areas, which are dedicated to products sold in the professional channels (hair salons, beauty salons, spas), will run for four days and close on Sunday, 24 March. With this new calendar, the organizers have taken into consideration the repeated requests, in particular from international exhibitors and visitors, who were less interested in attending the show on Sundays. Italian visitors who are interested in the sectors dedicated to professional channels will still be able to visit the show on this day. ""By updating the format of the show, we want to meet the new market needs,"" said Gianpiero Calzolari, President of BolognaFiere. ""Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna is the global reference event for the entire cosmetics industry, and it is therefore in our interest to monitor the transformations taking place both in Italy and internationally, to continue to support companies and operators from all over the world who have been following Cosmoprof for 55 years as a strategic appointment for their business."" According to Enrico Zannini, General Manager of BolognaFiere Cosmoprof, international stakeholders were not the only ones to ask for an adjustment of the opening dates. ""Italian operators and professionals also asked to anticipate business meetings with suppliers and partners on Thursday and Friday,"" he said. Furthermore, the organizers also consider that the concurrent opening of all exhibiting areas will facilitate the possibility to interact with the owners and buyers of beauty centres and hair salons interested in new products and private labels. Together with the communication of the new dates, Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna also launched their new advertising campaign for the 2024 and 2025 editions of the entire Cosmoprof network around the world. Dubbed Unfiltered Beauty / Natural Beauty, the new image, created by Heads Collective, refers to the common use of increasingly advanced filters available on smartphones and social media. The diaphragm that separates us from reality, is represented by a coloured plexiglass plate, and photographer Giulio Rustichelli passes through the coloured filter to investigate expressions with simplicity, without hiding anything. A quest for transparency that is more than ever important!"
Scentys perfumes Nuit Blanche event and innovates for more sustainable offering,"To enhance their immersive visit experience, several museums and spaces have chosen to connect the discovery of exhibitions to the sense of smell. A company specialized in the dry air diffusion of perfumes, Scentys immediately accepted this mission. In Argenteuil, west of Paris, the Maison Impressioniste Claude Monet contacted Scentys as part of a stage project to recreate the boat-workshop Monet used to represent the river Seine in several works. Visitors will immerse themselves into this singular place, both outside the boat, with Seine scents, and inside it, where multiple paint fragrances intertwine. In the French Caribbean, on the Martinique island, the Clément rum distillery will offer a ""Wheel of scents"" space fitted with the dry diffusion technology to encourage visitors to test their sense of smell by guessing the notes composing the brand's collections. And in the continental southern town of Villeneuve-Minervois, la Maison de la Truffe d'Occitanie will take visitors on an immersive journey to explore the history of truffle over the centuries. Scentys has translated the olfactory notes typical of each truffle variety. The Scentys technology is based on the dry diffusion of perfume encapsulated in beads placed in a refill. If this capsule was initially based on recycled polypropylene, it now comes in a version made of a biosourced material, a polyamide composed of ingredients 100% of natural, mineral, and plant origin. For the development phase, the brand had to take up the challenge of preserving the mechanical properties of the material, while offering the same olfactory outcome and ensuring compatibility with perfumes. The other technical challenge consisted in finding a material compatible with the existing moulds for the injection process. This made-in-France alternative, which is 100% of natural origin, will be available to Scentys's partner perfume brands."
One World Duty Free to operate Sri Lanka's first downtown duty free store,"One World Duty Free, and Port City Colombo have signed two agreements to operate Sri Lanka's first-ever downtown duty-free store. The signature-ceremony was held at the Colombo Port City Economic Commission's office last week. The two companies said their partnership will bring to life a preeminent global duty-free retail destination in Sri Lanka. According to the partnership agreement, ODF is set to develop and operate a 1,250 square metre duty free store at Port City Colombo, offering a curated mix of international brands spanning Beauty, Wellness, Spirits & Wines and Fashion. ODF's first retail store outside of Singapore will be nestled within a 7,000 square metre shopping oasis, Port City Duty Free Mall, primely positioned amidst a throng of international prestige hotels and casinos that promise a diverse and affluent customer base of tourists, expatriates, and locals. Construction of the ODF store is slated to commence from mid-2023, with trading planned to kick off by year's end. ""ODF Port City Colombo will offer travellers a purpose-built shopping environment enhanced by the company's innovative approach to smart retail,"" said the Singapore-owned omnichannel retailer in a statement. ""In our partners at Port City Colombo, we recognise a level of ambition which is perfectly aligned with One World Duty Free's game-changing approach to duty-free retail. The opportunity to showcase our credentials on the world stage and contribute to the creation of a landmark destination in Asia is a key milestone in One World Duty Free's journey of progressive expansion across Asia,"" said Keira Zhang, Founder & CEO of One World Duty Free. Anticipating a sustained resurgence in tourist arrivals following the COVID pandemic, Port City Colombo is set to accelerate Sri Lanka's economic development by creating a new gateway to South Asia through a range of state-of-the-art infrastructure, including commercial and residential buildings, recreational facilities, a financial district, and a modern transportation network. Developed in collaboration with the Government of Sri Lanka, and CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd (CPCC) as a public-private partnership, Port City Colombo is Sri Lanka's biggest development project funded by foreign direct investment to date. With major investment plans for travel retail, entertainment, and leisure facilities Port City Colombo aims to become a prime tourism and shopping choice ""on par with landmark destinations such as Singapore and Dubai."" ""In order to make our vision for Port City Colombo a reality, we have sought out best-in-class partners that can bring fresh thinking and innovation. One World Duty Free's technology-led ethos and commitment to delivering memorable consumer experiences will play a critical role in ensuring we deliver a compelling retail offer to travellers from across the world and thus the Commission's vision of creating Port City Colombo as a world-class touristic shopping destination,"" commented Dr Priyath B. Wickrama, Director General of the Commission and Commission Member of the Colombo Port City Economic Commission."
Lush unveils upscaled Green Hub for increased circularity,"Lush has operated a Green Hub facility since 2015, and recognising the potential of an in house location dedicated to waste management, the brand invested GBP 2.3 million in relocating to and refitting its new 40,000 sq ft premises on the Fleets Corner Business Park, in Poole, Dorset. With a building three times the size of its previous location, the capabilities of the Green Hub for processing and reinventing waste have upscaled and expanded. Key functions of the new Green Hub include: granulating plastic as part of the brand's closed loop Bring it Back recycling scheme; treating wastewater from their manufacturing and laundry processes; repairing machinery to prevent purchasing new; and donating surplus products and lifestyle items to charities and grassroots groups across the country. Since its early days, Lush — now a staple of the British high street — has pledged its commitment to reducing its environmental impact and ethically sourcing ingredients. But business remains a key driver of its decisions. ""We're keen environmentalists but we're not fools. If the customers want this, then we'll strive to provide this,"" Mark Constantine, CEO and Lush co-founder, said in an interview with AFP. Constantine was among six friends, including his wife Mo, who founded Lush in 1995. Recognisable by the strong fruity smells of its stores with market-like stalls, Lush sells two-thirds of its products ""naked"", without packaging, among them handmade soap bars and henna hair dye blocks. Some products, such as moisturisers and body lotions, are sold in black pots, which customers are encouraged to bring back for recycling. Others, like shower gel, are sold in plastic bottles. ""We are supplying consumers with what they need when they need it. We are then secondarily thinking about the environment,"" Constantine said. ""I don't believe personally that people are shopping with us primarily for environmental reasons. I believe they want a product that works,"" he added. While Constantine said Lush will continue selling its popular shower gels, there are red lines that they will not cross, like putting pumps on plastic bottles. The metal bits in the pumps would make them hard to recycle, he said. Lush has been praised by independent organisation Ethical Consumer and the Better Goods website for its commitment to non-animal testing. But they have also highlighted issues, such as the use of palm oil, which campaigners blame for deforestation and the destruction of wild animal habitats. Use of synthetic ingredients and lack of ""quantifiable"" environmental targets have also been raised. Lush says it no longer uses palm oil and is searching for alternatives to stop using its derivatives. Ruth Andrade, head of Lush's regenerative impact team, late last year outlined a climate ""to-do list"", to be implemented before 2030. This includes protecting forests and wildlife, transferring to renewable power and making materials ""regenerative and circular"". The group also wants to reduce it carbon footprint by ""radically"" reducing transport emissions. With 14,500 employees worldwide, an employee trust controls a 10-percent stake in the company, the rest is owned by 8 shareholders only. Lush is also a key local employer in the coastal town of Poole, near Bournemouth. Constantine has had a bittersweet relationship with his home region, which overwhelmingly supported Britain leaving the European Union in the Brexit vote. The group saw its turnover fall slightly, to 408 million pounds, in 2020/2021, the latest results published as last year's financial closure has been delayed by the integration of a North American affiliated company. Speaking about the company's declining sales in France and Germany, Constantine says Brexit was more to blame than inflation. Lush has however increased the price of its products in line with inflation, which is stuck above 10 percent in the UK. But Constantine said that even with a cost-of-living crisis that has forced Britons to cut back on other non-essential costs, ""you can at least have a bath"". And Constantine is confident that inflation won't ""carry out for much longer"", just in time for Christmas and the rollout of a new flagship store."
"Laneige, Amorepacific's spearhead for global growth","Amorepacific recently launched Laneige, the group's flagship global skincare brand, in the United Kingdom and the Middle East, following North America. Indeed, Korea's leading cosmetics manufacturer is continuing its international development strategy, with the aim of further reducing its dependence on the Korean and Chinese markets. In 2022, overseas sales reached KRW 1.5 trillion (approximately EUR 1.05 billion or USD 1.13 billion), accounting for 36% of the group's overall sales. Since last year, Amorepacific has continued to grow in the North American beauty market with its Laneige, Sulwhasoo and Innisfree brands. Alongside these iconic K-beauty brands, the Korean giant has also acquired Tata Harper, one of the pioneering clean luxury skincare brands in the United States. Amorepacific claims its sales in North America grew 80% in the first quarter of 2023, thanks to strong sales growth in e-commerce channels such as Amazon and branded stores, as well as offline channels including Sephora. ""Laneige's Lip Sleeping Mask and Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Collection, Sulwhasoo's First Care Activating Serum and Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream, Innisfree's Daily UV Defense Sunscreen and Green Tea Hyaluronic Acid Collection have become best-selling products among Millennials and Gen Z consumers who are highly engaged in skincare,"" said the group in a statement. In addition, Amorepacific partnered with the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) through its Sulwhasoo brand in March to expand communication with local customers. In the UK Laneige, which has grown into a leading premium skincare brand with a global presence in 18 countries across Asia, North America, Australia, and Europe, has made offline debuts at luxury beauty retail chain Space NK at the end of April. For the month of May, Amorepacific operates an exclusive Laneige brand space at two Space NK stores (Kings Cross and Westfield) in central London, while expanding brand awareness locally through content related to brand ambassador Sydney Sweeney. ""Prior to our official launch, Laneige was featured on Cult Beauty, Look Fantastic, and Beauty Bay, e-commerce platforms specializing in beauty in the U.K., and we were able to see the strong interest from local customers,"" said Jinpyo Lee, Chief Strategy Officer at Amorepacific Group. ""As the demand for Korean beauty products in the European market has increased in recent years, our sales in Europe grew by more than 90% year-on-year in Q1 2023. The North American and European markets are a hotbed for global beauty brands. The growth of Amorepacific's brands in these markets shows that local customers recognize our efforts in investing in natural ingredients and R&D for more than 70 years,"" he added. This month, Laneige also made its first foray into the Middle East, through a partnership with Sephora, the number one beauty retailer in the region. The brand's flagship products are now available in Sephora stores across the United Arab Emirates and in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain. ""Amorepacific will continue to actively expand customer contact points in various global markets and grow into a global beauty company,"" concluded Jinpyo Lee."
"""EcoBoost offers a 360-degree solution to creative constraints,"" CPL Aromas","Premium Beauty News - What is EcoBoost technology, in a nutshell? Alexandra Paumard - EcoBoost is based on a compact formulation with reduced dosage, which allows the use of intense materials in larger quantities, without compromising intensity. I have been working with EcoBoost since I joined CPL Aromas, which means for about 6 years. This innovation has several advantages, not least of which are the environmental benefits, as it significantly reduces the carbon footprint of a fragrance through lower concentrations, volume and sourcing. Premium Beauty News - Do you often use EcoBoost in your work? Olivier Maurel - I became familiar with this technology upon my arrival at CPL Aromas, 9 years ago. The project, which had been underway for a few years, was starting to become well-known by then. Today, our teams are using it more and more often. EcoBoost technology is proving to be a relevant choice for companies, with the specifications for, becoming increasingly demanding. The technology initially won over mass-market brands because it reduces transport and storage costs and also allows for a smaller quantity of concentrate to be ordered. It is now appealing to a niche market, looking for creativity and high-end products. EcoBoost is also very attractive to image-conscious brands looking for new and innovative eco-friendly solutions. Alexandra Paumard - EcoBoost can also help the industry solve the sourcing problems that it is facing today. Thanks to its reduced dosage, this technology allows less and better sourcing. With no loss of quality or olfactory performance, quite the contrary. A valuable advantage at a time when the price of raw materials has risen. EcoBoost also reduces labelling, as it contains fewer allergens, a plus for brands as consumers are increasingly demanding about product composition. This innovation also offers a solution to stability or colour constraints. EcoBoost also facilitates access to a palette of top-of-the-range materials for customers on a tight budget. Finally, it allows the same formula to be used in different media (perfumes, candles, personal care products), with no need to rework it. A significant economic advantage. In fact, our clients are becoming more and more receptive to the benefits of EcoBoost. Premium Beauty News - Does the reduced EcoBoost concentration mean formulating differently? Olivier Maurel - I wouldn't say a specific formulation but rather an adaptation to the mechanisms of EcoBoost. After its launch in 2009, each ingredient was tested at different concentrations for five years. A research phase that allowed senior perfumers to pass on to junior perfumers a methodology that was enriched with the arrival of new materials. The major difference in the Ecoboost formulation lies in the choice of ingredients since a low concentration allows using them at very high and unusual levels for greater intensity. The EcoBoost perfumer's palette includes about 200 ingredients, including some potent materials, like some of the CPL Aromas captives, whereas a classic palette has about 3000. Technically, the emphasis must be on intensity in the head notes and tenacity in the base notes to reach the same level of intensity as a classic fragrance, with a ten times lower dosage. Apart from the intensity requirement, there is no EcoBoost ""signature"", this technology applies to all registers: modern, classic, retro... Premium Beauty News - What about IFRA-regulated ingredients? Olivier Maurel - EcoBoost does not enable the use of materials prohibited by IFRA, but it is possible to use those whose use is limited thanks to a less concentrated formula. Like for example, oakmoss-like naturals, or molecules like certain musks or coumarin. Because it is at least ten times less concentrated, you can use up to ten times more. Thanks to the reduced and compact dosage of Ecoboost, the formula is often less expensive, giving access to a higher quality of naturals or synthetics, to craft richer or more sophisticated accords. Premium Beauty News - What are the criteria to certify that a formula is EcoBoost? Alexandra Paumard - Criteria vary depending on the medium. For fine fragrances, the juice is tested according to our evaluation protocol. First, on a perfume stripe, then on the skin. Candles follow the same process, first in a cabin, unlit then when lit. The perfume or candle receives the EcoBoost designation once the test protocol is validated. Premium Beauty News - You have also launched EcoBoost+ What is it about? Alexandra Paumard - EcoBoost+ technology is based on the same principle but with 20 times less concentration. Ecoboost+ was launched three years ago and for the moment is mainly of interest to mass-market brands. But in the future, it is likely to be as successful as, with a wide range of customers. Premium Beauty News - Do you think that EcoBoost could eventually replace traditional formulations? Olivier Maurel - I wouldn't go that far, but EcoBoost does indeed offer a solution to a demanding market. It is the result of nearly 15 years of expertise to create beautiful fragrances, crafted with noble materials, respecting demanding specifications. I don't think that there is any real or effective alternative to EcoBoost at the moment. It is a technology that fully responds to the needs of the market. Alexandra Paumard - EcoBoost is also compatible with other CPL Aromas innovations: biodegradable fragrances, aromaspaces, aromafusions, etc. This technology opens up new olfactory horizons, which is stimulating for creators. It also facilitates the creation of eco-labelled fragrances. EcoBoost therefore fully embodies the CPL Aromas philosophy. While, EcoBoost offers a 360-degree solution to creation constraints, which is attractive to brands, consumers still need to be educated on this subject. Highlighting that the sillage or staying power is not so much the result of the concentration of a fragrance as the choice and dosage of certain ingredients. From this angle, the ecological benefits of EcoBoost, to which consumers are increasingly sensitive today, and the nobility of the materials used, must be highlighted."
French hair care company Eugène Perma is strengthening its expertise,"Founded in 1919 by Eugène Sutter in Paris, the Eugène Perma group draws on more than 100 years of hair expertise, particularly in hair coloration and hair care. Bought and led by Didier Martin since 1995, the family business now distributes its activity between mass distribution and professional brands for hair salons. The Eugène Perma Professionnel business unit offers various ranges of hair care products and shampoos with the ranges, Essentiel, Collections Nature et Artist(e), relaunched at the beginning of 2023, and hair colouration with Carmen Rituel. ""Carmen Rituel, which was launched at the end of 2020, demonstrates our expertise in hair colouration in terms of R&D. Its routine, with 95% ingredients of natural origin and enriched with organic plant oils, is formulated with no ammonia, no PPD, no resorcinol and no mineral oils, with exceptional colour results,"" states Cécile Martin. This approach in favour of naturalness is also found in the consumer brands with, alongside the emblematic brand Pétrole Hahn, or Eugène Color, the Nat&Nov BIO brand, a pioneer in organic shampoos and hair treatments sold in supermarkets. ""Nat&Nove BIO is an organic brand where we worked a lot on sensoriality without ever compromising on performance. It is also a committed brand that supports the French production of organic active ingredients, with vegan formulas as are all our formulas,"" adds the manager. For all our product categories, the desire to move towards eco-designed formulas without compromising on customer experience and sensoriality is the group's leitmotiv.

We aim to strengthen our hair expertise by investing in R&D, to develop ever more effective products, with high-quality formulas and sensory textures,"" explains Cécile Martin. The group is also working on the sustainability of its packaging, in line with the 2025 regulatory requirements. The packs are recyclable and include up to 50% recycled materials. Already present in 40 different countries, the group's objective is to double its international development. ""We are already carrying out prospecting missions in China, the United States and South Korea. We are also developing some specific products for certain markets, and we are taking into account foreign markets in our numerous relaunches. However, trends are overlapping one another, like the ""skinification"" of hair products, and with 400 references we manage to cater for all needs,"" says Cécile Martin. Apart from aerosols and lightening powders, more than 90% of the group's hair products are manufactured in the Reims factory, which was inaugurated in 2004 and Ecocert Cosmos certified since 2018. ""We have a strong territorial anchorage with an important CSR approach. Of our 200 suppliers, more than 82% are located in France and more than 96% in Europe. We make sure to promote short circuits,"" notes the manager. The French group now aims to strengthen its hair expertise in colouration and deep hair care. ""Our objective is to invest in modernizing, simplifying and increasing the expertise of our offers"", concludes Cécile Martin."
Soeder taps into the French market through high-end partnerships,"Amour hotels, for instance have opted for the Wermut Negroni scent, a nod from Soeder to the legendary cocktail, packaged in a customized glass bottle with the hotel chain logo. Soeder is also available in concept stores such as Merci, Fleux or Gravity, in Paris, Antic Boutik, in Nice, Babeth, in Annecy, or Alternative, in La Rochelle. As for the Parisian department stores, Le Bon Marché was the first to offer the brand. ""Placing the products in cool places was an efficient way to create a positive image and position for the brand in Switzerland. We're doing the same in France, with Hotel Amour and selected places,"" explain Hanna and Johann Olzon-Åkerström, Soeder's co-founders. While the couple began to produce their first soaps in the kitchen of their home in Zurich, the young brand quickly found an audience. Just two years after its creation, Soeder opened their first soap manufacture in Zurich. ""Our goal was to come back to the simplicity of soap, with formulations that are free from synthetic ingredients but with modern and contemporary scents and designs. From the very beginning we wanted to control every production step from A to Z. This was essential to meet our quality and durability requirements,"" Hanna and Johann told Premium Beauty News. Soeder offers a range of natural solid and liquid soaps, as well as hand sanitizers, shampoos, conditioners, deodorants, lip balm, hand and face creams, and body and massage oils. All of them are manufactured in the brand's own factory in the town of Schwerzenbach, near Zurich. The products' fragrances are exclusively derived from natural essential oils. In terms of sustainability, liquid soaps are sold in reusable and recyclable glass bottles that can be refilled in Soeder stores and at certain retails. Today, Soeder has five own stores in Switzerland, four in Zurich and one in Basel, and is distributed in the country's department stores and main concept stores (KaDeWe, Globus, Kitchener, Blanche, Ademas). Some products are also distributed in major hotels and have been available to Swiss airline passengers since 2018. This year, Soeder also created Swiss' First Class Kit, consisting of three products: Repair Face Serum, Restore Face Cream, and Comfort Hand Cream. The brand now strives to strengthen its sales internationally, mainly in Europe, in France, as we said, but also in Germany, Denmark and Sweden. Soeder is also available in the United States and has just made its debut in Dubai. To meet the growing demand, in Soeder will inaugurate in January 2024 its new production site in Zurich Werstatt, in the district of Zurich Altstetten, in the heart of former railway workshops. This new factory will make it possible to double the production capacity, up to 6 million products per year. In line with the brand's sustainability commitments, the new plant has been designed to be energy positive, thanks to a manufacturing process that creates heat. Therefore, it will be able to release its energy surplus into the city's grid."
"After two years of renovation, Sothys reopens on Faubourg Saint-Honoré in Paris","When you enter the doors of 128, you find yourself in the space dedicated to the reception of visitors and the sale of the brand's products, and you are immediately drawn into the world of Sothys, with its white, gold and charcoal grey colours. Everything has been devised to offer visitors a unique experience: a scent bar to choose the fragrance and texture of some products, skincare rituals shown in images on a central screen and two, more intimate areas, for personalised diagnoses with a prescription, or to make-up after a treatment. A lift at the back of the shop takes you to the second floor where the reception lounge and the treatment suites are located. The lounge is a waiting area where you can enjoy an herbal tea from the Sothys gardens, before or after your treatment, to the rhythm of images of nature projected on one of the room's walls. The treatment area features three large cabins, each with a premium massage table surrounded by a light, enveloping voile curtain to enjoy an immersive relaxing interlude. 128 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré also houses an international training centre for all the group's brands (Sothys, Beauty Garden and Bernard Cassière). The training courses given at the ""Sothys Academy"" allow partner practitioners to benefit from all the necessary keys to adopt an active listening approach with their clients, to establish a skin diagnosis and a personalised beauty prescription. ""The opening of the Sothys Academy, which coincided with the reopening of the institute, is a continuation of the implementation of the training, which is a compulsory step for the qualified practitioners wishing to represent the brand. It is an essential stage in the partnership with Sothys and ensures that our standards are as uniform as possible. The Sothys Academy now has several addresses, 128 Faubourg Saint-Honoré in Paris but also Brive-la-Gaillarde,"" explains Christian Mas, Director and son of the founder of Sothys. In March, Sothys introduced the body line of its certified organic cosmetics range to complete its offer, which was until then only dedicated to the face. The brand has also recently launched, in April, a ""sustainable luxury"" range for hotel spas with 100% recycled and recyclable plastic containers for its professional products, along with gorgeous refillable bottles! Finally, in May 2023, a new face care protocol and a body massage for men will be launched, along with a range of grooming products for men created in partnership with Eden Park."
"""We meet a demand for regionalisation"", Thierry Rabu, Meiyume","Premium Beauty News - You became the Head of Meiyume in September 2022. What were your objectives? Thierry Rabu - Meiyume's strength lies in our being present in the different phases of the product value proposal, thanks to our network of partners and to our five plants located all around the world. Our business covers primary and secondary packaging solutions, filling, formulation, digital retail solutions, etc. So, it was somewhat tricky to define the company. As a result, my mission consisted in refocusing Meiyume on its core business to stimulate our growth, post-Covid. We mainly offer an added value in the form of innovation. Our innovative solutions are not limited to products: they also have to do with the value we provide in points of sale with our digital merchandising concept. It is all based on exceptional agility, thanks to a supply chain which benefits from a network of almost unique, both Asian and regional partners. Premium Beauty News – How was that conveyed in terms of organization? Thierry Rabu - First, we put the company in line with the regional strategic approach. We used to have a centralized decisional process. We have now given regions a real strategic value, and autonomy. The second phase consisted in even more smartly keeping this regional focus as part of a local market intelligence cooperation, so we could identify the right trends on each market. Meanwhile, we aimed to make our support services even more efficient, including Finance, Human Resources, and IT, so we could take advantage of a more advanced and agile backbone. Lastly, we modified the organization of our supply chain, which was also centralized per market category, and adapted it to our regional approach. After the pandemic, most of our clients focused on a more regional approach to supplying, so that we had to meet their demand with a better-adapted method, whether it be in the US, Europe, Asia, or South-East Asia. Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us about the company's global vision? Thierry Rabu - It is still defined as ""Empowering Beauty for a Sustainable Future"". CSR prevails in our clients' demands. We really need to integrate this commitment to all of our company's functions. We got the Ecovadis Gold label, and we are aiming for the Platinum grade. This new social and environmental focus helped us reshape our approach to both primary & secondary packaging and formulation. We invested in ecodesign for multinationals and independent brands alike. In-house, we strengthened our Regulatory Compliance team as regards formulation. Regarding product development, we systematically try to offer at least one or two ecodesign options. In parallel, we set up workshops focused on three main values: Agility, Creativity & Trust (ACT). Agility represents our ability to adapt to the different markets. Creativity is the very essence of Meiyume, in relation to product and solution innovation, while Trust is crucial for open and transparent exchanges, whether in-house or with our external partners. These notions have already been successfully integrated. Premium Beauty News - Did you have to make any specific adjustments in certain regions? Thierry Rabu - We completely transformed our approach to certain markets. In Continental China, our approach to the Chinese market used to be focused on export, rather than on the local market. We have been changing this strategy to boost our growth. Although export sourcing in China remains big for us, we can now meet the local demand. In the United States, we have been setting up a new partner entity in the form of an incubation cell. It will support independent and already well-established brands in developing tomorrow's products more quickly, thanks to our innovation and formulation power, with a partner in a complementary business. Meiyume's turnover is well-balanced between the different regions. We achieve almost similar revenues in all our four regional divisions, i.e. the US, Europe, the UK, and Asia. Premium Beauty News – How is your business divided? Thierry Rabu - The trading part accounts for almost 60% of our business, while production in our own plants represents about 35%, and activities in points of sale, 5%. Recently, we refocused the last part, putting an emphasis on digital solutions, which helps brands better manage their supplies, and collect data to better optimize and manage sales efficacy in stores. To this aim, we have our own referenced solutions. As for categories, our perfume business is the most important, because it generates the largest growth, ahead of skincare and makeup. Globally, perfumes are still on a roll, but it is a cyclical market. As regards makeup, hybrid products combined with care are really growing, and so are foundations, while the eye segment achieves an acceptable growth rate. However, demand for lip products has not reached its pre-Covid level yet."
"""Co-creation is the future of the cosmetics industry,"" Justine Hutteau","Premium Beauty News – Over four years, Respire has become a reference on the French beauty and hygiene market, known for being demanding. How can you explain this success? Justine Hutteau - Respire has always been focused on its community. It quickly gained engagement on social media, in particular on Instagram, on which we have always been regularly present on Respire's page – it counts more than 200,000 followers – but also on my personal page, now followed by more than 100,000 people. We have interacted with our community since the very beginning, by asking questions on the bathroom products our users would like us to develop, and we offer natural, efficient answers. We soon realized that some people were highly committed: they answered every question and were eager to get involved in product development. That is how La Ruche Respire (for ""hive"") was born, to refer to our community of co-creators, which counts 700 people to date. Basically, La Ruche Respire is a private Instagram account on which we ask questions several times a week about perfumes, textures, packaging, colours... But we also meet our community on our premises, so they can test or collect products. Many people contact us because they want to integrate La Ruche Respire. And we are now ready to make it broader! Premium Beauty News – Does this mean this community of co-creators, which has followed you since the brand was created, will gain even more importance? Justine Hutteau – Exactly. We aim to triple the number of members by this summer, by organizing recruiting periods in the months to come. To join La Ruche Respire, the candidates will need to fill in a precise questionnaire and explain their motivations. We want to get a broader panel of testers, more representative of consumers, to meet needs and expectations ever-more accurately. All new references are developed with La Ruche Respire: members give their opinion in all development phases, and then they test the products for about two weeks to fill in a basic questionnaire. Based on their answers, we review the product until we get a very high satisfaction rate. I do believe this approach is the future of the cosmetics industry. Because, with this method, when we launch our products, we know they will meet our customers' needs! And the very positive feedback on our latest launches confirms this! Premium Beauty News – Was it this process that led you to reformulate your roll-on deodorant? Justine Hutteau - A year and a half ago, we launched a solid deodorant in a cardboard pack whose effect lasted 48 hours. It was a real success when it came out! And we almost never had any negative comment on its efficacy. However, the cardboard pack did not get unanimous support. So, we decided to review it all, working hand in hand with our laboratory. We developed an ""anti-bad smell"" patented technology to make the new formula composed of 98% of ingredients of natural origin even more efficient than the previous one. The last test carried out by more than 400 testers was very encouraging, since we got a 4.7/5 score! This reference was released in late March, with four new perfumes available: cotton flower (our best-selling scent for the stick), white tea, aloe, and monoi (the last one is a Sephora exclusivity). We are always trying to enhance our product offering, so we also reviewed our two sunscreens (SPF 30 and 50), which have just been launched (April 12) on our website and at our retailers'. When we launched our first sunscreens, in 2019, mineral filters were the best in terms of health and sustainability. Now, they are controversial. That is why we decided to use organic filters in our new formulas. We screened the list of 21 organic filters authorized by the European Cosmetics Regulation and selected the best in terms of efficacy and safety. Premium Beauty News – Are you planning to go global? Justine Hutteau – We have been thinking about a global strategy. Right now, our website is only available in French. So, by the end of the year, we would like to have it translated into several European languages. Next, we also aim to launch the brand in a few European countries, but it is still too early to tell you more."
Robertet sets up natural & greentech startup accelerator,"On the heights of the city of Grasse, on the iconic premises of the old Charabot perfume shop, five young companies selected through an application process will join the Villa Blu accelerator project every six months, for two years, to take part in an intensive support programme. ""Villa Blu aims to be a welcoming place for everything that represents innovation in naturalness, in the broad meaning of the term"", says Olivier Maubert, Director of Robertet and President of Villa Blu. ""To Robertet, naturalness is not just a source for all our ingredients. We must have a broader impact and reflect on the whole ecosystem."" Each group of five startups-in-residence will be guided by both Robertet and external experts to identify their weaknesses, work on product design, quality, market understanding, company structure, fundraising, etc. ""Startups are increasingly innovative, but they do not always get the much-needed support a major company like us can provide. Natural expertise involves a lot of investment, analysis, processes, knowledge… We will provide all this as an acceleration solution"", adds the Director. The young companies targeted come from all over the world. They are both upstream and downstream players on the natural segment, and they focus on product and by-product upgrade. They interact with all business areas, not just perfumes and cosmetics. ""Robertet embodies sourcing, extraction, and proposal. We believe that we need to broaden our areas of competence if we want to remain a naturalness leader. The notion of upgrading is crucial. It goes much beyond our sole company"", says Olivier Maubert. Following this first programme, the companies selected will be able to get Robertet's support for another 18 months, in return for a 7% acquisition of interests – this way, they will get a 100,000-euro financial help. ""We do not mean to take control of them. We respect their independence and aim for them to remain this way. We are mainly here to help"", highlights Olivier Maubert. With the Villa Blu project, the group now aims to build up a broader programme mixing local authorities and communities, academic structures, and other partners in the ecosystem. ""Naturalness is no longer just the source of our ingredients. It represents a much broader ecosystem. We are launching Villa Blu with much ambition and passion, because society is changing. Thanks to Robertet's legitimacy, as the company that set up the project, and to our being based in Grasse, Villa Blu could be the starting point to build up a greater community gathering all this new Natural ecosystem!"" concludes the President."
Inuwet rabbit balms and unicorn masks want to conquer the world,"Founded in 2016 by the De Bruyère company, Inuwet is the French ""good vibes"" cosmetics leader for kids, but also for their mums. Even though the flashy, animal-shaped packs are fun, playful, and childlike, the formulas are reliable, vegan, natural, or even organic, and most products are made in France. ""People first buy our products because they are cute, but in the end, they come back and test other references, because the formulas hold their promises when it comes to textures, sensoriality…"", explains founder Marie Puech. The company boasts a two-digit sales growth (+27% in 2022), more than 3,000 points of sale throughout France (pharmacies, department stores, Nocibé, Beauty Success, Passion Beauté, Monoprix, etc.), including about 2,000 pharmacies, and a presence in 15 countries around the world. Inuwet is crafting its offering to assert itself as a key player on its segment. ""We are close to kids, which means we are also close to parents. That is why we thought it was key to assert our 'green beauty' positioning by offering more and more products mainly with ingredients of natural origin, and most of which are made in France"", explains Marie Puech. ""For example, our rabbit-shaped lip balm, our bestseller, suits children as young as three. It is made in France and contains 98% of ingredients of natural origin. We sell almost one million per year"", she adds. All Inuwet products are green-labelled (""no risk"") on the Yuka application, a reference for many French consumers. Skincare, makeup, bath products, but also accessories… Inuwet, a real lifestyle brand, does not only target children. ""Indeed! Some of our distributors, including department stores (Bon Marché, Galeries Lafayette, Printemps), already offer 'mum and daughter' skincare ranges which include our products, like our biocellulose masks and hand creams"", emphasizes the Director. ""I do believe that this service is a long-term trend and that we should jump on this bandwagon, as a brand much popular and praised among kids, and increasingly approved and used by mothers, who buy skincare products in particular"", she adds. Inuwet will officialize the launch of its Inuwet Mini range when they release the mini nail polish line with perfumed water for kids over 3, next June. ""With Inuwet Mini, we aim to provide parents with a reference. Inuwet Mini is a kid range free from controversial ingredients and composed of products with gentle, natural formulas"", explains Marie Puech. ""Our distributors will also be able to integrate this mini nail polish range to a 'kid and mamma' manicure routine."" In stores, in particular in pharmacies, where the brand aims to strengthen its presence, displays highlighting Inuwet Mini will be available to present the real benefits of this kid range. ""Also, we have been working on solutions to put forward our main arguments in more standard points of sale"", she explains. Almost 90% of Inuwet's sales are achieved on the French market: the brand is now firmly established on the French soil, ""although it has not matured yet"", says Marie Puech. In addition, it is distributed in Spain, Belgium, and Italy – at Douglas' – and on a more global level, in about 15 countries. ""We aim to reproduce our French model in neighbouring countries, but also to grow through overseas export. To this aim, I recruited new employees, and this year, I started a collaboration with a distributor in Dubai to develop this highly dynamic area,"" she says. The brand is present at Printemps, in Qatar, which recently opened (the ""grand opening"" was on March 8). ""Lastly, of course, we have been thinking about going back to the US, where we had really started growing with a nice referencing at Ulta Beauty, before the pandemic"", concludes Marie Puech."
"""Adopt sells a perfume every five seconds"", Frédéric Stoeckel","Premium Beauty News – How would you describe the Adopt Parfums concept? Frédéric Stoeckel – The brand was created in 1986, but it has undergone radical changes over the past ten years. It was founded under the name Réserve Naturelle by a man from the South-Western city of Bordeaux, who opened about 60 stores in France. Then, in 2015, it was purchased by an investment fund which broadened the network to 135 stores and renamed it ""Adopt"". When I took the position of President, in January 2019, I stopped opening stores and instead focused on the gem that was part of the concept: ""making high-quality perfume affordable to all"". We started working with great perfumers and fine fragrance noses at Firmenich, Symrise, Robertet, Givaudan, etc., and we recruited a Perfume Creation Director, who redesigned all juices to make original, high-quality creations in collaboration with them. We also boast a body care offering, ranges that complement our perfumes, an anti-ageing, oily skin, skin-brightening face care range, a makeup range, and home fragrances. Premium Beauty News – What is the French Fragrance Revolution about, exactly? Frédéric Stoeckel – We suggest a change in how we use perfume, or a complementary use to more expensive perfumes. Our customers can have not only one fragrance, but several interchangeable ones with which they can have fun. A 30-ml bottle costs EUR 10.95. We can call it democratization, as a new alternative which does not exclude great luxury brands. The approach is not based on a flagship product, but on a diverse offering. In our stores, we expose over 90 perfumes organized according to their olfactory families, and our portfolio counts 150 of them. Our model consists in spending all our money on juices. We produce them ourselves, always with the same bottle – a 30-ml tube. And the decoration consists of labels; there is no secondary packaging. We do not use ads a lot, because we express ourselves through our stores. And it works perfectly well, since Adopt sells one perfume every five seconds, somewhere in the world. We sold 6 million bottles in 2022, so we must be one of the perfume leaders in volume in France. The brand grew by 35% last year. Premium Beauty News – Are all products made in France? Frédéric Stoeckel – Right now, they are all made in Bordeaux, but they will soon be produced in the future plant we recently purchased in Château Renard, two hours south of Paris. It is undergoing some works, but we will be able to start bottling our perfumes in May and make the juices in October. In early 2024, the whole production will be taken care of in this plant, so that in Bordeaux, we will focus on shower gel manufacturing. Premium Beauty News – What is your growth strategy in France and abroad? Frédéric Stoeckel – In France, we almost no longer open owned stores. We only do it through franchisees and affiliates. There are 173 now, and there will be 200 by the end of the year. On the global level, we are present in 40 countries, on all continents, through various distribution models, franchises, perfume shops, drugstores, and digital concepts. Premium Beauty News – Can you tell us more about your growth objectives? Frédéric Stoeckel – Right now, we aim to drive the brand's growth on the global level. Adopt Parfums is a small rising brand in France, but tomorrow, we also want it to be the fastest-growing, globally. We are already present in 40 countries, but we are not planning to stop here. We opened a subsidiary in Spain last January, with two stores, in Barcelona and Madrid. We intend to grow the same business in Spain as in France. In China, we have been developing a digital strategy. We already have several stores in Asia, in South Korea, Vietnam, etc. The US is a more complex market – we should enter it this year. African countries also offer a big potential, and we are actually already present in Nigeria and Cameroon, as well as in the Middle East. Premium Beauty News – What about sustainability? Frédéric Stoeckel – We work a lot on ingredient supply chains. Adopt Parfums already supports efforts to reintroduce iris in France, and to make the vanilla chain sustainable in Madagascar, along with our partners. We also have projects focused on patchouli, ylang ylang, etc. We are also working on reducing our carbon impact, in particular by investing almost 3 million euros in the new plant to improve our energy and water consumption and develop recycling. Lastly, we have implemented a recycling policy based on packaging collection in our stores. The hummingbird is our symbol: it perfectly conveys the brand's features, in particular three: femininity, flowers, and environmental responsibility."
"""Brazil is a key market for us,"" says Fernanda Calvet, Sisley Paris","Created in 1976, Sisley Brazil is one of the pioneers of the ""green cosmetics"" segment. With products made from plant ingredients and essential oils, the brand has conquered the world and is now present in more than 100 countries, with a resolutely luxury positioning. In Brazil, Sisley's phytocosmetics have been available since 2013, but it was only a few years ago that the company decided to invest in its own points of sale in the country, all of them being located in high-end shopping centers. ""We started to structure our own retail network as of September 2020, with the opening of a first mini-store, actually a kiosk format at Shopping Cidade Jardim, in São Paulo. Throughout 2021 and 2022, we have continued to expand this channel, with openings in the CJ Shops (São Paulo), Batel (Curitiba) and Iguatemi (Porto Alegre) shopping centers,"" says Fernanda Calvet, the brand's General Manager in Brazil. The last mini-boutique opened its doors at the end of 2022, at Shopping Iguatemi in São Paulo. ""In such a store, we offer our customers quick make-up, hair care and skin care protocols that last no more than 15 to 20 minutes. All of this allowing us to present and test the brand's entire portfolio and to create a direct relationship with consumers,"" explains the manager. The Sisley Paris brand is currently present in 78 points of sale in Brazil, managed directly or by partners, both physically and digitally, including its own online sales site. And development projects are underway. ""In 2023, the brand will open its first physical store, including an in-cabin service for more complete skin and hair care protocols,"" announces Fernanda Calvet. ""The Brazilian market is fundamental for the brand, and we're investing more and more, year after year, in retail expansion, with both off and online launches, as well as in the structure of the Brazilian subsidiary"", explains the general manager, without revealing the details of the strategy outlined for the future of Sisley in the country. Fernanda Calvet recalls that Brazil is an important country when cosmetics are concerned; it is a source of inspiration and trends, with strong leadership in several categories, such as perfumes and hair products. Moreover, the growth of local consumption in the luxury segment has placed the country in the radar of multinationals. ""The luxury cosmetics market in Brazil has proven its strength and solidity and has grown even in the midst of the recent crisis. The search for personalization and exclusivity in the consumer journey, through a unique service experience, is strongly increasing. Consuming luxury brings a sense of belonging and the more exclusive and limited it is, the more it is demanded,"" says the manager. Data from the Brazilian Association of Selective Perfumeries (Associação Brasileira das Perfumarias Seletivas - ABPS) prove her right: in Brazil, sales (in value) of imported and luxury cosmetics recorded a 30% growth in 2022 compared to last year. A significant trend for a few years now, and which has not been interrupted by the pandemic. Indeed, with the closure of borders and the scarcity of international travel, some of the consumers who were used to buy cosmetics outside Brazil and in Duty Free shops began to make their purchases inside the country. The rise of the dollar against the Brazilian real also contributed to this change in behaviour."
French premium skincare brand Graine de Pastel seeks added visibility,"When Carole Garcia, a native of Toulouse, created her dermatological laboratory twenty years ago, it all started with woad (Isatis tinctorial), the region's emblematic plant. Listed in the pharmacopoeia for its dermatological virtues, woad is a plant endemic to the foothills of the Pyrenees, whose oil extracted from the seeds is rich in omegas 3/6/9. To develop its products, the company grows its crops in the southwest of France on 60 hectares of agricultural land, thus ensuring total traceability. ""We have our own extraction processes and have developed patented actives. There are four of them to date and a fifth is in its final development stage,"" emphasizes the founder. "" From the plant to the final product, we use our own extracts. What makes the brand so special is the know-how we have acquired with this plant. I consider myself to be an organic activist, but also a supporter of local agricultural practices that we are reviving after five centuries of oblivion,"" explains Carole Garcia. The ""proprietary"" actives address the main skin problems, with an anti-ageing active derived from woad proteins, which acts on collagen reactivation for skin regeneration; a complex of woad polyphenols to provide antioxidant benefits; Scalar, an anti-dark spot complex with woad bio-flavonoids to inhibit melanin synthesis; and of course, woad oil, the mainstay of all products for its supply in essential fatty acids. These patented actives are developed exclusively for use in the brand's products, with most of their formulas organic certified. In addition to the fifty existing references, two new organic serums, incorporating the patents, were added in January, an anti-spot serum and a resurfacing serum. ""People who approach the brand are looking first for efficiency, then for the healthy side of our organic formulas or with a minimum of 95% natural origin, and then for the militant side of the short circuit,"" affirms Carole Garcia. The three own pharmacies based in Paris, Toulouse, and Albi have helped to win over a large community of customers, who are loyal to the brand's committed values, through advice and support. The website and the brand's deployment in pharmacies, which began three years ago, add to the brand's visibility, which it intends to continue to develop. ""We are present in about 200 top pharmacies in France, in which we already have good sales results. But this is not enough, we need to develop our presence in pharmacies. The challenge is to make Graine de Pastel known to achieve growth,"" explains the manager. Asia, in particular China and Taiwan, is one of the priority export markets on which Carole Garcia wishes to concentrate and establish the brand's presence. ""We are a family-run SME and I did not want to let any investment fund enter into the capital. The idea is not to spread ourselves too thin and lose our soul, but rather to move forward step by step with the trust of our customers,"" she declares. Bolstered by its ultra-loyal community and word of mouth, the brand is relying on its values and the effectiveness of its products to gradually build its network. ""Twenty years ago, we were probably a bit ahead of the game, but today our values are spot on with the trend. Customers are very concerned about what they buy and with us, they know that it's not a posture, it's real. Our vision of the future will allow us to continue to accompany women in their desire to make the right choices for their skin, but also for their health and that of the planet,"" concludes Carole Garcia."
CPL Aromas responds to market constraints with EcoBoost technology,"EcoBoost helps significantly reduce the concentration of perfumes, without compromising on power and quality. With low concentrations, intense materials can be used in higher quantity, and therefore offer the same performance as current standards. By using only 10% of a standard quantity, this innovation provides a solution to the increasingly complex issues when it comes to perfume formulation. With lower concentration, volume, and sourcing, the EcoBoost technology reduces the energy needed for manufacturing. This way, CPL Aromas helps lower its perfumes' carbon footprint and boost brands' sustainable credibility. The main benefit of this innovation is its low concentration: perfumers can craft high-performance trails with a palette of powerful, renewable ingredients. ""If this technology has always been ecofriendly, now it can meet the increasing demand for sustainability"", says Alexandra Paumard, evaluator at CPL Aromas. But EcoBoost has more than one string to its bow. Thanks to condensed formulas, perfume concentrates and volumes are reduced, which minimizes packaging and transport costs. The low concentration also reduces the mass of ingredients and allergens, so the label is also lighter. In addition, with a very low solvent quantity, EcoBoost enhances the solubility, stability, and compatibility of perfumes with their bases. Plus, it solves the increasing challenges related to sourcing. ""The industry is facing sourcing issues which compel companies to work with tight flows"", explains Alexandra Paumard. ""The EcoBoost technology helps source less and better, without compromising on quality and on the olfactory characteristics of the formulas. That is a valuable point, given the rise of raw material costs."" Ultimately, this innovation offers the advantage of reproducing the same formulas, whatever the form: a fragrance, a candle, or a skincare product. Given its low concentrations, EcoBoost drives companies to rethink their formulation methods. Olivier Maurel, perfumer at CPL Aromas, explains that this technology required some time to adapt, in particular as regards the choice of raw materials. ""In the first years, experimentation helped develop a methodology, which was passed on to younger perfumers."" The EcoBoost palette is composed of about 200 ingredients, including powerful CPL captive molecules, so perfumers can craft intense trails. Thanks to this innovation, companies can reintegrate materials whose use is limited by IFRA, ""including natural ingredients like oak moss, or molecules such as coumarin, or certain musks"", and still be compliant with current regulations. ""Since the quantity used is ten times lower, we can use more, proportionately"", adds Olivier Maurel. Lastly, the EcoBoost technology makes it easier to use expensive, qualitative natural ingredients to which certain customers would not have access with standard formulas. All in all, this innovative approach frees the search for aesthetics from many regulatory or financial burdens. Initially prized by mass consumption brands, EcoBoost now targets customers with various profiles, including in fine perfumery. Its sustainable assets and sophisticated formulas appeal to niche, high-end companies looking for creativity. With EcoBoost, CPL Aromas offers a 360° response to most varied creative specifications. Perfectly adapted to the requirements of an ever-changing market, this promising technology paves the way for new creative opportunities, since it is compatible with the use of innovative captive molecules."
Asia and sustainable innovation were the main highlights of Cosmoprof 2023,"With 2,984 exhibitors (+11% compared to 2022) and more than 250,000 visitors, the 2023 edition of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna has returned to the level of attendance of 2018 and is approaching the record of 2019, the year before the pandemic, which had recorded more than 265,000 visitors. ""Cosmoprof is once again the reference showcase for the industry in the world,"" underlined Gianpiero Calzolari, President of BolognaFiere. The return of operators from China and Taiwan largely contributed to the success of the event, which allowed companies and manufacturers to recover projects and collaborations with markets or suppliers that continue to be a key component of global trade. This was especially true for Cosmopack, the part of the show dedicated to suppliers of beauty brands. ""After several years of China being closed due to the pandemic, it was important for us to resume our relationships with international customers,"" said Johnney Woo, CEO of Beauty Yaurient, a Chinese manufacturer of beauty applicators and accessories. The company will also participate in Beautyworld Japan in May, then MakeUp in Paris in June and MakeUp in New York in September, and Cosmoprof Asia in Hong Kong next November. At the same time, Beauty Yaurient is innovating with the use of natural materials for its brushes (wood or bio-composites), glue-free assembly techniques and the creation of brushes with removable bamboo handles and ferrules. Taiwan's Epopack had a similar will to reconnect with international markets. The company presented at Cosmoprof its new PET droppers with NBR bulb, which were unveiled at Luxe Pack Los Angeles last month. For its part, Hangzhou Ebei Industry Co., Ltd. caused a sensation with its Angled Essence Dropper Bottle and its very original design allowing it to tilt on a 45-degree bevel angle for an easier flow of the contents at the end of use. The design has been honoured by a Cosmopack Award. Sino-Italian manufacturer MYC Packaging Innovation also scooped an award for their 100% aluminium mascara, which combines luxury and durability. All components of the Metallica Mascara can be crafted in PIR and PCR aluminium and are recyclable infinitely. Broadly speaking, sustainability was once again one of the key trends at the show, alongside the ability to produce and deliver with agility formulas, packaging and turnkey products that meet latest trends. On the sustainability side, Geka impressed visitors with its post-consumer recycled material (PCR) mascara brush fibres and its new patented decoration technology that does not require additional film or ink. Faber-Castell Cosmetics also set a milestone in terms of environmental friendliness with a rechargeable mechanical cosmetics pencil dubbed Protopia. These are just a few examples and we will come back with more details about the numerous novelties and innovations spotted at the show."
Melvita to rise again as a major organic cosmetics player,"If it is present in 15 countries, Melvita mainly sells in France and Japan. However, on the French market, which accounts for 38% of its turnover, ""the flood of clean and natural cosmetics brands makes the offering plethoric and the market even more competitive, which can explain the reduced sales volume of organic cosmetics"", explains Nathaëlle Davoust, who has managed the brand for just over a year as the General Manager. As the number 1 in terms of organic brand awareness on the French market, according to a study conducted by the Bioalaune platform in 2015, Melvita still boasts a few assets. ""Thanks to our expertise since 1983, and to our strong popularity, we aim to get one step ahead again and to reconquer our position as a key industry player. To this aim, we have decided to celebrate our 40th anniversary by taking various actions throughout 2023, including unprecedented ones"", says the Manager. The pharmacy and parapharmacies (OTC stores) channel is at the core of Melvita's strategy to reconquer the French market: the company aims to be present in 1,000 additional pharmacies by 2024. Moreover, the brand deployed a team of hosts in its points of sale to (re)establish a dialogue focused on its strong sustainability values (Ecocert certification, Cosmebio labelling, French manufacturing in the Ardèche region, near Lyon, recyclable packaging choices, sustainable harvesting charter, close relationship with producers), but also on sensoriality and efficacy, two other Melvita assets. Also, the brand is still widely present in specialized organic stores, and it remains an exclusive brand in the Marionnaud selective network. To support the launch of its new range, Nectar de Lumière, for the first time, Melvita will deploy an ad campaign on bus shelters, in nine big French cities, starting from April 2023. Meanwhile, the brand will be showcased in the Parisian metro for seven days, with a poster campaign in five stations (Madeleine, Montparnasse, Opéra, Pont de Neuilly, and La-Motte-Picquet-Grenelle), with a view to reach a very high number of contacts (an estimate of 23 million people). On social media, for its 40th anniversary, the brand imagined a communication approach focused on its loyal customers and its collaborators, who will turn into models specially for the campaign. A brand committed to preserving biodiversity since it was founded, Melvita chose to celebrate its 40th anniversary by supporting WWF France in its efforts to protect the marine biodiversity. The company will contribute to the Saving Sea Turtle programme in Guyana and New Caledonia for a period of three years. This partnership has two main goals: take part in funding sea turtle preservation projects, and raise customer awareness by offering iconic products in limited edition. The Argan Oil, the Argan Bio-Active Cream, and the Intense Organic Rose Extraordinary Water were decorated with illustrations by Lisa Congdon representing a sea turtle in its natural habitat. According to the brand, the appearance of dark spots is the third main concern among global beauty consumers. ""That is why we have worked so hard to offer them an organic, efficient answer with our new Nectar de Lumière range, whose flagship active is rainbow seaweed. A cream and a serum are already available, and a two-phase water will be launched next June to complete the range"", explains Didier Thévenin, the brand's spokesman. The rainbow seaweed extract directly acts on complexion radiance by targeting dark spots to reduce their appearance (-18%, according to a study conducted by the brand). Ultimately, the range does not breach any of the brand's commitments: the bottle and jar are composed of 40% of recycled glass and 50% of recycled plastic, the packs are made of FSC-certified cardboard, the iridescent seaweed used in the formulas is harvested by hand in Brittany, France, and the serum contains 100% of ingredients of natural origin, and the cream, 99%!"
A breath of fresh air for L.T. Piver perfumes,"The brand was born in the perfume shop À la Reine des Fleurs, founded in 1774. It owes its name to perfumer Louis Toussaint Piver, who in 1813 bought the place where he had started as an apprentice. The brand developed and opened branches abroad as soon as 1817, before becoming a supplier to the Emperor, in 1858. In 1896, Jacques Roucher, director of the Paris Opera, took over the company. As a visionary, he foresaw that the recent use of chemical synthesis would modernize perfumery and surrounded himself with creative chemists. The result was Trèfle Incarnat (1898), one of the great successes of the Belle Époque era. He developed the brand through the growth of advertizing and increased the number of branches on the global level. At the dawn of the 1920s, the French company, whose motto was ""L.T. Piver perfumes the world"", was one of the few companies that generated more than half of its turnover abroad. The brand lived through the decades following the war, in particular by relying on the success of its famous hair ""lotions"" derived from its perfumes. In 1967, the company was awarded the French Legion of Honour decoration for its longevity and the quality of its products. However, like many old brands, it never really returned to its glory days. In 1989, L.T. Piver was bought by the Franco-Algerian Amouyal family from the Rhône-Poulenc chemical group. In June 2022, the brand caught Nelly Chenelat's attention. After 30 years working in the world of perfume at Cartier, Mugler, or YSL, in various positions, she aspired to a personal, creative project. She discovered L.T. Piver and was immediately seduced by its heritage and creativity, and the excellent value for money of its made in France products. The owner, Éric Amouyal, agreed to sell the brand. To boost the brand's renewal, Nelly Chenelat has decided to rely on the olfactory richness of fragrances that survived the past few years without any communication support, thus opening up numerous perspectives. L.T. Piver's flourishing heritage, a source of inspiration and an ideal basis for storytelling, represents another asset, as is its global dimension, since it sells over 2 million units worldwide (in the Caribbean, the United States, the Middle-East, Cambodia, etc.). In addition to all this, the new owner says, L.T. Piver stands out thanks to its quality craftsmanship. By 1860, the brand had three factories in Paris, Aubervilliers, and Grasse. Still in operation, the last one carries out raw material blending, concentrate maturation, alcohol integration, and maceration. As the L.T. Piver perfume company has always sourced its own ingredients, its internal know-how offers a singular olfactory signature, while guaranteeing the confidentiality of formulas. ""The notion of blending is essential for the brand, because it involves maturation or maceration times that impact the perfume's olfactory rendering"", explains Joëlle Lerioux, chosen by Nelly Chenelat as her in-house perfumer. The diversity of the L.T. Piver catalogue is as inspiring as the brand's craftsmanship. Starting from the beginning of the 20th century, the company developed body and hair soap, scented pastilles, ointments, brillantine, but also hair lotions inspired by its perfumes, Rêve d'Or, Pompeïa and Héliotrope Blanc, which are still available today. ""L.T. Piver's offering is really generous, it is aimed at a wide range of customers, regardless of their purchasing power"", explains Nelly Chenelat. ""It's a beauty and well-being perfumery,"" adds Joëlle Lerioux. The objective is to assert and perpetuate the masstige positioning of the current range, while developing new, more ""niche"" fragrances. Héliotrope Blanc, Cuir de Russie or Rêve d'Or, inexpensive references popular with perfume lovers, will therefore remain more or less at the same price. The new products, however, will have a premium positioning, and new extracts or fragrances will be designed. It is a creative work in its own right, drawing on the brand's heritage, for which Joëlle Lerioux endeavours to paraphrase the olfactory signature, not to betray its DNA, while preserving its quality. This continuity is based in particular on the brand's craftsmanship, which was passed on, and on its autonomy. The heritage of this historic house will also help develop a range of skincare products inspired from the old products, with formulas updated to the latest standards and tastes. Through L.T. Piver, Nelly Chenelat and Joëlle Lerioux hope to promote a quality, popular perfumery. An ""old-fashioned perfumery which involves taking the time to make something beautiful"". The ongoing projects are expected to come to market next year. They might be previewed at the TFWA 2023, in Cannes."
Freedge Beauty changes name to Les Cosmétiques Frais and raises EUR 1.5 M,"The French expert of ultra-fresh skincare products is gaining momentum! Previously named Freedge Beauty, the brand has changed name to Les Cosmétiques Frais, but the concept remains the same: ultra-fresh, natural and seasonal face and body care products made of squeezed fruits and vegetables, including strawberries, tomatoes, carrots, raspberries and blueberries. ""A French name better exemplifies the values of our brand, which is 100% local with sourcing close to our press located in Clermont-Ferrand in the centre of France,"" says Laurence Casey, co-founder. Freshly B Corp certified, the brand recently raised 1.5 million euros from Crédit Agricole Auvergne, Auvergne Business Angels, the FM Invest fund and independent investors. The funds will make it possible to finance the automation of certain parts of the manufacturing process, the creation of new products, as well as communication actions. The three partners behind the start-up — all of whom have worked for cosmetics giants such as L'Oréal, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson — have come up with a range of fresh cosmetics made from organic, seasonal fruit and vegetables grown in France as part of a local approach to sourcing. Not content with favouring quality plants, the brand also contributes to developing the local economy. More specifically, the various plants and produce selected for their numerous skin benefits are grown in France, before leaving for the production site, near Clermont-Ferrand, where they are peeled and then cold pressed to preserve a maximum of nutrients. Thanks to a patented process, each of the facial care products is formulated with a high concentration of pressed juices, from 74% for the jellies to 92% for the serums. The final step is shipping. After being packaged in small containers, they arrive at the customer's home within three days (for customers in France). Once empty, plastic-free packaging can be returned free of charge to the brand, which cleans and sterilizes them before refilling them. Today, the brand is mainly available online, via its website (www.lescosmetiquesfrais.fr) or platforms dedicated to green and ethical products such as Bien ou Bien and Dreamact. ""We are also distributed by the La Ruche Qui Dit Oui retail network throughout France. The development of our refrigerated box will help us find the right approach for or fresh beauty concept in brick-and-mortar retails and salons, but for the moment we focus on digital sales,"" underlines Laurence Casey. The brand achieved a turnover of 500,000 euros in 2022, more than twice the amount of 2021, and is aiming for one million euros in 2023. ""We have around 10,000 subscribers and half of them are regular buyers, with many very loyal customers, some of them having already placed more than 30 orders in two years. The time between two purchases is of 40 days on average, considering that our containers can be used for about of one month"", specifies Laurence Casey. The brand also plans to roll out its concept on various market across the world, starting with the United States. ""The globalisation of the brand will rely on the local duplication of our concept, with the dedicated presses settled on the different targeted markets and local sourcing of fruits and vegetables""."
WPE technology makes perfume love water,"The alcohol-free perfume trend had been brewing for a few years. It is now becoming clearer and clearer, with major launches like Dior's J'adore Parfum d'Eau. And it is an opportunity for Neovix Biosciences, a specialist in plant-based O/W microemulsions, to highlight its patented WPE (for Water Plant Emulsion) process. ""With my partner Christian Sarbach, we have been working for more than ten years on this technology, which had already been used by Hermès for the water-based perfume series Jardin après la Mousson, Jardin sur le Nil, and Jardin en Méditerranée. Now, the trend for natural and alcohol-free products and fragrances has grown, and we have many requests"", says Marc Bonnevay, Director of SCM Cosmétiques - Neovix Biosciences Group. Sabé Masson, with its Soft Perfume Liquide, and Maison Sybarite, with the collection of eaux de parfum, also chose this solution in keeping with a more skin- and environmentally friendly offering. The WPE technology is an innovative process for dispersing the perfumed composition in pure water, without using any alcohol or solvent, but based on a plant-derived ingredient. ""It is an oil-in-water dispersion; not solubilization, which is used with alcohol, nor encapsulation. That is what makes our technology different and interesting. The binder is a plant extract in very small quantity: a saponin derived from a variety of tea. Today, our formulations pass accelerated stability tests for one month at 50 degrees"", explains Marc Bonnevay. The billions of micro-droplets in the composition give the juice a milky effect. It is recommended to use opaque packaging to protect the emulsion, and to add Ecocert preservatives. ""The same technology is used for skincare products. It all depends on the oil concentration. For a perfumer, it is 5% to 15% of perfumed concentrate, but you can go up to 20%, 30%, or 40% of argan oil, for example, while keeping great fluidity. Therefore, the product moisturizes and perfumes at the same time"", adds the Director. The absence of alcohol directly leads to base and heart notes, producing an olfactory identity that is as close as possible to the perfumer's creation, as well as reinforced remanence. The fragrance concentrate used with the WPE patent therefore provides a 100% natural, non-irritant perfume. Moisturizing and non-oily, the microfluidic emulsion melts into the skin without any risk of allergy. As a result, the solution suits all skin types, even the most fragile, such as that of children and babies, and has just been chosen for the new range of Toofruit perfumes for children. It can also be applied as a fragrant mist onto hair, without drying it out. ""This is a major development. Alcohol-free perfume is a very strong trend, and pump suppliers such as Aptar and Silgan are all working on models designed for microemulsions, because they believe it is the future"", says Marc Bonnevay. Between perfume and skincare, the WPE technology seems to be imposing itself, with new launches planned this year on an alcohol-free perfume market that is still struggling to find its feet. ""The Dior Parfum d'Eau effect is beneficial and will set an example. We are still dealing with the constraint of a high industrialization cost, but the more we grow, the easier it will be to lower costs"", concludes Marc Bonnevay."
"UpCircle Beauty, or how to become a key, successful upcycled cosmetics brand","Coffee grounds, at the origin of the concept, kiwi, blueberry, and orange waste from the food industry, unsold items from the London flower market… the committed brand UpCircle now uses twenty upcycled ingredients, sourced from all over the world for their cosmetic products. ""Powders, oils, waters… we will continue to diversify the ingredients we work with and demonstrate there are endless possibilities with this kind of raw material supplied in very large quantities by different industries. Our latest launches contain new ingredients that we have never used before, such as rose petals infused in bath salts, or hibiscus flower acids for a hand cream"", says the co-founder. Founded in 2016 by Anna Brightman and her brother William, UpCircle has already developed a range of almost 40 face care, body care, and recently, hair care products based on these types of ingredients. ""The brand has grown a lot over the past two years"", confirms Anna Brightman. Distributed in department stores, independent shops and online, UpCircle is present in forty countries, and claims affordable, environmentally friendly performance in several respects. ""Above all, products must be effective and offer high performance. We put a lot of effort into innovation. We will not use an upcycled ingredient unless its benefits are clinically and dermatologically proven"", says the founder. In addition, the brand commits to controlling the use of packaging. For its UK customers, UpCircle has set up a package return and refill programme through the postal service. ""We mainly use glass and aluminium, which are recyclable in most countries. We have also implemented a package return system. When you finish your product at home, you can buy it back 20% cheaper on the website: you will then receive a label by email for you to send us back the empty jar for free. We clean it, sterilise it, and refill it. You will then receive the product in your packaging after 4 to 5 days. Our packs are 99% plastic-free, and we offer a solution for the remaining 1%, such as pipettes"", explains Anna Brightman. The system is currently in place in the UK and is about to be implemented in other countries. With one product sold every 90 seconds, the brand keeps growing, in particular with the help of a GBP 480,000 (approximately EUR 545,000 or USD 580,000) crowdfunding campaign in 2022. The funds will be used to expand distribution in other markets. ""Our biggest markets are the UK and the US, but we are trying to grow in Europe, although it is difficult due to Brexit"", notes Anna Brightman. Investments in communication and marketing and the development of products in new categories are also top priorities. ""We have reinvested all of our profits into our business and new product development"", she adds. UpCircle is planning to launch new ranges in the near future: hair products next month, then baby products and make-up. Proof, if any were needed, of the cosmetic validity of by-products from circular supply chains, the British brand's success is setting a new model to follow."
IL Cosmetics Group sets sail for North America,"""We are now one of the top 3 European make-up manufacturers, and we are posting double-digit growth, thanks to our investments (a new laboratory, a new R&D resources) and expanded capacities in our three European production and filling sites,"" explains Jean-François Harpes, CEO of IL Cosmetics Group. Since the mid-2000s, the Luxembourgish group has been able to diversify its activities to become a world-class color cosmetics manufacturer, with an extensive multi-product portfolio in the nail, eye and lip categories. ""Driven by reliability and transparency, we guarantee performances through a deep consumer centricity approach,"" adds the manager. Today, IL Cosmetics Group provides beauty brands with turnkey products based on the latest technologies, the latest trends and high quality standards, with strong support at all stages of the project. And the company can boast of great successes! ""We are the manufacturer of one of the best-selling mascaras in the world and one of the biggest and best-selling lipgloss ranges in Europe,"" highlights Aurélie Ignaccolo, Head of Marketing Director at IL Cosmetics. ""These worldwide top sellers have become real benchmarks for many brands, including in the United States."" To accelerate its globalization strategy, the group thus intends to rely on the renowned international references that have opted for made-in-Luxembourg make-up. And logically, the United States are the first stop of the journey. IL Cosmetics Group will first open a sales office in the country and, in the medium to long term, the stated objective is to have a production site in North America. In the lips category, IL Cosmetics Group seeks to meet the demand for instant plumping products, which is growing strongly. The group successfully transposed instant plumping from usual lip gloss textures to a semi-matte liquid lipstick format. ""At MakeUp in Los Angeles, we have introduced Demi Matt Plumper, an instant lip volumizer liquid lipstick that delivers opaque and intense one-swipe color with a non-dry satin finish. This product has already caught the curiosity of several brands,"" says Laura Pereira, Senior Lips Product Manager. In the eyes category, the consumer demand, driven by social media, is oriented towards mascaras that provide make-up results in just a few strokes. ""Products need to deliver instant gratification through visible transformations that are 'TikTok worthy'. Hence the need for products with fast volume like our Volume Maximizer that made a buzz in LA,"" emphasizes Juanita Parra, Marketing Manager Make Up. These innovations will of course also be visible at the next Cosmoprof show in Bologna, Italy, alongside a collection of mascaras that come in recycled packaging, have a bio-based brushes and are paired with performing formulas that have a high percentage of naturality. Of course, IL Cosmetics remains a key player in the nail category, a market now driven by new hybrid technologies inspired by semi-permanent gels and available in retail thanks to new ""HEMA-free and DI-HEMA-free"" formulations which will be previewed at the Cosmoprof event (stand G13-F14 Hall 15)."
L'Oréal debuts Carol's Daughter in France before European roll out,"Carol's Daughter was a forerunner in the market for natural products for textured hair, before other popular brands such as Melanin, Pattern, and Mielle Organics. The brand was born in 1993 in Brooklyn, in the kitchen of its founder Lisa Price, where she started out making fragrances on weekends before focusing her attention toward body care products. Encouraged by her mother Carol and by the success of her first creations sold at the church flea market, she quickly understood that there was a strong demand for effective, non-aggressive natural products suitable for textured hair. ""I was credited with starting the natural movement in haircare, but actually this was due to the fact that I started formulating in my kitchen, so I searched simple things matching with what my customers wanted,"" said Lisa Price during a press conference in Paris last week. Carol's Daughter experienced rapid development in the early 2000s, before being acquired by L'Oréal in 2014. An operation that sparked backlash from consumers, worrying about the fact the brand would struggle to hold on to the authenticity and DNA. ""In the US, Black people did not have a history of doing things with White-owned companies. We have bad stories of Black entrepreneurs having been stolen by big corporations and I think that's why the conversation was not good at the time of the acquisition. But now, things are different and we have proven that with L'Oréal, we were able to do things even better for our customers,"" explained Lisa Price. By joining L'Oréal, Carol's Daughter was able to expand their footprint in the United States and selling their body, skin and hair care products with the main retailers throughout the country, until their entry at Target in 2021. An important issue since, even in the United States, the distribution of products adapted to afro-textured hair and skin is insufficient, showed McKinsey in a recent report [1]. In Europe, things are certainly no better. Even when they manage to find a store that offers products that suit their needs, consumers are often disappointed with the quality or quantity of what's available. It is to meet these expectations that Carol's Daughter now takes its first steps on the French market, a few months after its launch in the United Kingdom and before rolling out accross the rest of Europe. Four product ranges - Goddess Strength, Black Vanilla, Coco Creme and Wash Day Delight - covering most of the needs of curly and frizzy hair will be available from March, in 150 specialized sales points and on Amazon, at recommended selling prices ranging from 8 to 15 euros."
"After a pandemic slowdown, Cosmoprof is back in force in Bologna","Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna is back for a 54th edition with growing numbers. The leading B2B event for the beauty industry will be held from 16th to 20th March 2023 in Bologna, Italy. As announced by the organizers during a press conference held in Milan, the show will gather under one roof over 2.900 companies (+11% compared to 2022) from 64 countries. According to BolognaFiere Cosmoprof, the company behind the event, decisive factors of the growing numbers recorded in the March edition are the return of companies from China and Taiwan, that previously were unable to exit their respective countries. 60% of exhibitors are coming from Europe, and the remaining 40% are from other continents. A total of 29 country pavilions will gather small and medium companies from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, California, China, Czech Republic, Ecuador, France, Germany, Greece, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, Latvia, Poland, Romania, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Turkey, UK, Ukraine, and the USA. Argentina, Australia, India, and Romania were not attending in 2022 and are returning this year. Ireland will attend the exhibition with its National Agency for the first time eve. Pre-registered visitors to the event up to now are coming from 116 countries. Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna expects to attract selected buyers from 50 countries thanks to the support of the Italian Trade Agency (ITA), and its offices across the world. ""Delegations of buyers, retailers, and distributors from the most strategic markets, such as North America, Europe, Middle East, Asia, and Oceania will meet Cosmoprof 2023 exhibitors to discover new proposal and industrial solutions. The interaction with the Health & Beauty network, part of BolognaFiere Cosmoprof, will bring to Bologna a delegation of top buyers representing the European professional distribution channel,"" said the organizers. To meet business habits and needs of the beauty sector and international stakeholders opening dates of each parts of the show have been revised. For the first time this year, Cosmopack, the area dedicated to the companies of the supply chain, and Cosmo Perfumery & Cosmetics, with the players of the retail channel and of prestige and mass market, will open for three days only, from Thursday to Saturday, since foreign operators prefer to concentrate business meetings in the working days. Cosmo Hair, Nail & Beauty Salon, the areas dedicated to the professional channel, will maintain the traditional 4-day opening, from Friday to Monday, in order to welcome the operators when salons and beauty salons are closed ""Up to now data foreshadow a successful edition,"" said Enrico Zannini, General Director of BolognaFiere Cosmoprof. ""Today attendees are pre-registering from 116 countries in the world. We are recording better results than for the 2019 edition, before the pandemic, and registrations from outside Italy are growing significantly. Compared to 2022 our digital community is much more committed, both on social media and on our website, with a growth up to 15% of engagement rate. These references confirm the recovery of both the fair and beauty sectors. We are ready to host our beauty community in Bologna, to feel again the buzz, the creativity, and the optimism of our industry."""

There will also be a 10-year anniversary celebration in Los Angeles on March 2, for media and the Beautycounter community."
"Meiyume, a turnkey solution orchestrator for the cosmetics industry","Thanks to the acquisition, since 2007, of eleven companies with complementary businesses, the Hong Kong-based Meiyume company, the beauty division of the Fung Group, now offers a wide-ranging business model covering formulation, packaging – primary and secondary – and digital retail solutions. Upstream, the ""product solutions"" unit takes care of development and production, at all stages of the value chain. The R&D laboratory defines the formulation and sourcing, mainly for skincare and makeup, as well as the package design, in a pack developed in-house or suggested by the customer. ""We are not just contract packagers, we need to add value to a project"", says François Camilli, Executive Vice President – Meiyume Europe. The company has five factories around the world, in the United States, the United Kingdom, Thailand, Indonesia, and China. They are focused on the skincare, makeup, and fragrance formulation business: the facilities meet mixing, filling and supply requirements for all formulas, whether they are powders, water-based, or alcohol-based. ""This way, we can formulate and fill in several locations around the world. It makes it possible to build supply chains according to the brands' needs and the markets they wish to target. We can also work with partners on a 'make or buy' basis, so we can have the desired 'Made In' label on the products, depending on the brands' requests"", adds François Camilli. Meiyume's expertise also includes the design and development of primary packaging, as well as the design of promotional products. Production is outsourced to a network of ten exclusive partners mainly based in China. ""We are known for our ability to arrange the supply chain for complex multi-material packaging. One of our best examples is the orchestration of eleven factories producing 17 components to deliver a finished product to our customers. The notion of added value is always paramount"", emphasizes the manager. Finally, to support brands from A to Z, the company offers the technological implementation of retail solutions. To help set up traditional POS advertising, Meiyume is now able to collect the feelings and behaviour of consumers at the point of sale via digital technology. ""Through data and analysis, we have the technical means to inform our clients of consumers' reactions to the products when they see them on display, all over the world"", says François Camilli. ""This information helps them define their target or product more precisely, if necessary"", he continues. Through its OneHome platform, a suite of applications integrated to POS ads, brands can manage the installing, updating and maintenance process for in-store displays. In addition, connected displays can adapt the interactive experience to the audience. For example, a screen fitted with a facial analysis camera adjusts the video content shown according to the gender of the person facing it. Already widespread in Asia, these digital experiences at the point of sale should soon develop in Europe, according to François Camilli."
"Carita, spearhead of the L'Oréal Luxe Division on the skincare market","As the skincare and wellness market is booming around the world, L'Oréal continues to invest in this sector, boosted by the successful relaunch of its premium skincare brand Helena Rubinstein, which made a comeback in Asia in late 2019. Buoyed by the interest of the Asian public in high-end, made-in-France skincare, the brand boasts excellent results and is performing well in its segment. With Carita, the cosmetics giant is investing in ultra-premium skincare, building on the brand's very Parisian identity. In October 2022, after two years of works, the brand celebrated the rebirth of its iconic address at 11 Faubourg Saint-Honoré, in Paris, a hairdressing – and then Global Beauty – hot spot since 1952, when it was launched by the Carita sisters, Maria and Rosy. The year 2022 also saw the relaunch of a new skincare range consisting of 18 topical products: the offering was reworked and premiumized with new formulas and packaging. A brand-new facial cleansing foam will be released in mid-February 2023. These products are available as part of beauty treatments and elevated with a rich list of protocols at the Paris Maison de Beauté or at the Hotel Martinez in Cannes. Now that Carita has returned to Paris with great fanfare, China is the top priority. The brand products are available in beauty salons and as retail goods in the spas of renowned Chinese palaces: Mandarin Oriental in Shenzhen and Beijing, and Capella in Shanghai. Three dedicated brand outlets were also opened in Nanjing (Deji Plaza), Beijing (Beijing SKP), and Shanghai (Shanghai New World Daimaru). The group aims for Carita to keep expanding in China, and more widely in Asia, in the months and years to come. With its 1,800 square metres of floor space, the mansion, which houses the Carita Maison de Beauté on five floors, owes its new style to the talent of architects Sophie Thuillier and Cristiano Benzoni. Since it was opened, the place has been mainly visited by Parisian women and men (25% of men regularly come to the hairdressing salon), but also by fashion and movie celebrities. As the address perfectly embodies luxury à la française, a more global clientele is expected very soon, in particular Chinese customers. For the L'Oréal group, it also showcases the ambition and know-how of the Luxe Division, highlighting the beauty world in its ""globalness"". The entrance to the building is through the iconic Carita porch. Then, customers walk under a series of arches to reach the sumptuous atrium, which gives an idea of the extent of the premises. The ground floor houses various areas, including a treatment bar with all the products in the range, a store with decorative objects and ready-to-wear, a reception desk, and a skin diagnosis area. Then, stairs (and a lift) lead to the eleven treatment suites and to the hair salon, located in the centre of the building, as a tribute to the two Carita sisters. The stylist team includes the famous hairdresser John Nollet, who has also been appointed Artistic Director of Carita. Right now, the L'Oréal Professionnel brand is used for hair care and styling, but a range of hair products by Carita may soon be launched. On the same floor as the hairdressing salon, eye care and semi-permanent makeup services are also offered. Plus, there is the 35-seat Rosy restaurant, served by chef Amandine Chaignot. The Maison de Beauté even has a 130 square metre flat that can be booked for private and professional events. On the top floor, the staff can go to the Carita Academy to practice and study during off-peak hours. Lastly, to pay tribute to the history of the Maison and the Carita sisters, a 245-page book, Carita - 11 Fbg Saint Honoré Paris, written by Laurence Benaim, has just been published by Éditions Assouline!"
Spanish fashion designer and fragrance king Paco Rabanne dead at 88,"""I am deeply saddened by the passing of Mr. Paco Rabanne. The history of Puig and Paco Rabanne began in the late 1960s with the launch of Calandre, the perfume created soon after the designer released '12 Unwearable Dresses in Contemporary Materials.' A major personality in fashion, his was a daring, revolutionary and provocative vision, conveyed through a unique aesthetic. He will remain an important source of inspiration for the Puig fashion and fragrance teams, who continuously work together to express Mr. Paco Rabanne's radically modern codes. I extend my sincere condolences to his family and to those who have known him,"" stated Marc Puig, Chairman and CEO of the Puig group, which owned Rabanne's label since the late 1960s. Francisco Rabaneda-Cuervo was born in 1934 in Spain's Basque region, near the city of San Sebastian, where his mother was a seamstress for the designer Cristobal Balenciaga and his father was an army general. Rabanne's life was uprooted by the Spanish Civil War when the army of dictator Francisco Franco turned on his father, a commander of the Guernica garrison, and gunned him down in 1936. In 1939 his family fled to France and Rabanne went on to study at the Beaux-Arts university in Paris, graduating with a diploma in architecture. Rabanne started out as a co-creator of the 1960s space-age movement in fashion alongside designers such as Pierre Cardin, who incorporated the era's giddy excitement around the future and technological advancements into their clothes. His 1966 show brought immediate fame and notoriety when he stunned the audience with ""12 Unwearable Dresses"", his models dancing barefoot down the catwalk in outfits made of sharp metal and other unlikely materials. Which earned him to be dismissed as ""the metal worker"" by Coco Chanel. His influence nonetheless carried through many generations and he famously dressed global superstar Lady Gaga in outfits made entirely of paper for her 2011 appearance at the MTV Europe Music Awards. It was in 1968 that he signed a license agreement with the Puig family, who owned a perfume manufacturing and distribution business in Barcelona, for the exploitation of perfumes. The launch of ""Calandre"" then marked the first success of a long series. Since 1986, the Puig group, which also owns Nina Ricci, the Carolina Herrera brands and Prada and Comme des Garçons perfumes, has owned the entire Paco Rabanne house. ""Paco Rabanne made transgression magnetic. Who else could induce fashionable Parisian women to clamour for dresses made of plastic and metal?"" said Jose Manuel Albesa, President Puig Beauty & Fashion. Ever the provocateur, Rabanne had a penchant for mysticism and esoterism. In 1999 he predicted in his book ""Fire From Heaven"" that Paris would be destroyed later that year when the Russian space station Mir crashed down to Earth — a claim derived from his reading of the 16th-century French seer Nostradamus. ""To say that Paco Rabanne marches to his own drummer is an understatement,"" the New York Times wrote in 2002. ""He's been called a futurist, couturier, mystic, madman, Dadaist, sculptor, architect, astrologer, perfumer, artist and prophet."""
Pierre Fabre wants to make Brazil its fifth global market,"Pierre Fabre Brasil has moved into new offices. The Group's branch, which owns the Avène, Ducray and Darrow brands, inaugurated a new headquarters in Rio de Janeiro at the end of last year. More spacious, designed to support the growth of the teams and promote experience sharing and interaction between employees, these premises should accompany the company's development in Brazil. ""This new headquarters marks the beginning of a new cycle. Our ambition is to reach 5th place in the company's ranking by 2026, i.e. we want Brazil to be one of Pierre Fabre's top five subsidiaries in the world"", explained CEO Ana Paula Magri. Currently, the country is the group's 10th-largest market in terms of sales. In the last four years, the Group's activity in Brazil has almost doubled, explained the manager. ""We are fortunate to operate in a market that has continued to grow, even during the health crisis. So much so that we chose to maintain our launches during the pandemic and have grown 1.5 times faster than the market in the last two years."" However, Pierre Fabre's growth in Brazil is due to another factor. ""It comes, in large part, from the bet we made to focus on the needs of Brazilians. This strategy has been in place since 2018, when we inaugurated our Brazilian Innovation Centre (BIC), by investing in research and technology to create products tailored to the needs of local consumers."" This is the company's first innovation centre on the American continent and the second outside France. It is of great importance for the growth of the Group's brands in Brazil, said Fernanda Chaves, Head of Technical Development. ""In just four years, the BIC has already developed several products for the local market. These include Darrow's Actine cleansing gel with a new vitamin C formula and the Actine Colors sun lotion. At Avène, the Cleanance Intense cleansing gel and the Cleanance UV SPF70 sun lotion. All designed for the skin of Brazilian consumers."" Ana Paula Magri points out that Darrow and Avène are the leading brands in terms of sales. But Ducray, which was relaunched in Brazil six years ago, is in full swing. ""We are counting on all three brands to increase the weight of the Brazil business within the Group and reach our goal of doubling the size of our business in Brazil in the next four years"", said the CEO. Some other strategic operations should also help us achieve this goal. ""We will continue to focus strongly on dermatology, by expanding our team of visitors to introduce our upcoming launches to dermatologists. We consider all segments of dermo-cosmetics as promising, but six categories, which represent 90% of the Brazilian market, will draw our attention in the coming years. These are acne, sun care, body hydration, anti-ageing, hair and wound healing."" ""Another key building stone of our strategy is to continuously innovate. The dermo-cosmetic segment is driven by innovation, and every year new technologies and actives are launched. We believe that innovations in the Brazilian market will be increasingly linked to the requirements of the public and that many will be co-created in partnership with consumers and dermatologists, as we already do at Pierre Fabre"", concluded the CEO."
Glassmaker Waltersperger invests in new production capacity,"Waltersperger, the last French glassmaker to work exclusively with semi-automatic machinery, has positioned itself on the market with an offering that complements that of the major industrial glassmakers in the luxury sector. ""We are very atypical, because we work in a semi-automatic way with a very traditional approach, since our glass is picked by hand. We therefore address the perfume bottling and spirits markets in a particular way, with greater flexibility on several levels"", explains Stéphanie Tourres, President and owner of the company she bought with her husband in April 2018. The first level of agility is the process, which delivers both hollow glass for bottles and pressed glass for jars and caps. The second level concerns production quantities. Waltersperger offers batches from 10 to 50,000 pieces. This is an advantage for brands with less ambitious orders and a big difference compared to industrial suppliers' offerings. ""Our core business ranges from 100 to 20,000 pieces. This is of interest to major clients who may request limited series or giant glass dummies, which we are the only ones to make in France, and also to niche brands, which represent a large panel of our customers"", says the Director. Ultimately, the company has enough flexibility to handle complex designs, such as the recent dog-shaped bottle of Bobby Miss Dior Limited. ""The mould for the cap, a dog's head, is composed of five parts, which cannot be done with fully automatic machinery. We can also provide a variety of bottle sizes, from 5-g caps to 4-kg bottles, which are also very difficult to produce with automatic lines, particularly due to the small quantities usually involved in these projects"", adds Stéphanie Tourres. Waltersperger also takes charge of the decoration of most of the bottles produced with the help of its local partners established in the Bresle valley, historically the valley of glass. ""The local ecosystem of the Bresle valley is very rich. The glass moulds are ordered from the mould makers around us, and so are the decorations. This is very important, because it minimizes transport, adds responsiveness, boosts regional employment, and guarantees made-in-France manufacturing"", she continues. Since its takeover, the Waltersperger crystal glass company has found its place thanks to an alternative offering, and is experiencing constant growth which has enabled it to double its turnover in five years, reaching 5.3 million euros in 2022. At the same time, the team has grown from 28 to 40 employees. In order to implement the set development plan, the managing couple also wanted to redefine the production capacity by moving to a new, more suitable site. The new factory should be in operation by the end of the year on a 3,200 m2 site located in a High-Environmental-Quality-certified industrial zone, with a production area of 2,500 m2. It will be equipped with the current machines, seven small gas pot furnaces and about ten semi-automatic production machines, as well as new installations. ""These machines allow for very small-scale production in one shift, so we will be adding a new oven in continuous feed with machines that can run 24 hours a day. This will drastically increase our glass tonnage capacity. We are going to go from one tonne to a potential four tonnes per day"", says Stéphanie Tourres. The site is also expected to be fitted with two additional lines, compared to the current four. The project represents an investment of 4.5 million euros, a significant effort in view of the company's turnover and the current energy inflation and rising production costs: +35% for glass composition and +60% for packaging. ""Two years ago, we chose gas for our new oven, because the technology to go electric is hugely more expensive for a small company. Today, the renegotiation of our gas contracts valid until the end of the year poses a major problem for the site's start-up in terms of energy, but electricity prices have also tripled"", adds Stéphanie Tourres in conclusion."
"""Flowers enhance biodiversity"", Isabelle Sultan, Dior","Premium Beauty News – Why choose flowers as a key target? Isabelle Sultan - Flowers are very powerful enhancers of biodiversity. And yet, many studies show they are disappearing. According to a study conducted in September 2021 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), they are becoming extinct twice as fast as animals. Therefore, we need to protect and reintegrate them to the ecosystem. Our commitments and tangible actions for the environment and the climate included a specific role in this field. Flowers are part of our DNA. Christian Dior had a passion for flowers since his childhood. They surrounded his garden and he was fully aware of their power – they guided his inspiration. And of course, it is also because of our perfume business. There can be no perfume without flowers. Premium Beauty News – More specifically, what action do you take? Isabelle Sultan - Parfums Christian Dior has committed to using the power of flowers to regenerate ecosystems. We have 42 gardens or partner gardens around the world: in Grasse, of course, in the south of France, but also in Haiti, for vetiver, and in Madagascar. Our commitment lies in the transition of these 42 gardens towards organic and regenerative farming by 2030. By 2026, 100% of the natural raw materials cultivated in our gardens and partner gardens will also be certified by the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT), one of our key partners. The company has also been investing in research and partnerships to better understand the powerful role of flowers in maintaining biodiversity, natural ecosystems and local communities. We have also set up a partnership with Hectar, the world's largest farming campus dedicated to regenerative agriculture, right next to Paris. The idea is to set up a research programme and partnerships to better understand the role flowers could play in helping biodiversity recover. This strategy will help support future owners, and I also hope it will change people's opinion on the importance of re-flowering ecosystems. Premium Beauty News – Then, could we say that the notion of sustainability has become an integral part of the luxury world? Isabelle Sultan – To me, there is a close relationship between luxury, quality, and good practices: we make products designed to last. A study conducted by the Boston Consulting Group shows that 60% of consumers think it is up to us (luxury companies) to kick off the transition towards environmental protection. We have a real influence on what is desirable or not, and Gen Z demands virtuous practices associated with luxury and desirability. Everybody is aware that we need to turn things around. Consumers are also citizens, and they are ready. Premium Beauty News - Parfums Christian Dior was one of the first luxury brands to develop refillable skincare products and perfumes. Do consumers play their part? Isabelle Sultan - We have been working hard over the past few years to offer refillable solutions for our iconic products. Christian Dior already created refillable lipsticks in the 1950s. The offering of refillable products accounts for almost 20% of our portfolio. This proportion should keep increasing, and so will our ability to educate and influence. The first phase consists in broadening our offering and making it desirable. We need to take the time to get consumers used to these new consumption habits. Premium Beauty News – Other than refillable solutions, what are your targets in terms of packaging ecodesign? Isabelle Sultan – We believe it is our responsibility to make luxury standards change. The first priority is to have removed virgin fossil-based plastics from all packaging by 2028. Then, we will reduce the weight of packaging materials by 50% by 2030. Lastly, 100% of our packaging will be recyclable or refillable by 2028. For example, the refills of Crèmes Dior Prestige reduce the pack weight by 47% at the first refill, and by 63% starting from the second, which reduces the carbon footprint by 50%. In addition, thanks to the investment of LVMH in the development of the Eastman plastic recycling plant, Parfums Christian Dior will also take advantage of this innovative molecular recycling technology for plastic waste. The plant will be operational in 2025 and help the brand gradually eradicate its use of virgin fossil-based plastics. Premium Beauty News – You joined Parfums Christian Dior in January 2021 with a mission: take action as part of a new company sustainability strategy. What is your take on sustainability in the beauty and luxury worlds in the years to come? Isabelle Sultan – I am very optimistic as regards how the luxury industry will boost sustainability. At Parfums Christian Dior, we are very committed and motivated to integrate sustainability to all levels of our business, to all functions, and to all markets. With the support of Laurent Kleitman, President and CEO, and my whole team, we are doing our best to contribute to making the luxury industry rhyme with sustainability."
Global Beauty Consulting favours complex formulation challenges,"Over the past few years, Brittany-based GBC laboratory has positioned itself as the privileged partner of brands with expectations breaking with conventional approaches. ""We have built ourselves the reputation to dive into complex territories. We always try to be one step ahead, whether in terms of galenic forms or of vision, meaning how we want to contribute to the cosmetic industry's progress"", starts its founder, Gael Boutry. Gael Boutry has a passion for cosmetic formulation and an asserted taste for challenge: ""I am interested in anything that is complex. We are actually less into making yet another anti-ageing cream"", he emphasizes. This approach seduces many brands, including those of the Clean Beauty generation, which are eager for new gestures, new galenic forms, and formulas redefined by natural alternatives. ""Our customers are mainly emerging brands. GBC's strength lies in helping them make formulas for which they hold the intellectual property rights. This way, they can start with small series of at least 500 SKUs: the made-in-France formulas belong to them, and they can explore complex territories"", Gael Boutry adds. The support process is global: the laboratory offers its ecosystem of packaging suppliers with similar values, as well as the possibility to benefit from economic feasibility studies conducted upstream. ""From the beginning, brands are aware of the costs related to development and tests, as well as of the factory price. I prefer to refuse a project if I think it is not viable"", he warns. After several years working on the development of solid products, the formulator is now focusing on new concepts. ""We made stick emulsions, like Hyalustick, which was developed with Superga and Cosmogen. It is a solid emulsion which requires waterproof packaging. But to me, hot-poured solid products, like shampoo or makeup-removing balms are just nonsense, from an environmental point of view. Of course, there is less packaging, but the raw materials used involve highly polluting manufacturing processes, high temperatures, then cooling processes… On the contrary, powder solutions require a cold process and much less energy"", he explains. So, he prefers powders to be reconstituted, ""provided we work with people who are perfectly familiar with the powder-pressing technology"", explains Gael Boutry. ""But there will be a limit in terms of sensoriality and distribution: there are not many solutions to distribute powder. With that in mind, we work upstream with packaging suppliers to help them develop tomorrow's packs for powder applications, while making all our formula issues clear to them"". Global Beauty Consulting's main working areas also include the use of fermented ingredients derived from upcycling and of biotechnologies for convenience raw materials. ""Today, we are still highly limited in terms of functional natural ingredients, because biotechnologies are mostly used for the development of actives. Ingredient suppliers will increasingly work on this issue, but to me, the right thing is to also work with biodegradable synthesized products which have no impact on the environment. If everyone chooses the same path, we will not have enough natural ingredients for everyone"", warns Gael Boutry. To him, the search for alternatives has to take into account the formula/process combo on the industrial scale. ""It is a good thing to make beautiful formulas in a laboratory, but it is better not to forget about the process, manufacturing, and packaging part"", he concludes. Well, that is a comprehensive vision of formulation."
"""Innovation also comes from manufacturers"" Laurent Dodet, P&B Group","Premium Beauty News - Why did you take part in the Open Innovation event as a manufacturer/supplier? Laurent Dodet - We aimed to break the mould! It was the first time a designer and producer had taken part in it as a key player! We felt like sending a strong message by standing beside major market brands and suggesting an approach and solutions that stood out, compared to the usual proposals. Innovation can also come from manufacturers – like P&B. We were there to offer project initiators our agility, reactivity, and adaptability, which are at the core of our daily lives, but also our means, know-how, and resources: we develop these by working on a daily basis in an ever-denser, more dynamic environment. As a reminder, every year in our six plants, we work for over 200 brands, on about 1,000 projects. Premium Beauty News - How successful was it? Laurent Dodet - It was very positive and instructive. It helped carry out a comprehensive watch review by screening core issues, as well as all issues requiring reflection and creating emulation in the beauty ecosystem. We are still discussing a few specific subjects with project initiators to go ahead and actually set up support-based partnerships, the objective being to offer these innovations to our portfolio of customers. It is a win-win situation: project initiators get some support, we take advantage of a new innovation, and our customers have access to real differentiating solutions. Premium Beauty News - What are the main innovation solutions you noticed? Laurent Dodet - Most core and reflective issues are focused on sustainability, whether they regard ingredients, packaging, processes, or the product use. Also, new consumer gestures are usually correlated to real industrial challenges – the microbiome, a key issue right now, and the importance of technologies in beauty! Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us about your innovation or R&D projects? Laurent Dodet - As part of Open Innovation, we aim to acquire new formulation and industrial skills to offer our customers highly innovative solid solutions that create new gestures. Right now, we are discussing terms with the different players that caught our attention, so we cannot tell you more. But we are crossing our fingers for these partnership projects to come to fruition. Otherwise, our disruptive innovations include Advanced Water S-100, a new generation of ionized water. We strongly believe in this technology, because it keeps surprising us in increasingly diverse fields and applications. There is also our UHT technology to produce preservative-free cosmetics. And we support the Progelife and Calysens startups specialized in medicine and cosmetics. We believe in their projects and strategies and work hand in hand with them to develop anti-ageing ingredients."
Eurofragance acquires its partner in Indonesia and outs from the U.S.,"Eurofragance has announced plans to acquire its longstanding business partner PT Euronindo Fragrance in Indonesia. Effective on January 17, 2023, the transaction is expected to reinforce the presence of the Spanish fragrance house in the Asia Pacific region. Eurofragance plans to expand its development, and marketing and sales capabilities in the Indonesian market to be on par with local competitors on this market which represents important growth potential for the company. ""Indonesia is a fast-moving country, this is the right time to invest further in a market which we entered over 20 years ago,"" commented Santiago Sabateés, Founder and Chairman of Eurofragance during the official signature ceremony. The Spanish fragrance house entered into partnership with PT Euronindo Fragrance seven years ago. Formerly known as Kemikaroma, the company used to import finished goods from Singapore into Indonesia. ""To date, the company has sustained unparalleled growth and puts us in a comfortable position to go head-to-head with some of the largest competitors in the sector,"" underlines Laurent Mercier, CEO of Eurofragance. At the official closing date of the purchase, Edy Chandra, PT Euronindo's actual Sales Manager will be promoted to Country Manager for the newly founded Eurofragance Indonesia. In parallel to this expansion in Asia, Eurofragance has decided to out from the U.S. market. The company has sold its Eurofragance LLC subsidiary, based in Middlesex, New Jersey to The Riverside Company, effective on December 6, 2022. Eurofragance's entry on the United States market dates back to 2017, with the acquisition of a majority shareholding in Fragrance Design LLC, in Atlanta, Georgia. Mid-2020, the Barcelona-based perfume house outsourced its manufacturing capabilities to OnScent, owned by The Riverside Company. ""After two and half years under this model, Eurofragance USA managed to triple its sales in this competitive market and hands over a promising business,"" said Leandro Nonino, outgoing General Manager and Vice President Sales North America."
Puig relaunches Wikiparfum and opens office in Miami,"As far as fragrances are concerned, Puig is relaunching WikiParfum, its digital platform dedicated to discovering and deciphering perfume. Now available in seven languages and through a brand-new mobile app, WikiParfum (www.wikiparfum.com) gives users access to a vast online compendium of expert content, functionality and features developed by industry professionals. The digital platform enables everyone to browse, compare and choose fragrances from a constantly updated library which currently includes some 19,600 scents, compared to around 5,000 when it was launched initially in 2020. Above all, the platform offers several technological innovations to facilitate access to an olfactory world sometimes perceived as complex and distant by consumers. For instance, WikiParfum helps users discover what a perfume smells like, even before they try it in a store. When a user searches for a fragrance on the website or the app, a digital tool draws from a database containing 1,400 photographs of raw materials used in perfumery and organizes the images into a visual representation. According to Puig, this solution, or scent visualizer, allows the user to ""see"" the fragrance. The larger the image, the more dominant the ingredient. Displayed on a black background, the ingredient is intense; less so if the background is white. In addition to visual data, WikiParfum delivers key information, such as the perfume's olfactory family, its main ingredients, the perfumer who created it, and the price range. A selection of related fragrances with similar ingredients completes the search results. To develop the tool, Puig has collaborated with Fragrances of the World, the largest independent guide to fragrance classification, created by fragrance authority and historian Michael Edwards. WikiParfum also wants to be a true personal perfume shopper. Based on the olfactory mapping of the database and on an individual's stated preferences, the platform's powerful algorithm provides users with personalized fragrance recommendations. Made for in-store use, the WikiParfum mobile app (available on Google Play and the App Store) features a barcode reader called EAN.Nose. Simply by scanning a perfume's label at the point of sale, shoppers can ""see"" how the fragrance smells and learn key facts Completing the WikiParfum platform is AirParfum, the innovative airborne fragrance system patented and launched by Puig in 2018 for use at the point of sale. AirParfum addresses what was seemingly an intractable consumer pain point: the inability to sample multiple fragrances in-store without incurring olfactory saturation. AirParfum technology transforms purified air into perfumed air, enabling shoppers to experience scores of scents without confusion or sensory fatigue. At the same time, the group announced last week they will open a new office in Miami, Florida, in the U.S., as of January 2023. With this new regional hub, the family-owned beauty and fashion company aims ""to support strong growth in the Americas."" Puig sells products in 150 countries and operates 29 subsidiaries."
Europe: a new challenge for French retailer Oh My Cream!,"Premium Beauty News - After 21 openings in France, Oh My Cream! is now crossing national borders, and the first stopover is the United Kingdom! Why choose England to start expanding abroad? Juliette Levy - At Oh My Cream!, we are very pragmatic. We are still a small company with a reduced team and limited means, which is why we thought accessibility – geographic proximity to the headquarters – and the language spoken might be the right choice for a first test on the global level, without using too much of our resources. The United Kingdom is the third European beauty market, after France and Germany, so it looked like the obvious solution to our equation. London is two hours and twenty minutes away from Paris by Eurostar, and the whole team at Oh My Cream! speaks fluent English, contrary to other languages like Italian or German. Premium Beauty News - Why decide to open two stores in two months? Juliette Levy - We aim to replicate the strategy we implemented in France in London, and all across the UK. We had not really planned to open two stores almost at the same time. However, opening a second store quickly, and then a third, etc., is definitely part of our action plan to expand in the UK. I instantaneously fell in love with the places we now occupy. The first, in Notting Hill, is a niche address which reminds me of our first venues in Paris: we stand next to trendy French brands like Sézane, Maje and Diptyque. The second is in Chelsea, on King's Road. It is clearly the premium shopping destination par excellence. We definitely had to be there. These two places are complementary. And then, thinking about it, with my investors, of course, we concluded that by opening two stores almost at the same time, our message would be stronger and more impactful. To everyone's eyes, we are the Clean Beauty retailer who is ready to take London, not a small concept store landing here randomly. Premium Beauty News - You opened your doors over a month ago in Notting Hill, and a few days ago in Chelsea: have you had any feedback yet? Juliette Levy - Londoners had been waiting for us, in particular as regards skincare. They are delighted with the insightful expertise they get, and which our competitors do not necessarily offer, i.e. Space NK, Boots, or department stores. And we have another asset: treatments are already doing very well here. Londoners indulge in skincare treatments and aesthetic medicine much more frequently and easily than French women do. In addition, if they have a real taste for face treatments, in particular facials, not all of them actually give in: a standard session at a facialist's costs at least 300 pounds. Oh My Cream! treatments have bright days ahead, that is for sure! Our own brand, Oh My Cream Skincare, is really successful. Obviously, they are exclusive products there, so they appeal to a population eager for novelty. Plus, they are affordable, so the buying act is quite simple. Oh My Cream Skincare sun products are doing even better than expected. Londoners use sun products on a daily basis: they are an integral part of their daily routines. Almost one customer out of two asks us for a sun block when they step in our store! Premium Beauty News - After the United Kingdom, what country were you thinking about? Juliette Levy - The Oh My Cream!, Beauty Destination 2.0 concept could meet consumer expectations beyond European borders, but it is not our main objective right now. We aim to succeed in expanding in the UK, and then in Belgium, where we have started developing: we will open two stores in Brussels in the first semester 2023. Belgium is our first foreign market right now in terms of online sales. We know we can have our own place there, but at a smaller scale than in England, of course. In two years, we will most probably expand in another neighbouring country: why not Italy, which loves skincare, but it is too soon to tell."
Cottan Paris 1840 reinterprets the origins of cosmetics,"One day, as collector Gaël Bascoul was taking a deep plunge into the past, he came across old formulas handwritten by Jean-François Arsène Cottan, a chemist and cosmetologist who worked with Guerlain and Molinard, in the middle of the 19th century. Gaël Bascoul had already founded the brand Monsieur Barbier, so he immediately saw an obvious opportunity to awaken a precious, much contemporary intellectual heritage. Helped by Jean-Claude Le Joliff, the President of La Cosmétothèque, a website designed to preserve and retain cosmetics sciences, techniques and know-how, he works on reinterpreting formulas based on the foundations imagined by the renowned chemist. ""We restore a heritage which corresponds to today's trends. Clean Beauty is hailed as a new phenomenon, but it was actually the basis of cosmetics in the 19th century. Mr. Cottan also promised his products were compatible with delicate skins, as they moisturized them and did not make them dry out. From the first findings, and every time we discovered a product, we could not but be captivated by the modernity of his work and acknowledge, with much humility, that what we had was a bit of our history which had unfairly fallen into oblivion"", says Gaël Bascoul. The development of the range revives one of the main principles of the Cottan routine, i.e. cleansing, exfoliating, and moisturizing: hygiene fundamentals as a skincare base. ""One of the aspects which caught our attention was that the simplicity of the approach could not but make us think of others which, much later, were based on the same three key gestures: cleanse, tone up, and hydrate"", adds Jean-Claude Le Joliff. As a consequence, the formulation laboratory follows this guiding principle: few products – three, so far – with simple formulas based on the concepts of the past and carefully selected safe ingredients. The range is composed of a cleansing soap based on plants, an exfoliating micellar vinegar with fruit acids, and a moisturizing vanishing face cream. ""Vinegars were widely used in cosmetics for hygiene and skin-balancing purposes. They are excellent postbiotics. Acids support the tissue regeneration process called epidermal renewal"", explains the formulator. The vanishing cream, as opposed to the cold cream, offers the softness of a light, non-oily texture. ""This revived formulation skeleton results in galenic forms that had been forgotten"", says Ganaël Bascoul. The brand reinterprets and modernizes original formulas. This mosaic of the past also inspired an identity, with Art Deco visual codes and packaging based on vintage materials. The beauty vinegar bottle is made of glass, a refill project is under study, and the face cream is packed in an aluminium tube which reminds of ointments, and fitted with an octagonal cap made from recycled plastic. Since they were launched in 2021, the Cottan Paris 1840 products have seduced not only French consumers on the brand's e-shop and at the Printemps department store, but also foreign markets: the brand is settling in Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. To the founder, it just shows the interest in French heritage and innovation, and it conveys the idea of a ""niche cosmetics segment based on different principles"" which, just like on the perfumes market, puts an emphasis on heritage brands. In Europe, they are available for about 20 to 40 euros, which remains affordable for a high-end design. To keep restoring this beautiful past, Ganaël Bascoul aims to update the rest of his precious catalogue. The next projects will involve a cleansing powder based on peony root to be rehydrated. ""Powder products were much common at that time"", explains the founder. There will also be a plant-powered oil for healthy skin, a blend of floral waters… A ""new Art of the Formulation"" inspired from the past is under way."
"How LanzaTech turns greenhouse gases into ethanol, bottles and dresses","That ethanol is then used as a chemical building block for consumer items such as plastic bottles, athletic wear and even dresses, via tie-ins with major brands such as Zara and L'Oréal. ""I wouldn't have thought that 14 years later, we would have a cocktail dress on the market that's made out of steel emissions,"" said microbiologist Michael Kopke, who joined LanzaTech a year after its founding. LanzaTech is among 15 finalists for the Earthshot Prize, an award for contributions to environmentalism launched by Britain's Prince William and broadcaster David Attenborough. Five winners will be announced Friday. To date, the company says it has kept 200,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, while producing 50 million gallons (190 million liters) of ethanol. That's a small drop in the bucket when it comes to the actual quantities needed to combat climate change, Kopke concedes. But having spent 15 years developing the methodology and proving its large-scale feasibility, the company is now seeking to ramp up its ambition and multiply the number of participating factories. ""We really want to get to a point where we only use above ground carbon, and keep that in circulation,"" says Kopke — in other words, avoid extracting new oil and gas. LanzaTech, which employs about 200 people, compares its carbon recycling technology to a brewery — but instead of taking sugar and yeast to make beer, it uses carbon pollution and bacteria to make ethanol. The bacteria used in their process was identified decades ago in rabbit droppings. The company placed it in industrial conditions to optimize it in those settings, ""almost like an athlete that we trained,"" said Kopke. Bacteria are sent out in the form of a freeze-dried powder to corporate clients in China, which have giant versions of the vats back in Chicago, several meters high. The corporate clients that built these facilities will then reap the rewards of the sale of ethanol — as well as the positive PR from offsetting pollution from their main businesses. The clients in China are a steel plant and two ferroalloy plants. Six other sites are under construction, including one in Belgium for an ArcelorMittal plant, and in India with the Indian Oil Company. Because the bacteria can ingest CO2, carbon monoxide and hydrogen, the process is extremely flexible, explains Zara Summers, LanzaTech's vice president of science. ""We can take garbage, we can take biomass, we can take off gas from an industrial plant,"" said Summers, who spent ten years working for ExxonMobil. Products already on the shelves include homecare products sold on the shelves of the Migros supermarket chain, in Switzerland, as well as a line of dresses at Zara. Sold at around $90, they are made of polyester, 20 percent of which comes from captured gas. Once purified, to remove any residual odor, this ethanol is also used to manufacture Coty group perfumes. The creation of perfumery ingredients is even being considered with Givaudan. ""In the future, I think the vision is there is no such thing as waste, because carbon can be reused again,"" said Summers. LanzaTech has also founded a separate company, LanzaJet, to use the ethanol to create ""sustainable aviation fuel"" or SAF. Increasing global SAF production is a huge challenge for the fuel-heavy aviation sector, which is seeking to green itself. LanzaJet is aiming to achieve one billion gallons of SAF production in the United States per year by 2030. Unlike bioethanol produced from wheat, beets or corn, fuel created from industrial greenhouse gas emissions doesn't require the use of agricultural land. For LanzaTech, the next challenge is to commercialize bacteria that will produce chemicals other than ethanol. In particular, they have their sights set on directly producing ethylene, ""one of the most widely used chemicals in the world,"" per Kopke — thus saving energy associated with having to first convert ethanol into ethylene."
Ingestible skincare: Increasingly demanding consumers,"As a manufacturer of high-performing liquid collagen products for the beauty, health, and wellness sector, Tosla Nutricosmetics has been eager to adapt the 'clean beauty' concept to the ingestible category. For example, all their formulas are therefore sugar, GMO, gluten, and lactose-free. So, like what happened in the topical skin care industry, Tosla Nutricosmetics thinks that: ""As consumers learn more about ingestible collagen products, they will become stricter and more selective in their choices. This will drive companies and brands to more innovative and sophisticated products, that will also deliver on the key consumer needs in beauty (aging, hydration, protection from oxidative stress, pigmentation, etc.)."" Moreover, just as texture and fragrance are key factors of success for topical cosmetics, taste is a key issue for ingestible cosmetics. ""And our liquids offer a far better experience than powders, gummies, or tablets, whether in terms of taste, smell and texture,"" claims Primož Artač, COO & Founder of Tosla Nutricosmetics. To meet these new expectations, Tosla relies on quality and their capacity for innovation. Their VELIOUS™ Masking Technology, for instance, helps them to address taste - the most important differentiation factor in the liquid collagen category - without adding sugar to their formulas. In order to provide efficient formulations that target skin texture, density and hydration, Tosla Nutricosmetics can rely on their EU-based manufacture [1] and in-house R&D & Production Design to enhance the efficiency of their products and all aspects of the user experience. Furthermore, Tosla Nutricosmetics has performed clinical tests of their three best-selling formulations, thus substantiating claims related to reduced wrinkles and smoother skin and guaranteeing brands and their consumers the high-performance of their products. ""We spotted the market shift towards beauty from within, and we have high-quality standards. Industry-leading companies recognise our mission, and we successful teamed up with many, and the best is yet to come,"" concludes Tosla."
C'leene toothpaste combines healthy formulas with fluorine,"Céline Benaroch, PhD in Pharmacy, pays close attention to the composition of toothpaste, a personal hygiene essential. Two years ago, she chose to work with a dental health professional to create a formula which met her expectations: toothpaste free from controversial ingredients, but powered by fluorine. ""Toothpaste is a product which can be partly ingested. And we use it our whole lives as early as childhood: it is our first hygiene cosmetic product. Most of the products available on the market contain the right quantity of fluorine, but two out of three also contain titanium dioxide, a component suspected of being carcinogenic. In France, it is banned in foodstuffs. In parallel, clean beauty brands choose to ban fluorine which, to me, is nonsense"", she explains. Although it is generally not used in clean formulas due to the potential risk of fluorosis, an enamel disorder observed in children which results from overdosage, fluorine is essential to good dental health, according to the entrepreneur. ""Dentists report a surge of tooth decay in children, following the use of toothpaste free from fluorine. And yet, fluorosis only affects 2% of children. What is important is to watch children brush their teeth, until they turn 6 or 7, and check they use a very small quantity of toothpaste, so they do not ingest too much product"", says Céline Benaroch. The C'leene formulas comply with very strict specifications. The fluorine concentration is 1,000 ppm in the toothpaste for children from 0 to 6, and 1,450 ppm in the adult version, in accordance with the levels recommended by health authorities. ""Our products are organic-certified by Ecocert and made in France. But the other criteria are taste, freshness, texture, and foam. We have worked a lot on that"", she adds. Not only the C'leene toothpaste revisits standard formulas, but it is also innovative in terms of packaging. Each version comes in a refillable pump bottle based on biodegradable bioplastic, except for the pump, for which Céline Benaroch has not found any alternative. The refills are packed in pouches made of paper derived from apple waste. ""The pump bottle is very convenient, because it contributes to children's autonomy. There is no cap, it does not break, and it delivers the quantity needed"", says Céline Benaroch. After an Ulule fundraising campaign launched last June, the C'leene range is now in the production phase. Starting from January, it will be available on the brand's website for EUR 10.90 per bottle, and EUR 7.90 per 100-ml refill. Then, it should be distributed in pharmacies and specialized stores. ""The campaign on social media had a huge impact. We received a lot of messages from dental surgeons who will not recommend fluorine-free toothpaste. They were looking for a formula like ours, with a healthy composition, and fluorine"", concludes Céline Benaroch."
Orijinal launches a solution for endless reuse of nail polish bottles,"Born in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, Orijinal stands out for its natural care varnishes containing a patented active ingredient based on French celery and an organic pomegranate extract. Aware of the environmental impact of nail varnishes, Cheryl Gava, the brand founder, has imagined a solution allowing the glass bottles of her nail polishes to be reused over and over again, when they are returned by consumers. Each time a new product is received, consumers can return a bottle when it is empty. The concept is quite simple. All consumers have to do is order a first nail polish on the brand's e-shop, then use it until they run out - a detail that is important. Indeed, Orijinal specifies it only recovers ""used bottles"", which actually means ""empty bottles"". From the second order, consumers can indicate that they wish to return their old bottle, which will allow them to receive the new product together with a postage-paid label to return the empty primary container. To make reuse possible, the brand has invested in a cleaning process derived from the food industry, which allows the bottles to be cleaned in just 16 minutes using a procedure that is ""as eco-responsible as possible"", specifies Orijinal. However, the solution only works if consumers really reduce waste, that is to say if they (really) use their nail varnish to the last drop. A practice that still seems uncommon in real life. Therefore, in order to motivate as many people as possible to change their habits, the brand is offering a voucher for each five bottles returned. But that's not all! The wooden cap can be separated from the plastic applicator brush to be reused too. If it is damaged, the consumer can ask to receive a new one for the same price. Nail polishes pose specific problems at the end of their life. The French Agency for Ecological Transition (ADEME) recommends ""throwing the glass bottle in the bin or container intended for recyclable glass packaging,"" which will generally allow it to be recycled, and ""throwing the brush and its cap in the household waste bin."" Orijinal therefore offers an alternative to the thermal recycling of glass, which is energy-intensive but remains common in France. On the other hand, if the bottle is not empty, ADEME recommends to dispose it in a recycling centre that accepts this specific type of product."
Mustela kicks into gear in Brazil with new developments and a local production,"""We have noticed that many parents who buy products for their children also use them for themselves,"" says Marilla Mesquita, marketing and CSR manager at Mustela in Brazil. The brand therefore began by extending efficacy studies of certain existing lines, such as sun protection, before developing products specifically intended for family use. In 2021, Mustela launched its organic BIO line in Brazil, before launching its new multifunctional organic balm, which draws on the benefits of avocado to restore and hydrate the skin of all family members, whatever their age. For Mustela, this new positioning is much more than a means of winning over new consumers, it is also part of a responsible approach to avoid multiplying purchases of products that would only fit for some members of the family. ""Consumers are increasingly looking for natural or organic and vegan products. But we have also seen a strong demand for simplicity, through multifunctional products that serve different family members,"" Marilla Mesquita points out. The brand therefore plans to expand its offering of family products over the years. ""We are going to launch a solid shampoo for the body and hair, which will be part of our BIO range, both offering a vegan, organic and biodegradable formula enriched with avocado and olive oils for the whole family,"" says the marketing manager. In 2023, Mustela will celebrate the tenth anniversary of its entry on the Brazilian market. The brand now intends to gain in efficiency by producing locally some of its iconic items. In addition, the brand plans to start developing new products in Brazil as early as 2024, in order to better meet the specific needs of national consumers. ""This strategy is fully aligned with our commitments to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030, as well as to positively impact communities and co-create 100% of our new products with families, ensuring that future generations grow up healthy and on a healthy planet,"" continues Marilla Mesquita. Sold in almost 10,000 points of sale in Brazil, mainly in the pharmaceutical retail channel and in e-commerce, Mustela has doubled its turnover in the country every three years. ""We are already the brand's sixth biggest subsidiary and we still have great potential for growth. Brazil is therefore one of the Mustela's priority markets,"" concludes the manager."
Capsum partners with Orius to create a vertical farm at its Texas facility,"Capsum continues to invest in the indoor production of botanical ingredients. The integration of plant-based ingredient production capabilities into Capsum's manufacturing plant in Texas will enable the company to control the entire production chain and to fulfil its vision of Seed-to-Face cosmetics creation. A specialist of microfluidics, the company is completing its offer with natural, responsible and efficient active ingredients to serve American beauty brands with additional sustainable and innovative benefits to include in their cosmetics. Capsum's innovative bio-production facility is planned to be autonomous in water and energy, powered by 2 acres of solar panels installed on the roof. It will start with production of sunflower microgreens and rapidly expand to other active ingredients from natural origin, including flower and root extracts. The technology that implemented at the Texas facility combines indoor farming and precision farming. Traditionally associated with greens and vegetables production, indoor farming is a technique to grow plants on vertically stacked racks, typically in a soil-less, closed-loop hydroponics setup which optimizes space and resources and doesn't require the use of pesticides. While precision farming is a scientific approach to cultivation that aims at steering plant development through precise control of the environmental and biotic parameters, and can be leveraged to boost the chemical composition of the plants in molecules of interest. Precision Indoor Farming brings together the two cultivation techniques for the production of plants boosted in active molecules of interest while minimizing environmental impact. The technique offers several benefits, including: the production of more active molecules, the reduction of water and energy consumption, a low carbon footprint, and a secured supply. As an example, flowers produce phenolic compounds at sunrise that can be boosted in quantity by prolonging the specific environmental conditions - typically temperature and quantity of light - that signal dawn to the plant. First trials indicate a threefold increase in total polyphenols contents produced by the plant compared to traditional growth conditions. In order to boost the development of this technology, Capsum has acquired a minority stake in the start-up, which was established in Toulouse, France, in 2021. The two companies think that using precision indoor farming offers a solution to the constraints related to the creation of new ingredients develop active ingredients in beauty by: combining naturality and performance, contributing to Clean beauty, offering large sustainability assets, bringing better transparency and securing the supply chain, contributing to brand uniqueness. ""Capsum chose Orius to setup its Precision Indoor Farm in Austin, TX, because of their credentials and skills in high-tech farming. While developing the project, both teams had such a great experience in sharing knowledge and ambition that they decided to partner to transform the Beauty Industry using Precision Indoor Farming,"" says Sébastien Bardon, Capsum CEO. As pharmaceutical and nutraceutical sectors are evolving following similar trends and constraints, Capsum deems that Orius perspectives are promising beyond beauty."

Why should you create immersive experiences in communication?,"An immersive brand experience proposes an enriched environment that encourages the audience to use its senses, to feel involved and to interact. Immersion takes various forms in brand communication strategy and adapting content creation – physical spaces transformed to invite the audience into the brand universe, augmented reality and spaces using virtual reality or 3D, holograms, light projections, gaming spaces, customization possibilities… The new brand content wants to be engaging, different and emotional. The agency WANDS Paris develops innovative approaches and sources the best technologies for their deployment. The end of year period represents a key moment for brands that need to stand out. The brand L'Occitane en Provence has solicited the agency WANDS to think of a concept and immersive digital experience for all their markets worldwide around their star product for this period – the advent calendar. This example highlights the reasons why immersion is of paramount importance to reach marketing objectives. Immersion and its uses in a multi-channel structure provide an amplification and resolution of brand objectives: memorization by the audience, whose cognitive aspects are activated; engagement which is provoked by the emotional aspect of the experience; growing notoriety of the brand offering an experience to share; and differentiation, by a unique communication line. A study outlines that 61% of consumers would be more likely to buy from brands who use immersive technology, such as augmented or virtual reality and 3D content. Hence, for L'Occitane, several specific objectives were defined before starting the project to develop special features: the accessibility of the experience which needed to be user and mobile friendly; conversion by encouraging gifting and advent calendar sales; a boost of traffic and engagement; and finally, the ability to collect data and KPIs. The concept that was developed corresponds to these objectives while bringing surprise and playfulness. The approach by the agency WANDS began by an exploration of the brand universe – that of L'Occitane of Provence is rich, authentic, colorful, engaged. From a study of the brand values and the theme of the year – crafters of nature – as well as a reinterpretation of the illustrative and chromatic range of the universe, a global concept has emerged. The ambition was to indulge the audience in the enchanted world of the brand through three digital activations that fit into the e-commerce website. WANDS has worked on the artistic direction, the design, and the development of an immersive landing page with the main objective of converting. The aim was not only to highlight the advent calendars in an immersive page design and to propose a direct ""Add to cart"", but to explain the characteristics and differences of each calendar, and their unique selling propositions. The customer journey has been optimized to define the shortest way to the cart. Finally, a widget invites the audience to discover other products. The animation is integrated within the e-commerce website through an HTML code or iFrame, offering an enchanted parenthesis. The second animation brings to light a virtual advent calendar that aims to drive traffic, conversion and engagement in more than 26 countries. The agency has imagined a 3D setting with a Christmas tree formed by cubes, turning on a pedestal and using visual elements from the holiday campaign. Every day, one box opens itself upon a click, to reveal an offer, keeping the suspense of the discovery for the audience. A form allows data collect and the reception of the offers by email. Just like the first animation, this experience is customizable by each country, in terms of images, texts, links and email template. A communication plan accompanies the animation to explain the concept of the virtual advent calendar. Finally, the third animation is more experimental and implies the audience participation with a Gift Finder – through questions and answers to find the ideal gift. The originality resides in the design of the experience, based upon the artistic direction of the global experience and an animated 3D box at each step. After answering the questions, the box opens itself in an explosion of ribbons, provoking surprise, before revealing suggested gifts. The stakes for the brand were multiple: the importance of being immerged into the brand universe, the storytelling, the adaptation with the e-commerce website of each market, adapted UI and UX, the presentation of the USP (unique selling proposition), and the specificities of each market. Artistic design, 3D content creation, simple consumer journey, brand immersion, technical development… To these criteria, the brand added an essential one: the international dimension of the project to guarantee the holistic dimension of the brand and to allow the local adaptation by several countries. Indeed, each experience is customizable by the markets who can change the text and thus, the language (including Arabic or Mandarin for instance), the visual assets, the links and template. Customization is offered to the users through a personalized back office. Furthermore, the users can be managed by an administrator who can handle different access levels. The data from the audience can be downloaded safely by each market. For an optimal operation, the integration of Google Analytics in the back office allows for the a follow-up and tracking of the animations, to obtain the relevant KPIs – number of clicks, length of sessions, bounce rate… Technology is as the service of an immersive and innovative approach, and invites the user to wonder within the brand universe. WANDS Paris tells stories and brings to light in a strategic and innovative way brands that are sensitive to excellence, luxury and premium."
"""Luxury hotels contribute to Sothys' growth"", Christian Mas","Premium Beauty News - Is Sothys' story rooted in French cosmetics? Christian Mas - At the beginning, in 1946, Sothys was a Parisian beauty salon. It was purchased by my family in 1966. The salon stood out because they made their own formulas. So, the brand got part of what I call the new wave of French beauty, with the Carita sisters, Nadia Payot, and all this flourishing, pioneering generation of cosmetologists and craftspeople. My father, Bernard Mas, soon made the brand operational to sell his formulas in France and beyond. We went from a craft business to an SME. In the 1970s, industrialization naturally became a possibility: my father chose to go back to Corrèze, where he built the brand's plant, because our family roots were there. And this choice became a real strength. Premium Beauty News - How did the brand grow on the global level? Christian Mas - My uncle developed sales in France and my father mainly focused on our growth on the global scale, always through the professional network – they stuck to their first choice. We have very strong stories for our export distribution networks, in particular in the US. In the 1980s, we set up a second local production plant in Miami, Florida, which is now celebrating its 40th anniversary, and then a platform for Asia based in Singapore. Today, we are well-established in about 60 countries and distributed in 90 countries, with a strong presence on both all European markets and our two main subsidiaries' markets, the US and Singapore. One subsidiary represents 5 to 60 people, one logistics centre, one sales team, local trainers to explain how to use our methods and products, and a marketing hub. Premium Beauty News - What is Sothys today? Christian Mas - My brother and I took over more than ten years ago. We kept growing in the beauty salon industry, almost reaching the top position, with 15,000 addresses around the world. Sothys has no wholly-owned salon, except the one located 128, Rue Saint Honoré, the historical address that will reopen in January 2023, after some embellishments. The group achieves a consolidated turnover of more or less 50 million euros, 65% to 70% of which is achieved on the global level. We also successfully entered the high-end hotel sector: we are present in about a hundred four- or five-star hotels in France and in a few beautiful places around the world (Hanoi, Osaka, Bora Bora, Marrakech, Monaco…). Our development strategy is based on our customers' loyalty to our network. Without the service to appeal to customers, it is complicated. So, we remain in beauty salons and we aim to develop in the hotel sector through our subsidiaries abroad. Premium Beauty News - Sothys highlights values close to Nature. How is that conveyed in your formulas? Christian Mas - When we succeeded him, as a visionary, my father created a botanical garden in Corrèze, in my grandfather's village, Auriac. He put a lot of energy into it, and now this four-hectare botanical garden helps us study the biotope in its 150 hectares of protected forest. Our visitors can discover how Sothys interacts with its environment. We have green expertise and we work on our flagship actives with the garden. All this is done with local producers, saffron growers in the Lot region, or birch sap locally harvested for our organic range. Premium Beauty News - What makes the Sothys products stand out? Christian Mas - Our truth comes from salon treatments. Our laboratory counts about thirty scientists and an integrated salon. Everything is done in vivo, between researchers and field people, and product development takes place at the same time as the treatment phase. That is what makes the difference. About fifty new formulas are created every year for the brand, and they are sold or used in beauty salons. Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us about the next launches? Christian Mas - Next year, our organic face range will be completed with a body range. There will also be seasonal treatments and collaborations with French brands sharing the same values. Next January, we will also announce a major launch: a new range of Sothys hotel amenities. We will meet all hotel room needs with a ""plastic neutral"", refillable range. Everything is produced at our plant, and the products will be the same as in beauty salons. Premium Beauty News - To finish, how do you define the Sothys woman? Christian Mas - She is a 40/45-year-old woman who likes going to beauty salons. But with social media and our hotel presence, our average customer is getting younger. Consumers are aware of our values. In the hotel industry, we also have 30% to 40% of men coming for treatments, so we have reached a new customer category."
"Proya, one of China's strongest beauty brands in 2022","Initially specialized in skincare essentials, the brand based in Hangzhou, near Shanghai, took a strategic turn in 2019 when it launched the Black Sea Salt Bubble Mask, now a bestseller with monthly sales above a million units on the Tmall platform. Then, it was equally successful with the Ruby Lightening Serum and the Double Youth Essence. By limiting launches to two products per year, the brand highlights its sophisticated ingredients, like red algae extracts, peptides, and retinol. Proya believes that in the cosmetics industry, success will now depend on the power of research: they recently announced the opening of their own R&D centre. ""Proya catches the new consumer trend: it is very popular among the Chinese 'ingredients party' consumers, the ones who focus on formulations, as it has strong scientific ingredients and perfect product formulas. It also plays with the China pride, for example by taking part in the Harper's Bazaar campaign 'The brilliant Chinese ingredient'"", explains Juliette Duveau, co-founder of consulting agency The Chinese Pulse, specialized in modern China's trends, confirming that Proya has very strong R&D capability and an independent laboratory. To her, "" Proya is a pioneer in creating new skincare concepts : because VC and VA are irritating for sensitive skin, overseas brands have not made them the focus of their efforts. However, Proya has become the pioneer of the concept of 'anti-oxidation + anti-sugar at the same time' and is the leader of 'morning VC night VA skincare' concept,"" explains Juliette Duveau. Likewise, as far as marketing is concerned, ""Proya catches new marketing trends quickly: it is one of the earliest beauty brands that started to be active on social media e-commerce => start live-commerce, and expand on the new emerging Chinese social platforms: RED, Douyin, Tmall, JD.COM, VIP.COM, etc."" In addition, its communication campaigns stand out, while emotionally resonating in young people and women. Without ever putting a product forward, they convey committed messages, like the viral video broadcast during the 2021 Woman's Day, which pointed at sexist stereotypes. The campaign slogan, ""genre is not a limit, prejudices are"" (#性别不是边界线 偏见才是#), was seen more than 300 million times on Weibo. Empathy seems to be the common theme of these ad campaigns that screen the Chinese society. After the summer 2022, the brand launched an awareness campaign against school harassment in collaboration with China Education Television. Not long before that, for the romantic celebration called Qixi, Proya chose to support the many Chinese single people who have to cope with family and society pressure to find a partner. With the slogan ""dare to love, dare not to love"" (#敢爱也敢不爱#), the brand clearly differentiated itself from other brands' many set launches. ""The reason for this success is a combination of 3 axes: product + marketing + communication,"" says Juliette Duveau. The brand, which has been listed on the Shanghai stock exchange since 2017, increased its turnover by 36.9% in the first semester 2022, reaching 2.6 billion RMB (372 million euros): it is one of the most profitable brands in the industry, according to Chinese news website 36Kr. The website specialized in finance highlights that this performance is all the more remarkable that ""the Chinese cosmetics market is under pressure, shaken by the control of the Covid pandemic and the fact that logistics were put on hold in certain areas"". According to 36Kr, Proya's resistance is due to a high proportion of its sales being achieved online, mainly through Tmall, Douyin (TikTok), and Jd.com. From 2018 to 2021, Proya's online share rose from 43.6% to 85.4%. In terms of positioning, ""Proya is a mid-range brand (200-400 RMB) and remains affordable for most students and young graduates, especially during shopping festivals and in live-commerce,"" explains Juliette Duveau. Its success is due to highly efficient products combined with reasonable prices – a winning strategy on a Chinese high-end market still dominated by Western brands."

"""Blissim focuses on pleasure rather than price,"" Quentin Reygrobellet","Premium Beauty News - E-commerce has experienced a real explosion during the health crisis and the closure of physical stores. Where do you stand today? Quentin Reygrobellet - After the strong growth of the 2020-2021 period, we are consolidating our gains by building loyalty among our members. With a turnover of 50 million euros, we have maintained double-digit profitability, which is quite remarkable in e-commerce. Our growth has slowed down, of course, but at a time when e-commerce is experiencing difficulties, we are lucky to have a differentiating model. Even if the accessibility of our boxes or our advent calendar contributes greatly to their success, we count on other elements than price: quality and personalization of the service, diversity of the offer, advice, discovery, pleasure and fun. Our mission is to surprise and delight the consumer. This is why today 200,000 women in France are keen to pay 16.90 euros each month without knowing exactly what they are going to receive in return. It is this constantly renewed pleasure that allows us to build customer loyalty and make them want to browse through our online platform. Premium Beauty News - You are also diversifying your offer, with the opening of a wellness area and limited edition boxes or collaborations. Quentin Reygrobellet - Diversification is a major pillar of our growth strategy. In the retailing sector, innovation is very much a matter of selecting brands and we are fortunate to be in a period where many new offers are emerging. We have done a lot of innovation in our formats, with themed boxes and limited editions (lingerie, post-partum, etc.), an advent calendar at an unbeatable price, and partnerships with brands and designers from other sectors. By expanding our offer to the wellness sector, we have remained true to our philosophy of discovery, with a large number of entries - CBD, intimate pleasure, mothers-to-be - with a didactic approach, lots of advice and specific brands. These corners dedicated to discovery are an important element for recruiting new customers. We help them discover new products and new brands, at reasonable prices, by being ""niche"" without being unaffordable. Premium Beauty News - Was it the same logic that led you to open a creative studio to launch your own brands? Quentin Reygrobellet - Beauty Story, our creative studio, is a fully-fledged start-up within Blissim, with a dedicated team. The idea was to leverage the knowledge we have of our customers' expectations, thanks to the data we have, to meet their wants even better. Even if we don't deny ourselves anything, the idea was not to create a retail brand, but to serve market segments that were not sufficiently taken into account. The Imparfaite brand thus celebrates the uniqueness and originality of all women. It is also available at Monoprix and Nocibé. In the make-up sector, Yolaine has several successful products, notably Mousse de Rouge, which is a hit in the United States and Japan. We are going to launch a mascara and a liner based on the data collected via a direct link between our data warehouse and our market analysis tool. Premium Beauty News - You announced the launch of your German business last March: what is your first assessment of this experience? Quentin Reygrobellet - Our entry into the German market is still very recent. It's a bit too early to say how we are doing. We are quite happy with our debut in this mature market where competition in the box market is not strong but where there are already well-established e-commerce players. We are going to create ephemeral pop-up stores in four cities (Cologne, Hamburg, Düsseldorf, and Karlsruhe) in partnership with Pick & Kopenburg, a department store that does not have a beauty department and has chosen us as a partner in this sector. In Germany as in France, we rely on the pillars of Blissim's success: we are the only player in Europe allowing people to discover beauty, trigger surprise, and guidance, with personalised offers based on a thorough knowledge of our customers. Premium Beauty News - What are the next steps? Quentin Reygrobellet - We are going to open our e-commerce site in Germany in 2023, relying on a logistic organization specially designed to be able to rapidly scale up and facilitate our entry into the other countries we are interested in: Italy, Spain, and Scandinavia... Our first steps in Germany are encouraging us to speed up our expansion. We noticed that several brands with which we have been working for some time, but which are not yet present in this country, are eagerly awaited. Our ambition is to carry on as we have always done: to grow by continuing to bring added value to our customers, while remaining profitable and in control of our destiny."
Cosnova's accessible price strategy is attracting more and more people,"Premium Beauty News - How do you explain the success of the Catrice and Essence brands, particularly in a market as difficult as France? Soazig Le Prince - In the current hyper inflationary context, consumers are making budget decisions that impact the way they buy and select products. Catrice and Essence are the main beneficiaries, because today no other brand is able to offer such a premium quality for less than five euros. As far as retailers are concerned, the two brands generate traffic and loyalty: this is what explains our remarkable performance and our tremendous growth in France and around the world. The entry of Catrice and Essence on the online boutique of French beauty retailer Nocibe for a year now has been a real boost in sales but also in visibility. Very good progress is underway month after month and the end of the year promises to be excellent, thanks in to our Disney make-up collections for Halloween, closely followed by our special Christmas references (palettes, boxes, etc.) that are pretty gifts at low prices. When you're a foreign brand, it's difficult to enter the French market, in particular with the very strong presence of L'Oréal in all the distribution networks and in particular ours, the mass distribution, but our strategy has enabled us to fit in this difficult marketplace. There is no magic in what we do. Our common thread is to manufacture make-up at unbeatable prices without compromising on quality. To do this, we rely on the synergy between our two make-up brands and our volumes. This economic model allows us to meet the expectations of the greatest number. Premium Beauty News - Each year, 50% of the range of each of the two brands is renewed. An impressive figure! Soazig Le Prince - Indeed, it is one of the strengths of the group. The Cosnova teams are developing new products very quickly for the two brands to reflect latest trends and consumer expectations in real time. This allows us to be highly competitive, but also to continually develop our new formulas so that they are as clean as possible without compromising on product performance. We have developed a non-exhaustive list of controversial substances that are banned from our products. In 2019, the Cosnova group also created its own in-house incubator dedicated to fostering beauty innovations. Currently, the teams are working on two projects simultaneously: Inao by Essence and La Manufacture. The incubator aims to imagine new categories of products that are tested under the name of an already existing brand, as is the case with Ino, a line of food supplements tested on the market German under the Essence brand. However, it can also develop its own brands, such as La Manufacture. It is a B to C project that combines customization and do it yourself makeup focusing on the complexion and marketed through a dedicated website: www.la-manufacture.shop. Premium Beauty News - The Catrice and Essence brands are both listed PETA International and Essence has been 100% vegan for a year. Soazig Le Prince - Since the creation of the group, its founder Christina Oster-Daum has been uncompromising on this point: no ingredients tested on animals will be used in the formulations. We made this choice even before the definitive ban on these tests in the European Union. To go even further in this cruelty free policy, Essence became 100% vegan a year ago and Catrice will also be completely vegan in February 2023. The Cosnova group has also created its own Clean Beauty seal, which prohibits controversial ingredients - such as PEGs, parabens and volatile silicones... - and ingredients of animal origin and which promotes simplified formulas. Finally, Cosnova has set itself the goal of using 30% less packaging by 2025, making 75% recyclable and using 50% recycled materials in its production. Result: 300 tons of virgin plastic were saved in 2021 compared to the previous year."
Cosmecode provides ideal foundation shade in one click,"Initially, the entrepreneur aimed to provide brands and distributors with an online and offline personalized advice solution thanks to digital technologies. ""Personalized advice is the most powerful conversion tool in the beauty industry,"" she says. ""When a client gets the help of a Beauty Advisor in a store, it is very likely that she will leave with the product suggested. So, the idea was to develop a digital version of this."" The tool's main feature is the help it provides when it comes to choosing the right foundation shade. ""We extensively tested consumers' reactions to digital advice and identified a great opportunity. It is a real challenge with all the existing skin tones. It is almost impossible to do online, and it is tricky in stores, where the bright environment should be taken into account"", she explains. With Cosmecode, the right shade recommendation is made by an algorithm. The process is quick and easy-to-use. The user takes a picture of herself, then the application shows the corresponding shade in the different brand ranges referenced in the database. Right now, the mobile app contains 6,500 foundation shades taken from the ranges the most widely available on the market (Chanel, BlackUp, Guerlain, etc.). ""In the long run, we aim to reference all the products available on the market, with permanent updates. But our solution can also perfectly adapt to a brand and its references"", says Mellouki. Showcased at the last VivaTech show, the Cosmecode prototype boasted a reliability score of 94%, according to the test performed on a selection of three ranges. According to Mellouki, the process is based on the Computer Vision and Deep Learning technologies, but also on huge referencing work. ""This tool is very hard to develop, but it has a tremendous potential. We have started with foundation, but we can also switch to other product categories later, like colours complementary to the complexion, for example, with lipsticks and hair colour"", she adds. Supported by a team of five developers, the company Director highlights her tool's power as part of a B2B approach. Beyond the general public, she targets both distributors and brands with personalized interfaces adapted to any communication world. ""In stores, brands can reference their products on the platform, which will be used as an advisory tool. This way, they can boost their conversion rates, but also provide advice of harmonized quality, a key element for them. Also, we are developing an online version with a plug-in to be integrated to e-commerce websites, so users can get their own shade recommendation before placing an order"", explains Mellouki. Last, but not least, the Cosmecode solution can very easily go global."
Armani Beauty partners with Fortnite to bring fragrances in the metaverse,"A field of all possibilities, the metaverse now allows people to buy virtual fashion and accessories, to see exhibitions or to attend concerts. But these new worlds at the frontier of reality are above all favored by brands seeking to gain visibility among their prime target, Generation Z, which masters these worlds like no other — even if only a minority have actually set foot in them. As a result, some brands have decided to go big, pulling out all the stops to stage initiatives in places where consumers are actually present — i.e., in the world of gaming, a form of metaverse that is enjoyed by billions of people around the world. Armani Beauty has now partnered with one of the most popular games, ""Fortnite,"" to promote its new men's fragrance, Code. Evidently, it's not a question of testing the new fragrance online, which is impossible for now. Here, it's about encouraging users to take part in an immersive experience called ""Rewrite the Code"" as a means of discovering the scent — in turn making as many people as possible want to try it — and buy it. In fact, it is above all a fairly classic online game, which put the recent launch at centre stage. ""In a world where time flows backwards, players race through maze-like speed runs to collect the numbers needed to unlock the Armani Code building and the Armani Code Parfum bottle, in order to harness its magnetic power to put the world forwards again,"" explains the brand on its Instagram account. Through this game, players have the opportunity to get acquainted with the bottle, the ingredients, and especially the scent's wider universe. Creating their own world, or a themed space in the metaverse allows brands to present their new products, while also building customer loyalty, and even creating a community. Brands like Balenciaga, Gucci, Hermès and Dior — among others — have understood this perfectly, and have all jumped into the world of gaming and, even more broadly, into these new virtual worlds. Indeed, these brands already have strong communities, and the metaverse can offer them many new possibilities."
Aroma-Zone opens a new store in Paris and prepares to grow abroad,"The French brand, which specializes in aromatherapy, natural and do it yourself beauty, has opened a 180 m2 store at the Forum des Halles in Paris, France. On this occasion, Aroma-Zone is launching a new concept, designed to facilitate the customer's journey and the discovery of the brand's three main families: Beauty, Health & Well-Being and Home. This is the tenth boutique of the brand in France (after Lyon, Montpellier, Toulouse, Marseille, Aix-en-Provence, Lille, et Strasbourg), and the third in Paris, after those of the Odéon district and Boulevard Haussmann ""We were looking for a location that would be easily accessible from the entire Paris region, because our customers sometimes come from very far away to find our products,"" explains Sabrina Herlory, CEO of Aroma-Zone, to Premium Beauty News. With more than 2,300 references of natural products, the shop gives access to the Aroma-Zone team of natural beauty advisers, to freely accessible digital tablets that enable consumers to consult the brand's recipes for making their own cosmetics, QR codes placed on all the products and giving access to their details on the Aroma-Zone website, as well as two bulk bars — a liquid soap bar and a vegetable oil bar. The opening of this new Parisian location comes with the launch of several new products: a CBD oil titrated at 12% and the brand's first food supplements in the form of eight 100% natural and organic superfoods powders (alfalfa, baobab, chlorella, turmeric, ginkgo biloba, Brazilian ginseng, guarana, matcha) and Curcumin and Spirulina tablets. While they currently only operates in France, Aroma-Zone is resolutely preparing its internationalization and will open a new store on October 20 in Brussels, Belgium. ""There is a strong international demand for our natural, simple and affordable products. Although it is only written in French, 15% of orders on our online store already come from abroad"", emphasises Sabrina Herlory. This first foray outside France will be followed by an opening in Italy. Switzerland and Spain are expected to follow in 2023."
"""Cosmetic 360 offers a unique vision of cosmetics"", Frankie Béchereau","Premium Beauty News - What do you expect of this eighth edition? Frankie Béchereau - Once again, we will offer a unique vision of the future of the cosmetics industry. Cosmetic 360 is definitely a show like no other: it is neither a packaging show nor an ingredient show. It is not a ""trade show"", but a ""vision event"". It is a place where you can meet people and companies you don't see anywhere else. This year, logistics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be in the spotlight: if these fields are not specific to cosmetics, they are key aspects of our sector. Cosmetic 360 is the place par excellence for cross-fertilisation: many of these start-ups, SMEs, and French and global laboratories only attend this show. After two years of pandemic, the event is extremely promising, as it will host 200 exhibitors. Compared to the 220 participants in 2019, a few Asian companies are missing, in particular Chinese and Japanese ones. But the show will still count 20% of global exhibitors from other European countries, plus from the US and a few Asian countries. In line with our mission, there will be raw material suppliers, testing companies, packaging and service suppliers (logistics, IT support, consulting), and brands. As for visitors, pre-registrations are also going very well – the number of international visitors is pretty high. Premium Beauty News - Will there also be a digital version of the event? Frankie Béchereau - We aim to capitalize on our digital experience, while enjoying the opportunity to meet people physically. In 2020, we had organized a 100% digital event, and in 2021, the show was hybrid: you could plan digital meetings. This year, we designed our own digital platform, which will be available at the end of September, as a tool to prepare and intensify the physical show. It will help companies organize their meetings beforehand and during the event. However, although there will be some content on the platform, we have preferred to organize physical conferences. Premium Beauty News - Why did you choose to put technological revolutions, in particular AI, at the core of this edition? Frankie Béchereau - Technologies are very strongly related to competitiveness: AI, data, algorithms, and virtual innovations will transform cosmetic trades. Many resources are available in France and we wanted to have several exhibitors in this sector as a complement to our conference programme, which will deal with many aspects of it. Several animations will also be dedicated to this theme. An AI animation area with about ten specialized companies was designed in collaboration with Choose Paris Region and Région Île-de-France. At the AI TechCorner, a laboratory of CNRS, the French national centre for scientific research, will introduce a skin diagnosis tool to develop personalized products. This brand new skin imagery technology is combined with skin analysis software. The prototype has not yet been industrialized. And for its 30th anniversary, Greentech will offer visitors to experientially discover how they model new molecules thanks to AI. Premium Beauty News - This year, the traditional Hackathon will actually be dedicated to AI's added value for the supply chain and logistics. Frankie Béchereau - The supply chain is one of the many fields where AI can be used and we are very happy to highlight this theme with our sponsor, the Deret Group, at a time when supplies are under tension. It also echoes the LIPACO Seine research project (LIPACO stands for Intelligent Logistics for the Perfumes & Cosmetics Industry) in which the Cosmetic Valley took part. The Deret Group will suggest subjects to multidisciplinary teams of students from different schools (engineers, packaging experts, cosmeticians, etc.). The delivery will take place at the end of the show, on October 13, around 5pm. Premium Beauty News - Open Innovation is still at the core of the show. How will this event be organized this year? Frankie Béchereau - It follows the same logic: we detect international companies with innovative projects, and then we organize interviews during the show with the companies which subscribed to this service, including Chanel, L'Oréal, LVMH Research, and Pharma & Beauty Group. This year, for this programme, we put an emphasis on digital innovations and the value brought by AI. Premium Beauty News - The Cosmetic 360 Week will take place in parallel to the show. What is it exactly? Frankie Béchereau - It is a meeting programme mainly reserved for global players which starts before the show and ends after. It is a whole cosmetics-oriented week which covers the show's two days, so people can discover laboratories, factories, training centres, and retailers before and after the show. This programme is part of our project to make Cosmetic 360 a specific event dedicated to all aspects of the 21st century cosmetics industry, but also to French excellence in this field."
Superga Beauty invests to adapt its Cosmeurop plant to full service,"The ""Beauty"" division of the Superga Invest group now has 6 industrial sites in France and 500 employees in France, Europe and Asia. The activity is divided into three business units: Subcontracting (filling, packaging, copacking, picking), Full Service, Promotion & Retail. For several years, the company has been investing massively in its production tool to become a privileged industrial partner of beauty and luxury brands. Between 2019 and 2021, 20 million euros were injected into the extension of the perfume division and the modernization and automation of its various sites. ""Our ambition is to operate sites that in all aspects (quality, safety, HSE, etc.) are as efficient as those of the brands, so that they can be fully confident in our ability to address their needs. We want to support all brands, from the smallest to the largest, thanks to a complementary offer and great agility on all of our production sites,"" explains Leslie Bréau-Méniger, President of Superga Beauty. The take-over in 2021 of the Cosmeurop site from L'Oréal enabled Superga Beauty to acquire a world-class factory, a historic flagship of French perfumery dedicated to the manufacture of Mugler and Azzaro perfumes. Although the L'Oréal group has undertaken to remain a partner of the site for a minimum period of 3 years, Superga Beauty has immediately initiated its industrial and commercial transformation to adapt it to the needs of full-service customers. With 129 underground tanks, from 1,000 to 10,000 litres, a storage capacity of 744,000 litres of alcohol, and 11 packaging lines, including 4 automatic lines, Cosmeurop can produce 3 million litres of perfume per year and fill-in 20 to 25 million vials. The manufacturing unit is fully computer-assisted for total precision in the weighing, premixing, colouring and filtration stages. All perfume storage tanks are buried and connected to the conditioning room by almost 9 km of pipes, so that the perfumes never come into contact with the air. The plant offers a level of technicity and production capacities that are hardly seen in perfume subcontracting, and which have already won over big names. ""These unique installations guarantee exceptional reliability and quality. All the perfumes produced on site are directly connected to the packaging lines"", emphasizes Anne-Sophie Motelle, Managing Director of Cosmeurop. Sized to respond to large-scale projects, the Cosmeurop site supplements the filling and packaging capacities of the other Superga Beauty units, in particular the BPS Fragrances site, in Northern France, which has a maceration unit and 8 perfume filling lines. Thanks to its various sites, Superga Beauty is able to process small, medium and large series. For Superga, however, the challenge was to make Cosmeurop gain in flexibility. Thus, most of the investments were aimed at transforming the site into an agile unit capable of satisfying the multiple full-service expectations of a wide variety of brands. The different sizes of the maceration tanks, the variety of packaging lines (automatic, semi-automatic and manual), thus make it possible to meet diversified needs, for minimum order quantities of 5,000 or 10,000 pieces. Below this, the group's other sites take over. Cosmeurop, which also has historical expertise and the appropriate tools for packaging refillable bottles fitted with screw-on rings, will also soon have a robotic line dedicated to small format bottles (10, 20 or 30 ml ). Enough to satisfy the two strongest trends of the moment! A new in-house quality control laboratory is now available to conduct all tests and analyses brands require on finished products. Finally, a storage capacity of 17,000 pallets makes it possible to anticipate certain logistical needs of full service customers. With Cosmeurop, Superga Beauty now has capacities capable of integrating into the industrial strategy of the largest groups, but also to address the needs of national and international players of all sizes who want made in France products. ""Capacity, expertise and agility are the main strengths we put at disposal of all kinds of brands,"" concludes Anne-Sophie Motelle."
Perfumes: Matière Première cultivates traditional French know-how in Grasse,"Founded in 2019 by Aurélien Guichard and two associates – Caïus Von Knorring, former Marketing Director of Valentino at Puig, and Cédric Meiffret, former Development Group Director at Dior, IFF and Givaudan – Matière Première is now enjoying a leading position in the niche perfumery world, with almost ten launches in three years. They owe their success to concise, easily readable formulas that beautify a flagship ingredient, driven by a persistent, wrapping trail. A master-perfumer at Takasago, Aurélien Guichard was raised in the Grasse region: during his childhood, he was immersed in the world of raw materials. His father, perfumer Jean Guichard, had some land in Grasse, where his grandparents cultivated flowers. He decided to preserve the family know-how by purchasing his own fields, next to his property. He became a farmer in 2016. Three years later, he harvested his first roses. After Rose de Mai, Aurélien Guichard chose to plant tuberoses - he has one hectare of those today. Initially meant to cultivate the traditional know-how of the Grasse region, these plantations led him and his two accomplices to consider creating Matière Première: a first for a niche brand, since rose cultures in Grasse are mainly intended for Chanel and LVMH brands (Louis Vuitton, Dior, Guerlain). His rose and tuberose productions are reserved for the brand's two iconic fragrances: Radical Rose and French Flower. A real asset for the brand, these fields offer unequalled authenticity in the niche perfume world, given the unique, exceptional personality and quality of Grasse flowers. Indeed, perfume brands have a taste for the tuberose of India, whose production is much more important and which costs about 11,000 euros per kilo of absolute. Much less than its cousin from Grasse, since the organic tuberose absolute obtained from Aurélien Guichard's fields, less fruity and less marked by an indole smell, costs about 250,000 euros per kilo. Once the flowers have been harvested, composition company Robertet carries out both the volatile solvent extraction to create the absolute, and the enfleurage with plant-derived waxes to obtain the ""absolute pomade"". About three tonnes of flowers are needed to get one kilo of absolute and 30 to 50 kilos of flowers are required for one kilo of enfleurage. The tuberose is a flower with a complex perfume which is harvested from August to November. During the day, it is mellow, solar, and velvety – a facet highlighted by enfleurage. At night, its perfume gets more luxurious, as it exhales methyl, camphorated tones with almost leathery notes for a pretty faithful result as an absolute. French Flower plays with the flower's two facets, since it is composed of absolute and absolute pomade to fully render the smell of a field of tuberoses. By exploiting its own fields of flowers, the brand gains flexibility: it can adapt production to its needs, as can be seen with the Rose Centifolia, which occupies a two-hectare field. Aurélien Guichard is now considering planting lavandin on his land. If it is rare for a niche brand to have its own fields of flowers, made-in-Grasse production increasingly seduces perfume companies in search of authenticity, traditional know-how, and localism. A flourishing business in the 1930s, flower culture gradually declined in the Grasse region during the 20th century. Then, in the 1980s, the partnerships concluded with local producers by Chanel, and Dior or Lancôme, a bit later, gave it a new shine. In addition, a wind of change is blowing on the region and its exceptional products, thanks to the Grasse perfume know-how being added to UNESCO's World Heritage list in 2018, and to the collective brand Grasse Expertise intended for local aroma-perfume-flavour-scent professionals."
Home fragrances: Scentys is investing and innovating to meet demand,"Since its creation in 2004, Scentys has been offering brands (75% of its turnover) an exclusive technology for diffusing perfumes in the air. The concentrate comes in a solid format, in the form of small pearls, and the fragrance is released thanks to an airflow system. This proprietary technology is also offered to shops, offices or hotels to enhance the olfactory identity of the premises. Finally, for in-store testing, the company offers alternative solutions to test bottles, in the form of mechanical olfactory keys: filled with perfumed capsules developed by the company, they ensure a perfect and very accurate reproduction (always validated by the brands) for about two months, with no necessary maintenance. Driven by the dynamism of the home fragrance market, Scentys is now targeting a turnover of 20 to 25 million euros within 5 years, compared to 6 million euros in 2021. In March, the company opened a sales office in New York to better serve a very dynamic North American market. It is also counting on the growing interest of Asia, particularly China, in creating pleasant olfactory atmospheres in homes, offices or cars. ""The home fragrance market has been growing at a steady pace for several years. Its growth has been accelerated by the various confinements, which have prompted people to attach great importance to the comfort of their homes and, more generally, to their well-being,"" explains Pierre Loustric, CEO. Anticipating the increase in its activity, Scentys has invested nearly one million euros in a new industrial site. On 1 July, the company commissioned its new production unit in Saint-Ouen L'Aumône, in the greater Paris area, in a 3,000 m2 site (against 600 m2 for the previous one), benefiting from the BREEAM environmental label. Equipped with new machines, the site is ready to meet the demands of clients who are increasingly interested in a full-service offer, including not only the filling of scented capsules but also their packaging. A Quality Manager position has been created to supervise all the processes and guarantee optimal customer service. A FabLab with rapid prototyping machines has also been integrated. It should allow development teams to move more quickly from the customer's concept to the industrial prototype, and thus help considerably reduce the development time before launch. At the same time, Scentys has revamped its visual identity with a new logo, a new baseline (""Excellence in fragrance diffusion"") and a new website. Thanks to a technology that uses very little perfume concentrate and ultra-light products with a diffusion time equivalent to that of a candle, Scentys has long claimed a reduced environmental impact. Especially since its dry technology does not emit VOCs and therefore offers a particularly safe perfuming. To take things a step further, the EcoVadis Silver certified company has expanded its offer cartridges with a recycled PP option. The cartridges can also be recycled in the normal flow of plastic packaging. Scentys is carrying out further research and is currently evaluating various alternative materials. ""Our very light cartridges (24g) are perfectly suited to e-commerce and have a very low carbon footprint compared to candles, for example. But we are continuing our efforts to find ever more ecological solutions,"" insists Pierre Loustric. Scentys has recently developed a connected and intelligent diffuser, which can interact with voice assistants (Alexa type). A customisable turnkey solution for a brand wishing to develop a new relationship with its customers. ""We are an engineering company with a very marked technical culture. We see innovation as an important vector for growth, but innovation is not just about high-tech, it is also about regular advances in the use of more sustainable materials and reducing our environmental footprint,"" concludes the CEO."
JCPenney partners with Revieve to offer digital makeup and skincare experiences,"The U.S. retailer has partnered with digital brand experience company Revieve to launch new digital tools to enhance shopping experiences for makeup and skincare on their online store. The new tools includes an AI-powered skincare advisor and a hyper realistic AR-powered makeup try-on technology. ""We want to be the shopping destination of choice, offering a personalized approach that fully celebrates and honors them as unique individuals,"" says Michelle Wlazlo, Chief Merchandising Officer at JCPenney. ""Our partnership with Revieve allows us to deliver on our customers' desire for personalization regardless of age, gender, race, skin tone, beauty regimen, or budget."" JCPenney's Skincare Advisor leverages Revieve's proprietary Skin Diagnostics technology and AI-powered product recommendations as a seamless, end-to-end experience in which consumers can find a personalized skincare routine with a simple selfie. To receive an in-depth skincare analysis and customized product recommendations, visitors to JCPenney's website can take or upload a selfie and answer a quick questionnaire about their skin type and concerns. Revieve's proprietary Skin Diagnostics technology then analyzes more than 120 skin metrics to provide users with an in-depth analysis of their skin and offer JCPenney Beauty product recommendations and skincare education tailored to their needs. According to Sampo Parkkinen, CEO and Founder of Revieve, JCPenney is ""one of the only department chains in the US to bet on personalization."" The simultaneous launch of these new digital experiences will help ""JCPenney customers in finding the right makeup products and skincare routine tailored to their skin type and preferences,"" he added. The introduction of these new personalized digital beauty experiences follows the launch of JCPenney Beauty, the retailer's new, fully inclusive beauty experience, last year. Initially launched at 10 JCPenney store locations across the USA and on jcp.com in October 2021, JCPenney Beauty features an assortment of 170+ beauty brands - from tried-and-true favorites to fresh indie finds to BIPOC founded - spanning makeup, skincare, haircare, styling tools, fragrance, nailcare, and bath and body products at varying price points. Based on extensive consumer research, the retailer has created a blend of products within the mass, masstige (accounting for nearly a half of the assortment), and prestige range for customers."

Capsum opens a lab farm at its research centre using iFarm technology,"Capsum will now be able to cultivate its own organic ingredients for new cosmetic formulas. The French designer and manufacturer of microfluidic skin care formulas has partnered with Finnish technology development company iFarm, which specializes in IT-driven technologies to grow plant in a controlled environment. iFarm has created a cutting-edge farm-laboratory within the Capsum's existing Research & Development site at its Marseille plant. The pilot laboratory consists of three growing rooms with experimental racks based on Ebb-and-Flow hydroponics technology and an automation control system piloted by iFarm's Growtune software. This set-up allows Capsum to grow a range of crops, including microgreens and flowers, and to conduct experiments, test new plant varieties and streamline its supply chain with pesticide-free cosmetics ingredients being grown on-site. ""Indoor growing is perfect for the beauty industry, as it allows us to cultivate in a fully controlled environment free from pesticides and any harmful chemicals. iFarm's technology fits the needs of our researchers, since they are able to vary a wide range of parameters,"" said CEO of Capsum Anthony Briot. Capsum's is currently researching innovative extraction methods and the iFarm technology will provide its R&D team all the needed to complete long and intricate research processes and to produce the botanicals required to develop innovative formulas. However, iFarm's vice-president of sales, Timo Koljonen, outlined that the potential benefits of indoor farming for cosmetic companies go beyond the laboratory setting. ""With iFarm, clients can start with an R&D project and then scale it up to industrial production of herbs, flowers and microgreens, with full hardware and software support along the way. A crop that is stable and predictable year-round, as well as guaranteed to be free from any potential contamination by pesticides or other harmful chemicals, would be also beneficial for larger production volumes,"" he emphasized."
"""We need to expand our global reach,"" says Gotha CEO, Paolo Valsecchi","Premium Beauty News - How do you prepare for the future as make-up is recovering rapidly?

Sales of colour cosmetics are therefore growing around the world, in particular in North America. At the Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna and MakeUp in Paris trade shows, we celebrated this return to the pleasure of make-up with a collection named ""Seeking Joy"". As consumers are looking for fun and playfulness in all areas of life, we think emotional plurality will be a defining feature of 2020's. However, that does not mean the market did not transform compared to the pre-Covid era! The rise of online sales, the growing influence of social media and the search for more natural and sustainable products are some illustrations of the big shifts of the market. Premium Beauty News - What are the consequences for Gotha Cosmetics? Paolo Valsecchi - I think we need to invent something new! The growing role of social media, for instance, has changed the game. Brands need to accelerate new products developments and to reduce time to market. From an industrial point of view, this means that we need to be closer to our customers, closer to end markets. In clear, we need to expand our global footprint with bigger capabilities in Europe, Asia and North America. In addition to expand geographically, we might also find interest in adding new product categories to our portfolio. Our recent acquisition of iColor Group in China will help us to better serve medium local brands interested in offering premium products with competitive prices. More recently, we acquired Mia Cosmetic Factory, a filling company specialising in colour cosmetics based in Ripalta Cremasca, near Crema, Italy, The company was already partnering with us for the filling of a variety of products such as foundations, mascaras, brow products, glosses and highlighters, among others. The operation will enable Gotha to develop new projects faster. Premium Beauty News - What are the next steps? Paolo Valsecchi - We are looking for new opportunities, in particular in North America. Also, we want to add more categories to our portfolio in Italy. Eyes and lips would be interesting areas of growth for us! On September 14 and 15, we will present our latest innovations to the North American market at the Equinox Hotel in the Hudson Yards district, in New York."
"J -7: ""MCB by Beauté Sélection 2022 will be very dynamic!""","Premium Beauty News - What should we expect for the 2022 edition of MCB by Beauté? Christophe Gabreau - After two years of pandemic, the 2022 MCB by Beauté Sélection show gives a sense of renewal. Beauty and hairdressing players are back: we are expecting a high number of brands and visitors and we have prepared a rich content, with a very comprehensive conference and events programme. Just over 270 exhibitors are confirmed, including many newcomers from Europe, but also from other continents! It just shows how much beauty and hairdressing players need – and want – to go meet the public, exchange, and make themselves known! Premium Beauty News - At your last press conference last July, you announced you were expecting 45% of global exhibitors. Have they confirmed? Christophe Gabreau - They have! We will have 45% of global exhibitors, with Brazil ahead, closely followed by Italy. More than 25 Brazilian brands will attend, mainly in the hair care category – a very dynamic segment in this country! We will also have Japanese, Chinese, and Korean brands. As far as Europe is concerned, Spain will be better represented than the previous years. Premium Beauty News - This year, you decided to dedicate a whole area to eyes and nails. Why? Christophe Gabreau - This area reflects an undeniably major ""consumption"" trend: final customers' interest in comprehensive beauty places. Consumers like it when they can have different aesthetic services in the same place (hairdressing, coloration, manicure, makeup, skin treatments…): it is really time-saving. Professionals know that now, so many of them have diversified their businesses to provide complementary services. Claude Maxime and Dessanges, for example, do not introduce themselves as hair salons, but as beauty salons, although their core business is hairdressing. We will host more than thirty brands in this area, so there will be both products and equipment: Magnetic Nail Design, Peggy Sage, Lash Master, Fraise Nail Shop, Make-up For Ever, Erlinda, and many others! Premium Beauty News - For the first time, the 2022 edition of MCB by Beauté Sélection will host the global Eyelash & Nail competition in partnership with the Nail Art France association. Christophe Gabreau - The competition will last three days, and the awards ceremony will take place on the Monday, in the eye and nail area. Two stages will be built for it. This competition makes us even more unmissable as a specialized hairdressing and aesthetics show. We are expecting about 250 candidates from all over the world! Premium Beauty News - The show's three days will be marked by many conferences and events. What themes will be highlighted? Christophe Gabreau - We wanted to focus on two main subjects for which the industry's upstream players (R&D, engineering departments, manufacturers…) and downstream players (hairdressers, makeup artists, beauticians…) try to understand the changes, future trends, and consumer expectations. These two themes are committed beauty and digital technologies. Over the show's three days, the speakers will share their thoughts and experiences with visitors to provide them with concrete solutions. The programme is real exciting [editor's note: link to the programme at the end of the interview]! Premium Beauty News - The show will start in just a few days. How many visitors are you expecting? Christophe Gabreau - We have exceeded our expectations: the number of visitors increases every day, and we should have even more than the 50,000 we had during the 2019 MCB by Beauté Sélection !

Made in Italy: TTC a new powder player in the Cosmetic Valley,"Since 2008, TTC (Tutti Trucchi Cosmetici) has focused on handling fabrication and assembly of beauty products for brands around the world. TTC seized the opportunity to push its limits and grow into a truly innovative hub of services by providing packaging, filling & assembly, as well as formulation and production of new products. TTC is located in the ""Cosmetic Valley"" in Italy, and the geographic position of the company has been strategically important in building new business. In 2020 TTC added an internal branch that is fully dedicated to powders. Along with a brand-new state-of-the-art R&D lab, new product development, sales, and marketing teams are all focused on the mission of formulating, creating, and producing beautiful makeup powders. TTC is bringing fresh innovative concepts to the industry. The mission of the group is to invest energy and time to create a portfolio of products that showcase quality and innovation. This focus has led to a library of over 2,200 newly created formula codes in just the last two years. The R&D team is fully dedicated to innovation, working every day to find ways to upgrade traditional powder categories for eyes, face, and body. The products coming out of this innovation hub are changing the rules of beauty. TTC's new lab opened just before the outbreak of the pandemic (Jan. 2020) which necessitated an intense focus on innovation during a period when the market demand was low. This ultimately provided the opportunity to experiment with new technologies and new raw materials. ""We are hyper focused on powders that provide a truly new skin experience from the first touch,"" said Milena Casiraghi, Managing Director of TTC, ""innovation means being unique in the market."" Playing with new raw materials is resulting in innovative products never seen before on the market. Casiraghi says, ""we are really reinventing the pressed powders category thanks to the expertise of our R&D and marketing team - they have a very specific vision in terms of make-up, and they are trying to combine the best of traditional expertise with new raw materials and active ingredients to create innovative products for tomorrow."" TTC's new machines are creating the best products. Their R&D team and industrialization experts are already involved in this new endeavor, and they are expanding their team this summer. The possibilities for innovation stem from both a visual perspective (multicolor pressed products), as well as from a sensorial/application perspective - new textures created with injection technology release a weightless, very shiny, and pearly effect that can't be obtained with standard powders. TTC is growing! They have new colleagues on board in their Sales, NPD, R&D, and Regulatory departments; new people, new ideas, and new opportunities are the driving force behind their new endeavor where they are encouraging clients to visit them directly to explore new innovations and trends. The TTC showroom is becoming a real treasure that showcases their products and collections as well as demonstrates what the entire kdc/one network is able to offer. This showroom will be the largest stock packaging showroom in Europe. Customers can develop formulas in addition to brainstorming and shopping for packaging options at the same site. For additional information, please contact: Milena Casiraghi, Manager Director, mcasiraghi@kdc-one.com Antonella Lupi Timini, Sales Manager, alupitimini@kdc-one.com"
Ankorstore breathes new life into independent brands and stores,"The co-founders, Pierre-Louis Lacoste, Nicolas d'Audiffret, Nicolas Cohen, and Mathieu Alengrin, all come from e-commerce. And yet, given the weight of online retail giants, they aimed to help independent points of sale reclaim their power with both technical and financial tools. The Ankorstore system is based on a new concept aimed to help 250,000 independent retailers in Europe, 40% of which are in France, get secure access to a catalogue of European brands in seven product categories (beauty, grocery, home, children's products, fashion, jewellery, and stationery). For stores, the minimum order amount is set at 100 euros only – this deliberately low limit helps them test products and prevent overstock. Delivery is free: it triggers a payment to be made to the platform within up to 60 days to compensate for retailers' cash flow issues. For the 20,000 brands already referenced in Europe, all categories included, Ankorstore offers instantaneous visibility online as part of its broad network. In addition, shipping costs are refunded and invoice payments automatically generated as soon as the delivery has been made to the store. ""This way, brands are protected against non-payment risk,"" explains Lily Cadell, Country Manager France. ""They create their own catalogue on the website, so they can accept or refuse orders. They remain free to choose their own distribution strategy. Then, they ship the products, we pay them, and the store can pay us within 60 days. We definitely define ourselves as a marketplace which helps independent brands to boost their business and retailers to source their products from these brands,"" she adds. A third of the 5,000 beauty brands selected are French. It is one of the three most dynamic categories in France for the platform, with a 65% growth of the number of brands since January. ""Brands are selected according to simple criteria. We only work with brands which have stock, since we promise stores to be delivered within 10 to 15 days. Then, of course, come quality and margins: we cannot work with brands with low margins, it is not interesting for retailers. Generally speaking, we accept 50% of the brands that apply,"" explains Lily Cadell. Endro, Jolis Baumes, Comme Avant, Respire, Les Petits Prodiges, Lamazuna… Clean Beauty brands enjoy a privileged position, but the offering still boasts eclectic profiles to stick to an exhaustive approach. The platform's business model is based on a commission taken from the turnover achieved by brands: 20% for the first order placed by a store, 10% on restockings. However, there is no commission if the store is a historic client of the brand, i.e. if they worked together before Ankorstore. With a 1.75-billion-euro value, Ankorstore is part of the closed club of French unicorns. Early this year, the company raised 250 million euros to keep growing and assert its position as the first European marketplace to facilitate exchanges between independent retailers and brands. ""We are more than a marketplace, because we aim to create a product that is truly integrated and easy-to-use on a daily basis for both stores and brands,"" says Lily Cadell. To highlight this objective, the company created a new integrated entity, Ankorstart. Thanks to its network of experts, it helps guide retailers starting their businesses from the beginning up to three months after they have opened their shops. ""Before, during, and after, we support them with brand selection, financing issues and cash flow flexibility, stock evaluation according to their own store, administration and legal procedures, etc.,"" explains Lily Cadell. To further strengthen its position as a partner, the company will launch a new fulfilment offer in late 2022: brands no longer willing to take care of the deliveries will be able to store some of their goods in an Ankorstore warehouse and outsource logistics and deliveries to the platform. Right now, Ankorstore counts eight offices in Europe, in Paris, Lille, London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Stockholm, Barcelona, and Milan, representing 600 employees. ""We evaluate the potential of independent stores in Europe at 1.5 million. Right now, we have 250,000: there is still a long way to go, so we are focusing on this. We also aim to enrich our catalogue of brands, in particular in the beauty category,"" Lily Cadell concludes."
"BolognaFiere, Informa and PBA partner and announce new trade show in Miami","Beginning in January 2023, BolognaFiere, Informa Markets and PBA will combine their forces and their beauty industry knowledge to strengthen their positions in the U.S. market. As a part of the new joint venture, PBA, who currently organizes ISSE in Long Beach, California, will evolve the show to be a part of the Premiere Beauty expansion in Anaheim, California. Premiere Beauty also runs events in Columbus, Ohio, in Birmingham, Alabama, and in Orlando, Florida. PBA already partners with BolognaFiere on the Cosmoprof North America show, held in Las Vegas, which hosted over 1,100 exhibiting companies and welcomed over 32,000 visitors in its 2022 edition. While Cosmoprof North America and Premiere have different attendee value propositions, the three partners expect to leverage the power of the two brands in order to deliver more value to the beauty industry across the U.S. Beginning in 2024, BolognaFiere, PBA, and Informa Markets are willing to expand the Cosmoprof North America brand, bringing beauty industry professionals together in Miami, Florida, one of the highest growth markets in the U.S. The three organizations believe that this new show will also be well positioned to serve the Latin American market. Informa Markets, which is also partnering with BolognaFiere in the organization of Cosmoprof Asia, had tried to launch an event in Miami in 2020, but this project, initially rescheduled to 2021, had been suspended due to the pandemic. The joint venture will be led by Ed McNeill, Vice President of the Informa Markets, U.S. Beauty Portfolio, with Meredith Loza and Marco Labbate leading Marketing and Sales, respectively in cooperation with the Sales and Marketing teams of BolognaFiere Cosmoprof. ""The U.S. market is particularly in the spotlight today, given the current uncertainties in the Asian continent"", highlighted Gianpiero Calzolari, President of BolognaFiere Group."
"""Tomorrow's beauty will be physical and digital,"" says L'Oréal's Camille Kroely","Does L'Oréal's presence at VivaTech mean that beauty and technological innovation are now inseparable? Camille Kroely - Technological innovation is the ally of tomorrow's beauty. At L'Oréal, we believe that innovation is at the intersection of science and technology, and that's exactly what we're presenting at VivaTech. Innovation is at the heart of our DNA... At the beginning with science, and today by bringing science and technology together to offer an augmented beauty. How can technology shape the future of beauty? Camille Kroely - Today's technologies allow us to meet consumers' needs at the click of a button. Throughout their beauty journey, our customers have access to services that provide them with precision, such as virtual makeup testing via artificial intelligence, as well as customized advice, such as Lancôme's Shade Finder, which helps them find the right shade of foundation, or personalized skin diagnostics in store with Skin Screen and at home with E-youth Finder. These innovations allow customers to find their own tailored beauty routine with an unprecedented degree of precision. Technology offers unlimited possibilities for personalization. Among the innovations showcased at VivaTech is Yves Saint Laurent Beauty's ""Scent-Sation"" which lets users find the fragrance that best expresses their emotions. Has personalization become essential to winning over consumers? Camille Kroely - Scent-Sation is a unique immersive experience that, through a connected headset, can evaluate consumers' emotional responses to different families of scents in order to help them find the perfect fragrance. The need for personalization has always existed, and technology offers consumers a customized response, with unprecedented level of precision. The group's brands are also making their first forays into the metaverse with NFTs and immersive experiences. Is this an inevitable next step? Camille Kroely - At L'Oréal, the metaverse is a unique field of exploration and innovation for fostering engagement with a new generation of consumers. The beauty of the future will be physical, digital and virtual. We are therefore approaching it with a 'test and learn' approach to identify possibilities to enrich the consumer journey, which is constantly evolving, moving from an 'Online to Offline' approach to an 'Online to Offline to On-Chain' approach. What possibilities could the metaverse hold for the group's luxury and consumer brands? Camille Kroely - The metaverse offers many opportunities. Among them is the possibility to engage communities and promote diversity. For example, the NYX Professional Makeup brand is supporting the next generation of artists by launching the first 3D beauty designers label to shape the beauty codes of tomorrow. As part of this launch, NYX partnered with People of Crypto Lab (POC) on The Sandbox platform and made available 8,430 NFT avatars representing diversity in all its forms. For its part, Yves Saint-Laurent launched 10,000 NFTs to unlock unique and personalized experiences and services in the YSL Beauty ecosystem. With SkinCeuticals Pro 1:1, L'Oréal offers personalized — and free — skin diagnostics to build a customized routine. Is the future of skincare also virtual? Camille Kroely - Knowing your skin's needs and the most appropriate product routine is a very strong demand that has always existed. Today, thanks to new technologies, we allow consumers to access a certain level of advice and recommendations at the click of a button, wherever they are. At L'Oréal, we're seeing an exponential demand for skincare that's growing rapidly today. We must respond by combining beauty products and services to offer consumers the best possible experience. Will all these technological innovations also be deployed in physical stores? Camille Kroely - That's the strength of what we're presenting today: a fluid beauty journey that offers the best of our recommendations and diagnostics through in-store devices. Lancôme is using artificial intelligence to offer Skin Screen, an advanced skin analysis service, provided free of charge in-store by a brand beauty consultant. The service uses an innovative device that takes pictures of the face using tripolar light technology to provide the best high-resolution analysis. Skin Screen uses artificial intelligence to compare images with our Skin Aging Atlas database of more than 15,000 images, and pools more than 20 years of data and expertise in clinical trial evaluations to analyze 13 skin health parameters, including hydration, texture, UV damage and dark circles. Is technology also being used to support a more environmentally responsible approach to beauty? Camille Kroely - At L'Oréal, we have identified many revolutionary technologies for making beauty more environmentally responsible. The L'Oréal Water Saver offers a hair-washing experience that reduces water consumption by 61% compared to standard methods; this will represent billions of liters of water each year. Virtual makeup testing is also proving to be very effective for preserving the environment. When a consumer uses it, we see up to -17% in the return rates of our products because the customer was able to try them beforehand; which also allows us to reduce our carbon footprint. What beauty will look like at L'Oréal in 10 years' time? Camille Kroely - In 10 years, beauty at L'Oréal will be ever more responsible, more inclusive, and at the intersection of science and technology."
Abortion decision backs US companies into a tight space,"""Today's Scotus (Supreme Court of the United States) ruling puts women's health in jeopardy, denies them their human rights, and threatens to dismantle the progress we've made toward gender equality in the workplace since Roe,"" said Yelp Chief Executive Jeremy Stoppelman on Twitter. ""Business leaders must speak out now and call on Congress to codify Roe into law."" The Supreme Court's decision of June 24, 2022 to overturn the landmark 1973 ""Roe v. Wade"" ruling enshrining U.S. women's right to an abortion, is expected to result in patchwork legal rights across the United States, with abortion legal in progressive states like California and New York and barred in more conservative states like Texas. However few other CEOs of large US companies joined Stoppelman in condemning the decision. More common were statements from companies announcing or reiterating intention to reimburse employees if they need to travel for an abortion. ""We are expanding [the benefits of the ELC's medical plan] to include the coverage of travel and lodging necessary to access reproductive healthcare options within the United States that may not be easily accessible or locally available to employees and their dependents enrolled in ELC's medical plan,"" said The Estée Lauder Companies in a statement. Similarly, luxury group LVMH said: ""LVMH and our Maisons remain committed to providing equitable access to high-quality and affordable health care resources for all employees and their families, regardless of where they live in the United States. This includes expenses associated with travel to a different state for health care services."" Yelp and Airbnb were among the first companies to announce such benefits last September following a Texas law banning abortion after six weeks, or before many women know they are pregnant. Others, including Citigroup, Tesla and Amazon, had also announced the benefit in following months. More companies came forward after a draft version of last week's abortion ruling was published in a press leak in May; this group included Starbucks, Levi Strauss and JPMorgan Chase. On Friday, Disney added its name to the list, assuring employees of access to reproductive care benefits ""no matter where they live,"" according to a memo reported by CNBC. In the personal care industry Johnson & Johnson, and Unilever have made similar moves. However, most large companies in the U.S. have avoided publicly discussing the topic, a dynamic that Wharton business school professor Maurice Schweitzer considers unsurprising. ""I think we'll see more companies statements. But companies are facing a challenge. On the one hand, they want to be active, be involved, make a statement, lead on this issue, because particularly for some companies, their employees value this,"" Schweitzer said. ""But it's a complicated issue, because the legal landscape will change,"" opening companies up to possible litigation, he added. Schweitzer pointed to Disney's recent difficulties in Florida as a cautionary tale. The entertainment giant found itself between a rock and a hard place as Florida's legislature advanced what critics have called the ""Don't Say Gay"" law, which bans lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in elementary schools. After initially staying quiet on the proposal, Disney finally spoke out on the measure, enraging far right Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, who ultimately signed a second law specifically punishing Disney over the row by eliminating the company's special status surrounding its Orlando theme park. Disney ""ended up frustrating employees by not speaking out early enough, but also incurring costs from a political fights."" Schweitzer noted that more companies have spoken out in recent years, such as Apple CEO Tim Cook on gay rights and Dick's Sporting Goods on gun control, which on Friday announced that it will provide up to $4,000 for employees, their spouses or their dependents who have to travel for an abortion. But the procedure is ""more fraught"" than many issues, Schweitzer said. ""It's easier for companies to try to be silent than to wade into it,"" he said. Actually, major companies usually stay apart from social and political conflicts, especially in a polarized time. They tend to be afraid of offending their customers and associating their brands with sensitive subjects. However, this changed recently as pressures do not only come from advocacy groups but have extended to younger consumers and employees expecting the brands the buy, or the companies they work for, to have clear positions on what they see as key public issues. A series of indie brands have well understood that commitment could be a way to stand out from the crowd and met success by placing ""corporate activism"" as the keystone of their business model. Keeping quiet is no longer an option, but speaking out can be risky: more than ever companies need to be clear about their own values and how their corporate mission is expressed!"
CTKCLIP & the digitalization of beauty creation,"Founded in 2001, CTK is a cosmetics platform company that provides turnkey product development services – tracing its roots all the way back to Taega Trade - a cosmetics packaging manufacturer established in 1979. We provide a comprehensive range of services from content creation, product design, formula, packaging, marketing, production, quality management, and logistics. Our numerous collaborations with global beauty powerhouses allowed us to stay ahead of the trends, shaping future beauty innovations. We work with OEM partners to provide the best solution for each brand's unique concepts and identities. We match the best OEM manufacturer to each client's needs rather than running our own factory, because operating an in-house factory would blindside us into focusing on promoting products we are equipped and specialized in. This bias also limits the opportunities that we could otherwise propose to the clients that best fit their needs. Breaking free from the limitations, our in-house R&D labs and creative teams can solely focus on developing and curating the best proposals for the clients. We are now digitalizing these services through CTKCLIP so that we can reach a wider audience without the constraints of time and space. CTKCLIP is an online beauty creation platform. This platform is designed with the goal of simplifying product creation by matching thousands of formulas, packaging, and raw materials sourced and curated by CTK matched to client's needs, all within a few clicks. Drawing parallels to Expedia – the all-in-one travel platform that provides all information from flights to hotels and car rentals, CTKCLIP is a beauty platform where one can find everything needed for beauty creation. Beauty creation is now made easy, without the hassle of going through multiple stages of development. It makes comparing information and matching various product requirements simpler and faster. We work and collaborate with over 200+ partner factories and manufacturers, showcasing a wide range of the best and newest products in the industry, we then mix and match client's desired ingredients, formulas, and packaging, putting together the best options for client's review. With more than 20 years' experience in the industry and rubbing shoulders with global beauty powerhouses, we have rich knowledge on industry's standards, enabling us to offer tailored service to our clients. We also have our very own in-house cosmetic chemists' team at our CTK INOLAB – who are all experts in their fields. They are always experimenting with the latest trends and ingredients developing them into formulas – that are globally compliant. These formulas are not just innovative and trendy but also adhere to the strictest global compliances and highest quality. We also support our OEM partners by sharing our know-hows and scientific feedbacks so we can put together the best for our clients. Same goes for packaging – we proudly house a team of experienced packaging engineers and designers who design and bring to life innovative packaging solutions with new, eco-friendly materials. We hold over 280 patents – including the bottoms-up stick - designed for stick formulations but effectively eliminating wastage with its sophisticated cup mechanism. It was recently nominated at Makeup in Paris for the Innovation & Trend (IT) award! Our subsidiary - CTK Bio Canada champions our R&D efforts in eco-friendly material development, with our latest development of biodegradable and compostable plastics materials. For now, CTKCLIP is a platform that offers our existing beauty turnkey services from product planning, through development online. We promptly curate and introduce the newest products in the market to meet the diverse needs and requirements of our clients. Moving forward, we have plans to expand our platform to allow our partners to directly upload their newest innovations onto CTKCLIP, so we can further fasten the turnover time for products updates and expand our collection of products. On top of that, it will allow us to truly become a platform where our OEM partners can interact with our brand clients directly. Apart from ODM, we also have plans on further expanding CTKCLIP beyond - to include fully integrated solutions for clients. To kickstart our expansion effort, we have partnered up with CTK subsidiaries that provides 3PL logistics services as well as OBM designing services and these services will be made available on CTKCLIP soon. Lastly, we also have plans on providing retailing solutions on CTKCLIP. We would like to facilitate B2B and B2C commerce; connecting partners, brands and clients across the globe with the ultimate goal of CTKCLIP growing into an all-rounded platform that provides a full complete range of services- right from the very initial stage of product development to the retailing end."
"""We are banking on disruptive innovations"", Laurent Dodet, P&B Group","Premium Beauty News - Can you give us a quick overview of the P&B Group? Laurent Dodet - Pharma & Beauty Group has six plants in France that provide development and production services to more than 200 customers operating in the cosmetics, medical devices, food supplements and pharmaceutical sectors. This tool is complemented by a partnership with Cetes Cosmetics, the industrial arm of the Oriflame Group, which gives us access to the production capabilities of its factories in Poland, Russia and India, when necessary, to serve our customers. The group has 700 employees and posted sales of 90 million euros in 2021. We are targeting the 120 million euros mark in 2022. But P&B is first and foremost an entrepreneurial adventure! After a two-decade career in the beauty and health sector, I wanted to acquire a company in difficulty in 2012 to develop a qualitative and innovative industrial offer for the beauty, pharmaceutical and food supplement markets. This first site had around twenty employees and a turnover of 800,000 euros. It was certainly a bit of a crazy challenge, but it was an exciting one too! We created the group by successively buying up companies in financial difficulty, some of which were on the verge of liquidation. We focused on sites with specific know-how and, above all, motivated people! Today, we have a diversified and very complementary industrial tool. Each site has a specific purpose, our units are very complementary but can also support each other for certain productions and offer our customers a reassuring backup possibility. Premium Beauty News - The world of cosmetic contract manufacturing is in strong development but also highly competitive. What are the assets of P&B Group today? Laurent Dodet - We do not consider ourselves as subcontractors but as designer-producers! Our priority is the quality of service provided to customers. We master a wide variety of production technologies for dosage forms (liquids, pastes, tablets, loose powders, hot poured solids, etc.). Our site in Montélimar, which is GMP Pharma certified, allows us to bridge the gap between the ""in & out"". We can condition a wide variety of packaging, ranging from the most standard to the most disruptive solutions such as pouch aerosols, sticks (skincare and make-up), powder sticks, aluminium tubes, DOY packs, etc. We have invested massively in human organisation, industrial infrastructures and innovation. For example, we have industrialised the production of preservative-free products based on CL TECH's UHT technology. In total, we currently employ more than 40 people in cosmetic R&D and 6 people in food supplement R&D. In general, we focus on breakthrough innovations, in partnership with start-ups from the medical world or other sectors, in particular for the development of dermatological products or innovative medical devices, but also the implementation of new production processes. For example, we have done a lot of research on ionised water for healthcare and medical devices (e.g. nasal sprays). This research work will soon lead to a publication and numerous projects in cosmetics. Finally, we will be one of the four companies participating in the Open Innovation session of the Cosmetic 360 trade show which will take place on 12 and 13 October 2022 in Paris. We will be meeting the project leaders alongside leading cosmetics groups such as LVMH and Chanel. Premium Beauty News - What are your plans for the future? Laurent Dodet - Innovation is still at the heart of our strategy and we plan to continue supporting start-ups in their projects. We invest 6 to 7 million euros each year in new equipment and to improve our infrastructure. We are currently building 900 m² of offices in Saint-Chamas, near Aix-en-Provence, to bring together all our support services. On the same site, we plan to build a 1,000 m² building dedicated to our R&D. We also have a project to expand our sites in Montélimar and Saint-Chamas by 2023. We are also thinking about completing our formulation know-how through colour expertise, particularly in the area of tinting (hot poured and fluid): either by developing this expertise internally or through an acquisition. We also want to promote our know-how internationally, and we are structuring ourselves with this in mind. Premium Beauty News - What is your vision for the market in the coming years? How do you intend to meet future challenges? Laurent Dodet - Environmental and social issues will become increasingly important. Our carbon footprint will be finalized in July and this will allow us to identify areas for improvement and continue our actions. To combine sustainability and secure supplies, we are working to shorten our value chains so that we are no longer forced to source raw materials from the other side of the world, in particular through the vertical integration of certain resources. In the same vein, we are also working on traceability, particularly for Energie Fruit, one of our customers who has placed transparency at the heart of its project. Beyond that, I think that innovation will remain strategic. It requires commitment and patience, but our objective is to continue to grow while maintaining our agility and our sense of service."
ABC Texture aims to grow thanks to innovation and an eco-designed plant,"ABC Texture develops full-service cosmetic formulas and products in the skincare, makeup, and sun care categories. All formulas are based on the GREENette concept and contain at least 95% of ingredients of natural origin. They are also eligible to the Cosmos or Eve Vegan certificates. ""Our formulas are always minimalist. All ingredients should have a function in the product,"" says Louisette Bourdin, President of the company. ABC Texture combines these high degrees of naturalness with a great diversity of galenic forms. The formulas can be solid, hot-poured, emulsified and aqueous for production volumes from 50 kg to two tonnes. ""We work with natural materials without any compromise on sensoriality, even if our products are highly technical or involve significant constraints, given the specifications. For example, we have products with a double function, like our solar foundation,"" adds the Director. The laboratory also offers a Texturothèque® service, so customers can choose the texture they want from a portfolio of standard, customizable formulas. When they settled in the city of Dinard in 2008, ABC Texture made a pioneering choice with an HQE-certified, 2,000 m2 industrial site. Building standards were complied with. For example, the excavation soil was used to create a natural fence. Also, the building's orientation was designed to prevent high temperature variations: it is made from bio-bricks to preserve inertia between winter and summer. It is powered by renewable energies, etc. ""We wanted a smart plant. Of course, it was 30% more expensive, but we make up for this with energy gains and the building's sustainability. The environment is also more pleasant for employees,"" says Louisette Bourdin. Alongside committed brands, including conventional ones in a transformational phase willing to develop more natural ranges, ABC Texture adapts to different markets and achieves 30% of its turnover with export. In line with the wave of Clean Beauty, ABC Texture meets a rising, accelerated, contextualized demand, says Louisette Bourdin. ""There is an increasing demand for naturalness, but also for projects with a faster time-to-market. Brands used to give us 18 months to two years, now they require six months to one year, so it is essential to start with standard options to be customized according to customers' needs. As we are dealing with supply difficulties with raw materials and increasingly strict CSR strategies, our customers also keep asking for more: local products made in Europe, France, or even Brittany. All this should be meaningful, because they need a story to tell,"" she concludes."
Unilever and Geno launch new venture to scale alternative cleansing ingredients,"With USD120 million (about EUR114.3 million) jointly invested in the newly-formed initiative, and with other strategic investors expected to join, the venture aims to develop a plant-based alternative to palm oil using biotechnology to be used for cleaning and personal care products. According to the duo behind the initiative, there are currently few viable alternatives to palm and fossil sources that can be produced at scale in order to make those ingredients. Geno's research and development team has deployed more than USD 300 million in technology investment to create a portfolio of 2,200 patents and applications covering product pathways, synthetic biology approaches to engineering microorganisms, processes to bio-manufacture products, their sometimes unique biological compositions, and product applications. ""Our technology enables pathways for alternative sourcing of materials whose supply chains often have limited social and environmental transparency, by offering more resilient supply chains that are transparent, traceable and responsibly-sourced, as demanded by consumers. Beyond creating new transparent and responsibly sourced-supply chains and alternatively-sourced materials, our Geno technology also represents the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 100 million tons in upcoming years,"" said Christophe Schilling, Geno CEO. Geno will deploy its biotechnology platform and is already starting to scale the process for its advanced technology to produce the ingredients. Initial estimates have shown that companies could reduce the carbon footprint of palm-derived ingredients by up to 50% with this technology-driven, plant-based alternative. Companies like Unilever, whose products are used globally by 3.4 billion people each day, are increasingly partnering with biotechnology innovators to explore, develop, and manufacture new versions of traditionally-sourced ingredients. ""While palm oil will remain an important feedstock to Unilever, these alternative ingredients can play a growing role in diversifying supply chains to drive optionality, sustainability, cost efficiencies and transparency,"" said the company in a statement. For Unilever, one of the world's biggest soap and detergent manufacturers, this is the largest investment in biotechnology alternatives to palm oil to date. As such, the venture offers the opportunity to tap into the combined USD 625 billion home and personal care markets. During the recent months, palm oil - as many other vegetal oils - has been recording price hikes at an all-time high. In a context of increased uncertainty on supply chains, it is strategic for major users to diversify their sources of such key materials. ""Biotechnology has the potential to revolutionise the sourcing of our cleansing ingredients and ensure Unilever is a future-fit business – for consumers, shareholders and the planet we all share. This new venture will sit at the intersection of science and sustainability, meaning we can continue to grow our business without relying only on palm oil or fossil fuel derivatives, while also making our supply chains more resilient from having access to ingredient alternatives. We will be marrying science and nature to make sure there is no tradeoff for our consumers between the efficacy and sustainability of their products. We are building this innovative new venture to have the scale to drive real impact and change in our industry, helping to reinvent the chemistry of home and personal care products for the 21st Century,"" said Unilever's Chief R&D Officer Richard Slater."
"""We re-root Vichy in scientific expertise,"" Vania Lacascade","Premium Beauty News - Vichy Laboratoires is a dermocosmetics pioneer in France. How do you define the brand today? Vania Lacascade - Founded by a doctor almost 90 years ago, it is firmly rooted in health and science. It is part of the L'Oréal Active Cosmetics Division and is mainly distributed in pharmacies and parapharmacies. It is recommended by over 50,000 dermatologists around the world, in particular the haircare and anti-ageing ranges. Two years ago, we readopted our initial brand signature, which dated back to the 1990s: health also depends on our skin. It really is the brand's philosophy: the skin is a health barometer, so we need to get to know it and take care of it. Health is more than ever at the core of all our concerns. Premium Beauty News - How do you express this health concern? Vania Lacascade - We have been working on the exposome science for several years: it is the study of the impact on our skins of our environments (pollution, climate), lifestyles, but also hormone variations, which can have significant consequences on the skin's biological functions. We have three committees of dermatologists dedicated to the study of the exposome to understand the cumulative effects of these different factors on the skin and scalp, in the different phases of life. During the 2000s, the brand decided to get deeply involved in the management of menopause and its impacts on the skin. This issue is still taboo in society, but people are starting to speak out. Last September, we relaunched Neovadiol, our skincare range dedicated to the menopause. It was also a new way to openly communicate on this key phase of women's lives. Premium Beauty News - How do you highlight scientific expertise? Vania Lacascade - Over the past three years, we have considerably strengthened our presence alongside health professionals. We conducted about forty studies, published about twenty articles, and we made a strong comeback at major dermatology congresses. In addition, we tightened our relationships with dermatologists, but also with pharmacists, in particular as regards the menopause. For our part, this theme was a major area of improvement, thanks to our research on the impact of hormone variations on the skin, in particular falling oestrogen levels and rising cortisol levels. Our relationship with pharmacists proved all the more essential in managing this phase of women's lives. I am a pharmacist myself and I know how crucial it is to benefit from this support in pharmacies, because they can help women with it. We reviewed this skincare range to be in line with our advances in knowledge, in particular as regards the two phases of menopause, the peri- and postmenopause, which do not involve the same needs. As I said, it is still taboo, so we also launched an awareness campaign with our range called ""skincare for menopause"", without any ambiguity. It was crucial to open up the debate, in particular with round tables, testimonies, and tips. We aimed to make women speak up and support every one of them through this phase of their lives and with their management by health professionals. Premium Beauty News - How is Vichy Laboratoires positioned compared to the group's other brands? Vania Lacascade - With its scientific expertise in the impacts of the exposome on the skin and scalp, Vichy targets women and men in all life phases. Puberty with Normaderm, the thirties with daily skincare like Mineral, the first signs of ageing, down to dark spots, with Lift Active, the menopause with Neovadiol… In parallel, the Dercos range helps us take scientific action for the scalp. So, we are complementary to our sister brands, we support people throughout their lives. Our brand is very close to consumers, highly inclusive: it targets women and men of all ages. Premium Beauty News - What about sustainability? Vania Lacascade - It is a global approach of the L'Oréal group. Our demanding dermatological charter helps us guarantee the safety and efficacy of our products, but with the great challenge to develop more sustainable formulas with dermatological raw materials and ingredients derived from sustainable sources. Biotechnology also brings a lot in this field. We have clear objectives, i.e. 95% of bio-based ingredients or ingredients rich in abundant minerals by 2030, and 100% derived from sustainable sources. We constantly review our formulas to improve their environmental profiles, in particular their biodegradability. As for sun care products, we have been reformulating our portfolio to offer a profile that is more ocean- and marine-biodiversity friendly. As regards packaging, we aim to reduce weight and use recycled plastic. This sustainable innovation strategy has been integrated to our development programme for years and is part of the group's more global approach. Premium Beauty News - What are your projects innovation-wise? Vania Lacascade - Prioritize flagship categories, keep forging ahead with anti-ageing skincare, explore the hormone issue, in particular the menopause and haircare, but also sun care, since the UV impact is a major factor of the exposome to be taken into account. All this is part of a strategy for the continuous improvement of our formulas' environmental footprints and profiles, while guaranteeing safety and efficacy. Premium Beauty News - What can you tell us about your market targets? Vania Lacascade - The brand is present in over 60 countries and very well-established in Europe, our historical market. It is also very strong in countries like Canada and Brazil. The latter is actually our biggest market globally: the brand's positioning is healthcare-oriented, in particular with hair care. Dercos is the first brand recommended by dermatologists for anti-dandruff care. China and the US are markets on which we aim to further develop, in particular with face and hair care. Lastly, we aim to keep re-rooting the brand in its medical ground, both for healthcare professionals and consumers. We are more than ever legitimate on the dermocosmetics market, thanks to our scientific expertise, and we pay particular attention to developing real proximity and an authentic tone in our communication."
"""New markets are emerging for perfumes,"" Xavier Ardizio, Argeville","Premium Beauty News - In 2021, Argeville joined the closed circle of hundred-year-old companies. Today, it is an internationally renowned company that embodies the success of French perfumery and Provençal know-how. Xavier Ardizio - Argeville employs 310 people worldwide and has a turnover of 60 million euros thanks to three activities: Perfumery, which represents more than 80% of our sales, natural ingredients, and food flavourings. 90% of our sales are to international customers. Asia is our fastest-growing market. We are present in China, Thailand and Vietnam. We opened a production site in Bangkok in 2019, which allows us to serve our regional customers with greater agility. There is a real interest in perfumery and Made in France ingredients. We employ some 30 people in Dubai where we opened a creative centre in 2012. The Middle East represents 30% of our business, it is also a platform for accessing African markets where we anticipate significant growth in the coming years, with local players in full development. With this in mind, we will be opening an office in Johannesburg next July. We are also present in South America, with a sales office and a small laboratory in Bogota, Colombia. Premium Beauty News - This international presence allows you to have a global vision of the perfume market. What are the main challenges for the future? Xavier Ardizio - What we observe everywhere is a growing demand for natural ingredients. Consumers want quality perfumes, derived as much as possible from nature. To meet these expectations, we can draw on our heritage. When Argeville was founded, it specialised in the cultivation of perfume plants from the Grasse region. More recently, we have invested in an extraction site located in La Laupie, in the Drôme area, to make it our centre of expertise for natural products. We have also set up partnerships with French producers of perfume plants to foster the development of short circuits and secure our supply chain. But whatever the ingredients' origin, mastering sourcing has become a strategic issue in perfumery. It allows guaranteeing supplies, ensuring the product traceability and controlling their quality. Throughout the world, our perfumers are prescribers in the choice of the grades we buy. To obtain the best options, we have to work in close partnership with our producers. Premium Beauty News - Isn't this emphasis on natural products detrimental to innovation? Xavier Ardizio - Absolutely not. There is a lot to do in this field, which is very far from having been fully explored. We are constantly looking for new materials and new qualities. We are working on new, more efficient and more sustainable extraction methods. Environmental issues also compel us to be inventive. Our R&D is therefore devoting a lot of energy to reducing the use of solvents, finding new formulation methods and reducing transport costs. Premium Beauty News - The world of perfumery is an incredibly competitive arena. What are Argeville's assets in this sector today? Xavier Ardizio - Argeville is an independent family business. Our customers are large family-run SMEs that are like us, they are attracted by our reputation as a century-old company in the Grasse area, our accessibility and our agility. They are companies in tune with our values: Excellence, humility, audacity and pleasure! Our expertise in natural ingredients and our mastery of the supply chain round off our list of strong points. Finally, we are one of the few companies with 360° expertise and with the capability to offer a complete service for the creation of fragrance lines via our sister company 1st.Mood, based in Valbonne. Premium Beauty News - How do you see the future of the perfume market? Xavier Ardizio - Formulation will continue to evolve towards more naturalness and sustainability. This is an unstoppable trend. At the same time, new markets will emerge, particularly in Asia and Africa. People who did not have access to perfume before will develop an interest in these products, and growth will continue globally. We are therefore carrying on with our investments. At the industrial level, our Mougins site will move to Grasse in a brand new factory, which will be home to a new automated weighing robot. Works are scheduled to start in September 2022 and be completed in April 2024. This is an investment of around 25 million euros. On the commercial side, we intend to expand our international network: the opening of our South African office is the first step toward other projects that should come to fruition in 2023!"
Hinode seeks to increase global footprint and to sell in 30 countries by 2030,"Like other Brazilian beauty giants, Hinode was born in a garage: the one of wife and husband Adélaïde and Francisco Rodrigues. At that time, Adélaïde was a seamstress and supplemented the family income by selling beauty products. Within a few years, it happened that she was earning more than her husband, a metallurgist. The couple then began to work together, before launching their own brand in 1988. Hinode's entry into the country's list of leading cosmetics companies has its roots in 2008, when the company - which then had an annual turnover of around 8 million reais - when it shifted its business model to a multi-level marketing (MLM) strategy. The growth became exponential with a turnover reaching 2.7 billion reais in 2018. ""However, we faced growth difficulties,"" explains Erica Pagano, Vice President Product Innovation and Branding. ""It was time to reorganize the entire house,"" she says. Product shortage, lack of sales advisers and the difficulty of measuring business performance were among the difficulties to overcome as the company's turnover fell to 1.6 billion reais in 2020. From 2019, the company began to change its governance: the members of the Rodrigues family gradually move towards seats on the board of directors and the management of the company was entrusted to Marilia Rocca, the current CEO, and experienced executives were appointed to top management positions. In parallel, the entire product catalogue also had to be reshuffled. The number of SKUs was reduced from 1000 to 350 - most of them being manufactured at the company's 12,000 m2 industrial site, which opened in 2017 in Jandira, in the metropolitan area of São Paulo. ""Our portfolio was very large and had no clear direction. Today, we offer a portfolio centred on beauty and healthy lifestyles,"" says Erica Pagano. ""We want our sales advisors to be real specialists and to be able to provide the best possible product demonstrations,"" she adds. The offer was not only refocused, it was also radically renewed. ""Our motto is that nothing is that good that it cannot be improved"", continues Pagano. The new Routine Dermo skin care line thus succeeded Age Reverse with products featuring the Skintelligent exclusive technology, which facilitates the penetration of active ingredients. And as for the Joli PreciOus Oils body care line, it is now made from essential and vegetable oils. Perfumery, which accounts for 50% of Hinode's sales, has also been enriched with new products. Fragrances in the Life collection, were co-created with Firmenich and feature their H-Emotions technology, which uses neuroscience to create emotions. ""In addition to keeping an eye on global trends and what the consumer is looking for, one's have to invest in technology so as not to be overwhelmed,"" insists the innovation manager. Packaging is also a key issue. One of the brand's best-sellers, the Hands cream, is now packed in green plastic derived from sugar cane. And the Dazzle makeup line offers many products in cardboard packaging. ""We want to deliver the best products with the least environmental impact"". A few months ago, the brand presented its new positioning. The distinction between the name in Brazil (Hinode) and the international name (HND) was abandoned for Hinode Group, due to be used on a global scale. Currently available across eight countries in Latin American (Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Paraguay), the company is now targeting new territories. ""Our ambition is to be present in 30 countries by 2030,"" concludes Erica Pagano. For 2022, Hinode Group forecasts a turnover of 1.9 billion reais (about USD 397.8 million or EUR 371 million)."
LVMH eyes India's burgeoning beauty market with investment in Sugar Cosmetics,"Sugar Cosmetics, a cult favourite beauty brands amongst Gen Z and Millennial consumers in India, and one of the country's largest beauty companies, has closed USD 50 million Series D fundraise led by the Asia fund of L Catterton. ""The upsized round saw strong interest from multiple private equity funds with continued participation from existing investors - A91 Partners, Elevation Capital, and India Quotient - firmly placing the company on track to further capitalize on its growth momentum in the rapidly expanding beauty and personal care market in India,"" said L Catterton, a global private equity firm part-owned by LVMH, in a statement. Sugar Cosmetics offers an extensive portfolio of beauty products across the lips, eyes, face, nails and skin categories and has more than quadrupled sales over the past three years. Products are sourced from suppliers in Germany, Italy, India, USA and Korea, and are sold online and through a network of 40,000 retail outlets across 550 Indian cities. ""The company's effective use of new-age, impact-focused content marketing has helped it develop lasting emotional connections with a diverse range of consumer cohorts,"" highlighted L Catterton. L Catterton, which is mostly focused on middle market companies and emerging high-growth enterprises, intends to build on their strategic relationship with LVMH to help Sugar Cosmetics to embark on their next stage of growth amid the expansion of India's beauty and personal care market. L Catterton has significant experience investing globally in the beauty and personal care industry. Their current and past investments in the space include Il Makiage, Intercos, The Honest Company, Tula, Bliss, CI Flavors, Elemis, Etvos, Function of Beauty, Marubi, Merit, and Sociolla, among others. ""The move comes at a time when the Indian cosmetics and toiletries market is at an inflection point,"" commented Bobby Verghese, Consumer Analyst at GlobalData. Driven by consumers who are increasingly making cosmetics and skincare a part of their daily repertoire and experimenting with different types of products, India's beauty and personal care market has expanded considerably over the past five years. Rising adoption of online shopping and greater product penetration in secondary cities are also contributing to the market's enlargement. According to GlobalData, sales of beauty products grew by 5.6% CAGR [1] during 2015-2020, with value sales rising from US 11.1 billion in 2015 to USD 14.6 billion in 2020, when COVID-19 arrived. With the pandemic restrictions easing gradually, GlobalData forecasts the cosmetics and toiletries sales in India to grow by 7.2% CAGR over 2020-2025 to reach USD 20.6 billion in 2025. ""Startups such as Sugar Cosmetics and Nykaa are well positioned to tap the fast-paced growth in online beauty retail through their mastery of the omnichannel distribution model,"" conluded Verghese."
SoPost seeks to adapt sampling campaigns to each market specificities,"Campaigns powered by SoPost are integrated to brands' communication environments through a multitude of digital channels, like social media, EDMs, influencers, the SoPost testing community – and there are also several integration possibilities on websites. Every targeted consumer is invited to interact with the SoPost form by providing their contact details and consent in a 100% customized brand world. ""Once the product has been received and tested, every consumer is invited to share their feedback. We suggest leaving a comment and note, or they can fill in a questionnaire that is tailor-made with the brand to get both quantitative and qualitative insights. The campaign is part of a communication journey with consumers, before, during, and after product testing,"" explains Hélène Tournesac, Director of SoPost partnerships in France. The solution also guarantees a last step involving a redirection to the website, e-shop, or retailer web page in order to invite consumers to purchase the real size product. All data collected by SoPost belong to the brand. SoPost only takes care of collection and processing matters. ""There are two types of data. When the contact details required for shipping are provided, the brand also offers consumers an opt-in option. If they agree, their personal data will later be used by the brand for marketing communication/CRM purposes. This consent is optional, but we have found out that on average, almost 50% of the people who order the sample give their consent,"" says the Director. ""We do not collect data indirectly: we always work with voluntary declarative data and never use behavioural or contextual data. SoPost's positioning has always involved absolute transparency with consumers in perfect line with the regulations in force,"" adds Hélène Tournesac. The solution is actually adapted to regulatory constraints, which vary from one market to another. ""In Germany, for example, double consent is mandatory. The form includes a first consent, and then we send an email to consumers for them to confirm they agree to provide the brand with their contact details,"" explains Hélène Tournesac. Founded in Newcastle ten years ago, the company is now expanding outside its main markets, the UK and the US, to focus on new European and global territories, including France and Germany – they have worked on it for almost a year – and even Australia, where an office will soon open. By setting up local teams, SoPost aims to better stick to each country's own cultural features and to the various regulatory constraints on data management and routing in order to ensure execution optimization. ""It is important to adapt to local cultures, in particular to language, and to be familiar with every country's legal framework. Each feature requires a perfectly adapted digital solution. As for routing, by developing close relationships with our local logistics centres, we get familiar with regulations on packaging, labelling, and shipping. It is essential, because there are different prerequisites when it comes to shipping samples. Lastly, our strength lies in our ability to be operational on multiple markets, so we can coordinate and harmonize operations for the same brand on the global level,"" says the Director. As such, the SoPost e-sampling solution helps fulfil several brand objectives: implement a global marketing strategy, exert influence on the brand's reputation, develop an audience, increase sales, and collect data for marketing purposes. ""We help our customers choose and activate the digital environments best-adapted to their own strategy to target relevant audiences depending on their communication plans and objectives. Our solution offers a sampling journey from A to Z, both online and offline. We aim to create a rich, flawless consumer experience. With our solution, we mainly work on targeted sample distribution, so we streamline volumes and distribution, but we also set up the journey and collect feedback. Targeted sampling has become crucial for brands,"" concludes Hélène Tournesac."
Amyi offers an educational olfactory journey to Brazil's fragrance lovers,"""Brazilians are passionate about perfume. Our country is the second largest market in the world by value and the first by volume, with consumption in litres per capita almost three times higher than that of France. Despite this, we are still lagging behind in terms of innovation and consumers have a poor knowledge of olfactory journeys, ingredients and essences. We want to contribute to the education of Brazilians in the field of perfumery,"" explains Luciana Guidi. For consumers, choosing a new perfume is a real challenge, and not only in the case of online purchases. ""Who has never regretted its purchase after having discovered that the initial scent of a fragrance had completely changed half an hour after testing it in store? It's because we didn't have time to understand how the perfume evolves. The top notes evaporate very quickly and the fragrance that will come with us for the rest of the day is not the one that was smelled at the time of purchase,"" explains Larissa Mota. To facilitate the choice, the two co-founders have created an online platform that assist and educate consumers. As a first step: customers have to answer a questionnaire on their preferences, their profile and behaviour. Based on these answers, an artificial intelligence then suggests a trial kit consisting of 7 ml miniatures, test strips and online access for a training session to finalize the choice of the perfume. The next step takes place once the samples have been received and tested by the customer. It is necessary to reconnect to the platform, where additional information on the perfumes is available, with videos of perfumers explaining how they chose the ingredients, and much more. To facilitate understanding, Amyi fragrances are associated with colours, textures, sounds and memories. ""We help consumers identify the ingredients and the olfactory paths that they like or not,"" explains Luciana Guidi. Once the perfume has been chosen, it is sent at home in a 100 ml version. ""We seek not only to innovate in the way of choosing and selling perfumes in Brazil, but also to transform the market itself. This is just the beginning. We will continue to help Brazilians get to know perfumery better so that we can create truly personalized fragrances for each of our consumers, with the help of artificial intelligence,"" emphasizes Luciana Guidi. The perfumes are designed by Brazilian perfumers from major international houses, such as Givaudan, Takasago or Symrise, but with great creative freedom. ""We firmly believe in the potential of Brazilian perfumers,"" says Amyi co-founder. ""There are few perfumers in the world, but 20% of them are in Brazil. We want to give visibility to these great artists and make Brazilian perfumery a global reference in terms of trends,"" she adds. Amyi's fragrances are gender neutral, vegan and made with ingredients that are not common in Brazil, such as Egyptian jasmine absolute, aged oud wood, rhubarb and black iris. The Brazilian DNVB raised around BRL 400,000 from private investors for its launch in 2019. In 2020, it received an additional investment of BRL 1 million, which enabled them to expand their product range. Launched as a 100% online business, which has been successful so far, the brand plans to meet new consumers by opening a kiosk in a shopping centre in São Paulo. ""We believe in diversifying sales channels to reach more people, but we will only take this step if we manage to transpose the educational and sensory concept of Amyi into a physical point of sale. We are not a usual perfumery brand"", concludes Luciana Guidi."
MakeUp in Paris prepares the return of beauty innovation,"After a successful 2021 edition in October, MakeUp in Paris expects to welcome more than 150 exhibitors and 4000 visitors to resume business and innovation as usual. Once again, the event will gather suppliers of ingredients, formulation, packaging, accessories, full service and digital solutions and devices. ""The pandemic has disrupted the trade show business, but the beauty industry, more than any other sector, needs a real trade show with face-to-face contact.

Womaness becomes first menopause brand to enter Ulta Beauty,"Womaness is entering select Ulta Beauty stores and online as part of The Wellness Shop - a curated offering of self-care and wellness products for the mind, body, and spirit. The partnership provides retail access and visibility to items that cater specifically to the needs of the 40+ woman. The brand was co-founded in 2021 by Sally Mueller and Michelle Jacobs, born out of the desire to speak to and serve the 50+ million women approaching or in menopause, and dealing with the most common symptoms, from hot flashes and sleep issues, to light leakage and fine lines. ""Our mission from day one has been to change the conversation around menopause and the women experiencing it,"" said Womaness co-founder and COO Michelle Jacobs. ""We want to be the first brand women think of when they think of menopause, offering them a collection of innovative products that address the most common (and often taboo) symptoms."" ""We're thrilled to be offering Womaness solutions to the Ulta Beauty guest,"" continues Womaness co-founder and CEO Sally Mueller. ""We're here to make it easier for women in menopause to shop in the places they love to find the products they need to feel unstoppable.

Aircos lends its powder expertise on skin and personal care applications,"Aircos, the French leading developer and manufacturer of powder cosmetics, continues to diversify its offer. After having launched a range of cleansing and exfoliating powders in 2020, the company seized the opportunity of the Clean Beauty in London trade show to introduce its BeautyTabs technological platform for environmentally friendly products. Since they facilitate the reuse of primary containers, these compressed powders are in line with the current quest for plastic packaging reduction. They are perfectly suited to the creation of refillable cosmetic concepts. ""With the BeautyTabs technology, Aircos promotes product reuse and a reduced dependency on plastic, with no discarded packaging, no water transport, and a refillable, multi-use product,"" said the company in a statement. In practical terms, the consumer inserts the tablet into a designated refillable bottle and adds water to the marked line. Then, he just has to let the formulation dissolve and to mix it to get a ready-to-use product. Compressed powders make it possible to create on-the-go products, suitable for many uses, and requiring very few packaging material, while maintaining the sensory experience and efficiency associated with aqueous formulas. With this 100% 'Made In France' technology, Aircos offers ""clean"" formulas that are talc-free and silicone-free. As of now, Aircos offers its customers a line of fully customized personal care formula made of up to 99.7% natural ingredients and COSMOS certifiable. Furthermore, the company is currently working on skin care formulations to complete its offer. They are expected to be available in the coming months. ""Today, the cosmetics industry is facing an ongoing challenge to meet both environmental challenges and consumer expectations. They are ready to rethink their consumption habits and adopt zero waste approaches that take into account the product's packaging, its reuse, and the impact of its water consumption and transportation. On average, a conventional shower gel is composed of 80% water, most often in disposable plastic packaging. With BeautyTabs compressed dissolvable powders, the rules have been rewritten so that consumers can reassemble their product in a fun and eco-friendly way,"" highlights the Anjac Group subsidiary. With the BeautyTabs technology, Aircos is strengthening its investment, development, and innovation strategy through solutions that combine eco-responsibility and efficiency."
"""Nail polish is more natural, safe, and efficient,"" Pierre Miasnik, Fiabila","If the pandemic boosted the demand for nail polish, it also sped up pre-existing trends, including for this category: naturalness, removal of controversial ingredients, search for performance… ""Over the past ten years, there has been an unprecedented technological mutation in the nail polish sector,"" explains Pierre Miasnik, CEO of Fiabila, one of the industry's leaders. And the French company has largely contributed to it! As monomer-based gel formulas are being marketed, although their use is not completely safe, Fiabila has chosen to innovate by offering alternative solutions adapted to consumer expectations. ""We are working on several technologies adapted to the different market segments. But, whatever the technical choice, we always offer high-quality, 100% vegan formulas produced in plants that comply with the strictest quality and environmental protection norms,"" adds the CEO, ""to offer ever-more natural, safe, and efficient products."" All these technologies and innovations will be showcased in Bologna, Italy, at the next Cosmopack show, where Fiabila will display a collection of conventional nail polish, i.e. all nail polish products based on the formation of a film by solvent evaporation. Today, these products are divided into two large categories: traditional petro-sourced formulas, and biosourced formulas, which are increasingly popular among brands and consumers. ""Today, we can reach levels as high as 90% of biosourced raw materials with highly satisfactory quality. All our formulas are tested on panels and their levels of performance (lasting results, drying, shininess, etc.) are perfectly calibrated,"" adds Pierre Miasnik. Beyond that, more recently, Fiabila re-deployed the technology of reactive or hybrid formulas, which consists in adapting conventional formulas for a hybrid use of nail polish – hence its name. Such formulas contain an oligomer which provides them with additional properties. The application is the same as with conventional nail polish: the film forms after the evaporation of solvents and when the oligomer physically dries. Then, an overlayer is applied to make the film polymerize: in the presence of UV rays (natural light or LED lamp), the nail polish hardens and become even shinier. ""The result is truly exceptional, the nail polish is shiny and lasts eight days,"" emphasizes Pierre Miasnik. Fiabila has patented two oligomers for these hybrid formulas. As a complement, the Salon Prodigy technology is composed of formulas reactive under LED lamps designed to compete with gel formulas containing monomers. The use of oligomers instead of monomers prevents the formation of an occlusive film particularly difficult to remove. If it lasts a bit less long, the product is much healthier for nails! Besides these two large families, Fiabila offers solvent-free water-based nail polish. There is a range for children, which can be removed with water and soap, and a range for adults, which is removed with a nail polish remover. Lastly, Fiabila boasts two recent innovations: the Do Not Disturb technology, which offers almost odourless formulas much praised in Asia, and a range of ecodesigned nail polish with recycled solvents retrieved during the company's manufacturing process, so that purity levels can be guaranteed. All these solutions help meet market expectations related to naturalness and performance! And since, on all segments, safety remains the main concern, Fiabila developed several methods to limit the eventual formation of nitrosamines in formulas. This has become a hot topic, in particular in Switzerland, Germany, and Austria, where rules have been tightened as regards this issue. According to the company, by removing particular clay types, bentonites, and using inhibitors, under certain conditions, the presence of these substances can be divided by ten. A patent was registered for this technology. From an industrial standpoint, Fiabila has kept investing, so the company now boasts sufficient capacities to keep up with a global market boom. As an example, the group has just opened a new filling site in Poland. The 8,000-m2 plant has been operational since early April: it is equipped with automated lines, cutting-edge equipment identical to that of the group's other units, and technicians trained in France for three years. Always seeking optimum quality, Fiabila has also just finished restoring the pigment crushing unit of its plant located in Maintenon, in the south-west of Paris. The new technology implemented significantly minimizes the risk of pigment air contamination. As a matter of fact, for the second year in a row, the site has obtained the EcoVadis Platinum certification for CSR. Fiabila is working to have this level of performance recognized for all its units around the world with more global labels."
"Start-up: Eclo, a unique, virtuous cosmetics concept","After twelve years spent in a cosmetics multinational company as a makeup product development manager, Priscille Charton wanted to give life to her own idea of more responsible cosmetics. ""Day after day, I increasingly felt like applying eco-design to product innovation. The offering of clean makeup is limited, because the market is less mature than clean skincare: things are technically more complex. I was aware of the urgency to innovate differently in this field,"" says Priscille Charton, co-founder of Eclo with Julien Callède and Marin Susac. Together, they created a makeup brand ""not to make beauty rhyme with guilty"". ""I wanted efficient formulas that would satisfy consumers' senses, but with zero ecotoxicity. So, both the formulas and packaging needed to be biodegradable,"" adds the founder. In fact, the formulas designed to be applied with the finger are packed in Finnish startup Sulapac's small, fully biodegradable round jars. The cap's colour helps identify the product family: four lipsticks, red and pink with universal shades; three blushes, peach, bronze, and pink; and four highly mineral, nature-inspired eye shadow shades. A concealing foundation range should come out next fall, as well as a mascara. All products are Cosmos-Organic-certified and 100% of natural origin, made from vegetable wax and mineral pigments. They are made in Brittany, in the Rance Bay, in the Western part of France. The Eclo concept goes beyond formula and packaging naturalness. It is based on regenerative farming, which preserves the quality of farming soils by protecting living organisms. ""We worked with the association called Pour une Agriculture du Vivant to set up a list of raw materials that were good for both the skin and soils,"" explains Priscille Charton. Three ingredients were selected for the first range. Hemp from Brittany provides eye shadow formulas with soothing and moisturizing benefits. Also, it cleans up soils by absorbing toxins and heavy metals, and it resists climatic variations without requiring much water. Rye is used in blushes to confer a natural healthy look. ""This plant boasts kilometres of roots abundant with biodiversity. It is a habitat for living organisms: worms, mushrooms, rodents… It creates regenerated soils on which anything that grows is richer in nutrients and more nourishing,"" says Priscille Charton. As for lipsticks, algae from the Rance Bay (in Brittany) were chosen for their smoothing, plumping properties. ""They represent an essential part of the marine ecosystem. We ensure their preservation with reasonable, reasoned cultures,"" explains the founder. The partnership with the association Agriculture Pour le Vivant is also aimed to educate the cosmetics industry as regards the use of this type of ingredients. ""It is a brand new concept with which our industry is not familiar. We are the first members of this association to be part of the cosmetics sector. We are leading the way. We mean to state that if one uses natural raw materials in their formulas, they should have grown in a sustainable manner, by giving the land its full powers back. To this aim, we need to educate not only ingredient suppliers, but also producers, so they consider supplying the cosmetics industry, not just the food industry. It works both ways,"" explains Priscille Charton. In addition, Eclo is a partner of 1% For The Planet, so they give part of their turnover to an association which helps preserve the environment. At the end of the ongoing crowdfunding campaign, the products will be available online on the brand's e-shop, and then in concept stores. ""We have already received a lot of business requests, because our concept is innovative. It all goes so fast,"" concludes the founder."
La Compagnie de Provence banks on skincare and gets global,"Launched by two friends determined to modernize the use of Savon de Marseille, La Compagnie de Provence soon got the public success expected. A brand of the Ganassini group since 2013, the company now boasts a range of 180 references, counts 1,000 points of sale in France, and exports products in about 40 countries. ""I joined La Compagnie de Provence six years ago with one mission: it consisted in repositioning the brand, ensuring it was in line with market trends and consumer expectations,"" explains Guillaume Cornu Thénard. Building on the dermocosmetics expertise of the Ganassini group, La Compagnie de Provence managed to broaden its offering with a substantial face & body care range. ""We created collections with shea butter for the sake of its nourishing virtues, and with velvet algae for its moisturizing benefits. More recently, our holistic apothecary collection combined vegetable and essential oils, and we also have an anti-ageing line with antioxidant fig. We always make a clear, very simple promise, so consumers immediately understand what they buy. This is part of our brand's codes – we used to write Savon Liquide Marseille in big capital letters on our bottles,"" says Guillaume Cornu Thénard. Today, liquid soap still accounts for 46% of the turnover. It is the entry and discovery point for the brand, but in just a few years, face care and body care have reached a 10% and 30% share, respectively. Home product references (candles, dispensers, cleaning products) complete the picture. The formulas are composed of at least 95% of ingredients of natural origin. Flagship ingredients are mainly derived from short distribution channels in Provence, and the primary packaging is made from glass or rPET. All inks are plant-derived. ""We made a significant investment and recruited a person in charge of our CSR policy. All the objectives defined by the UN were fulfilled, and this year, we will mainly focus on life quality at work, bearing in mind that the company employs about 40 people. Then, our second target will have to do with packaging to make sure we use as little plastic as possible. Our last priority will be our carbon footprint. All this shows how committed we must be, and we will publish our results at the end of the year,"" explains Guillaume Cornu Thénard. As it plans to achie a 7.3-million-euro turnover this year, with an annual growth rate of 10%, the brand keeps developing in France: it will boast about 1,000 points of sale by the end of the year, mainly in the perfume world – at Sephora's and Marionnaud's –, which will represent 300 of them by late 2022. Pharmacies make up the second network, and concept stores, the third. ""We have also defined two other priorities: digital technologies, with our e-shop, which represents more than 10% of our turnover, and wholly-owned stores, because they are crucial in terms of consumer experience. All this helps understand the specificity of our brand, between modernity and tradition,"" adds the General Manager. The brand counts seven wholly-owned stores mainly located in southern France. No further openings are scheduled this year, but the Marseille shop should be redesigned to house an organic coffee shop, a wall of ingredients and, more importantly, a refill fountain. This concept has already been implemented at Galeries Lafayette and in the headquarters store in Aix-en-Provence. Export accounts for 65% of the company's turnover, with a presence in about 40 countries, in particular in department stores (Europe, North America, Argentina, Asia, and Oceania). ""The brand quickly managed to establish itself abroad, because people all around the world have a passion for traditional as well as contemporary Provence. This is what makes La Compagnie de Provence unique: we talk a lot about lavender and olive trees, but we equally highlight La Cité Radieuse by Le Corbusier, the LUMA tower, the Mucem, the Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilizations, impressionism… Over the past few years, new cultural and architectural dynamics in Provence have perfectly echoed our brand's initial positioning,"" concludes Guillaume Cornu Thénard."
"Mane creates a consumers research lab for perfumes in São Paulo, Brazil","Dubbed Casa do Consumidor (House of the Consumer) the new area is designed to recreate the real situations in which consumer products are used. It includes: blind test rooms, a beauty salon, shower cabins, a bathroom with a camera and even a miniature railway, where a locomotive runs to measure the a perfume's sillage. ""In order to better develop our perfumes and aromas, we seek to listen to the consumer from the start of the development process, our aim is to be able to deliver products that meet the needs and expectations of our customers. By testing the creations with the final consumer at each stage, we can be more precise in our proposals,"" explains Alexandra Frenkiel, Head of Market Research and Consumer Insights at Mane. The company already has testing facilities in many countries, but the majority only hosts the company's teams. However, Mane's premises in New Jersey, United States, are the only ones to feature a space intended to host consumers, as the one recently created in Brazil. According to Alexandra Frenkiel, Mane's goal is to respond more quickly and precisely to the demands of its customers, helping them to launch on the market products that will meet consumer expectations. Present in around forty countries, Mane sees in Brazil a ""significant and priority growth potential for the group"". Perfumery represents 60% of the company's turnover in the country, compared to 35% worldwide. Mane, whose industrial headquarters are in Rio de Janeiro, also plans to open a new factory in Brazil. The kickstart of the works, initially planned for 2016, has however been postponed, ""given the macroeconomic context"". However, a new study should be launched soon for the construction of a manufacturing unit in the municipality of Jundiaí, in the state of São Paulo. ""With the aim to put it into service in the first quarter of 2024"", indicates Alexandra Frenkiel."
Into the Metaverse - The future of beauty retail and customer experience,"The pandemic has fundamentally changed the way we live, work, and interact. With heightened restrictions, lockdowns, and social distancing rules halting many in-person activities, consumers have increasingly moved toward online channels, and companies have responded in turn. The adoption of digital products and services in the past two years has taken off at a rapid pace, with a McKinsey Global Survey of executives citing that companies have accelerated the digitization of their customer and supply chain interactions and of their internal operations by three to four years. As consumers spend more time on their connected devices and detract from real-world connections, they are craving deeper social interaction. For consumers, this highly immersive virtual world is a place where they can come together to play, work, and live unique experiences, allowing for new ways of engagement and socialization. For brands and retailers, the Metaverse offers opportunities to transform their digital presence by making it more fun, informative, and interactive for end users. It is an expansion of the traditional brick-and-mortar store experience and an addition to the omnichannel journey – a marketing and sales channel that enables the engagement of potential customers at all stages of the purchase journey with no physical boundaries. Looking at the Metaverse through the lens of beauty, AR try-ons and virtual shopping are just some examples of how consumers are already interacting with brands and retailers in this virtual world. In an increasingly digital-first environment that rewards short attention spans, it is more important now than ever for brands to find smart and meaningful ways to connect with consumers at every touch point. As a provider of digital solutions for offline and online consumer experiences, Meiyume understands consumer behaviour and is well equipped to help beauty brands enter this new space. ""With people now greeted daily by massive streams of information, marketers must understand what their consumers want and successfully harness the right platforms in today's omnichannel climate to establish deeper connection and brand affinity. We have seen that most consumers are multi-channel customers that use a mixture of human and digital interactions to get what they need from discovery to engagement to product transactions. As a new touchpoint, the Metaverse presents opportunities to reimagine the future of consumer engagement and Meiyume is excited to work with brands to enter this space. Our retail and technology solutions can help beauty companies of all sizes develop interactive digital experiences that can be integrated into consumers' everyday virtual lives, helping brands connect with their audience more intimately through a seamless product discovery and shopping journey,"" said Steve Dodd, Head of Technology and SVP Retail Solutions at Meiyume. In entering the exciting world of the Metaverse, Meiyume has launched their first NFT art, designed to embody the company's brand personality and philosophy of continuous innovation in creating future-focused products and solutions. The NFT is now on sale, where all proceeds will go to the charity One Tree Planted, a non-profit organization focused on global reforestation."
"Symex Mixing Technologies celebrates 25th anniversary, aims for global expansion","Founded in 1997, Symex Mixing Technologies [1] has become the reference in mixing and homogenizing technologies for the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. ""We provide high-end equipment to companies that need state-of-the-art technologies for manufacturing products with a high level of quality and we support our customers wherever they are located around the world,"" explains Ulf Sieckmann, CEO of the company. The leading names of the cosmetics industry are among the customers of the German company — including L'Oréal, Henkel, Estée Lauder, Dior, etc. — who are interested in its patented technologies allowing full control of the industrial process of mixing and homogenizing cosmetic formulas. ""Our technologies include traditional agitation systems, coaxial agitators, rotor-stator homogenisers, as well as rotor-rotor homogenisers - Co-Twister-, and temperature control systems, that allows to perfectly control all the manufacturing parameters and product properties including the size of droplets and particles in the emulsions,"" Sieckmann adds. Fully automated, Symex equipment also allows to save significant time during the maintenance and cleaning stages, and offers high flexibility since it can process batches from 10% to 100% of its capacity, with complete reproducibility. Furthermore, sustainability in terms of energy and resources savings are another key advantage of Symex technologies. Cleaning is made place not only faster, but with less water and detergent consumption means also less waste water. A large variety of products, such as skincare creams, sun protection, shampoos, toothpastes, lipsticks, make-up, mascaras and ointments, are currently manufactured around the world using Symex's equipment. ""Our systems can be used whenever there is a need to mix ingredients. The higher the viscosity is the more useful our equipment is,"" explains Ulf Sieckmann. Continuously and steadily growing, the company doubled the manufacturing capacity at the end of last year by adding another 2,000 sqm premises including a manufacturing facility and a large office building next to the site built in 2008, for a total investment of around six million euros. Just in time for the largest contract in the company's history, a 25 million euro order for Japan! The company, which currently employs about 160 staffs, aims to continue expanding globally with ""all companies interested in having access to the same level of quality that already Symex provides to industry leaders."" The company has also adapted its technology to dry mixing with a patented rotor-rotor dispersion technology, for all the formulations that do not contain waters, in particular powders for colour cosmetics."
Maison 21G closes series A and expands footprint in Asia,"With a unique O2O (online to offline) bespoke business model, Maison 21G has become the number four brand in perfumery in Singapore; placing the brand just after Chanel, Christian Dior and Jo Malone. The company has achieved this milestone with only three outlets and a unique retail experience with its ""Ateliers"" (private perfumery workshops). Founded in 2020 by Johanna Monange with the aim to disrupt the fragrance industry and break convention by putting the customers in direct contact with Haute Couture natural essences, Maison 21G has achieved USD 3 million of revenue in 2021. Further down the road this year, Maison 21G aims to simplify its bespoke offer to work with e-commerce partners like Amazon, Lazada, and other distributors to increase its reach. Maison 21G has signed a partnership with Human Wellness, a distributor in Korea, to open a flagship store in Gangnam along with a private atelier space in their luxury Spa. ""I believe that within three years, our partners in this market will put the brand solidly in the top of luxury perfume brands . Korea is famous for being one of the toughest markets of Asia… but a major trendsetter from which the whole world of beauty takes its cue,"" said Johanna Monange. The brand also plans to launch in China in 2022. ""Our arrival in China is set to be our biggest challenge. I know my proof of concept in Singapore will be a huge help, but we need to deploy in a very professional way, while not trying to go too fast. We are finalising a huge contract with Eternal Optical Far East, one of the oldest and most famous players in the Chinese perfume industry. Steven Lau was among the first to invest in perfumery and he has stuck to his beliefs from the very beginning. He has various luxury brands like Hermes and Bulgari who believe in his quality of work in retail, and I fell in love with his vice president, Chole, a fantastic woman, empowered, kind and full of energy,"" added Monange. In the Middle East, Maison 21G has signed a distribution agreement with Chalhoub group. The new capital will also enable the company to extend its leadership team. ""I am hugely proud to announce the arrival of Jacques Gouallou at my side as General Manager of Maison 21G. Jacques was the president of Benefit in Asia and has more than 20 years' experience in the luxury industries, working with both LVMH and L'Oréal. Jacques will be the catalyst of our ideas and will also attract more skills and talents with his charismatic presence at Maison 21G. It is no exaggeration to say that this is a game-changing talent acquisition for me and my team,"" concluded Monange."
Diffulice provides industrial filling in white room,"Initially developed for Body'Minute's private brand products, the Diffulice packaging centre set up by Jean-Christophe David, the founder of the beauty salon network, offers both Swiss and global brands a secured industrial tool. Diffulice provides filling & capping services for jars, bottles and tubes in compliance with hygiene procedures for white rooms. ""We have a very high level of requirement as regards air quality, processes, and machinery. Not many subcontractors offer cosmetics packaging in a white room: it is the poor relation to subcontracting, and yet it is essential. In Switzerland, 80% of cream manufacturing is carried out in a white room; packaging is an asset,"" says Jean-Christophe David. In addition, Swiss brands will be able to get the Swisscos origin certification which requires that all manufacturing phases be carried out in Switzerland. Recent installations and production lines are designed for filling any product series, from primary to secondary packaging, and from storage to transport."

"New formulas, new packaging: Caudalie reinforces sustainable commitment","Premium Beauty News - Caudalie has always positioned itself as natural, but as soon as 2006, you went farther, creating a formulation charter to ban several controversial ingredients. What does this approach represent? Angélique Mahot - All our skincare products are created in France in our Natural Formulation Laboratory of the Cosmetic Valley. Every day, our team of formulators surpasses itself to create a new generation of highly natural skincare. The Caudalie products comply with a very strict naturalness charter called Cosm'éthique, which is updated every year for ever-more reasoned and committed cosmetics. In 2006, six substances were removed from our formulas – they were considered as potential endocrine disruptors or they were irritant, derived from petrochemistry, or from ingredients of animal origin – for the benefit of natural ingredients. We have now banned 60, including phthalates, mineral oils, parabens, phenoxyethanol, and sodium laureth sulfate, silicones, PEGs and microplastics. The vast majority of our skincare products are vegan and free from ingredients of animal origin – except for honey and beeswax. Since 2020, we have also undertaken to offer only formulas with at least 95% of ingredients of natural origin (except sun products and Eaux Fraîches) for even more transparency for our consumers. Premium Beauty News - The Clean Beauty market has changed a lot. How is the brand positioned today? Angélique Mahot - The health crisis confirmed what we believed from the very beginning: the future belongs to brands that try to produce sustainable products. Today, being clean is essential. And we were clean much before it became a trend. But today we need to go much farther. Most of our products are based on patented, innovative ingredients developed in partnership with the best research laboratories specialized in anti-ageing, like the Harvard Medical School and Dr David Sinclair, with whom we have worked for 10 years. Premium Beauty News - Have you also revamped your packaging? Angélique Mahot - In 2020, we undertook to change all our packaging so it could be refillable, recycled and/or recyclable. Between 2019 and 2020, we reduced our annual plastic waste by 44.33 tonnes. It represents 1,385,312 1.5-L bottles of water. Our clean commitments go beyond this: we are partners of 1% for the Planet, so over the past ten years, we have given 1% of our turnover to associations that plant trees. At the end of the year, the brand will have planted 10 million! We are the main donor for 1% for the Planet in the French cosmetics industry, and we hope other companies will draw inspiration from us and join the movement. Lastly, in 2020, we created the 100% Plastic Collect programme with Tristan Lecomte. In Thailand, we collect the equivalent of our annual plastic production so it is recycled locally and reused by the local population."
"Harmay, the Chinese company that appeals to investors and beauty enthusiasts","Since opening a first store in 2017, Harmay has sold small-sized products of Chinese and global brands for less than 100 yuans (14 euros). Thanks to an in-house architecture design team, it now owns nine stores in China and counts over 400 employees. ""The main reason why capital invests in Harmay is that they have the recipe to attract consumers and especially the GenZ generation,"" explains Juliette Duveau, co-founder of consulting agency The Chinese Pulse. She also says that ""samples should account for a big part of their total sales"", but that ""some consumers will still buy normal size in Harmay because it is a convenient shopping destination for them to collect all the products they want, and they will also pay for the immersive, cool experience to reshare"". The brand does everything it can on social media to pass on the message that store visits are designed to be the most memorable possible. Every Harmay store has its own aesthetic, artistic, and friendly world where buyers can stroll (no shop assistant to help) and even have something to eat. ""Harmay offers a coffee space in the ground floor of its Anfu Rd store, they just created their own drink brand @introlemons in 2022,"" adds Juliette Duveau. Harmay stores are also contemporary art places. ""In addition to co-curating with artists, Harmay also officially launched a support plan for emerging artists, although the exhibition itself is not aiming at generating direct sales, but consumers are more willing to visit and consume in spaces with aesthetic identity"", analyzes Juliette Duveau. The company has announced the funds raised would be used to develop in new categories, strengthen its digital presence with its own application, broaden its brand portfolio, and open stores in Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. Last November, Harmay purchased American makeup brand Kevyn Aucoin. Harmay also stands out with its multiple partnerships and events with high-profile brands like Maison Margiela or Japanese high-end cosmetics brand BAUM, ""as Chinese young generation wants to discover more niche and unique brands,"" says Juliette Duveau. Harmay recently set up a partnership with Swiss company Firmenich specialized in fragrance and aroma creation to assert itself on the booming Chinese perfume market. According to Euromonitor data, the annual growth rate of this market should reach 22.5% over the next five years. By 2025, perfume sales in China should reach 4.7 billion dollars. ""This agreement makes sense, as China is going to be the second biggest fragrance market worldwide"", emphasizes Juliette Duveau. ""Chinese young consumers are changing and evolving quickly. Harmay, as a giant multi-brand beauty retailer rooted in China, has a rich knowledge about the local beauty market and young consumers' preferences in terms of lifestyle and shopping habits. Those assets can help Firmenich to understand better and adapt smartly to the consumers today."" The Chinese media have noticed the emergence of this ""sample economy"", a sign that young people are changing the way they consume cosmetics. But they also highlight the absence of regulations on this market, as there are doubts about the origin and authenticity of the samples. Harmay is pointed at for not providing precise information about its supplier chain. ""The Harmay critics are mainly relying on its initial business model, which can be considered as a kind of 'grey' market. Harmay based its initial business model on selling brands' samples online or by distributing some international brands' products in a not always 'official' way,"" deciphers Juliette Duveau. However, the expert considers ""the switch it operated over the past months in immersive and conceptual retail extension over China contributes to change this image."""
"""Our line of business must find its place in a desirable future"", Mustela","Premium Beauty News - How is the Mustela brand perceived today? Sophie Robert-Velut - The brand was created in 1950 and has a genuine legacy in terms of recognition and reputation. Both in France and in the countries where we are present. The brand was launched to care for the skin of newborns, with this idea that still drives us today: to be at the side of parents to believe that tomorrow's world can be a better place. The present must not compromise the future, so our manufacturing activity for children and the family must find its place in a desirable future and guarantee a radically lighter footprint. Premium Beauty News - What are your objectives in terms of brand positioning? Sophie Robert-Velut - To move from the baby care category to a more family-oriented positioning. In our markets, the trend is to consume less but better. There is also a desire on the part of parents, once they have found a brand they like, not only for what it has to offer but also for its societal commitments, to keep using it over a longer period of time and more broadly for all the family members. We are therefore expanding some of our categories, for example, our products for atopic eczema or sun care. Mustela's organic range, launched at the end of 2019, was initially more positioned as a baby care range, but given that parents have also adopted it, these products are now positioned as family care products. We recently launched our Multi-purpose balm with 3 organic certified avocado extracts, a product for the whole family. I don't want to over-segment our offer with products only intended for adults. We must not create confusion, our aim is really to cater for the whole family. Premium Beauty News - You have embarked the Mustela brand on a relevant CSR strategy and Laboratoires Expanscience is also B Corp certified, so what concrete actions have you put in place? Sophie Robert-Velut - With this new CSR strategy, our ambition is to become a company with a positive and regenerative impact by 2040. This covers many aspects. We have set ourselves the following objectives: firstly, zero waste by this deadline and, secondly, to contribute to global carbon neutrality by 2030. This commitment includes being in a position to refuse the packs by switching to solids, and to propose ""Reviens"", a range of refillable Mustela products, already in use in pharmacies and drugstores. With this solution, we also want to invite competing brands to join us, because this is a consumer gesture that can only become widespread if several market players are also offering it. The planet should no longer be a competitive issue. We, therefore, want to propose a zero-waste offer for each major useful gesture. For example, at least one washing product will come in a solid or refillable version, the same for atopy or normal skin products, etc. We want the consumer to always have the possibility to choose a product that is better for the planet. Regarding carbon neutrality, we are working on analysing the life cycle of our products, of our ingredients, which play the most important part in our carbon footprint, by securing their sourcing and traceability. We are also trying to increase our use of upcycled ingredients and food co-products. All our portfolio adjustments are moving towards organic or an even higher level of naturalness. Premium Beauty News - And in terms of innovation? Sophie Robert-Velut - Rather than talking about innovation, we prefer to work on the usefulness of the products we put on the market, and on correcting the negative environmental impact of our activity. This goes beyond removing controversial ingredients from our products. It means, for example, also offering a fragrance-free range, or with lighter natural fragrances, even if the Mustela scent remains a Proust's madeleine. Premium Beauty News - What about your international footprint? Sophie Robert-Velut - We are present in about a hundred countries, with fourteen subsidiaries around the world, in the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, Russia, and also a Chinese subsidiary, which opened last summer. In this very broad geographical area, there is already a lot to do and we don't intend to open any new markets for the time being. In Europe, the brand has a strong presence, similar to France, where we have been present for decades. In other countries, Mustela is more considered as a premium brand, which is less well known, although it is progressing very quickly, but with a very qualitative and natural brand image. Our commitments are perceived by parents as being of value. Premium Beauty News - What is your take on this global strategy? Sophie Robert-Velut - Two and a half years ago, we completely revamped our brand platform and worked on a raison d'être based on the empowerment of parents, starting with a change in our communication charter, so that we would no longer talk in a way that could make parents or pregnant women feel guilty. Qualitatively, a new narrative was established. We communicate with a touch of humour and diversity, there are as many good educational systems as there are parents. Today, Mustela has again returned to growth and is gaining market shares in all the countries where the brand is present, in terms of both value and volume."
Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna prepares to reopening to the global community,"After a two-year hiatus, Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna is coming back for an in-person event that will host over 2,700 exhibiting companies, from 71 different countries. The show floor will feature 34 collective pavilions, including 26 country pavilions. ""After two years of virtual events, the business community shows great expectations and excitement for the return of the exhibition in real life"", said Gianpiero Calzolari, President of BolognaFiere. To offer a fitting program of visits and dedicated services to international operators, Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna has increased investments in the Buyer Program, a project that aims to support the participation of selected importers, distributors and wholesalers, and to organize business meetings with exhibitors. Also, the presence of Italian and European large-scale retail chains and perfumeries, as well as distributors and importers from the area of Middle-East and Gulf countries, is encouraged through special projects with media partners and trade associations. To optimize the experience at Cosmoprof and organize business meetings beforehand, Cosmoprof My Match - the digital match-making platform created by Cosmoprof - will offer live chat and virtual tools that facilitate networking between exhibitors and visitors. The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation and ITA - Italian Trade Agency - are offering their support to facilitate the presence of buyers, distributors, importers, and wholesalers from the main markets. Thanks to the funds provided for the extraordinary Made in Italy promotion plan, Cosmoprof is organizing a hospitality program and specific services for selected operators. Recently, a series of new regulatory tools have been adopted to facilitate the access of foreign buyers and exhibitors - including from non-EU countries - to Italian trade shows (more details are available on the Italian Ministry of Health website). In addition to a rich exhibition offer, Cosmoprof and Cosmopack Worldwide Bologna will also be completed by a series of special events and projects. From Thursday to Saturday, the CosmoTalks will offer operators and professionals participating in the show with exclusive conferences and seminars, with the contribution of experts from all over the world. Trend agency Beautystreams will also present its annual CosmoTrends report, analysing the proposals of the exhibitors and highlighting the most impacting trends to date and the developments to expect. Beautystreams will also curate the Cosmoprof & Cosmopack Awards project, celebrating the most innovative proposals and the beauty products with the most significant impact on consumers. In the Cosmopack section of the event, the CosmoFactory will be back too. This special project brings on the show floor the entire production process of a specific cosmetic product, from the creation of the formula to the filling in dedicated packaging solutions. The eighth edition of the project will present the creation and manufacturing process of ""Six4all"" - a multi-ethnic foundation that combines a neutral base with six shades of colours. The installation will be curated by French-based design agency Centdegrés with the participation of Pink Frogs Cosmetics for the formula of the base and the six shades of colours, Marchesini Group Beauty for the machinery, PennelliFaro with a brush designed specifically for applying the product, Scandolara for the primary packaging, an exclusive aluminium tube, Seriplast A.T. Packaging for the sample size and Gatto Astucci for the secondary packaging - a clutch designed to highlight the quality of the product. The project will involve also Stratasys with its 3D industrial technologies. ""We understand the importance of returning to the event in person. For the 2022 edition, our goal is to offer a top-quality event to stakeholders, with the most suitable services and tools to deal with the new post-pandemic scenario,"" said Enrico Zannini, General Manager of BolognaFiere Cosmoprof."
Gotha Cosmetics takes over majority stake in iColor Group to expand in China,"Gotha Cosmetics sets foot in China through a majority investment in iColor Group, a cosmetic formulation and filling company headquartered in Shanghai. Financial details were not disclosed, but the operation marks a key milestone in the international expansion of the Italian company. Created in 2005, Gotha Cosmetics produces a large variety of color cosmetics with a strong expertise in emulsions and is well known for its innovative face products and liquid lipsticks. The company has solid business background in the US and EMEA [1] Regions. With this transaction Gotha aims to accelerate its growth with local brands in China, as well as to support its current client portfolio in its expansion in Asia through local production. The acquisition will also increase Gotha's capabilities in turnkey solutions. ""Thanks to this acquisition Gotha Cosmetics will strengthen its global footprint and production capacity entering the Asian and specifically Chinese markets, which are experiencing a solid and stable growth. We think that the timing for this transaction is perfect and iColor is the right partner to serve those markets and deliver good products and service. Initial focus will be the local market expansion, keeping the current iColor set up and leveraging meanwhile our Italian expertise in cosmetics,"" said Paolo Valsecchi, CEO of Gotha Group. iColor Group provides skincare and make up formulations, product development and filling solutions to local and international brands. They define themselves as a one-stop cosmetics manufacturer that provides product designs, formula research and development, production, processing, sourcing, product record, warehousing and logistics. The company owns production facilities in Suzhou and Shanghai, with more than 40,000 sqm covered surface. The sites integrate R&D, production and filling departments and can process a wide variety of product categories including emulsions, powders and anhydrous formulas."
"Florasis, the startup that upgrades Chinese makeup","In the wake of the 'guochao' trend (国潮) which highlights Chinese brands with a strong national identity, this ""floral essence nourishing eastern makeup"" concept, as defined by the brand, is working quite well. Florasis sales are reported to have reached 3 billion yuans (420 million euros) in 2020, exceeding those of Perfect Diary, the other Chinese makeup unicorn, according to the Chinese press trying to analyze the phenomenon. The same year, on the Tmall marketplace, the Florasis and Perfect Diary (Yatsen group)market shares reached 16.35% and 14.88%, respectively, among makeup brands, according to Daxue Consulting. Most media believe the Florasis breakthrough is due to the partnership with Li Jiaqi, the live-streaming sales star influencer who achieved high scores as soon as 2018 with loose powder and carved lipstick. This close partnership is both a strength and a weakness for the brand, according to 36Kr (36氪), who think it is too dependent from it. On the other hand, the Chinese financial website emphasizes the strong presence of Florasis on all Chinese networks. Products are available on Tmall, JD.com, Vipshop, Pinduoduo, Koala, Xiaohongshu, and Kuaishou. Florasis's dynamism helped the company enter foreign markets. Tmall reports that on Singles' Day 2020, consumers from over 100 countries and regions purchased Florasis products on their platform, so that the brand became the best-selling Chinese brand on the global level, all categories included. In March 2021, Florasis arrived on Amazon Japan, where they took advantage of the local craze for ""Chinese-style makeup"", a trend the Jing Daily magazine analyses as a sign of a slowdown of Korean and Japanese cosmetics for the benefit of C-Beauty. Last year, Florasis, who sells products directly to consumers, without relying on retailers, was the best-selling beauty brand on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, according to parent company ByteDance's statistics relayed by the South China Morning Post. The newspaper held by the Alibaba group considers this recent network is still little used by global brands. In China, the Chinese press emphasizes the main difference between Florasis and Perfect Diary in terms of social media and marketing. If Perfect Diary is mainly focused on Xiaohongshu as a main basis, ahead of other platforms, thanks to beauty recommendations and tutorials posted by the first wave of users, Florasis prefers to use live-streaming selling on Taobao. That is where the main difference lies between the two brand positionings: Perfect Diary mainly targets students, urban women living in big cities and small towns, while Florasis is focused on active, cultivated women. In addition, the Florasis range is more limited than Perfect Diary's, with higher prices. The Florasis loose powder costs about 150 yuans, which ranks it between the 50 to 100 yuans of Perfect Diary and the 250 to 300 yuans of Givenchy, Nars, or Make Up Forever. The fact that Florasis is so successful shows there is an upgrade of Chinese cosmetics brands, which could gradually threaten major historically high-end global brands. The brand puts forward its ""R&D team and product development cycle, which lasts one or two years, i.e. longer than some global brands"". However, this feature could be viewed as a handicap on the super reactive, highly competitive makeup market. Also, according to a few marketing experts, another aspect might disadvantage the brand: this 100% DTC (direct-to-consumer) player does not have any physical shop to help develop their sophisticated visual and narrative world."
Roval invests in a full-service solution for bulk hygiene products,"Driven by legislation and consumer demand, bulk products are gaining ground in all hygiene and beauty distribution channels: specialised organic shops, supermarkets, pharmacies and selective channels. According to the research firm YouGov, 76% of French consumers have already bought bulk products, mostly food. Furthermore, 63% of respondents would like to have the opportunity to buy in bulk, the products of major brands that they usually buy in packs [1]. To meet this demand, Roval has been working for several months with Jean Bouteille, a French company specialising in POS liquid bulk distribution systems. The company is already supporting numerous brands and 1400 outlets, including 410 new ones in 2021, in achieving their project. As part of this collaboration, Roval has invested in a high-capacity Bag in Box (BIB) packaging line in 3-litre, 5-litre and 10-litre formats, and is offering its range of conventional, organic and natural washing products, as well as its R&D expertise, for turnkey or customised products. The aim is to offer brands and distributors a full-service bulk solution. The teams at Roval have already validated the compatibility, flow and behaviour tests of formulas at the POS with the most frequently requested product families (shower gels, shampoos). Other formulas will be tested in the coming months. Three turnkey references will be proposed. Roval's R&D teams are also available to help brands develop custom formulas adapted to this type of distribution. The BIB format proposed by Jean Bouteille and filled in by Roval Cosmétiques can be used for two types of purposes, depending on the brands' strategy and markets: – The in-store dispensing fountain: The BIB is integrated into the fountain available at the POS. The customer fills the container directly at the shop and reuses it during his next shopping trip. For a complete made in France solution, Roval proposes to use the individual reusable bottles manufactured in its Plastirève factory in Normandy. – The ""Maxi Refill"" size: This packaging is adapted to consumers who prefer an economical and easy to take home, large family size offer. Depending on the needs of brands and retailers, different types of formulas (standard, natural or organic) can be used for all types of hygiene routines: hand, body, hair, shower or bath. Very committed to its CSR policy, Roval received the EcoVadis gold medal in 2021 and improved its CDP rating to B-. The company, which has three production sites in France and one in Spain, is continuing its efforts in this area and intends, with this full-service bulk offer, to facilitate the transition of the entire sector to zero waste."
Cosmoprof Asia relocates to Singapore to renew with face-to-face meetings,"Cosmoprof Asia and Cosmopack Asia are moving from Hong Kong to Singapore this year. ""This decision was made after extensive discussions with business leaders, exhibitors and partners who have contributed to the success of the event over the years,"" said the organisers in a statement. Actually, the current entry restrictions for travellers to Hong Kong and the ""zero-Covid"" strategy that remains implemented in China mean that inbound travel to Hong Kong is likely subject to quarantine restrictions in November. Keeping the same dates (16-18 November, 2022), the show will take place at Singapore Expo, a world-class conference and exhibition centre ideally located at the doorstep of the Changi Business Park and close to Changi Singapore Airport. To facilitate the visit, all sectors of the beauty industry - from packaging to finish products - will be gathered in the same venue. ""The APAC region remains a crucial reference for global economics, and Cosmoprof Asia is continuing its growth in the area,"" said Antonio Bruzzone, General Manager of BolognaFiere Group and Director of Cosmoprof Asia Ltd. ""In 2022, Singapore is the best location to welcome stakeholders and professionals again, offering a not-to-be-missed experience to do business in person."" Very well situated in Southeast Asia, Singapore has been selected for its vibrant business environment. It is a well-known global transport hub with one-flight connections from hundreds of cities around the world and has a proven record in facilitating quality events. The city also hosts the regional headquarters of a large numbers of key players in the beauty and personal care industry. Even more important in the current context, while Hong Kong was doubling down on zero-Covid and its international isolation, Singapore opted to live with the coronavirus and reopen to the world. Last but not least, Singapore residents are free to gather in hawker centres or enjoy post-work drinks. As Zoom calls cannot entirely replace the people-to-people connection, the relocation to Singapore was vital for the trade show. The most recent data available showed around 400,000 air passenger arrivals Singapore in December 2021, while Hong Kong saw just 27,000 passengers in that same period. ""Our proactive decision to relocate the fair from Hong Kong to Singapore shows our determination to help the industry to reconnect in 2022. We are confident in Singapore's strong reputation as a preferred destination for business events, and look forward to welcoming our delegates from around the world in the Lion City this November,"" said David Bondi, Senior Vice President - Asia of Informa Markets and Director of Cosmoprof Asia Ltd. While waiting to meet each other face-to-face in November 2022, Cosmoprof Asia's beauty community will have the opportunity to participate to the virtual event Cosmoprof Asia Digital Week, from 27 June to 5 July 2022."
UK's UpCircle Beauty gives waste a new lease of life,"Every day a bike courier for the skincare brand UpCircle Beauty visits 25 cafes in London and collects some 100 kg (220 pounds) of coffee grounds that would - otherwise - be thrown away. Set up six years ago by Anna Brightman and her brother Will Brightman, UpCircle reuses the coffee grounds to make beauty products, adding ingredients such as camomile infusions or a powder made from olive stones. The siblings took the plunge to set up their own business after working for multinational companies. ""I wanted to do something that was closer to my heart,"" Anna Brightman told AFP. ""It was my brother who had the initial inspiration when asking out of curiosity at the coffee shop where he was going every day what happened to the coffee grounds,"" she said. ""He was shocked to learn the coffee was disposed of at a landfill and they had to pay on top for it."" She joked that she and her brother have since ""made a name (for themselves) as the crazy siblings collecting coffee around London and making cosmetics."" Once the coffee collections got going, ""people started to contact us with all types of by-products,"" Anna said, noting more than 15 of them are now incorporated into their range. Among these are water from making concentrated fruit juices, fading flowers that get thrown away by florists and leftover chai spices. UpCircle pay for some of these ingredients, though the coffee grounds, for example, are free. But the logistics involved in collecting them can be complex and costly. Every year, half a million tonnes of coffee grounds are thrown away in the UK and the firm claims to have recycled 400 tonnes to date. Nevertheless, the idea of marketing a beauty product made from ""trash"" initially got a thumbs-down from industry insiders, Anna Brightman admitted. She said they have to work to get the message across that ""these ingredients we are working with are not gross, old or unclean."" Younger people are ""more open to the idea of the circular economy"", she added. ""For obvious reasons, they are concerned about the future of our planet"". Used coffee grounds work better as a skin care ingredient than dry ones, said Barbara Scott-Atkinson, the formulator for UpCircle's products. ""It's been heated and it's damp. This makes it more suitable to use than plain ground coffee and the level of antioxidants increases."" The company sends the ingredients for repurposing at its factory in Bridport on the southwest coast of England. The smell of citrus essential oils wafts through the factory as they are being used to make a scrub. The production process is simple: coffee grounds are mixed with sugar and essential oils, then whipped shea butter and a natural preservative is added. The exfoliant is then poured into glass jars, 3,000 of which are distributed around the UK every week. Demand is growing rapidly, particularly in the United States, according to the company, which is reluctant to give figures on its sales or growth. The burgeoning interest in repurposing food waste puts Upcircle in competition with other brands of natural cosmetics, such as Britain's Wildefruit or Australia's Frank Body, or even the UK giant The Body Shop. As a result, coffee grounds are starting to become sought-after, Anna Brightman said. ""Some cafes tell us they... would like if we could split the week: they get the coffee waste Monday and Tuesday, and us the rest of the week,"" she added. To combat ravaging the planet's resources, many entrepreneurs and designers around the world are coming up with new ways to create value from waste. Recently, an exhibition called ""Waste Age"" at London's Design Museum showcased the use of agave, or sisal fibres, by Mexican designer Fernando Laposse, who studied at London's Central St Martin art school. Laposse turns the natural fibres of the plant — used to make tequila — into avant-garde furniture such as tables, benches and hammocks. He also uses colourful corncobs from his country of birth to make furniture and veneer, helping boost the ""circular economy"" and create jobs. ""In the UK, we recycle 15 percent of our waste, the rest is incinerated or put in landfill"", said the exhibition's curator Gemma Curtin. The Design Museum exhibition also showed chairs made from old fridges, baskets decorated with fishnets recovered from the ocean and creations by fashion designers, such as Stella McCartney and Phoebe English, who use recycling. Curtin added this prompted visitors to question what is really ""luxury""?"
Blissim aims to become major e-commerce player in Europe,"Sold before being re-purchased to Birchbox by its founders, Quentin Reygrobellet and Martin Labas, the group's French entity renamed Blissim has focused for two years on growing locally, boosted by the Covid crisis most favourable to e-commerce. ""In two years, our turnover rose from 30 to 50 million euros with a continued two-digit growth"", explains Quentin Reygrobellet. Recently freed from the agreement signed with their former shareholder, which prevented them from going global, Blissim now aims to keep developing outside France. To this aim, Raise Investissements, a company founded by Clara Gaymard, joined the pool of shareholders last February 4: it represents a third of Blissim's capital, alongside the two majority shareholders – the founders – and Otium Capital. ""It will help us speed things up in Europe, with Germany on March 1, but also in France: we are one of the first digital players here, but we can still make much progress, overall. Right now, we have three pillars to focus on: the EUR 14.90 box, e-commerce, with retail products, and our private label creation studio, Beauty Story,"" says the CEO. To succeed on the German market, the CEO mainly aims to rely on the competitive edge offered by the box. ""Germany is a relatively mature market, but our product is affordable. Our box will be the cheapest, the only personalized one, and the only one to be related to e-commerce, so we have access to all major brands,"" he says. Just like in France, every month, the boxes will contain a personalized selection of five products of five different brands from the selective or parapharmacies network – professional or niche, mainly clean beauty brands. ""At first, we will have a global offering, but we will gradually work with more local brands,"" adds Quentin Reygrobellet. ""We are very ambitious with the German market, it is one of the main European markets,"" he says. For now, Blissim defines itself as the European leader in terms of number of subscribers, with 200,000 people recruited in France only. And the company should grow even more pretty soon, by adding European consumers. As a matter of fact, the German experience should be a major springboard to introduce the concept in the other countries targeted, like Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, and Poland, with one objective: focusing on the local strategy supported by native teams. Following the French model, the box concept is designed to provide brands with a new tool to reach consumers. ""Things have changed a lot over the past ten years. Brands have radically changed, putting digital technologies at the core of their global growth strategy. The box has become one of the main communication levers. For example, before Covid, the content of our boxes was determined three to five months beforehand, on average. Now, we are in February, and we have already chosen the December 2022 box,"" explains Quentin Reygrobellet. An essential booster, according to the founder, the Blissim box has already appealed to 300 partner brands with very diverse profiles, from the best-established to niche brands, with an increasingly clean offering. Launched three years ago, the Beauty Story studio really took off a year ago, by launching well-established private labels. It was aimed to develop and support brands independently of the Blissim brand, and offer their products through an open retail channel. ""Our business is based on data which help us identify consumers' needs little or not satisfied by brands. Thanks to our box, we also build a bridge between the on and offline worlds to make it possible for customers to test products and catch their attention. With Beauty Story, we use these two assets to create brands with pretty well-asserted universes that can meet these needs,"" explains Quentin Reygrobellet. The dozen of brands already released by the studio includes Imparfaite and Glim, available on the Blissim websites, of course, but also at Nocibé, Marionnaud, Beauty Success and Monoprix. ""As an example, in 2021, the Imparfaite Radiance Serum was one of the skincare best-sellers on our website. We had anticipated the global boom of the anti-blemish serum category,"" he explains."
Eurowipes: Innovative and eco-responsible impregnated products,"With N.E.W., the ANJAC Health & Beauty Group subsidiary offers proven active products derived from a formulation that's water-free, preservative-free, solvent-free and with no unnecessary excipients. As such, Eurowipes offers natural products combining effectiveness and naturalness (up to 100% according to ISO 16128) that are COSMOS-certified and contain minimal ingredients. Powdered active ingredients are deposited by electrostatic fields in a targeted way onto the product, precisely where needed. In this way, multiple ingredients can be combined and deposited on the product using non-water-soluble active ingredients. As for all the other innovations offered by Eurowipes, the impregnation medium used remains natural and biodegradable, making it possible to develop end products that are 100% compostable at home. ""Through our exclusive partnership with Fibroline, a French engineering company and expert in the development of technologies for depositing all types of powders onto porous products such as textiles, non-woven surfaces, foams and papers, we combine our expertise in ""clean"" formulations with a dry impregnation process for products that are highly active and meet consumer expectations in terms of sustainability,"" explains Virginie Lassagne, Eurowipes Research, Development Projects & Innovation Director. The environmental benefit of this technology is significant, with a dramatic reduction in water transport and the ability to develop a compostable end product while retaining its portable properties. Additionally, for these water-free and solvent-free products, the use of eco-friendly packaging is now possible (for example, a 100% recyclable cardboard box). With this expertise, the possibilities are endless. Eurowipes already offers two new products: 1. The ""Multi-masking"" mask: with several active ingredients that treat each part of the face according to its need. The mask is dry-impregnated on up to three areas. As such, the consumer benefits from a purifying treatment for the forehead area, an anti-aging activity for the eye area and a deep moisturizing treatment for the lower face. A true revolution to simplify the beauty routine. Eurowipes' R&D team supports its customers in the development of other tailor-made ""multi-masking"" concepts adapted to their needs, whether for beauty masks or more broadly for health patches for the pharmaceutical industry. 2. Eco-friendly make-up remover pads! These makeup remover pads use an organic cotton material made from natural biodegradable fibers and are impregnated with active cleansing powders. They're ready to use and simply need to be moistened with water beforehand. A cutting-edge consumer product: effective, ultra-portable and made with mostly natural ingredients. With N.E.W. Eurowipes, ANJAC Health & Beauty Group offers a high-tech platform with unlimited possibilities for Health and Beauty products adapted to new consumer needs: personalization, efficiency and portability. And of course, a solid response to high expectations for effective eco-responsible solutions!"

Colorprescription: Stimulating imagination with real-life colours,"At a time when algorithms and artificial intelligence have transformed and automated trend forecasts, Sabine Le Chatelier and Claude Vuillermet have chosen to go in the opposite direction by proposing a 100% physical, purely inspirational product, free of any authoritative interpretation. The zero-digital concept of Colorprescription is based on the subjective choices of the two colourists, expressed each year in ten limited-edition boxes of sensory inspiration, each of which is dedicated to a colour, available in different shades and on different substrates. ""It is a 100% physical tool mixing materials and colours. Every month, a colour is selected, developed and applied to various materials. It is a subjective approach whose aim is to provide industrialists and brands, from all sectors, with a real colour shot capable of broadening their horizons, stimulating their creativity and generating new interpretations, and opening their minds to new materials,"" explains Claude Vuillermet. For subscribers, it is also a way to build up a collection of materials classified by colour that will provide the basis for future developments. The two colourists also wanted to break away from the consensual style adopted by trend books, with sometimes strong biases, breaking out of each other's comfort zones, but also by refusing to impose a preconceived classification. ""We want to inspire without imposing,"" emphasises Sabine Le Chatelier. ""Everything is mobile, detachable, rearrangeable and reusable. There is a notion of freedom in this tool. It's the ultimate anti-guru,"" she continues. Each box contains a manifesto, an editorial (all texts are bilingual French + English), and a colour chart. Each shade is associated with images and keywords and all the choices are substantiated and contextualised with meaningful images, artistic references, literary words, technical notes or historical accounts which also allow to broaden the scope or, on the contrary, to go into details. All of this is combined with a variety of materials (tinted mouldings, textiles, leather, plastics, ceramics, glass, etc.) which can be vintage or made to order. ""As these are very limited editions, we can afford to carry out very sophisticated research,"" emphasises Claude Vuillermet. Colorprescription is aimed at the sectors of fashion and cosmetics, the industry and decorators and packaging manufacturers. All sectors that have to work with colours and materials and who structure their offer around these subjects! The idea is to inspire colourists, designers, design studios and R&D departments who work with colour ranges, by showing them - upstream of the project process – original, and unusual materials. So far, four boxes have been produced (blue, green, brown, pink) and the white box will be released soon. Each colour is available in four shades. The Colorprescription annual subscription includes 10 editions (published monthly, except in July and August).

"Trade shows: Cosmoprof, Esxence and Experience Lab announce new dates","The 53rd edition of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna has been rescheduled to 28th April to 2nd May 2022 in order to facilitate the in-person attendance of international operators, announced BolognaFiere yesterday. The event was originally scheduled from 10th to 14th March 2022. ""The 2022 edition of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna must be a real support to the cosmetic industry: it is our duty towards the more than 2,700 exhibiting companies confirmed to date, the institutions and associations that continue to make us feel their support, all buyers and distributors who follow our initiatives to develop their business. The decision to postpone the event further to April 28 - May 2, albeit painful, is the result of a responsible dialogue with our players, in order to facilitate the presence of international operators, who can therefore organize the visit to Bologna with greater ease and live their return to Cosmoprof with greater serenity"", explained Gianpiero Calzolari, President of BolognaFiere. ""We want Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna 2022 to be accessible to as many operators as possible: this is our contribution to the revitalization of the industry,"" added Enrico Zannini, General Manager of BolognaFiere Cosmoprof.

Both events were originally scheduled to be held from 17th to 20th March 2022. Other events, such as Paris Packaging Week, have also recently been postponed.

Boosted by online and international sales Cosnova achieves record results,"Online and international sales were the main growth drivers that led to these record results. Cosnova Beauty's e-commerce business has grown by more than 50% in 2021 compared to last year, and by more than 130% compared to 2019. According to the family-owned company, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, online sales now account for approximately one tenth of global net sales. In addition, Cosnova Beauty performed very well on international markets. Sales grew by 40% in the United States and by 22% in China. ""In the USA and China in particular, the strategy of focusing more on online trade and B2C business with e-commerce partners has been very successful,"" said the company in a statement. The company also achieved very good results in Western Europe where sales increased by 25%, but the most impressive results were recorded in the Middle East and North Africa region with growth exceeding 50%. ""Cosnova remains fully on track for success, despite the tense global situation in another challenging year - which is why we are very pleased with this result,"" commented Mathias Delor, Managing Director and COO of Cosnova GmbH. ""The global supply bottlenecks also presented us with a major hurdle and we are aware that we could not keep our customers fully satisfied here. Nevertheless, we are proud that the internationalization and digitalization we have been driving forward have contributed to this impressive result, as has our consistent fulfilment of our promise to offer the highest quality at a top price. In the jubilee year 2022, we will continue to expand our position on the market even further."" Last year, the global beauty player focused on expanding its e-commerce business. The aim was to implement a collaborative platform dubbed 'Connected Beauty' to connect retail, brands and consumers in a new way. ""We are very proud that we have completely revamped our online infrastructure in 2021 and have created an innovative brand experience platform with 'Connected Beauty', which includes engagement, commerce, service, marketing and the brand websites,"" said Dirk Lauber, Cosnova's Chief Digital Officer. Cosnova also invested a lot in digital marketing with the expansion of its social media presence on channels such as Instagram and TikTok. Social commerce, live shopping events and augmented reality tools are on the digital agenda for 2022, with a strong focus on influencer marketing and content production. ""These are important strategic topics for us because our marketing distribution channels are almost exclusively digital and we want to take the requirements of the platforms, trends and developments into account,"" said Thorsten Mühl, who, as Director Digital Marketing, has been instrumental in shaping the digital transformation at Cosnova since April 2021. Another key element of the company's growth strategy is the expansion and diversification of its portfolio. In addition to the Essence and Catrice core businesses, Cosnova will continue to focus on the steady growth of its youngest brands such as L.O.V. or LaManufacture under the umbrella of NextGen Beauty GmbH, a sister company of Cosnova GmbH. The incubator is also working to establish the new Zeena brand in emerging markets this year. The aim is to provide consumers in these markets with decorative cosmetics that meet Cosnova's quality standards outside the traditional distribution channels."
Unbottled solid cosmetics now in European Sephora stores,"Founded only a year and a half ago, at the beginning of the Covid era, Unbottled quickly reached its public, in particular through social media, and created itself a boosting community: right now, 58,000 people follow the brand on Instagram. Its positioning is inspired from the observations of Sarah Pouchet, the founder, and Benjamin Legros, her associate, regarding sustainability. They aim to remove plastic containers from our bathrooms based on a positive approach and sensorial products. ""After six years working for a major cosmetics group, it got clear to me that I wanted to change the system from the inside and develop products free from plastic packaging and as good and pleasant to use as bottled products,"" explains Sarah Pouchet. The first three references, a shower gel, a shampoo, and a face cleanser, were launched after a year of R&D. ""We realized we actually met a need. Three weeks after the launch, our products were out of stock,"" adds the young woman. Eighteen months later, the range counts ten new references, both products and accessories, and most importantly, it is part of Sephora's selective network: in France since January 4, and in Europe starting from January 17. All in all, the brand will be available in 1,000 stores, as well as on the e-shop. ""Sephora gave us the opportunity to be part of a broad distribution network, and we actually aim to reach as many people as possible: the vast majority of people who have started their own ecological transition, pay attention to what they do, but are not ready to use a shampoo with no foam yet. Solid products should not be reserved to the committed happy few. It also shows we help democratize them and we can share the same playground as liquid products,"" she concludes. The brand's latest products include big sizes in the form of breakable tablets, like chocolate, for shower gel and shampoos, with two new perfumes: apricot/shea and neutral for babies. In addition, the range comprises two new shampoos for oily or dry, coloured, curly hair, the normal hair shampoo and shower gel in a miniature version, as well as accessories: a magnetized carrying case and soap holder. The conditioner is expected in February. The formulas are perfumed, can foam, and offer a neutral pH. They are composed of vegetable oils, 100% natural perfumes, and superfood actives. ""We reconcile people with solid products thanks to sensoriality. We also aim to remain on the skin and hair care segments, as we want to become a French Lush,"" says Sarah Pouchet. After the transient pop-up store opened in November at the Paris Beaugrenelle shopping mall, Unbottled intends to soon increase their physical presence by inaugurating stores in Paris and across the French territory. A modest – first – fundraising campaign launched last Fall helped the brand speed up its development, recruit a whole team, and develop other products."
Anjac acquires majority stake in Apollo and strengthens in North America,"France's Anjac Health & Beauty, an industrial group specialized in the formulation, manufacturing and filling of cosmetics, medical devices, drugs and food supplements, has completed the acquisition of Apollo Healthcare Corp., a Canada-based company specialized in the development and production of personal care, OTC and wellness products, for CAD 327 million (approximately USD 256 million or EUR 227 million). Based in Ontario, Canada, Apollo Healthcare Corp. is one of the largest private label personal care product manufacturers in North America, developing and manufacturing products for major North American retailers and brands. Apollo's customer base spans across major North American drug and mass merchandise retailers, users as well as wholesale clubs. The company's annual turnover surpasses 100 million euros. Apollo Healthcare Corp. has been co-founded by Charles and Richard Wachsberg, who will remain shareholders and co-CEOs. With this acquisition, Anjac Health & Beauty group continues their external growth strategy and further strengthens their footprint in North America, after the acquisition of Cosmetics West in 2019. ""We are very pleased to expand our expertise and technologies throughout the North American continent with this major acquisition. Great opportunities are opening up for our international customers especially when it comes to industrial robustness and innovation!,"" explains Aurélien Chaufour, CEO of Anjac Group. After Cosmetix West and Feltor in 2019, and Roval Cosmétiques in 2020, Anjac signs with Apollo their 8th acquisition within five years. The Anjac Group now gathers 13 companies representing a total of 21 R&D and manufacturing sites and a global turnover which is now twice bigger than three years ago, reaching EUR 600 million, after the new acquisition."
"Chanel launches N°1, a new beauty range that embraces naturality and sustainability","Chanel has just taken a big step in the alliance of luxury and environmental responsibility. The French brand has just announced the launch of a new line of beauty products combining natural ingredients from sustainable sources and more planet-friendly packaging solutions. The red camellia (Camellia japonica), Gabrielle Chanel's favourite flower, is at the centre of the N°1 line. The ingredient has been selected for its revitalizing and anti-aging properties, particularly for combating the first signs of aging. According to Chanel, the red camellia extract prevents cellular senescence, thereby enabling skin to remain healthy looking for a longer period of time. ""Naturally rich in antioxidants, it also helps protect skin from the consequences of stress,"" the brand adds. The N°1 de Chanel formulas contain up to 97% ingredients of natural origin (according to ISO 16128 standard). These formulas also include up to 76% of camellia derivatives, with petals, seeds and yeasts used in order not to waste any part of the plant. Through this new line, the French house is also embracing sustainable beauty, with ecologically-conceived packaging. The weight of the jars and bottles has been reduced, through a streamlined design, by minus 30% on average for the entire line, and up to minus 50% for the Revitalizing Cream glass jar. The use of recyclable materials was preferred: 80% of the products in the range are made of glass. The cream jar is refillable. Refilling the Revitalizing Cream twice, therefore allows its greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced by half. The use of plastics was limited, especially single use ones. Cellophane has been removed, as well as paper leaflets, replaced by a QR code. Only organic inks were used to decorate the glass bottles. Inks on the lids have been replaced by in-mould engraving. Lastly, all the product line lids contain recycled or bio-sourced materials. In addition, the Revitalizing Cream lid incorporates camellia seed shells. This innovation is the result of a collaboration between Chanel and Finnish start-up Sulapac. Composed of 90% bio-sourced materials stemming from renewable resources, wood shavings (by-products of the paper industry) and camellia seed shells. Every detail was carefully considered, including: the sensorial qualities of the material, its resistance to heat variations, the unique sound of the jar closing, how it feels in the hand and the depth of the matte satin finish engraved with the iconic double C. Among the flagship products of this new range are a serum, a lotion, several face and eye creams, a powder-to-foam cleanser, a lip and cheek balm, a foundation, and a fragrance mist. The whole range is already available on the Chanel e-shop, before a wider launch from January 15."
Mustela aims to expand its scope to family dermo-cosmetics,"Mustela's new Multi-Purpose Balm with Three Avocado Extracts promises to nourish, restore and protect any dry areas of the face and body such as the neck, arms, hands, elbows, knees, feet, lips and cuticles. With this launch, the Expanscience Group's brand, known for its expertise in the baby and child care products, wants to open a new chapter in its history by building on the its expertise in skin care and plant extraction to expand its scope to skin and body care products for the entire family. For this first foray into family cosmetics, Mustela has developed a multi-purpose product, presented as ""an easy way to consume better"" through a reduction in the number of products in the bathroom while making life easier for parents. ""This product is emblematic of our commitments and our know-how"", explains Clémence Menez, Marketing Director Mustela France. A B Corp certified company since 2018, a label awarded to businesses that balance purpose and profit, Mustela has crafted the product using the emblematic ingredient of the Expanscience group: Peru's organic avocado upcycled from the agro-food industry byproducts. Certified organic by Ecocert, the balm contains 99.7% of natural ingredients and is EWG Verified, meaning that it is free from any ingredients of concern as defined by the Environmental Working Group (EWG). It contains no perfume or dye, its colour and smell being naturally given by avocados. ""The avocado is the star of this product, it is a fruit with high nutritional values, studied and used by Mustela for many years. It provides the balm with three complementary substances: fats, derived from oil, rare sugars, some of which the avocado is one of the rare fruits to contain, and antioxidant polyphenols"", underlines Sophie Leclere-Bienfait, Director of Innovation and Research and Development on Active & Natural Ingredients. Supplied from sources assessed by the UEBT, the avocados are transformed at the Expanscience plant in Peru thanks to patented processes. Then, the ingredients are shipped to France where they will be used in many of the group's products, including the new Baume Universel. ""Transforming avocados where they are produced not only helps to preserve their qualities but also limits the environmental impact of the entire process, by limiting the volumes that are shipped"", adds Maëla Le Mercier-Pinier, Mustela Product Manager at Laboratoires Expanscience. The Multi-Purpose Balm with Three Avocado Extracts comes in an aluminium tube, a material that has been preferred to plastic for its ability to be infinitely recycled. ""For the moment, we are using virgin aluminium, but we are in full swing to find a way to use recycled aluminium tubes for even more circularity,"" says Mustela in a statement. According to the brand, another advantage of aluminium is that it can be bended thus allowing maximum formula delivery (up to 10% more product compared to a conventional plastic tube). The first product in the brand's new family range, which will have a specific logo and packaging, Multi-Purpose Balm with Three Avocado Extracts was launched in France at the end of last year."
Proverb Skin moves to eco-friendly packaging with compostable paper pouches,"Proverb Skin's skincare trial samples are now available in paper home compostable sachets, a world first, according to the company. In addition, their best selling Cleanse & Shave Nutrient Mud and Energising Facial Scrub now have new aluminium packaging. According to the brand, the process of filling a liquid serum into paper pouches was a mammoth ordeal that required a two year-long testing process. The pouches are composed of layers of paper and biofilm from wood pulp cellulose ensuring they are 100% plastic-free. They are designed to home compost at ambient temperatures back into the water, CO2 and biomass without having any ecotoxicity for the soil. ""To date, nobody has held an emulsion in a paper-based pouch that will home compost,"" claims the Proverb Skin. The new sample pouches are available to consumers that would like to try the skincare collection before they purchase the full sizes, and are fully home compostable in 26 weeks. The choice of eco-friendly packaging is in line with Proverb Skin's DNA. For their formulas, the brand makes sure to only ever use natural and organic ingredients. The new launch aluminium tube, Energising Face Scrub, for instance, has reclaimed blitzed avocado stone and coconut shell as a natural exfoliant. ""Next year, we are hoping to bring out our entire skincare range in a one-time purchase glass bottle that can be refilled with our compostable skincare pouches,"" announced Proverb co-founder, Kirstie Sherriff."
Olfactory creation: Cinquième Sens combines freedom and creativity,"Like the collections of fashion houses, each year the Creative Week explores various themes (Green Week, African Week, Kitsch Week, Bright Week...). A way of keeping up with the times while prescribing future trends. This year, Cinquième Sens [1] gave its perfumers carte blanche to stage the concept of freedom using fragrances. With this in mind, Sarah Burri, Camille Leguay, Alice Dattée, Veronika Rebeka Nagy and Isabelle Ferrand unleashed their imagination to focus on three creative themes: liberation, evolution and escapism. With the notion of liberation, the idea was to harness the perfumer's skills to give voice to silent flowers. These ""forgotten"" ingredients, which never appear on the perfume organ because their scent cannot be extracted using classical methods. Hence, Isabelle Ferrand imagined the fragrance reminiscent of a wheat flower: a powdery, vegetal, dusty scent, which she transcribed with transparent, abstract, honeyed floral notes to express the idea of light and sunshine, but also with iris, violet, cedar and sandalwood. The second celebrates evolution, as a passage towards a new era. Veronika Rebeka Nagy wanted to release fougere from the men's wardrobe and take it to more feminine or androgynous lands. Moving away from the fougere note's classic lavender-coumarin structure, she emphasised geranium, vetiver and evernyl. Naturally, this gives the composition a very herbaceous dimension revolving around myrtle, with a coumalactone base note, a non-allergenic substitute for coumarin, but with a milkier roundness. The last stage is escapism, to free ourselves from the notions of space-time and the laws of physics. Cumulus, for example, transports us to the sky, through a vaporous, airy, cottony fragrance, conjuring up those big clouds synonymous with warm weather. A mix of milky, powdery notes and an ozonic, almost cold side. The powdery, almost talcum powder accord emerges in the background, with this ""clean"" facet currently very trendy in perfumes. In total, no less than nine perfumes, on the wide-ranging theme of freedom, were created for this event. Cinquième Sens once again surrounded itself with partners to stage its Creative Week. This year, Jérémy Tamen, a tea expert, concocted a bespoke infusion for the event. A combination of natural, zesty and herbaceous notes, translating his vision of freedom: that of a walk around the Mediterranean. The team also worked with Les Parfumables, which presented new olfactory substrates in the form of a container made from a 100% biodegradable wood-based alternative to plastic, produced by the Finnish company Sulapac. An annual event, which confirmed that Cinquième Sens masters both the art of creation and the expertise of training."
"Anjac: ""An ambitious CSR strategy for the next five years""","It has been a little more than a year since our last interview. Can you tell us about any developments in your CSR at Anjac? Aurélien Chaufour - The Anjac Group and I have very strong convictions and place a high value on CSR. After three years of fast-paced acquisitions, I wanted us to accelerate our actions and push for synergy across the companies. Also, this year, with our 12 companies we co-constructed an ambitious and very concrete CSR strategy for the next five years. Our goal is to continue to move forward quickly in order to create value for our customers and territories where safety, health, and the environment are the number one priorities. Does innovation still have a role in your CSR strategy? Aurélien Chaufour - More than ever! Innovation is a constant driving force, and I believe it greatly motivates the products and services we offer. Not only does it encourage more environmental sustainability, but it also places the focus on consumer health and regional benefits. CSR lead to challenges, but above all, it creates value for our industries and companies. Innovation is the cornerstone of our group's CSR strategy. I can already proudly tell you that 90% of the innovations from our own R&D relate to sustainability. This is the result of many years of work by our R&D teams. The Anjac Green Attack innovation program guides our internal actions toward sustainable innovations affecting formulas, processes, and packaging. Solid cosmetics, certified household compostability, a natural approach, natural health... the achievements are numerous. And our R&D committee is working to take it even further... Our Responsible Purchasing policy goes hand in hand with our goals. Anjac has begun working with our top suppliers through EcoVadis, an internationally recognized rating system. On what actions is your CSR strategy based and how is it implemented within your companies? Aurélien Chaufour - Innovation is the first pillar. Then we chose very concrete and pragmatic actions that allow us to involve all the teams and businesses. CSR is everyone's business. We need to build an industrial model that combines sustainability and performance. This involves eco-efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at our manufacturing sites. We have set our objectives for the next five years, and we can share them with our clients with full transparency. The ECOVADIS rating, which covers the full 360° vision of an integrated CSR approach, helps us measure our progress and creates a challenge for each of our sites. Already in 2021, we have reached a milestone, with 51% of the group's sales achieving a GOLD medal rating. We set a goal for ourselves to achieve Gold across the board within five years, so why not go for Platinum! What about your social and societal actions? Aurélien Chaufour - Obviously, all of this progress is possible thanks to our teams, who are highly motivated by their impact on people. We prioritize safety, along with autonomous, pressure-free team development, always encouraging the group's entrepreneurial spirit. Our ""Zero Accident"" policy is a priority, deployed at each of the group's sites. Our societal commitment reflects our values and our activities in our territories. Human and Health, in its entirety, does a good job of summing up what is most important to us. We support the Gustave Roussy Hospital, Europe's #1 children's cancer center, CEW, the cosmetics industry's top-ranked network providing beauty care for hospital patients; EPIC, with its Prerana and Agir pour l'École associations; and the Maison des Femmes, a unique medical-social structural model providing care and assistance to women who are victims of violence. And obviously, we place great importance on universal access to daily care, which is why we regularly donate products, an action we've found to be very effective. Is there anything else you'd like to tell us before we go? Aurélien Chaufour - The Anjac Group demonstrates its customers clear ambitions and CSR objectives, driven by innovation. This marks a new stage in our development. We're on our way to actively contribute to the transformation of our Health and Beauty industries. Source : (www.anjac.com)"

Chanel's first Advent calendar trapped in a bad buzz turmoil,"For cosmetics brands, advent calendars are a good way to draw attention during the pre-Christmas period while inviting their consumers to test a large array of new products. Advent calendars have multiplied at breakneck speed in recent years, with some brands even offering up to three or four different calendars. Let us guide you to the best online slot games - slots-online-canada.ca and some of our favorite casinos where you can play these slot machines. Beyond the magics behind these boxes, consumers usually get their money's worth as well, whether it's because they're testing new products, or because they get content that has an overall greater retail value than the price of the package. Indeed, it's a sales argument put forth for most of the products presented to the public. For instance the Body Shop offers a calendar for US$79 which is actually worth US$132.59 when buying each products separately. Sephora's calendar is sold at US$45 while it contains products for a value of US$102 at retail price. And Lookfantastic's US$135 calendar would contain US$640 worth of products. If Chanel had until then stayed away from the movement, the first advent calendar of the French luxury house, which represents a giant bottle of n°5, its iconic century-old perfume, has been at the centre of conversations on social networks for a few days now. It all started on TikTok, with several posts influencer Elise Harmon, followed by some 250,000 subscribers. After having started to opening, day after day, the boxes of her luxurious calendar, the young woman began to share her disappointment. Miniature versions of collector perfumes, lipsticks, hand creams: the brand's calendar has a host of objects that beauty fans dream about but it also contains pins, stickers, pouches, and decorative Christmas baubles that - according to some commenters - Chanel would generally offer free to its customers when they purchase a certain product. Considering the price of the calendar, consumers expected classics, albeit in small formats, rather than trinkets. However, the brand was fully transparent, providing a detailed list of all the contents of the calendar. According to the count made by ETX Studio, among the most valuable 'gifts' are the N°5 Eau de Parfum Spray 1.2 fl. oz. (85 dollars), N°5 L'EAU On Hand Cream (55 dollars), N°5 The Bath Soap 2.6 oz. (26 dollars), limited edition Rouge Allure lipstick (45 dollars), LE VERNIS nail polish (28 dollars), a miniature Rouge Allure lipstick plus several miniature collector perfume bottles whose value is hard to identify. This makes a total of about 250-350 dollars, including miniatures. Of course that's without counting the various bracelets, mirrors, pouches, snow globe and other accessories. Commenting on the controversy, Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel's Fashion President told WWD that: ""This controversy is a bit of a shame because it was not what Chanel intended. Chanel thought it would please some of its customers by offering this type of product. Evidently, we see that you have to be careful and therefore, in future, we will certainly be much more cautious."" He explained the calendar was produced in very limited run as part of this year's celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Chanel No.5 perfume, and that it was totally sold out. In an official statement, Chanel said they were ""aware of the comments that are currently visible under our publications and are sorry that this calendar may have disappointed some people."" ""Directly inspired by the mythical silhouette of the No.5 bottle, this calendar, only available for a short period, has a unique design and an original content, which makes it a true collector's item whose value cannot be summed up by the products it contains alone,"" the brand added."
"""It's a strong, committed and creative relaunch"", Jean Jacques, Parfums Caron","Premium Beauty News - How does your duo operate with Ariane de Rothschild? Jean Jacques - Ariane de Rothschild is very involved, she is passionate about perfumes, and she is a true entrepreneur. If you look at the history of Caron, the most creative period are the 40 years spanning from 1904 to 1941, during which Ernest Daltroff, the founder, was at the helm of the company. At that time, there was an explosion of creativity, a desire to surprise and audacity. Ariane brought all this back to life with her energy and her desire to undertake, her way of always finding new ideas. She is a woman full of liberating energy. Beyond the means that will allow beautiful things to be done, she instils a creative dynamic. Caron was Daltroff's Perfume House, but also Félicie Wanpouille's House. He was the olfactory creator, she was his business partner and muse. This duo is reincarnated today with Ariane and me. A new creative duo. Premium Beauty News - A fruitful collaboration? Jean Jacques - In two years, we have already launched fourteen perfumes. There are also many projects underway for next year and a 2023 collection, which is very relevant and daring. A lot is going on. There is a desire to show that something is happening in this brand. It's really a strong, committed and creative relaunch, driven by passion. Premium Beauty News - What characterises the Caron olfactory signature? Jean Jacques - An overdose of naturals. When you put 10% of sustainable vetiver in Aimez moi comme je suis, it's truely the House's signature. In Pour Un Homme it's almost 61% natural lavender, which is unique in selective perfumery. For Poivre Sacré and Poivre Imperial, I started from the same premise as Parfum Sacré, created in the 1990s, which was one of the first women's fragrances to contain an overdose of pepper essence, i.e. 6%. Poivre Sacré is a sulphurous, powerful, spicy pepper, with the same postulate of 6% pepper essence. On the creative side, I also inspire myself of the history of the House, which is based on this idea of unexpected duality, like the meeting between Daltroff and Wampouille, but also the lavender and vanilla duo in Pour Un Homme, or the duo between Ariane and me today. I compose my perfumes around this idea of an explosive encounter between two ingredients that are not meant to go together and that finally work well, like vetiver and hazelnut in Aimez Moi Comme Je Suis or tuberose and ginger in Tubéreuse Merveilleuse. Premium Beauty News - How is the brand doing after these two years? Jean Jacques - There is still a lot to be done but there are very positive signs. The boutique in Paris is still going strong. We are opening new markets, the Middle East where we are fully legitimate with our powerful fragrances, and Asia where, although the appetite is more for fresh fragrances, we are surprised to see that signature and powerful fragrances also perform well. Overall, people have a positive expectation regarding the brand. There is a kind of fond tenderness. We all know someone who has worn a Caron perfume, even in foreign markets. So there's no reason why we shouldn't keep offering the things we're best at. Premium Beauty News - And what about France? Jean Jacques - People realise that something is going on even if of course, not everyone has come to the same conclusions. Aimez Moi Comme Je Suis was launched in 2020 amid Covid, but it's a perfume that catches people's attention when they simply cross someone wearing it. Once they have smelled it, people love it. In our boutique, it is our second sale and the first in the Middle East. It's making its way, but we have to continue to be very creative, to be in our role as a Maison de Parfumerie, created by a Perfumer, experimenting, taking chances so that our fragrances can be discovered by more customers. I have the feeling that the first signs are already there."
"On The Wild Side, wild cosmetics made in France","Premium Beauty News - On The Wild Side offers natural products, but with specific commitments? Anne-Sophie Nardy - Our products are certified organic and made from 100% natural ingredients. We use no ingredients derived from petrochemicals. Unlike other natural brands, we do not use essential oils as they can be irritating. Finally, the brand's DNA lies in the use of wild plants harvested in collaboration with a cooperative of gatherers. Birch sap and beech buds, for example, come from forests in the Gironde and the Massif Central regions. Because they result from a long natural evolution, grow with no protection and interact with an often difficult environment, wild plants are richer in active ingredients. Tests have shown them to be very effective in regenerating the skin, improving hydration and reducing oxidative stress. Premium Beauty News - Why a cooperative of gatherers? Anne-Sophie Nardy - On The Wild Side wants to stand for committed cosmetics. We strive to be more than just another cosmetic brand, by taking part in local actions that change the world and raise awareness. It was, therefore, important to work with truly knowledgeable people who love plants and respect the natural environment. Since January, I have been actively involved in the AFC, (Association française des professionnels de la cueillette de plantes sauvages, or French association of wild plant gatherers), whose mission is to promote the trade of wild plant gatherers and to develop responsible and sustainable gathering practices. Gathering is an ancestral practice but, like agriculture, it can have an impact on ecosystems. It is therefore important to define good practices: how to pick the plant, at what season, how much and with what tools... Premium Beauty News - In concrete terms, how does this translate into your range? Anne-Sophie Nardy - We offer six face care products, including a cleansing oil, a day cream and a care oil. We complemented our range with two hair care products in July. The range also includes a food supplement for nails and hair in capsule form, and a relaxing night concentrate, in the form of drops to be mixed in a glass of water. We launched five new products this year, and there are more to come next year. Premium Beauty News – And in terms of packaging, how is this commitment reflected? Anne-Sophie Nardy - All of our containers are recyclable: in glass or aluminium. For our secondary packaging, we use FSC managed cardboard. We are considering integrating refills next year for the glass containers. Premium Beauty News - Where are the products available? Anne-Sophie Nardy - Initially, products were only available online, via our e-commerce site. Questionnaires for our community via Instagram and on our website, helped us to better understand their expectations. Distribution was gradually extended to marketplaces and physical outlets. The brand is now present in 500 POS: department stores such as Le Printemps, Galeries Lafayette and La Samaritaine, but also at Sephora for a year and a half, online and in retail in twelve countries in Europe, and in concept stores such as Merci, for example. Today we are looking to consolidate our presence in these POS, and to extend our presence internationally. We are going to open a new market in an Asian country, via e-commerce and physical outlets. Premium Beauty News - What are the next steps for the brand? Anne-Sophie Nardy - We raised 500,000 euros in 2020 from business angels. This allowed us to recruit, launch our new products and improve our notoriety, with a manifesto film and a poster campaign in the streets of Paris. We are going to continue our current strategy by completing our offer, with relevant products for our customers while sticking to our formulation charter. We want to consolidate our international foothold and further develop our community through social networks like Instagram. We are also aiming for the B Corp certification in 2022."
Beauté Privée intends to boost its development with a more premium positioning,"Founded about ten years ago, Beauté Privée is now a leading pure player in the field of beauty. With 250,000 daily visits, 90% of which are on mobile phones and 70% via the app., the platform has recorded a 24% average annual growth rate since its acquisition by Showroom Privé two years ago. Riding the e-commerce wave, the parent group now intends to capitalise on this momentum and has embarked on a technical and marketing overhaul of the site and the application. ""The Showroomprivé Group strongly believes in the value of this platform,"" comments Aurélie Bouvart, Marketing Director. ""This brand strategy is completely independent of the Group but is integrated into its DNA. We are reaching out to women and we are talking about immediately accessible wellness products,"" she adds. The new positioning, developed with the Marcel Agency, is based on the notions of partnership, accessibility and well-being. With the slogan ""Beauté Privée après vous, votre meilleur allié pour se faire du bien"" (Beauté Privée, after you, your best ally to care for yourself), a vast communication campaign was launched in October with the aim of establishing the brand's new identity. To convince users, Beauté Privée is counting on a richer and cleaner offer. The site currently has 1,000 partner brands, including 200 new ones since the beginning of the year, and plans to double that figure in the next two years. ""We have a very comprehensive catalogue that we intend to develop to fulfil our mission of making beauty accessible to all beauties,"" declares Aurélie Bouvart. The wide-ranging recruitment of new brands is aimed at major groups but also clean beauty indie brands, a growing category according to the Manager. ""Nearly a quarter of our references come from the green section, which for us, covers organic, natural, vegan, made in France and zero waste products. We are trying to facilitate access to responsible consumption since these references are offered with an average discount of around 43.5%,"" she continues. At the same time, Look Forward, the incubator of the Showroomprivé Group supports fashion and beauty start-ups with a committed profile, such as for beauty: 900 Care, Unbottle, All Tigers and Beautymix. Customer experience has also been revamped by making the application and website more user-friendly. ""We have worked on making navigation lighter, to create a more premium user experience. The idea is also to provide the customer with additional advice on how to discover new products,"" explains the manager. Beauté Privée covers exclusively France at the moment but is interested in looking at business opportunities outside France."

Arcade Beauty creates a new division for turnkey beauty products,"Arcade Beauty Retail (ABR) will aim to offer ""customizable and turn-key solutions that provide accelerated speed to market, with customer needs in mind."" According to the group, the new offer will focus on eco-friendly, innovative packaging and delivery systems, sustainable materials and responsible sourcing.

India beauty retailer Nykaa sees valuation surge to $13 billion after IPO,"Founded in 2012 by former investment banker Falguni Nayar, Nykaa has grown into India's top e-commerce site for beauty products, with strategic endorsements from Bollywood stars and support among twenty-somethings. The company now offers more than 2,500 beauty brands, from makeup to skincare products, fragrances and other personal care products, through its websites, apps and some 80 brick-and-mortar stores. ""I hope the Nykaa journey — an Indian-born, Indian-owned and Indian-managed dream-come-true — can inspire each of you,"" Nayar said at the listing ceremony on Wednesday. Nykaa (the Sanskrit word for actress) quickly became popular with young tech-savvy Indians — predominantly women — who preferred the wide selection of brands compared with what was on offer at their local shops. ""The best part about Nykaa is that it lets me access so many global brands that had never been sold in India before,"" 30-year-old loyal customer Sanaeya told AFP. ""They have everything from major luxury brands to smaller niche ones and even lesser-known Korean skin care products. I always find something new there."" Nayar, 58, joined only six other Indian women dollar billionaires as Nykaa's parent company FSN floated on the Mumbai stock exchange, hitting a valuation of 1 trillion rupees ($13.5 billion) in the first five minutes of trade. The company has said the IPO proceeds will be used for a range of strategical corporate purposes, including investing in FSN Brands or setting up new retail stores. Bollywood actress Katrina Kaif has invested in the firm — helped cement Nykaa's popularity as it battles giants such as Amazon and Flipkart. Nykaa has also manufactured its own in-house brand of products since 2015 and recently began selling clothes and household products. It has a growing high street presence with 80 stores across 40 Indian cities. The retailer expects India's beauty and personal care market to nearly double in size from 2020 to 2025, reaching nearly 2 trillion rupees. Even after selling 4.8 million shares via the IPO, Nayar — along with her husband and twin children — continues to own more than half of the company, valuing her stake at $7 billion. Nykaa's three-day IPO was over-subscribed by nearly 82 times, signalling strong investor demand for a start-up that has already achieved profitability. Technology start-ups in India have attracted record investment this year, with more than 33 ""unicorns"" — companies valued at more than $1 billion — created, benefiting from investors spooked by a crackdown on technology giants in China. Others going public this year include food delivery giant Zomato, whose shares have since risen 80 percent, and mobile payments pioneer Paytm which is conducting its IPO — India's biggest — this week. But unlike many of its loss-making peers, Nykaa is profitable."
"With its Eau de Parfum Naturelle, Chloé is starting a trend in selective perfumery","Premium Beauty News - How was Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle born? Karole Stanislas - This new addition is part of the sustainable development approach that has been driving Chloé for several years. And more particularly since the arrival, a year ago, of our new Creative Director, Gabriela Hearst, who advocates an ethical and responsible fashion. The brand's latest fashion show during the Fashion Week demonstrates this. Furthermore, this approach also draws on the DNA of Chloé, a brand that has always emphasised natural and authentic femininity (""the most naturally feminine fashion brand""). Premium Beauty News - Does this launch reflect a quest for naturalness among consumers? Karole Stanislas - This project is first and foremost a reflection of my holistic vision of consumption. But also my conviction that people are looking for ""cleaner"" or natural products. The health crisis also helped to bring this project to fruition and finished convincing perfume houses. Indeed, it was quite challenging to impose this launch, the industry was reluctant, mostly for technical reasons related to the sillage and the staying power of the perfume. That said, even if I believe this trend is real, no study really supports it. Moreover, it varies from one country or market to another. But you only have to look at the beauty shelves to see for yourself. Premium Beauty News - What is your take on the natural trend in perfumery? Karole Stanislas - I think that consumers see natural products as a token of confidence, particularly in terms of health, rightly or wrongly so. But there are two obstacles to this trend: on the one hand, a strong industry lobby, and on the other, the fact that it is an expensive choice. I think we need to strike a balance in terms of formulation. There are many contradictory studies on the subject. On the one hand, petrochemical endocrine disruptors are stigmatised. On the other, natural resources are not inexhaustible, ecologically speaking. This is why perfume houses are developing sustainable materials or ingredients from upcycling. In my opinion, green chemistry is a response to this complex issue, which is very topical at Coty. Premium Beauty News - What brief did you give to the Perfumer Michel Almairac for this new product? Karole Stanislas - Behind the brief, there was a desire to reinterpret the signature fragrance by giving it a new facet, with this creative requirement. We wanted the fragrance to give off this naturalness, olfactively, as clear evidence. Through green facets in particular, which express this idea of nature, of a garden in bloom. Premium Beauty News - This Eau de parfum is composed of ""100% natural"" ingredients. Can you tell us more from a technical point of view? Karole Stanislas - Perfumer Michel Almairac worked with beautiful natural materials (rose, citron, neroli and cedar), coming from organic farming and eco-responsible channels. In this respect, the brand was determined to be transparent. This formula also includes isolates, which are molecules extracted from a plant via a chemical process, provided that they contain more than 50% renewable carbon. I wasn't involved in the creative process, but the renewable materials that perfume houses - in this case, Robertet - have been developing recently were also a challenge. Premium Beauty News - You are the first major brand to offer a ""natural"" Eau de parfum. Is this a turning point for the future of perfumery? Karole Stanislas - The craze for this type of perfumery is real, but I am not sure that it will become a trend of its own in the selective segment. Perfumers are indeed more and more approached for this type of project, which demonstrates the public's expectations. But I don't think that all the big brands are ready to take the step. It is a delicate subject, which comes up against the strong industry lobby and the lack of transparency surrounding the formulation. The choice of natural, high-quality materials is also expensive. The trend towards ""naturals"" is already well established in the beauty care or niche perfumery sectors. It is now taking its first steps in the selective sector, as part of a global ecological awareness. Indeed, big brands are increasingly launching initiatives to use ""cleaner"" or eco-responsible materials. It remains to be seen how green chemistry can reshape the perfumery of tomorrow."
"L'Odaïtès, a family adventure and ""a real feast for the skin""","Before being a cosmetics brand, L'Odaïtès is first and foremost a story of family transmission and legacy. Nabilla Chemillier, Co-founder and General Manager of the brand, and her two sisters, also involved in the adventure, grew up with their grandmother, a pharmacist. Between picking plants in orchards and gardens, distilling floral waters and preparing essential oils, they discovered the practices of the Mediterranean apothecary tradition and learned various traditional skincare techniques. Each of the three sisters has expertise in a different field: Alya owns a pharmaceutical laboratory while Sofia is a chemist, and Nabila used to work in statistics and accounting. When their grandmother passed away, they decided to carry on her savoir-faire. ""We wanted to keep the same rigorous quality approach in terms of raw materials, hence the exclusive use of cold-pressed or extracted active ingredients to preserve their biological richness,"" explains Nabila Chemillier. This is how the three sisters joined forces to found L'Odaïtès. The name of the brand, created in 2015, is a reference-tribute to this legacy, via Daïtes, the Greek god who invented feasting. ""Our products are designed to offer a feast to the skin and make a nod to dates, the emblematic fruit of the Mediterranean basin,"" explains the Manager. Cold extraction is one of the founding principles of the brand. This process ensures that the biological richness of raw materials is preserved as much as possible. ""We work with virgin vegetable oils, even if they are difficult to stabilise. We also focus on the packaging to preserve the finished product in the bottle as much as possible."" This is why the brand has chosen brown glass bottles, which are more efficient in protecting the product from light, or airless containers, which protect sensitive actives from oxidation. Another founding element of the brand is the choice of active ingredients from the Mediterranean basin, particularly from desert areas, such as dates. ""It is an unparalleled ingredient, the sap is extremely rich in polyphenols, its ORAC index is 3 times higher than that of grapes,"" stresses Nabila Chemillier. The date also contains many trace elements and polysaccharides to boost cell communication for a radiant complexion. The stone of the date is also used. Transformed into oil and powder, which is excellent for exfoliation. In the end, this fruit is used in five products of the L'Odaïtès range. Like neroli, orange blossom essential oil is one of the brand's flagship ingredients, both as an active ingredient and olfactory signature. Finally, following the practices of their grandmother, the three sisters wanted to create a brand that was as natural as possible. ""From the outset, a lot of work had to be done to formulate with natural preservatives, 100% plant-based emulsifiers, natural stabilisers, etc., in perfect adequacy with our choice of noble botanical raw materials."" Right from the start, the brand has been committed to educating consumers, particularly about the difference between virgin and refined oils. For L'Odaïtès, it is this choice that ultimately comes first, before choosing between organic or conventional oil, because, unlike refined oil, virgin oil will be packed with all its nutrients (essential fatty acids, vitamins, etc.) and will therefore bring real benefits to the skin. But choosing fresh ingredients and limiting preservatives comes at a price! ""A virgin oil is twice as expensive as a refined oil,"" explains Nabila Chemillier. Thus resulting in a top-of-the-range positioning and a distribution targeting specialised outlets. ""We have given priority to niche perfumeries, spas and apothecary-type pharmacies."" Proud to be made in France, L'Odaïtès is now distributed in a hundred or so outlets, mainly in Europe, especially in France and Italy, but also in the United States, on the coast via a local distributor, and in Morocco and Senegal. For an indie brand, distribution is a major challenge and the key to success, especially in France where retail sales are highly concentrated, particularly in the selective circuit. To broaden its offer and meet current expectations, the brand will launch a food supplement at the end of the year. A face serum is also in preparation for next year. ""After the lock-downs, consumers have somewhat abandoned make-up in favour of skincare. They are no longer trying to conceal their wrinkles and are looking for a radiant and luminous complexion, by using either cosmetics or food supplements,"" points out the General Manager."
"Following Singapore, Maison 21G bespoke perfumes go global","Has Johanna Monange found the formula that will finally bring luxury perfumery into the new millennium? By combining quality ingredients, personalisation, accessibility, digital and experiential, she has succeeded in fulfilling the key expectations of young consumers with a brand that is refined, luxurious, without being haughty... And the success is there with a dazzling expansion! Today, the brand has three outlets in Singapore's most prestigious locations: after opening a boutique in the chic Duxton district, Maison 21G entered the luxurious Marina Bay Sands shopping centre in July, before recently moving to the Takashimaya Shopping Centre on Orchard Road. On the export front, the brand has already established itself in Hong Kong, Australia and Thailand, and is about to make its debut in the Middle East, with the support of the Chalhoub Group, and in the United States at Bloomingdale's. The next stop for the brand, is China of course, where growth rates in niche perfumery are skyrocketing, with plans for a boutique opening as early as 2022, then probably Europe, with a boutique in Paris in 2023. But the priority remains Asia, where Maison 21G believes it is well placed to meet the strong demand for quality and original fragrances from the younger generation. Like others, Johanna Monange, founder and CEO of the young brand, has observed the disruption of make-up by direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands. To achieve the same results in the world of perfumes, this former IFF chose to target young consumers in South Asia, China and India where, with a penetration rate of less than 1%, niche perfumery has significant growth potential. She relied on influencers and above all on a brand concept that was innovative, consistent and reassuring. ""We have strived to reinvent the entire customer experience, both online and in retail. We offer many possibilities for customising perfumes, but also bottles while offering high quality, transparent and sustainable French perfumery,"" explains the founder. Maison 21G offers a range of 35 combinable fragrances, developed with IFF's perfumers. It is thus possible to create one's made-to-measure perfumes on-demand using ad hoc technology. If they wish so, consumers can be guided in their creation by a quiz - online or in-store - based on their personality, favourite fragrances and ingredients. And of course, the 30 ml bottles can also be personalised with a message and an image. A double roller bottle concept has even been developed to allow customers to adapt their perfume to the different moments of the day. Along the same line, the brand has wanted to unleash the creativity of customers with its range of home fragrances! Maison 21G has designed Dual Candles that allow two different scents to be easily combined to create a personalised home ambience. A set of mini candles also made to be combined at will, allows creating the unique olfactory signature of one's home. Finally, the Luciole Olfactive oil burner allows the twelve scented oils of the Maison 21G collection to be combined to create the desired ambience, for indoor or outdoor use. Most of the fragrances are mixed fragrances, and all are 100% vegan, free of preservatives, GMOs, CMR substances and phthalates. The bottles are refillable and the brand aims for zero plastic waste. To make its young customers feel at ease, the brand has freed itself from the lingo of perfumery experts. Maison 21G does not refer to chypre or citrus fragrances but to ingredients: bergamot, jasmine, rose, citrus fruits... ""New World wines have succeeded in making their mark worldwide with a simple approach based on grape varieties. In the same way, I believe that the narrative on perfumes should be made accessible to as many people as possible,"" stresses Johanna Monange. The choice of small sizes (30ml), which are more affordable (less than 100 dollars) than large sizes, follows the same logic. The small formats also help to maintain the interest of Millennials and Gen Z, the core target of Maison 21G, who are fond of new products but not very loyal, and who can thus more easily build up a varied ""olfactory wardrobe"". Again to bring the brand closer to its consumers, Johanna Monange very quickly relied on influencers and invested in social media. ""We invited KOLs to create their own perfumes, to try our discovery kits, to educate themselves about perfume,"" she explains. The IRL experience has not been forgotten, with in-store workshops, on reservation, and an omnichannel shopping experience allowing, among other things, to easily find in-store the olfactory profiles and fragrances created online. After two successful fundraisings, the brand looks to the future with optimism. ""Today, there is a real interest in perfume among the younger generations in Asia, including China,"" concludes Johanna Monange. ""We don't just offer customisable perfumes, but perfumes that can be adapted to different times of the day, to different seasons, just like clothes."""
Upcycling and transparency: J.U.S Parfums successfully plays with trends,"Originally, J.U.S was only a bet: Thierry de Baschmakoff, Artistic Director and designer, wanted to illustrate all the current trends that were not found in perfume at a trade show dedicated to alternative brands: upcycling, open-source (i.e., the release of the formula), DIY. For instance, for this project, the bottles are recycled, their decoration consists of a self-made balloon envelope, the composition of the juice devised by Céline Ellena is communicated and displayed, the furniture is second-hand... At the venue, the concept is a hit among visitors and professionals alike. ""The perception was very positive, which we did not expect. The visitors' reaction to the fact that the perfumer's formula was released made us realise that this was a real enhancement of the perfumer's profession,"" details Thierry de Baschmakoff. With the support of Brigitte Worsmer and Jean Baptiste Roux, Thierry de Baschmakoff decided to transform the idea into a real brand with the priority of keeping the concept's original ingredients. J.U.S, for Joyau Unique et Sensoriel, was launched in 2018. The upcycling aspect lies in the reuse of old moulds from the glassmaker Waltersperger to make the bottles. ""There is a mix of genres. We also used water-based lacquering to protect the juices from the light and give them a slight pop effect,"" adds the designer. These screw-neck bottles can be refilled whatever their size via aluminium refills or at the perfume bar installed at Le Printemps Paris. Upcycling also concerns merchandising. The material used at the point of sale comes exclusively from recycled materials, right down to the pencil jars from the 1970s. The juices of the 12 fragrances were created by some of today's most talented perfumers in the French perfume industry, in collaboration with Brigitte Worsmer, who was in charge of the olfactory creative coordination. Céline Ellena, Aliénor Massenet, Alexandra Carlin and Aurélien Guichard were given carte blanche, with the commitment to communicate their formulas in complete transparency. ""The idea of open source was not easy at first, but perfumers finally accepted it, realising that transparency is a fundamental trend. It also allows the perfumer's work to be promoted and the ingredients to be highlighted. It leads to a more open and sophisticated language,"" assures Thierry de Baschmakoff. Under the impetus and management of Jean-Baptiste Roux, the brand is gaining a foothold. In addition to its online sales platform, it is available in seven (and soon ten) perfume stores in France, as well as in the various Printemps stores. Internationally, it is present in various outlets in Russia and the Middle East. A recent round of financing has also enabled the company to accelerate its development in Europe, where it will soon enter stores in Spain, Switzerland and Poland, as well as in China and Korea, where new store openings are planned. ""We are on a good development trend. We still have plenty of markets to open in Asia, such as Indonesia, or Japan, where consumers could appreciate this type of alternative brand,"" adds the manager. On the product side, two new formats of 25 and 50 ml are in the making. ""We are also working on new juices to go even further on the olfactory side. Next year, we plan to launch a new line of scented candles with an original approach in terms of design, still based on the upcycling of the item. Finally, we don't rule out collaborating in a project on spirits one day,"" concludes Thierry de Baschmakoff."
"MakeMyMask, the combination of bespoke, natural and home-made cosmetics","A pharmacist by training, Julie Pernet initially formulated for herself, masks based on Ayurvedic powders to deal with hair loss issues she was experiencing following a pregnancy. ""Although Ayurvedic powders are already proposed by DIY cosmetic specialists, their use is still reserved for experienced users because there are a lot of different solutions available. I wanted to democratize and simplify the use of these powders and lift the two main barriers, which are the choice of powders according to one's skin condition and the way to blend them together in the best possible way,"" explains the creator. During two years, she developed an algorithm referencing all these powders, as well as the vegetable and essential oils that she considered essential. She then defined six scalp care objectives (detox, strength, lightness, growth, cleansing and beauty), to which 60 different types of powders were suited. ""To have strong and beautiful hair, you have to work at the root level to deliver all the nutrients. The scalp needs balanced nutrients to produce sebum, keratin and all the hair fibres,"" she says. Each mask has four essential ingredients, explains the designer: a fortifying and detoxifying ayurvedic powder selected to address the main issue; a nourishing plant oil selected to match the hair type; a treating essential oil based on the type of scalp (oily, normal or sensitive) and an aloe vera powder to moisturise and regenerate. The bespoke typology is determined from an online diagnosis that will allow selecting the right ingredients. ""You don't necessarily have to have a specific issue to deal with, it can simply be to make your hair look more beautiful and shiny, in which case you will opt for the beauty cure,"" explains Julie Pernet. For each concern, there is a cure box that includes: 4 sachets of powders to make 4 masks to apply once a week; the essential oil; the vegetable oil; the application brush and the jar to make the mixture in. Each element can then be ordered separately. ""I've pre-measured each element which means that the user only has to mix the three ingredients, add water and have her mask fresh and ready to apply, in 30 seconds,"" she adds. The ingredients are natural and organic, and the packaging is designed with an eco-responsible glass and cardboard profile. The closure system of the powder bags is made of oxo-degradable plastic. The cure box with 4 masks is available at the price of 45 euros. The ritual also includes a shampoo and a detangling balm, both natural, to be used after applying the mask, (35 euros each). Launched last February, MakeMyMask already claims a 50% repeat purchase rate. The founder plans to develop new hair care products to democratise the DIY approach to cosmetics. ""There is a strong demand for vegetable dyes. I would like to find a partner specialised in this field to develop a complementary quality offer,"" she adds."
"MS Beautilab acquires Gi Picco's, a European specialist for cosmetic powders","Olivier Salaun nailed his colours to the mast shortly after his appointment as head of Marvinpac: MS Beautilab - the Beauty Division of the Swiss group - would benefit from significant investments in order to strengthen its product portfolio, its innovation capabilities and its geographic reach. Dubbed ""Pulse 2025"", the company's strategy aims to strengthen its skincare and make-up as well as its international development. MS Beautilab has just taken a first step with the acquisition of GI Piccos Cosmetics, an Italian makeup manufacturer specializing in coloured powders. ""Gi Picco's technology is next-generation in powder manufacturing. They offer incredibly creative and attractive solutions that are influenced by the world of design, art and Italian fashion. It has been in GI Picco's DNA since 1967,"" explains Olivier Salaun. ""They are also very much anchored in a sustainable and economic reality to respond to brands globally."" According to Irene Inguaggiato, General Manager of Gi Picco's, the Italian company has a perfect mastery of cutting edge technologies such as Top Injection, which makes it possible to formulate powders from a mix of solid and liquids. ""This allows for a more creamy, luxurious and luminous formula, which is higher in iridescence than pressed powders"", she says. Enrico Colombo, Director of Operations, specifies: ""Unlike Back-Injection, Top Injection lets several shades to be poured without a separator, allowing for varied compositions, three-dimentional decorations and the customization of a palette. Patterns that are raised or embossed, pearlescence, glitter effects, - anything is possible!"" This is a beautiful illustration of Gi Picco's motto: L'idea diventa colore (""The idea becomes colour""). Following this merger MS BeautiLab now operates three make-up and skincare R&D laboratories (located in France, Italy and Switzerland), and four production sites including a full service facility in Czech Republic. Other international developments are expected, especially in North America. To be continued !"

"""Omnichannel is a priority for luxury beauty retail,"" Wolfgang Baier, LUXASIA","To reach their ambitious double digit annual growth targets, LUXASIA has been investing heavily into technology and teams, collaborating closely with retail partners, to become the omnichannel leader on the Asia-Pacific luxury beauty stage. And this proved to be a key asset when the new coronavirus began to spread around the world. ""We have been enhancing our online retail for several years, and when COVID-19 hit we were more than ready, with more than 250 e-commerce stores already serving customers in the whole region,"" says Wolfgang Baier, Group CEO of LUXASIA. ""In 2020, driven by the pandemic, our total online sales skyrocketed by more than three times, with one of our business units even achieving 60% online share of total sales for the year."" With more than 120 luxury brands in their portfolio, 8000 points-of-sale, 2000 talents employed, and numerous joint ventures with major luxury players such as LVMH, Shiseido, Yves Rocher and Puig, LUXASIA serves 15 markets representing more than 3 billion potential consumers, who are now eager to return to normal. ""We might be biased, but Asia-Pacific is the place to be for beauty and retail now,"" emphasizes Baier. LUXASIA understood way earlier on that omnichannel was a priority for businesses looking to gain an edge in the new retail landscape. The company began its omnichannel journey five years ago. Baier decided to enhance the group's ecommerce and digital capabilities and to implement a consumer analytics-led approach to both its brick-and-mortar and online strategies. To help brands successfully achieve their online aspirations and provide them with relevant tools, LUXASIA has launched LEAP Commerce, a regional full-service e-commerce enabler covering all digital channels: online marketplaces, mono- & multi-brand sites, and social commerce. The platform is forecast to generate 2 million transactions this year, and LUXASIA's aim is to grow sales up to ten times in the next five years. Its next frontier would also be to accelerate and dominate luxury beauty social commerce. The Asia Pacific distributor has consumer-centricity at its core, with a database that includes more than 1.5 million luxury consumers, with validated preferences, growing at a rate of 30,000 to 40,000 consumers monthly. LUXASIA wants to know not only what people bought, but what they are looking for and their preferences. ""Data is crucial for customer engagement,"" highlights Baier. All LUXASIA's retail staff are equipped with tablets linked to its CRM engine, providing visibility of customer preferences and past purchases. This empowers the retail workforce with information to make recommendations that resonate, enabling effective up-selling and cross-selling. ""We invested massively over the last years to train and develop our 2000 LUXASIANs, especially on customer relationship management and digital marketing,"" explains the CEO. Beyond in-store engagements, LUXASIA also uses its CRM engine, Salesforce, and the accompanying AI solution to drive consistent yet impactful consumer marketing. In parallel, it has been critical albeit challenging to adapt its supply chain and operations to this business model shift. As LUXASIA manages most of its warehouses, it was possible to transform them over the past years. ""Our fulfilment centers are now ecommerce-ready, optimised for both B2B and B2C operations,"" says Baier. The company continues to invest into its technology infrastructure, including the warehouse management system, order management system, as well as a middleware that smoothens ecommerce operations across numerous online marketplaces in multiple languages and geographies. While 30%-50% of all luxury sales in the Asia-Pacific region are expected to come from online in the near future, with social commerce being the next big wave, Wolfgang Baier says players need to streamline and enhance their omni-retail networks. As far as brick-and-mortar stores are concerned, this means they have to be fully integrated to the whole omnichannel system while providing a high-value additional experience. According to Baier, niche brands have a huge potential in providing such high-end experiences, both online and in-store. LUXASIA has been shaping receptivity and growth of niche beauty in Singapore for more than 15 years through its Escentials omni-retail concept, combining an boutique website and three brick-and-mortar stores. Escentials carry leading niche luxury brands such as Creed, Acqua di Parma, Frédéric Malle, Diptyque, Maison Francis Kurkdjian, Penhaligon's, Byredo and so on. ""Asian consumers are becoming much more concerned with what they are buying, the story behind it and how they differentiate themselves with it,"" states Baier. To capture the galloping niche beauty interest and demand across the region, LUXASIA will be launching Escentials in Malaysia with the opening of a new site in October 2021 and a retail store in Kuala Lumpur in November 2021, followed by an expansion into Thailand and Vietnam in 2022. Truly exciting times for luxury and niche beauty in Asia Pacific."
ADA bets on a sustainable approach combined with an expansion towards Asia,"As a hotel industry supplier, ADA Cosmetics International has faced the full impact of the coronavirus pandemic. This situation was anything but a perfect start for CEO Kai Bendix, who assumed management responsibility for the tradition-rich company shortly after the first lockdown in July 2020. But the challenges were already enormous prior to that, with a strong competitive pressure, and the rise of environmental awareness and social responsibility issues. To meet these challenges, the German hotel cosmetics manufacturer plans to sharpen its brand positioning, invest massively in the development of sustainable product innovations, and in CSR commitments. According to the company, this paradigm shift calls for the development of new solutions that put sustainability at the heart of product development. ""This means that instead of doing whatever is technically feasible, we develop product solutions that contribute to the bigger picture,"" says Kai Bendix. The company's R&D department is already working intensively on innovations with a focus on the careful use of resources, the avoidance of waste, and efficient recycling. A return system for empty cartridges and a method for aseptic filling of open dispenser systems are also in the works. At the beginning of next year, ADA plans to launch a new, completely sustainable cosmetics range that will include everything from shower gel to nail files. Work is continuing on packaging that will significantly increase the use of recycled and renewable materials. To boost its growth, the company is planning to expand in Asia's growth markets, primarily in China. A new structure was established in the country to coordinate sales activities – from supply chain to marketing – across national boundaries. Another aspect of the new ADA Cosmetics strategy is to build up the company's innovative strength. With this in mind, the management team is on the lookout worldwide for exciting, young skin-care brands as potential partners. This offers a lot of potential for both sides. Furthermore, company plans to enter the consumer business and build a second foothold. ""In the coming years, the 'New ADA' will help make us stronger, more innovative, and more sustainable than ever before,"" concludes Bendix."
"Online sampling, a major factor in product discovery, according to Odore","Now a specialist in online sampling campaigns, Odore first made a name for itself by placing connected sample dispensers in strategic urban locations. The start-up works with beauty brands and groups such as L'Oréal, Sephora, Guerlain, Clive Christian and LVMH to improve the performance of online campaigns through a data-driven marketing approach. As sales become increasingly digital, more and more beauty brands are using digital marketing in conjunction with sampling to track the previously hard-to-measure conversion of consumers using targeted campaigns. Thanks to the Odore platform, brands can create and launch digital campaigns on social media, by email and on their site, alongside physical sampling. With its platform, Odore was able to analyse the purchasing habits of 20,000 consumers of beauty and cosmetic products over 12 months and thus deliver various telling data on the behaviour of consumers when faced with the sample. According to the study, 85% of those who tested a product did not know the brand beforehand. Once they had tested the product, 75% of the respondents said they had bought or were likely to buy the product. Beyond the well-known role of sampling in the discovery of new products, Odore also highlights the relevance of sending samples to people's homes. Indeed, despite their interest in the tested products, only 33% of respondents said they would have gone to a shop to try the product. Receiving the sample at home is clearly a conversion booster, even more so when coupled with an online purchase offer. ""The spikes in conversion rates and brand awareness clearly show the role that digital sampling can play in helping confidential brands make a name for themselves,"" explains Armaan Mehta, co-founder of Odore."

The launch of a first fragrance for a fashion brand is also expected to be announced next month. The founders of the new structure have pledged to place eco-responsibility at the heart of the Drim Tim's approach, thanks to the so-called Eco Tim unit, which is in charge of finding sustainable solutions to improve the ecological performance of the products they create."

TechnicoFlor celebrates 40th anniversary and inaugurates new automated factory,"TechnicoFlor's 5,000 sqm new production facility will allow the family business to double its production capacity, bringing it to 2,000 tonnes of perfumes per year. Moreover, thanks to the automation of the entire process, TechnicoFlor plans to halve the duration of its operations and thus be able to supply its customers in less than 5 days. The cornerstone of this new facility is a modular robot of more than 40 meters long with very short production cycles that can weight more than 500 liquid raw materials and produce several sizes of orders at the same time (from 5 to 1000 litres ). In addition, a module dedicated to powders can process 20 different raw materials with weights ranging from 30 mg to 1000 kg. To avoid pumps, the products are entirely filled using gravity. A state-of-the-art R&D laboratory completes the brand new construction. Of course, the site has been designed to reduce the environmental impact of production activities. ""With the new site and the help of all of our perfumers and employees, we are able to create innovative formulas that respect nature, and supply our customers with very short delays"", explains François-Patrick Sabater, Founder and Chairman of TechnicoFlor. The company, which currently generates 55 million euros in turnover, intends to use these new production tools to boost its growth and reach its target of 100 million euros within three years. Already selling in more than 60 countries - in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Western Europe and Central Europe - TechnicoFlor plans to open a new creative centre in Moscow and to build a new production site in Shanghai, in the so-called Beautéville, China's new ""Cosmetic Valley"". The company, which specializes in natural and responsible compositions, is also strengthening its environmental commitments by participating in the creation of a new fair trade supply-chain in Burkina Faso. After launching a responsible purchasing program in 2020, as well as a perfume biodegradability calculator, TechnicoFlor now wants to launch an ""Eco-Score"" in order to offer more transparency to consumers."
"Clever Beauty, green and anti-waste nail polishes","Tired of seeing her mother transfer the remains of her nail polishes from one bottle to the other to avoid wastage, Maëva Bentitallah, a young committed entrepreneur and founder of Clever Beauty, wanted to bring a concrete solution to a waste problem related to the length of the brush in the bottle. ""According to the tests carried out, between 15 and 48% of the product can be lost, depending on the brand. I pushed the doors of a Fablab, which proposed 3D software, to create an anti-waste cap system that would allow recovering the remaining 20% that can be lost on average in nail polish bottles. We had to find a configuration where the brush becomes longer when the bottle is opened, hence this push-button system. When you open the bottle, you press the button and the brush goes down. Once closed, the system is locked,"" she explains. In collaboration with the specialised French supplier Fiabila, Clever Beauty nail polishes also offer a cleaner alternative formula, free of 10 controversial ingredients and made from bio-sourced solvents derived from cotton, corn and cassava. The formula is considered safe for little girls from 3 years old, pregnant and breastfeeding women. ""We also sell to beauty salons, which use a lot of polish daily, and can experience tolerance problems. Professionals breathe in more than 3,000 molecules every day, so there's a real issue here,"" emphasises the founder. These green nail polishes claim to be equivalent to their conventional counterparts in terms of staying power (4 to 6 days with a good application), shine and coverage. The range of 14 references is available in 11 colours, deemed essential and chosen by the brand's community to advocate responsible consumption, and three care, base and fruit vitamin-enriched polishes. The bottles are recyclable after use. ""At the request of our customers, we have also launched a natural nail polish remover, the first returnable nail polish remover with a pump to apply the right amount of product,"" adds Maëva Bentitallah. The products are made in France by promoting short circuits and are filled and assembled by workers with disabilities in Marseille. The founder's idea is to develop a complete and consistent make-up range, based on the brand's DNA, which seeks to combine natural formulas without compromising on quality, and clever packaging. She recently finalised a crowdfunding campaign for her new #Invincible Mascara and launched pre-orders on her website. ""This will be the first mascara in a refillable glass bottle with organic actives and made in France. The user keeps the brush and only buys the glass mascara refill. We worked 8 months on the formula to propose French sourced actives and to remain intransigent in terms of quality and wear,"" she specifies. Clever Beautyproducts are sold online as well as on Nocibé.fr and through 200 partners in France and 9 countries, including Switzerland, Luxembourg, the United States, Iceland, and in Douglas perfumeries in Italy."
Granado's global targets change the game on the Brazilian market,"With Bossa, which was launched in Brazil for Christmas 2020, and then in France in March 2021, Granado aimed to celebrate its 150th anniversary with a fragrance just as iconic as Carioca: five years earlier, the latter had symbolized the peak of the brand's effort to rebuild itself around its historic cradle, the centre of Rio de Janeiro. ""If Carioca evokes Rio's botanic garden, in the city itself, Bossa tells the story of a walk on the long beaches of Ipanema and Copacabana,"" explains its creator Cécile Zarokian. And yet, both floral and solar, Bossa does not have the heavy notes often associated with tropical beaches. The vivid top notes (lemon, tangerine, petitgrain) balance the sweeter, more floral middle scents (frangipani, musk). ""I didn't want a substitute with heavy monoï and coconut notes, I was too scared to fall into the usual clichés of the French girl discovering Brazil,"" emphasizes Cécile Zarokian. To seize the city smell, she had frequent, long walks in the Urca neighbourhood, right at the feet of the Sugarloaf Mountain, where the ocean smell is carried by a soft, fresh breeze. Created in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, Bossa is also meant to be joyful, positive, full of glee – an echo to the Cariocas and their legendary joie de vivre. ""The project went real fast: I left my first meeting with the Granado team with briefs. Then, the brand liked my creation's originality a lot: they thought it was both innovative on the Brazilian market and accessible to most,"" recalls Cécile Zarokian. Indeed, just like its predecessor Carioca, Bossa was supposed to solve a complex equation: representing Rio as the perfect gift for tourists coming to Brazil, without being grotesque, so it could also seduce Brazilian customers, this historic brand being so dear to them. When interviewed by Alessandra Tucci, the founder of Paralela Escola Olfativa, partner of Cinquième Sens in Brazil, Granado's Marketing Director Sissi Freeman explained Cécile Zarokian's choice by the importance the brand attaches to innovation: ""For this project, we had invited Cécile as well as other perfumers from composition companies. And she got it immediately. She managed to convey what we wanted perfectly well: the sea's lightness – Rio's lightness. We had wanted a sophisticated coconut note in our collection for so long."" ""It has been a few years since Granado started making considerable efforts to reconnect with its roots and upgrade its offering. They aim to set the standard of a Brazilian perfumery that finds an echo all around the world,"" explains Cécile Zarokian. Supported by Puig, which took a stake in the Brazilian group in 2016 and owns the Phebo brand, the true symbol of the country's art of perfume, Granado takes its time to let juices macerate – if it is a key practice in traditional French perfumery, it is little used in Brazil. To meet ever-more demanding local customers' expectations, extreme care is taken of the bottles, caps, and cases. The case graphics, hardly retouched by Granado's designers, were directly taken from the brand's archives. How can this not strengthen the love story between Brazil and perfumes? The country is the second largest market in the world in volume, neck and neck with the USA, and the third or fourth largest in value, depending on the current exchange rates. Now, if economic difficulties weigh heavily on their expenses, Brazilians are very knowledgeable about global fragrances, now widely distributed in all big cities. Even niche perfumes are getting popular! If most global brands on this segment are still unaffordable to a large majority of consumers, local players offer their own interpretation of the concept, as can be seen with the Boticário group: last April, they launched O.U.I, a high-end perfume line designed in France and produced in Brazil. In addition, the investments in quality made by Brazilian brands are paying off: in 2020, in the middle of the Covid crisis, perfume sales in the country rose by 8.4%, according to the Brazilian association of the personal hygiene, cosmetics and perfumes industry (ABIHPEC). ""Brazilians are increasingly surprised by national perfume brands' offerings. In addition to make very high quality products, they have kept investing in innovation over the past few years,"" says João Carlos Basilio, President of ABIHPEC. With Bossa, Granado was the first major Brazilian brand to decide to work with an independent French perfumer. Still, the fragrance, which can be found in multiple other products, from soap to shower gels or candles, was entirely produced in Brazil. ""To make the juice, I worked with my local partner, Vollmens. In the middle of the sanitary crisis, they managed to import raw materials unavailable in Brazil, like lemon from Argentina, tangerine from Italy, and a few synthetic molecules I specifically requested,"" recalls Cécile Zarokian. If the launch in France, meant to be boosted with a pop-up store at Galeries Lafayette Champs-Élysées, did not go as expected due to the third lockdown during which physical points of sale closed between April 3 and May 3, 2021, Bossa's sales now seem to be in line with the brand's expectations. According to Alessandra Tucci, perfume, strategy and innovation expert and founder of training company Paralela Escola Olfativa, in São Paulo, Brazil, it is actually ""the floral, solar fragrance that was missing on the Brazilian market""."
"La Beauté Française, the BtoB marketplace for Made-in-France indie brands","For Marie-Laure Durier, the Founder and Director of this new player in the French market, the explosion of new eco-responsible cosmetic brands, which coincides with new consumer expectations and purchasing habits, implies a transformation of distribution methods. ""We need to accelerate the off-line and on-line consumer experience,"" she explains. After 25 years in the luxury sector, this former Clarins and Guerlain executive noticed the absence of young French green beauty brands on the shelves of retailers, at a time when consumers are on the lookout for committed French brands. This sparked the idea of a platform capable of facilitating and accelerating the setting up of contacts between young brands and retailers. ""Young brands often find it difficult to find outlets or retailers because when they start up, they often only have about ten references whereas a large group will often offer more than 300; it's not the same return on investment for a buyer,"" underlines the entrepreneur. Marie-Laure Durier believes that independent brands have a key role to play in revitalising the French cosmetics market, one of the most challenging in the world, with a highly concentrated distribution system and consumers used to a very high level of quality. According to her, among the many local and independent brands that are created each year, there are many promising companies capable of shifting lines, especially with more responsible products. ""We exclusively chose French brands, with a clean formula and aiming for zero waste. We are looking for disruptive and committed products, such as chewable toothpaste, waterless formulas, bamboo fibre linen, natural perfumes,..."". To facilitate the interaction between these start-ups and the various distributors in the sector, La Beauté Française does not require any subscription, nor any fixed costs, and only pays itself via a commission on the sales made. Access to the platform, therefore, does not involve any drain on the brands' cash flow as long as no sales have been made. The platform also makes it easier to grasp the complexity of retailing and to access its variety in a much easier way. ""Distribution channels on the platform are varied, such as in-home players, beauty salons, hairdressers/barbershops, hotel spas, drugstores and pharmacies, perfumeries, perfumery groups and chains, department stores and travel retail,"" details Marie-Laure Durier. For her project, the founder wanted a technological solution capable of managing the complexity of the sector, adapted to the needs of professionals while offering an attractive and functional interface. ""In addition to cosmetic products, we also have products for professionals such as linen, aesthetic outfits, or gift packs,"" she explains. We chose to manage the variety of products through a system of tabs allowing for easy navigation between the different categories offered. To launch the first BtoB marketplace dedicated to French beauty, Marie-Laure Durier chose to work with the publisher Wizaplace. ""La Beauté Française was launched in a few months using our all-in-one marketplace solution. As with any BtoB platform, payment was a key issue. Adapting payment terms and allowing 30-day direct debit was a prerequisite for La Beauté Française to meet the expectations of both professional buyers and sellers,"" explains Eric Alessandri, CEO of Wizaplace. To access the platform, the various stakeholders must identify themselves and show that they belong to the beauty or well-being sector via an online registration form. Once their registration has been validated, retailers have access to professional prices for the different products on offer and only need to place an order!"

Lastly, as regards the three regions, we support customers in America, Europe, and increasingly often in Asia, thanks to our global network of responsible suppliers. Premium Beauty News - Albéa has diversified the group's historic business, then. What was your approach? Xavier Leclerc de Hauteclocque - The success of the IBG concept is based on four pillars, the first being agility. It is really our spearhead, because we promise an optimum development time, in particular by integrating design as early as the global product design phase. The second pillar is our ability to imagine comprehensive ranges of 20, 30 or 50 products. They can be turnkey solutions combining packs, formulas, and accessories, or only packaging made of plastic, wood, metal, or glass. The third is the tailor-made approach: we work in close collaboration with our customers, as an extension of their own teams. Ultimately, of course, we take advantage of Albéa's expertise in CSR. Although IBG is not an industrial manufacturer, the whole management team shares this historic sustainability commitment with me. Premium Beauty News - How did you come up with the idea of creating this service entity within the Albéa group? Xavier Leclerc de Hauteclocque - We wanted to serve complementary customers in a complementary manner. IBG has set up a very broad, most agile ecosystem for design and project management, which helps develop concepts from A to Z as well as comprehensive ranges on various market segments for both prestige and mass customers. Right from the start, our approach is customer-oriented: what matters is their positioning and wishes! Together, we imagine the best solution, find the best partners, and manage the project. Design and sustainable development – which plays an increasingly significant part – are definitely at the core of the project. In 2020, 86% of our customer proposals were eco-designed. We will reach 95% in 2021 with packs, formulas, and also accessories! Premium Beauty News - What is your positioning on the market? Xavier Leclerc de Hauteclocque - We adapt to our customers' organization and to the project value chain. We have global teams, so we can stick to that pretty easily. We cover graphic design, design-to-cost, and product development with or without the formula. Plus, we manage our projects in an agility-oriented manner, by taking care of quality and regulatory management, logistics, and even digital matters, like product animation and social media! Premium Beauty News - What are your customers' main problems? Xavier Leclerc de Hauteclocque - Digitalization changed the game. Today, beyond the traditional product segmentation, our concepts need to take into account our customers' communities' expectations. As a matter of fact, expectations can vary from one country or distribution channel to another. This creates logistic and regulatory constraints, and it also requires great cultural awareness. Premium Beauty News - What are your objectives, development-wise? Xavier Leclerc de Hauteclocque - We aim to both keep developing our model on the American and European markets and widen our presence in Asia. I would also like to strengthen our collaboration with customers as regards CSR, a strategic, high-priority, transversal issue. There is still a gap between the ""green"" solutions we offer or can offer and our customers' choices. Lastly, digital technologies remain our second main development focus, in particular regarding customer experience in the long term. Actually, I believe that by getting consumers involved with brands' product strategies, responsible choices will prevail! Premium Beauty News - What conclusions do you draw from IBG's first year, given this oh-so particular context? Xavier Leclerc de Hauteclocque - We have all been affected by the pandemic, and many of us still are, from a personal, social, and economic standpoint. Within this context, we have taken advantage of the fact that most of our retailer customers were still able to welcome their clients during the various lockdown periods, which partly offset the collapse of air traffic and the difficulties encountered by other sales channels. That is what helped us get satisfactory results, and it was much encouraging given the fact it is such a young business. It also shows how increasingly important agility and flexibility are for brands. That is why I would like to seize this opportunity to warmly thank all my teams for being able to adapt this new, highly volatile environment."

Maison Lesquendieu revives their heritage of exceptional fragrances,"Founded in 1903, Maison Lesquendieu owes its international success in the early 1900s to the unfailing demanding nature of pharmacist and perfumer Joseph Lesquendieu, who was only content with exceptional compositions based on first-choice raw materials. ""My grandfather was anxious to stick to a small production. To him, no one could produce a lot without failing somewhere. There was a limit not to be exceeded to keep control of quality, from sourcing to the finished product. At that time, the brand developed in over 20 countries in ten years,"" explains Jérôme Lesquendieu. This product-oriented hyper luxury spirit made the brand highly successful up until its heyday, in the 1960s. Today, it is coming back thanks to Jérôme Lesquendieu's determination to offer the perfume world extreme refinement again, down to the smallest detail. ""I had this feeling there was no such brand reminding of the 1920s in the perfume world, unlike in the luxury aviation or car industries: there was no segment where people 'made the effort of excellence for something unnecessary'"", he says. To reach his target, the new Director was anxious to keep his grandfather's original method: he refused any tolerance to imperfections and preserved manual work to make small volumes. By immersing himself in the perfumer's archives, he revived five of the creations that best evoked Lesquendieu's journey throughout the 20th century. Of course, the first ""Historic"" perfume is the very first fragrance created in 1903, Lesquendieu Le Parfum. ""My grandfather was the son of a tanner, so there are leather notes, but also bergamot and jasmine notes. It is a particularly mysterious and sensual creation,"" explains Jérôme Lesquendieu. Then, there are Feu de Bengale, created in 1925 and based on Madagascar vanilla, and Bonne Fortune, a 1927 fresh citrus-based perfume ending with warm notes: ""it is the fragrance he wore the most,"" adds the Director. These are followed by Glorilis, a powerful spicy oriental perfume which dates back to 1953, and lastly, Lilice. ""My grandfather created this fragrance for my grandmother he called Lilice – only for his own personal use. I made this choice for the story it tells. It is a mixture of iris and rose, two fascinating materials complex to work with and balance."" Almost fully composed of natural materials, the juices boast a concentration of over 20% and last all day, as the original fragrances did. The bottles have the same bell shape as in the 1920s and display a few codes of that period. They are now decorated with a handmade pure 24-carat gold cap. Under Artistic Director Jérôme Lesquendieu, a new collection of five Oriental fragrances was recently launched in Dubai before being distributed in Europe in September. ""It is a completely different range which I directed based on my grandfather's travels to the Middle East,"" he explains. Maison Lesquendieu counts over 50 points of sale in Europe – Jovoy in France, the Four Seasons in Geneva, Switzerland – and in the Middle East. It keeps expanding on the global level, in particular in Asia, Russia, the UK, and Eastern countries. The fragrances are available for about 240 euros for the Historic range and 280 euros for the Oriental Collection."
Shiseido sells several prestige makeup brands to refocus on high-end skincare,"The operation marks a global strategic shift for Japan's largest cosmetics group, which is refocusing on higher-margin skin care products, particularly in Asia, with the aim to become a global leader in skin beauty by 2030. Earlier this year, Shiseido agreed to sell its mass market skin-care and toiletries business to CVC Capital Partners in a deal worth 160 billion yen (USD 1.5 billion or EUR 1.3 billion). Shiseido acquired Bare Escentuals-owned brands, bareMinerals and BUXOM in 2010, in a USD 1.9 billion deal. Laura Mercier was acquired in 2016 for or USD 248 million. According to the Japanese group, the combined sales of the three brands in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020, accounted for 4.9% of its consolidated net sales. The company said it will reinvest the funds obtained from the transfer into areas crucial for its long-term growth, ""such as development of key brands and acquisitions, mainly in the skin beauty category, digital transformation, and enhancement of production capabilities and innovations."" However, Shiseido will not be pulling out of the US, where it continues to market brands such makeup brands as Nars, Clé de Peau Beauté, the skincare line Drunk Elephant, and fragrance brands including Issey Miyake, Narciso Rodriguez, and Dolce&Gabbana. Launched in 1995, bareMinerals is a U.S. leader in mineral-based cosmetics and is considered the creator of ""clean beauty"". BUXOM, created in 2007, is a color cosmetics brand focused on ""going big, being bold, and feeling sexy."" It is ranked among the top five U.S. brands across various lip categories. Prestige makeup brand Laura Mercier was founded in 1996 and pioneered the natural, ""flawless face"" category. According to Tricia Glynn, a Managing Director at Advent, bareMinerals, BUXOM, and Laura Mercier are ""clear leaders in prestige beauty and are widely recognized for their quality, authenticity, and innovation, with differentiated products and devoted customers."" Advent will host the three brands into its newly formed affiliate, AI Beauty Holdings Ltd. Upon completion of the transaction, Pascal Houdayer, former Chief Executive Officer of NAOS (Bioderma, Esthederm, Etat Pur), will serve as Chief Executive Officer of the standalone business. ""We believe these brands have significant runway for growth, particularly as we see the large and growing color cosmetics market benefitting from secular tailwinds. I look forward to helping expand these brands across new products, channels, and regions, while enabling the new company to realize its full potential,"" said Pascal Houdayer."
The celebrities building business empires thanks to the beauty industry,"Who would have imagined 10 years ago that Rihanna would one day join the world's select club of billionaires at just 33 years old, not thanks to her music, but thanks to her shrewd business skills? The singer has built a veritable empire thanks to her cosmetics brand Fenty Beauty, launched in 2017, which she owns in equal parts with the LVMH group. The brand is based on a strong theme of inclusiveness with, for example, a single foundation available in dozens of shades. Now, Forbes reports that the brand was already bringing in more than US $550 million in annual revenue in 2018, just one year after its creation. Today, it's reportedly worth nearly US $2.8 billion, and recent launches (skincare, fragrances) suggest that the brand has far from finished growing. She may be known for her acting skills, but Jessica Alba is also a businesswoman who got into cosmetics a decade ago. The Honest Company, which offers natural beauty and baby products, is undoubtedly less popular than some cosmetic brands (with ""only"" 1 million followers on Instagram, compared to 10.8 million for Fenty Beauty by Rihanna). It is nevertheless still highly successful. According to a recent ranking by Cosmetify, the company has a turnover of US $300.5 million (compared to an estimated US $570 million for Rihanna's brand). Crowned the world's youngest billionaire in 2019 by Forbes, before being stripped of the title by the American magazine for inflating her income, Kylie Jenner can also boast of becoming a cosmetics mogul in just a few years — and she's only 24. The young woman — who capitalizes on her 255 million Instagram followers (25.1 million for her brand) — has got everything right with Kylie Cosmetics, which has scores of followers around the world, and an estimated revenue of nearly US $200 million, according to Cosmetify. The brand, which offers makeup and skincare, even outstrips KKW Beauty, the brand of her older sister Kim Kardashian, launched three years later. Note that for a few years now, celebrities have been launching their own beauty brands, whether in makeup or skin care. Lady Gaga, Millie Bobby Brown, Selena Gomez, Jennifer Lopez, Cindy Crawford and Miranda Kerr are just some of the celebrities who now have their own beauty brands."
The Hut Group takes over online beauty retailer Cult Beauty for £275 million,"Cult Beauty was co-founded in London in 2007 by Jessica DeLuca and Alexia Inge as an online specialist retailer of emerging, prestige beauty brands across skincare, haircare and cosmetics. Today, Cult Beauty stocks about 300 prestige beauty brands - including Charlotte Tilbury, Drunk Elephant and Huda Beauty - many of them (over 70%) being independent. According to The Hut Group, around two-thirds of these brands are not currently listed on the group's other beauty sites. The UK e-commerce giant sees this as an important opportunity to complete its offering. ""Cult Beauty is frequently the partner of choice for emerging indie brands due to its personalised, content-led approach and enthusiastic consumer base who are continually seeking new, innovative solutions to complement their beauty routines,"" THG chief executive Matthew Moulding said. ""Cult Beauty's first-to-market reputation makes the brand an exciting fit for our THG Beauty division,"" he added. The Hut Group plans to keep Cult Beauty's separate branding and identity intact. ""Due to its distinguished brand portfolio, Cult Beauty will retain a very clear identity within THG Beauty,"" highlighted the company in a statement. According to The Hut Group, this acquisition will also be an opportunity to develop Cult Beauty's international reach. Indeed, currently less than 50% of Cult Beauty's sales are made outside the UK. ""We anticipate fully migrating Cult Beauty onto the THG Ingenuity platform by the end of the year (within the first six months of acquisition), giving the brand access to the global digital features to underpin significant future growth,"" said Matthew Moulding. The acquisition will help The Hut Group to better address consumers' preferences globally. ""THG Beauty will principally service customers within North America via our Dermstore and Lookfantastic brands, while in the UK, Europe, Asia and the Rest of the World the key brands will be Lookfantastic and Cult Beauty,"" detailed Matthew Moulding. The Hut Group expects Cult Beauty to contribute sales of about £60m and adjusted EBITDA of about £3m for the remainder of FY 2021, and contribute sales of approximately £140m and adjusted EBITDA of £10m in FY 2022. Most recently, Sephora announced the acquisition of Feelunique, another major online retailer of prestige beauty products in the UK."
Sephora acquires Feelunique and makes first foray into the UK market,"LVMH-owned beauty retail heavyweight Sephora has agreed to buy online cosmetics retailer Feelunique in a deal that marks its first big push into the UK. The acquisition, which is subject to clearance by anti-trust authorities, is expected to be closed during the 2nd semester of 2021, according to Sephora. The amount of the transaction has not been disclosed, however British media have mentioned a total amount of 132 million pounds sterling (about 154 million euros). ""The transaction is a key step in Sephora's European growth strategy and marks a first step for Sephora's presence into the United Kingdom,"" commented Martin Brok, President and CEO of Sephora in a release. According to Sephora, the United Kingdom is one of the top 10 biggest prestige beauty markets worldwide, with a very high level of digital adoption. ""UK consumers have a strong appetite for a carefully curated Prestige Beauty offer that is tailored to their needs, and provided through a consumer-centric, seamless experience,"" adds Martin Brok. However, Boots' strong positions in this market has long been a big hurdle for the French group. Founded in 2005, Feelunique is a fast-growing business. To date, the e-commerce player claims 1.3 million active customers and stocks over 35,000 cosmetic and fragrance products from some 800 brands and ships to more than 120 countries worldwide, with a strong focus on the UK market. Earlier this year, Feelunique announced a record-breaking 12 months for the financial year, ended 29 March 2021 with sales increasing by 26%, in context where online purchases surged due to the global pandemic. Earnings before interest, tax and one-off costs (EBITDA) reached £2.5 million - up by £7.5 million from an EBITDA loss of £5 million the previous year. The acquisition of this key pure player also is also in line with Sephora's ambitions digital ambitions. While not in the same league as Sephora's global market share, Feelunique is a major player in the British e-commerce beauty market competing with sites such as Lookfantastic (The Hut Group) and Cult Beauty. Furthermore, Feelunique makes most of its sales with millennials and Gen Z consumers."
Anjac Health & Beauty makes innovation strategy more sustainable,"By purchasing five new companies over the past three years – Innovi, Pascual Cosmétiques, Feltor, Cosmetix West and Roval Cosmétiques –, the French group kept on with its external development strategy, becoming a comprehensive leader in cosmetics design and production. With its various expert, complementary units, including Aircos, Chemineau, Euro Wipes, LPEV, Incara, Shadeline, and Sicaf, Anjac Health & Beauty counts 20 production and R&D sites in France, the US, and Spain, and employs over 2,000 people for a consolidated turnover of 400 million euros. ""We have become a reference player in Europe. We support all brand profiles, from start-ups to major multinationals, by offering a broad range of products and technologies. We do have a Made-in-France offer, but we are also present in Spain and the US, in California, where our business was boosted starting from 2019,"" explains the group's CEO Aurélien Chauffour. Thanks to this growth strategy and various specializations, Anjac keeps investing in equipment and research to offer innovations driven by sustainability requirements. As an example, they invested in a line of masks with ""home compost"" ecodesigned materials and 99.9% of ingredients of natural origin, in a new stick packaging line for Pascual Cosmétiques – a makeup, casting, stick, and liquid formula expert – in order to meet customer expectations regarding solid products, and in a newly-built R&D laboratory for skincare and premium texture expert Sicaf Cosmétiques, which multiplied the company's creation and innovation surface area by ten. Anjac's innovation strategy is focused on sustainable formulas and packaging. ""90% of our innovations have a positive impact on CSR, thanks to environmental and societal benefits and a positive action on consumers' health. They include solid cosmetics in all forms (sticks, loose powder, pebbles…), an SPF booster which reduces the quantity of UV filters, a food supplement with a highly reduced glycemic index, and a natural alternative to glyphosate designed for other applications,"" reveals Marketing & Communication Director Anne Rutigliano. As for packaging, the group boasts many development projects, like Doypacks made of recyclable and compostable PE for Roval, an alternative to virgin plastic based on a 100% natural, compostable material developed by Innovi for injection and extrusion applications, and a recyclable, refillable PCR compact line for Aircos. In addition, Anjac Health & Beauty is the first manufacturer to have worked with Candice Colin's Beautylitic tool, which was initially intended for distributors to decipher the clean & safe profile of products based on algorithms. Thanks to this partnership with the French startup, the group can now screen all its innovations and part of its products. ""This tool makes it possible to characterize and objectify the clean nature of our products in full transparency, compare them to a panel of other marketed products, and address the key issue of ingredient biodiversity and environmental protection. We long anticipated the substitutions and alternatives to controversial ingredients, like silicones, talc, phenoxyethanol, etc. and we offer our customers other solutions,"" explains Anne Rutigliano. Guided by these commitments, the Anjac group imposes itself as a major player in an industry undergoing a real value transformation and is already embracing new consumption models."
Givaudan explores multiple ways to make eco-conscious perfumes,"""With Naturality, Givaudan opens up a new olfactory creation chapter by adopting more eco-conscious processes. This approach is in line with the company's raison d'être: Create with Love for Nature. It is all based on creating perfumes that convey our green commitments: reducing ingredient-related emissions by 20% by 2030 and a positive carbon footprint by 2050,"" explains Xavier Renard, Global Head of Fine Fragrances at Givaudan. ""Tomorrow's classics will still provide pleasure and wellness, but they will also meet the urgent requirements needed to protect our planet"". Environmental protection thus lies at the core of the perfumer's job. ""Over the past few years, consumers have grown aware of environmental issues and put them at the same level as the holistic approach,"" says Arnaud Guggenbuhl, Marketing Director of Fine Fragrance. To meet this expectation, Givaudan has got most of the company's teams involved to reduce its perfumes' environmental impact with two main priorities: revamp the perfumer's palette with renewable ingredients and guide perfumers towards a greener creative approach. Givaudan puts an emphasis on upcycling by optimizing each resource to create innovative green ingredients. The composition company has managed to obtain a natural peach essence derived from residues of fruit juice production in the US. It is a real technical feat, since they create natural fruit extracts that had not existed so far with a highly reduced environmental impact. The same approach was adopted for green chemistry and synthetic ingredients. Thanks to the Five Carbon Path programme, Givaudan optimizes the synthesis of perfume molecules with two main targets, renewability and biodegradability, based on an energy-efficient synthetic process which generates as little waste as possible, as can be seen with the brand new exclusive captive molecule Ebelia, a fruity note similar to blackcurrant. Biotechnology can also produce highly odorant molecules with a small quantity of renewable materials using transformation processes with a low carbon impact. For example, Ambrofix is obtained with an enzymatic reaction with cane sugar. Formerly derived from a natural material, clary sage, this captive molecule is now based on a renewable resource – a real ecological performance, since it is much popular among perfumers. All these new ingredients cannot but help perfumers formulate differently! To gradually give up on petrochemistry, Givaudan explores all the alternatives available to create a 100% renewable palette of ingredients by 2030. It is a new olfactory language that perfumers need to learn. It involves constraints that open creative doors. Just like the disappearance of nitromusks led to the emergence of sweet notes, these green requirements are allowing a new perfumery to bloom. This palette of renewable ingredients provides much fluidity, harmony and textures, a dimension much appealing to the public. Beyond an exercise in style, this new approach offers perfumers a real playground to work on complex, faceted perfumes that let emotions speak. Indeed, to lighten perfumes' carbon footprint, revamping the perfumer's palette is only the first step: formulation should also be rethought. To this aim, Givaudan innovates by reducing the concentration in formulas to 3% or 5%, diminishing the volume of oil and the use of ingredients around the world. As a matter of fact, the new renewable ingredients with a low carbon footprint but strong olfactory power make it possible to create as highly-performing trails despite their low concentration. With the ""High-Low"" concept (high performance, low carbon impact), Givaudan offers both powerful and green perfumes. In addition, this choice offers perfumers several creative advantages. The low concentrations make it possible to add materials highly limited by IFRA to formulas, while complying with the regulatory limits in force. The combination of these notes with new ingredients also gives a very modern dimension to fragrances. Lastly, the low concentrations make the use of expensive natural materials easier to create more qualitative and sophisticated perfumes. In short, paradoxically, this innovative approach revives more classic perfumery and partially frees aesthetic research from regulatory constraints. If the green and creative benefits of the High Low concept are not visible yet on the market, to Givaudan, this technique represents one of the main paths to tomorrow's perfumery."
MS Beautilab initiates transformation and goes global,"As the world of cosmetics outsourcing is undergoing profound transformation with a clear concentration on the global level and a massive demand for turnkey products, MS Beautilab — the Beauty Division of the Swiss group Marvinpac — has initiated a historic transformation process under the leadership of Olivier Salaun, the new group CEO, and a new executive committee, and of a board of directors composed of historic Managers and representatives of family shareholders. ""We aim to outperform the strong growth expected for outsourcing by tripling our cosmetics turnover by 2025. By then, skincare and makeup should both account for half of our sales,"" explains Olivier Salaun. The Marvinpac Group was founded as Strand Cosmetics Europe, a French Lyon-based company specialized in high-end makeup and skincare formulation and production, and Marvinpac, a Swiss specialist of packaging and co-packing, gradually got closer between 2017 and 2020. It is divided into two main Divisions: Marvinpac, for food & beverages, and MS Beautilab, for makeup & skincare – they represent 57% and 43% of the group's business, respectively. The group counts three production sites: one in the suburbs of Lyon, France, one in Switzerland, near Fribourg, and one in the Czech Republic, near Prague, mainly specialized in packaging. ""We have huge assets, for example we succeeded in diversifying our products by adding skincare to makeup, and we boast a very complementary industrial tool in line with market expectations. We are viewed as a reliable player, but we need to enhance our innovation capacities and geographical presence, because we are still too focused on European markets,"" says Olivier Salaun. The Beauty Division's ambitious growth targets will be achieved with considerable investments intended to transform MS Beautilab's value proposition: the company wants to boost its full-service offering for premium, prestige, and luxury brands and offer more innovations on the most growth-driving segments, like anhydrous cosmetics and natural formulas. Investments will focus in particular on strong growth segments and new segments in the group's portfolio. ""Our expertise will also help us develop anhydrous skincare products with disruptive ambitions in this sector,"" adds the CEO. ""We will strengthen our capacities in many categories. In certain cases, like powders, we may have to plan an acquisition or an industrial partnership,"" he says. All in all, the group's investments over the next five years should reach several tens million euros, the majority of which will be allocated to the MS Beautilab cosmetics division. If, right now, 90% of MS Beautilab's sales are achieved in Europe, the idea is to soon enter new markets in North America and Asia. ""We want our turnover outside Europe to reach 25% to 33% by 2025,"" announces Olivier Salaun. This way, about a third of the group's sales would be achieved in France and Switzerland, another third in other European countries, and the last third in Asia and North America. To make sure this objective is fulfilled, MS Beautilab has planned to open a sales office in the USA in 2021, with a presence on both the East and West Coasts, and to create a development laboratory focused on makeup in California as soon as late 2022. As for China and Asia, where the company already offers bulk products, they will focus on skincare, in particular for major local and international brands. ""We aim to strengthen our presence in Asia, so we have started discussions with various potential partners to have our formulas packed locally."" The company intends to rely on its capacity to offer brands made-in-France and made-in-Switzerland skincare and makeup products – these two origins are very popular in the premium, prestige, and luxury segments. As regards CSR, a strategic roadmap is being finalized with the aim to start implementing it from 2022 in the continuity of our EcoVadis certifications (Gold in Switzerland, and Silver in France and the Czech Republic.) Just like many partners of cosmetics brands, MS Beautilab saw its business considerably change in just a few years, with turnkey finished products now accounting for the main part of the business. According to Olivier Salaun, this change of paradigm involves ""thoroughly reorganizing our working methods and customer relationship"". The company aims to provide more and more customers, both major international brands and emerging indie brands, with a full-service offering, by gradually managing a more significant part of the value chain and getting to the all-in-one phase, the objective being to offer not only a formula in a primary pack, but also a comprehensive marketing proposition including both product and pack design and a marketing strategy, in synergy with the expertise and historical know-how of the Marvinpac entity. ""MS Beautilab can rely on a strong scientific approach thanks to extensive knowledge as regards the skin, sensoriality and textures. Our work on naturalness provides a unique skincare offering, and we also boast rare expertise in pigments,"" emphasizes Camille Schmit Deroin, VP Skincare VP. To improve the customer experience in connection with the Make Up and Skin care Business Units, a ""cosmetics task force and resources dedicated to Marketing and Innovation"" have been created and strengthened within the Group, specifies Jean-Marc Tuffal, VP Marketing & VP innovation. ""We need to listen and be able to anticipate needs. We aim to be positioned as a reference made-in-France makeup player, thanks to a strong value proposition and an integrated value chain. With our high-end, made-in-France and made-in-Switzerland skincare offering, we are one of the rare players to be present on both markets,"" concludes Olivier Salaun."
"Makeup is back, Aircos and Pascual are ready for action!","How did you live through this particularly severe period for the makeup segment? Thomas Sirot (Aircos) - The fact is that 2020-2021 was a very difficult period for our factories, which saw orders come and go, start and stop. I recognize the efforts of our teams, as they have shown great flexibility both in continuing to serve our customers and in protecting our employees. Thanks to the long-term vision of Aircos and the Anjac group, we maintained our expansion strategy as we reinforced our teams with talent that is focused on innovation: a process industrialization engineer, a marketing manager, a sales manager... and a new Research & Innovation manager. We opened a sales office in the United States in the midst of the turmoil, and we confirmed our intention to open an R&D laboratory alongside our sister company Cosmetix West in California. Our activity in the United States is very important, as making prestigious brands best-sellers is a great satisfaction, but we want to go even further and that requires local proximity and agility. In terms of innovation, we are very dynamic. 2020 and 2021 are accentuated by the launch of lines of cleansing powders that are matching the trend for clean, nomadic and eco-responsible products. As for packaging, we are innovating with the ""Direct-to-Green"" single-material compact, eco-designed with 1 direct filling in the base, without any metal, for easily recyclable full-service solutions. We are developing 100% natural and compostable biosourced solutions thanks to the innovative materials of the Anjac Group's Innovi Applied Research Laboratory. Grégoire Huet (Pascual) - 2020 was a difficult year, but the brands quickly got back to new product developments for the recovery. ""Color"" offers accessible products that are highly coveted by consumers. For us, 2020-2021 consolidated the rise of R&D and Innovation at Pascual. Our investments in R&D and our Clean expertise are more than ever praised by renowned French luxury brands who are looking for products that are efficient, clean, but also very sensorial. We work closely with them. This challenge is met both in the R&D laboratory and in manufacturing. Pascual offers this particular expertise to its customers, in addition to the flexibility of small batches and the Made in France mark of quality. More than ever, as our customers' need for agility increases, our know-how in kitting at the gates of Paris is particularly appreciated. We continue to invest in our equipment, after 1 filling line for sticks of all diameters, we are increasing our number of tanks for the production of foundation. We are working on several major launches that will be unveiled soon. What are the most important innovations for this year? Thomas Sirot (Aircos) - In addition to the innovations mentioned above, we continue to innovate on our Livelogy technology platform. This proprietary technology offers unlimited possibilities in color intensity, for stunning finishes, with exceptional sensory aspects that imprint the codes of cream textures. After the metallic effects, we are launching a brand new Ultra Matte formula from Livelogy: ""Very Noir"". Like a creamy gouache paint, "" Very Noir "" turns into a powder and offers an ultra black, ultra matte coverage, that is simply amazing! The other Aircos major launch, more than 50 Clean and Talc-free makeup and skincare textures! This is the result of years of research. Since 2018, thanks to briefs from trailblazing American Indie Brands, our R&D has been working to replace the ""unwanted"" talc, increase naturality to over 90%, and guarantee makeup results to make conventional formulas blush. Grégoire Huet (Pascual) - Clearly for Pascual, innovation means offering Clean performance and sensorial foundations in emulsion and stick as well as lipsticks that reach extreme naturality rates of 99%. Like all Anjac companies, we use the Beautylitic tool to qualify our formulas and compare them with market leaders, and they all come out with flying colors! Our new ""Sweet Lip Oils"" collection to revolutionize lip glosses with a Makeup-Care approach! Ultra-clean, 98% natural, vegan, for a wide choice of ""fresh and tangy"" looks enriched with key ingredients. There is no doubt about the makeup dynamic within the Anjac group. A range of innovations and new services are already in the pipeline for 2022."
"LAST, the first longwear makeup line based on green isododecane","The secret for longwear, no-transfer or waterproof makeup mainly lies in a synthetic molecule which used to be exclusively petrochemical: isododecane. Thanks to the research done by French biotechnology company Global Bioenergies, this flagship cosmetic ingredient is now available in a biosourced version obtained by fermenting plant resources. In 2008, the startup started working on an alternative to petrochemical isododecane derived from biomass to create a more environmentally friendly supply chain. ""Our concept was mainly aimed to have bacteria produce molecules they don't naturally produce. That used to be considered impossible,"" explains Marc Delcourt, co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies. Twelve years later, this process with countless applications (fuel, plastic, food…) is marketed for the first time in the cosmetics industry, a key sector for this ingredient essential to long-lasting makeup. ""Isododecane in longwear makeup is the core of the issue. This market represents no less than 4% of the cosmetics market in value. We are the only ones to produce a biosourced isododecane, so only we have the key for naturalness on this growth-driving market with a high demand. It is a unique opportunity,"" says the CEO. Thanks to its hold throughout the day and night, during outdoor activities, and in damp environments, long-lasting, waterproof or no-transfer makeup does have a public expecting high performance, colours… and naturalness. This ingredient can also be used as an emollient in various dermocosmetic or hair care formulas as a substitute for silicones, which are about to be banned due to environmental issues. ""We started by launching the LAST brand in June, with small production volumes. Then, starting from 2022, we will make this ingredient available to makeup players willing to replicate what we have just done. People are already knocking on our door. Within the next three or four years, we will considerably increase production volumes to target broader markets, like dermocosmetics and hair care,"" announces Marc Delcourt. The brand introduces itself as the first to offer longwear makeup with highly natural formulas that do not compromise on vibrant colours. They have developed twelve intense, matte or iridescent colours for liquid eye shadows that last 24 hours. The formulas contain 90% to 99.8% of ingredients of natural origin. The same goes for the three waterproof, black, blue or brown mascara references with 90% of ingredients of natural origin, and the three brow mascara shades with 95% of ingredients of natural origin. The products are free from controversial ingredients and perfume. The eye shadow bottles are made of glass, the caps are based on metal. The mascara bottles and caps are based on recycled plastic, while the brush is biosourced and derived from castor oil. Available on the colors-that-last.com e-shop since June, the brand should soon enter selective distribution networks in France with a price range from EUR 18 to EUR 25. A lipstick line based on the same concept will complete the offering as soon as September. By launching LAST, Global Bioenergies has made a huge step forward, bringing naturalness to a cosmetic segment where it was almost nowhere to be found. This disruptive approach made the public-listed company [1] change its industrial organization by transferring all equipment from the initial site in Germany to that of Pomacle, in Eastern France."
"Hygienic and greener, Livcer adapts its monodoses to current expectations","Founded in 1988, the family business has acquired unique expertise in the cosmetics sector in the design and production of thermoformed parts, ideally suited to single-dose product testing, at home or at the point of sale (POS) or for sales products. The thermoforming technology applied to plastic sheets allows producing simple or complex shapes of any size, quickly and at very competitive prices. It is suitable for a wide variety of textures - liquids, powders, creams, cushions, or solids - and usages, through vertical or horizontal filling. Whether for product testing or the manufacture of single-dose cures, Livcer primarily serves the make-up and skincare segments, with the emphasis on a premium consumer experience, in compliance with environmental, hygiene and safety requirements. ""Leveraging on twenty years of experience in the production of thermoformed doses, we are constantly developing, with the help of our clients and suppliers, a wide range of innovations to make the sample and the single-dose a product with real added value. In 2020, our consumption patterns and habits have fundamentally changed as a result of the pandemic,"" explains Aude de Livonnière, CEO of the company. The company quickly adapted its offer and accelerated its innovation in response to the new hygiene requirements imposed in POS by the health context. The Livstick, launched in 2020 to allow the safe testing of lipstick, is an example of this. The sample comes in the form of a stick made of wood, cardboard or recycled plastic, the tip of which is coated with a small amount of lipstick; the whole of it is slipped into an eco-designed unit blister pack made of over 60% recycled material. ""The Livstick allows the consumer to test the product in total confidence. It can be distributed as a sample for home testing or as an in-store tester,"" emphasises Aude de Livonnière. Livcer has also expanded its catalogue to include thermoformed doses or blisters in even more minimalist formats, of 2ml or even 0.5ml, which correspond to the exact dose of formula to be tested. The necessary eco-design of products increasingly involves the use of green alternatives to traditionally used materials. This includes the elimination of aluminium foil in favour of paper and the use of mono-material laminates made from recycled plastic. All the product and marketing information intended for the consumer can also be printed directly on the blister pack of the dose. This technological advance eliminates the need to add the associated cardboard packaging. ""Eco-sourced materials are starting to appear and we are studying various sources, such as coconut and hemp fibres. The green attitude is not a passing trend but a real issue that is part of a work-in-progress approach. We are intensifying tests to offer a range of solutions that would suit each cosmetic formula,"" adds the Head of the company. Committed with Ecocert for many years, Livcer achieved the Gold level of recognition following its Ecovadis evaluation, thus placing itself in the 5% of companies with the best ratings by this organization."
Ex Nihilo boosts development on international stage,"Founded by Benoît Verdier, Sylvie Loday, and Olivier Royère, experts in finance, consulting, and marketing, the brand opened its first store 352 Rue Saint-Honoré, in Paris, in late 2013. Since then, Ex Nihilo has stood out in the most beautiful niche perfume places: Harrods in London, Tsum in Moscow, Bergdorf Goodman and Saks in NYC. In Paris, it is available at Galeries Lafayette Haussmann and Champs-Élysées, and will soon be at La Samaritaine, as soon as it reopens. Ex Nihilo's strength lies in its choice of addictive creations combining exceptional natural materials and innovative synthetic captive molecules, but above all, in the unique shopping experience the company offers – an integral part of its DNA. Thanks to Osmologue, an exclusive technology aimed to personalize two collections (Initiale and Babylone) with beautiful ingredients, the brand makes almost tailor-made perfumes on request, while adapting them to customers' tastes. The Osmologue technology was installed at the Paris store as soon as the brand was created, and then it was replicated at Harrods, in London, and in the two NYC corners. It is also available at the current points of sale in Toronto, at Saks, and in Dubai, at Bloomingdale's, creating a unique immersive experience. This original and attractive concept offers sophisticated, semi-tailor-made fragrances twisted with beautiful materials selected upstream by Givaudan perfumers to ensure a harmonious olfactory result. The bottle cap can also be personalized for a real high-end experience. All in all, Ex Nihilo boasts 42 creations signed by various junior and senior perfumers, including Quentin Bisch, Guillaume Flavigny, Nathalie Gracia-Cetto, Olivier Pécheux… This large choice of perfumes makes up five collections, where the Parisian style mixes with more oriental scents. What's more, the brand has multiplied artistic collaborations to offer exclusive perfumes or limited editions. The whole range is well-adapted to layering, thanks to perfumed bases and light body and hair mists that intensify fragrance trails. References like Fleur Narcotique, Venenum Kiss, Vétiver Moloko, and Gold Immortals are the brand's bestsellers. For example, Fleur Narcotique is highly successful in Russia and Eastern European countries, one of Ex Nihilo's main markets, alongside the Middle East. Europe and the USA do not lag far behind though: there are about 20 points of sale in North America, mostly on the East coast, from Miami to Toronto, at Saks, but also in NYC – and of course, there is the Lucky Scent digital network. After a year 2020 marked by the closure of many physical stores, the brand is about to speed up its development on the international stage, in particular in California. In addition to a corner at Saks, in Beverly Hills, they are planning to open a flagship store in West Hollywood next October. All in all, the company has scheduled to double the number of points of sale in the year to come. Other than in LA, California, they will unveil a new flagship store in Dubai next September: these two new places will offer the innovative Osmologue technology and will be adorned with Ex Nihilo's aesthetic codes, with a ""local"" colour touch. Also with a view to strengthen its presence on the international stage, the brand is planning to settle in Asia. After opening a first point of sale in Korea this year, the founders are now much interested in China, a new playground for niche perfume brands. Global expansion is not the only challenge for Ex Nihilo. Over the next few months, it will be crucial to adapt sustainability requirements to luxury codes. And of course, there is digitalism: the in-store experience should be put forward on the social media – it just cannot be ignored, to Benoît Verdier – in particular to reach the GenZ and Millennials. Ex Nihilo will have many other projects to work on over the next few months, including the launch of a new fragrance after summer, with a captive molecule extracted from patchouli: akilagawood. While the synthetic molecules highlighted help preserve the environment, the company has not overlooked the beautiful natural materials that guarantee their perfumes' quality. And they are ready to make them more widely known abroad."
"Essentia Beauty, new brand Ozmee's incubator partner","Specialized for 20 years in the turnkey creation, development, and production of skincare, makeup and fragrances, Essentia Beauty has spent the past five years investing and structuring the company's innovations around a consumer-centric approach. ""We aim to find out how to provide an added value on an oversaturated market,"" explains CEO Katia de Martino. Several innovative packaging and formulation solutions resulted from these efforts, the top priority being sustainability. For example, they now offer solid perfumes in different forms, like Chubby Click, a 100% natural fragrance available as a refillable premium stick or a refillable pendent fitted with a patented sliding and locking system. ""Solid perfumes are more than a trend: they meet many expectations, in particular young people's, because they are eager for new gestures. And to us, the possibility to refill the product is the most efficient sustainable strategy. We are committed to offering the best options in this field,"" says Katia de Martino. The Smart Palette makeup concept is in line with this strategy. Various cosmetics – eye shadow, mascara, blush, lipstick – are showcased in only one compact, refillable case. Also, Fan Lipstick, whose design can be customized, is fitted with a retractable mirror to guarantee users a convenient gesture. In addition to these developments, the successful Cosmos-certified makeup line launched for Monoprix helped Essentia get through hard times during the crisis 2020 and still be one step ahead. This line required two years of R&D to achieve optimum finish and comfort performances. In 2021, the company's commitment for innovation and the search for sustainable solutions urged them to adopt an original support strategy targeting young companies and to add the brand incubator service to their business model. ""We have built partnerships with three new brands. We support them according to their own needs and help them with their marketing strategy and positioning to provide an actual added value,"" explains the CEO. One of them, Ozmee, will be launched in June in Italy through its e-shop. The concept is based on a mascara offering tailor-made to each morphotype. The diagnosis is based on a mere selfie according to five criteria: length, thickness, volume, quantity, and curvature. ""This is made possible thanks to an exclusive, patented facial analysis software based on artificial intelligence,"" explains Katia de Martino. According to the CEO, this high-level customization concept is in line with the brand's sustainable strategy focused on cosmetics waste reduction. ""Ozmee's mission consists in reducing waste by helping consumers find the product best-adapted to their own needs,"" she explains. Essentia Beauty aims to strengthen its position among European turnkey solution leaders, while still investing in China, where the company opened a subsidiary already three years ago."
GK Concept launches new in-store contactless testing device,"The French company had already developed Paperscent, a contactless technology launched in 2018 to test perfumes on paper in physical stores. This time, the self-sufficient test provides an answer adapted to all viscosities. Paperscent is designed to replace testing bottles: this compact case integrated to the store's furniture can be personalized by the brands. It delivers a card that is instantaneously sprayed with perfume and personalized. ""Customers want to be on their own when they go shopping. Our technologies are designed to arouse consumers' curiosity: they act as 'traffic stoppers'. Thanks to Paperscent, we observed an increase in the number of tests carried out, which in turn increased sales by 30%. It is also a way to preserve olfactory quality: the spray delivers the right dose of perfume directly from the bottle, but since this happens inside the case, you do not have all sorts of smells diffused in the store,"" explains Arthur Hagiage, President of GK Concept. Building upon the success of Paperscent, which several major brands have already adopted, GK Concept decided to apply the same concept to cosmetics testing, in particular skincare and makeup testing. Based on the same principle, this technology lies in a highly compact case which easily mingles with the store's furniture and can be personalized: it can detect movements to deliver the right dose of fluid, whatever the viscosity. ""Since our machine is small, you can put 33 of them in one linear metre, which is pretty interesting for the whole range of foundation shades, for example. But Dropper works with all types of liquid products, creams, foundations, serums, perfumes…"" says Arthur Hagiage. Just like with Paperscent, the dose of product is directly taken from the brand's bottle or jar. The system can adapt to the container size to avoid any repacking and protects the formula from any external contamination. The case is either plugged or powered with a battery. For controlled, continuous use, it is connected, so beauty advisors are directly informed with a notification when the device should be recharged. ""The success of our technologies lies in their being constantly functional: we have developed our own in-store predictive, easy-to-use maintenance system,"" adds the President. The made-in-France Dropper electronic technology is in line with the current redefinition of in-store testing, which should now be contactless. Already familiar with hand sanitizer dispensing technology based on movement detection, consumers can now discover the experience of safe self-sufficient testing. And for brands, it is an opportunity to provide a low-cost solution."
Sicaf Cosmétiques is stepping up its innovation and supports the market recovery,"Premium Beauty News - Sicaf has recently invested in a new R&D centre, what are its objectives? Lionel De Deken - This is a major concern for us. This new site allows us to grow with innovative projects. It has been sized to meet our growth ambition for the next 10 years. It will be an important tool for the consolidation of our industrial and R&D capabilities. This new building is home to some 20 people and can accommodate up to 40. It has a laboratory organised into formulation islands, with a surface area three times that of our previous facilities. Pierre Planès - This new R&D centre is organised into several poles. A pole dedicated to prospective and technology watch, to create innovative textures. As well as specialised development centres which, based on our customers' briefs and the work of the prospective team, develop high-performance, bespoke products. All of this is, of course, supported by a regulatory department that ensures the compliance of formulas. This allows us to propose two or three prospective collections each year, inspirational formulas that we present to our customers to illustrate our capabilities, and feed their development strategy. In addition, the laboratory takes part in the cross-functional projects of the Anjac Health & Beauty Group. Premium Beauty News - Precisely how are the synergies organised between the Sicaf R&D and the other entities of the Group? Pierre Planès - Anjac has an R&D Committee that I chair. It is a place where information is fed back and shared between our different entities, but also where technological innovations and highly specialised products are created and developed. Lionel De Deken - The twelve entities of the Group [1] offer a unique development and deployment potential. Their complementarity allows for rapid transfers of knowledge and expertise. When customers submit projects to us, they are transferred to the most appropriate entity. We also offer synergies between regions, for example in some cases Sicaf formulates for a US brand and our US subsidiary, Cosmetix West, takes care of the manufacturing in the US. Premium Beauty News - What are Sicaf's main lines of research and innovation today? Lionel De Deken - Our strategy of growth and differentiation is based on the creation of disruptive and innovative formulas. We are recognised as skincare experts, specialising in hot cast products (balms, deodorants, solid cosmetics) and powder micro-dosing. We also have a long and valued history of expertise in fragrance derivatives, which has given us a rare ability to work on highly concentrated fragrance formulations. Our top priority is to meet the expectations of our customers, major French and international brands operating in the masstige, premium and luxury segments, who are looking for effective formulas with a very distinctive sensory signature. Pierre Planès - Overall, clean beauty is the segment that is experiencing the strongest growth. To better address this trend, the Anjac Health & Beauty Group has joined forces with Beautylitic, the scientific analysis and evaluation tool for beauty formulas, which allows us to advise our customers right from the product design phase. Also, another major research focus is obviously on natural, organic and sustainable formulas. We aim to offer the highest levels of naturalness and sustainability, without compromising the sensoriality that consumers are used to. This can be a real challenge, especially for solid products where our expertise in hot casting is a huge asset. These solid formulas are becoming increasingly popular because they are a good fit with current concerns. They contain little or no water, require little or no preservatives and therefore offer high levels of naturalness and do not require complex packagings. Our researchers are truly focused on providing the next generation of solids, the one that comes closest to traditional skincare textures. Already in 2019, we received an award for this at the Cosmétagora trade show. Even for creams, switching to natural textures without silicone that are as effective in terms of sensoriality requires a lot of research. This is also innovation! This know-how is truly the distinguishing feature of Sicaf. Premium Beauty News - How did you deal with the health crisis? Lionel De Deken - Despite the difficulties, it has been a very rewarding period. We bounced back very quickly by producing hydroalcoholic gels to make up for the drop in revenue during the first months of the crisis. We used the opportunity to rework our organisation and our future strategy. We have continued to invest in R&D, suspended lower-priority investments and retained all our teams to be ready for the upturn. Some of our customers have bounced back very quickly too by turning to direct sales and the Internet, others have reorganised themselves, and others took advantage of the recovery in Asia. Today, we respond to requests that are sometimes very demanding. In summary, I can say that we have emerged from the crisis stronger than ever!"
What Matters combines elegance and ecology in home and body care products,"Premium Beauty News - You launched What Matters a few months ago. How is the project doing now? Charlotte Caton - We are very satisfied with what we have done so far. We launched our brand in September 2020 in D2C with about fifty references: skincare, hygiene, and home products. Hygiene products are packed in white bottles, while home care products are presented in brown bottles. The refills are made of flexible plastic to reduce our consumption. We have chosen a comprehensive offering to meet all families' needs. What Matters is a unique concept of refillable products packed in very smart bottles made of reinforced, secured glass. It is a patented technology developed by French glassmaker Verescence which guarantees the bottles' integrity: they cannot break down into pieces, even if they fall on your bathroom tiles. We are pioneers in the use of this technology, and although, initially, we did not ask for significant volumes, Verescence followed us, so they could put forward and valorize their outstanding know-how. We boast a broad range, but there are few products in each of them – most are gender-free. All products are fitted with pumps to adjust the dose with optimum accuracy. We provide dose recommendations, including the number of times users need to press on the pump: the idea is to consume less, but better. Our products have got good marks on Yuka. These sensorial, pleasant-to-use formulas are made in France and certified organic. Premium Beauty News - What about sales? Charlotte Caton - Our customers are really free, but we do help them as much as possible so they gain time: standard purchases, guided purchases, re-orders in a single click, or recurring orders. This flexible system without obligation makes it possible for them to order only what they need. We help our customers evaluate their needs according to their personal situation: in a relationship, family, house-sharing… They can place three or four orders before they subscribe. Due to the crisis, people have spent a lot of time at home lately, and it boosted our business. We have already sold over 145,000 products (50% of bottles and 50% of refills). But above all, we have recorded a repurchase rate of 46%. We adopted a 100% digital model, which means customers cannot test our products before buying them, so it proves they like them. In any case, online selling and social media provide direct, unlimited feedback. Our subscribers' opinion is a precious source of information. Our most popular products are toothpaste and hand wash. We believe we have helped our customers save three tonnes and a half of plastic since our brand was launched! All our packaging is recyclable, our cardboard's height can be adjusted, and we manage our deliveries according to frequency rather than product, so our orders are not scattered. So, we deliver every month, or every two or three months, depending on the needs. Now, what we need to do is broaden our distribution network. We will open up to retail starting from the end of the year in stores like Printemps. We have placed our third order: our suppliers will produce 450,000 more bottles for us. We are also considering opening our first points of sale for export as soon as 2022, in French-speaking countries at first, like Belgium and Switzerland, where we already have customers thanks to the web, and then in Spain and Germany. Premium Beauty News - Have you planned other developments? Charlotte Caton - We have developed a B2B range with 5-litre refills for hotels and B&Bs. Single-use plastic will soon be banned in hotels – there is a strong demand in this sector. As for products, we are about to launch a two-in-one shampoo-shower gel for kids with a refillable metal foamer. We are also preparing a hair conditioner, a BB cream, and shaving foam. In the home category, we plan to launch a fabric softener. As regards bestsellers, we are also working on powders that can be diluted, so we no longer need to transport water and can further reduce packaging. But we do not want to make any compromise over sensoriality. However, we also try to fight against hypersegmentation. That is why we only offer two toothpaste models: one for adults, the other for kids. Premium Beauty News - The segment that grows the fastest is sustainable cosmetics, but it is also the most glutted. Charlotte Caton - We do not target activists; rather customers who want to change practices but do not really know where to start. But above all, we believe we should help people change using pleasure, not fear or constraints – supermarket customers who want something different. Our clientele is mainly composed of families with children: they need practical, concrete solutions. Our mission consists in helping them gain time by delivering them products when they need them – and never more! – and on which they can count with their eyes shut! We stand out thanks to our balance between a premium design and an affordable price. People are seduced by our beautiful offering, they repurchase their products because they are good ones, and they are faithful to our brand because it helps be effortlessly ecoresponsible."
WWP Beauty establishes itself as a global full service partner,"Headquartered in New Jersey, the company is well known for its rigid packaging and extruded tubes for the makeup and skincare markets. However, the acquisition of Cosmetic Design Group and Design Quest in 2019, both based in the Los Angeles area, enabled WWP to diversify its offer, in particular in full turnkey design services. Today, full service represents 40% of the group's global turnover. ""Cosmetic Design Group was fully integrated to form WWP Beauty by the end of 2020. This integration was about being the source for everything beauty to our customers, expanding our capabilities to include a full service offering of packaging, formulation, full service turnkey and accessories, and increasing our global footprint with the openings of our EMEA office in Paris, France and our APAC office in Shanghai, China,"" explains Josh Kirschbaum, CEO. At the beginning of this year, WWP Beauty unveiled its new brand identity, with a new logo, a new website and a redefined discourse and business outlook. While the beauty industry as a whole experienced a slight drop during the beginning of the global pandemic, WWP Beauty used this time to evolve and expand its product portfolio, and to prepare for the increased demand that we anticipated for post-COVID. ""Today, our company is not only focused on quickly evolving our brand to meet the ever-changing needs of our customers, but also on ensuring that we are providing every customer with solutions that are sustainable, clean, compliant, and inclusive,"" added Kirschbaum. Even though many people know WWP Beauty for their solutions in color cosmetics, over the last year the group has shown agility in bringing sustainable packaging, formulation, and accessories solutions that span into categories like skincare, fragrance and hair care. ""With turnkey being a preferred service by many brands, this year we have launched our Es•sence fragrance collection and two new skincare collections; Bluelight and Twilight,"" said Kirschbaum. Developped in partnership with Scentinvent Technologies, Es•sence is a new solid fragrance format that features skin-loving ingredients, and allows the brand to play with color, scent and packaging to create a truly unique fragrance experience. The Bluelight collection features skincare products that contain bluelight technology which helps protect the skin from the harmful effects that come from HEV lights emitted from technological devices such as TV, smartphones and computer screens. As for Twilight, it is a collection of products that focusing on the night time beauty ritual with comforting tactile textures formulations, packaging and accessories that help enhance the selfcare experience and bring calm and joy to at-home skincare. As far as packaging is concerned, sustainability is the key area of innovation for the company. To help their customers evaluate the different options, WWP Beauty has developed a tool that called Eco Analyzer. Two of WWP Beauty latest sustainable packaging launches were ran through the Eco Analyzer. The Eco Pac Tube uses 19% less plastic per piece, and reduces GHG emissions by up to 93% in comparison to a standard tube of the same size. The ColorVue lipstick features a mono-material design and a patent pending mechanism that uses up to 12% less plastic and reduces GHG emissions by up to 85% in comparison to a standard lipstick component of the same size. Additionally, in 2021 the company has also launched a Refillable Body Stick, Refillable Multi-use Face Stick, Refillable Bottle, and a Square Tube available in PCR material."
"""Retail is not dead, it just needs to be better,"" says Malina Ngai, AS Watson","""Forget physical versus online. It's not either or; O+O is the new standard for retail,"" explained Malina Ngai, Group COO of A.S. Watson Group & CEO of A.S. Watson (Asia & Europe) speaking at the inaugural Beauty Tech Live industry event. According to Ngai, the O+O (Offline plus Online) concept simply describes how customers shop today, but it is very different from the traditional O2O (online to offline or offline to online) strategies. ""It is more about creating an integrated experience to better serve customers' needs, that enables them to shop across any channel, anytime, anywhere."" And there are huge business consequences, as there is no cannibalisation in customers' spending in physical stores. ""In fact, an O+O customer spends three times what an instore-only customer shops with us. It's about creating bigger share of wallet and higher customer lifetime value,"" Ngai added. Combining physical and online stores is a great challenge for the A.S. Watson which operates over 16,000 physical stores and 100 e-commerce platforms in 27 markets between Asia and Europe, under brands such as Watsons, Kruidvat, Superdrugs, Drogas, Rossmann, ICI Paris XL, Marionnaud, The Perfume Shop. In order for the O+O to be efficient, it relies on ""a combination of our extensive physical store network as core touchpoints, our 140,000-strong customer service workforce, integrated with digital platforms, and most importantly, the customer connectivity with our base of 139 millions loyalty members we've built over the past few years,"" said Ngai. However, O+O is not just having physical and online stores connected. ""It's an ecosystem that is powered by technology, big data and artificial intelligence. Just as important, it's an organisation cultural change when it comes to managing the business and prioritisation."" In this context, all of the group's physical stores are connected to digital platforms, which means the product offering is no longer limited by shelf space. In a few clicks, store teams can order products for deliveries or pick-up by customers. A.S. Watson also enables members of its loyalty programs to shop online not only on A.S. Watson's mobile apps and websites, but also via WeChat or WhatsApp. For example, in Watsons China, customers can seek personalised advice from in-store beauty advisors via Enterprise WeChat and enjoy one-to-one service. The advisor can suggest personalised promotion offers with the help of artificial intelligence engine, help order the products from the cloud service MyStore (WeChat platform tailored for Watsons) and customers can receive product delivery within one hour. To offer a seamless retail experience and keep customers engaged, A.S. Watsons has doubled its development of digital assets and contents over the last 12 months, as well as its fulfilment capacities to cope with the surging demand through picking in stores. The aim was to be able to deliver ordered products within hours. ""Customers of all generations are now increasingly mobile savvy and digitally connected,"" highlighted Malina Ngai. A.S. Watsons therefore chose to focus on developments using customers' own mobile phone to align with their daily habits. With WatsonsGO, for instance, customers to buy in store via payment on mobile app. First launched in Watsons China, the service is now available in Watsons Hong Kong and Singapore. With Go-In-Store, customers who browse online can speak to an instore beauty or health advisor on video to get consultation. On line tools, such as Skin Analyser, ColourMe, or Virtual Foundation Trial use virtual reality and artificial intelligence to provide recommendations or make virtual try-ons. In stores, a touch screen dubbed Endless Aisle, allows customers to shop and choose either to collect the products in store or have them delivered to their home. Also, A.S. Watson has partnered up with delivery service Grab in order for customers in Southeast Asia to get their delivery in only less than two hours. Converting more customers to O+O will be A.S. Watson core growth strategy in 2021 and beyond. However, physical stores will continue to play a significant role in the whole beauty shopping experience, and the group plans to open 1,000 new stores this year. ""Retail is not dead; it just needs to be better for our customers,"" concluded Malina Ngai."

Asquan is committed to protecting the oceans and the environment,"In front of this situation, Asquan lauches the Ocean Waste Collection Program, to use innovation to support eco-systems and protect the oceans. At Asquan, besides using recycled or eco materials and integrating recyclability in the core of our designs, we decided to be more innovative and go beyond our business model. We believe in an industry that globally preserves the environment and values people. Starting in 2020, we decided to contribute to the recovery and the recycling of ocean-waste plastics. Our goal is to reduce Ocean plastic waste ,whilst at the same time improving the lives of our society's most underprivileged living in countries with poor waste management infrastructure. The ecosystem put in place creates a recycling infrastructure and invites locals to earn a stable income by joining recycling forces. Through the use of blockchain technology, collectors can increase their income by exchanging the collected plastic waste for tokens that in turn can further be exchanged for food, money, housing, education tuition and health insurance. Asquan is working towards this goal through our Ocean Waste Collection Program (OWCP) which has both positive environmental and social impacts. Asquan initiated the OWCP in Q4 2020, where approx. 20 tons of ocean waste was recovered, equivalent to approx. 1 million 500 ml plastic water bottles. This year, Asquan is committed to continue the momentum and reach 2 million+ plastic bottles or a total 40 tons. Our efforts contribute to the development of recycling eco-systems in areas that have among the most deficient solid waste management infrastructures. This accessibility to recycling improves the materials recovery, helps in developing a circular economy, and stops plastic leaking into the environment. Asquan's OWCP initiative is aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), a global framework offering the best path forward to collaborate on solving society's biggest problems and challenges. By participating in the collection of ocean plastic waste, Asquan contributes to clean up our oceans as well as supporting the SDG14: Conserving our Oceans. By allowing local people to collect and exchange plastic waste for money and services, the OWCP initiative improves access to employment, health and education which in turn contributes to the SDGs 3, 4 & 8: Good Health and Wellbeing, Quality Education and Decent Work and Economic Growth. By joining forces in this movement against plastic pollution, we generate true added value and help tackle some of the world's major issues i.e.: plastic waste and poverty. Asquan believes that this way, we develop strong partnerships towards sustainable development, consistent with SDG17: Partnerships for Sustainable Development. Asquan's ambition is to pursue this path towards sustainability and collect ever more plastic waste. Brands can support our social and environmental aspiration by trusting us with their business. Every project made with us contributes to reducing ocean plastic!"
KDC/One wants to grow in Asia and focuses on sustainable beauty,"Acquisition after acquisition, KDC/One has grown as a one-stop-shop provider for many beauty categories. The group now generates 62% of its turnover in the beauty and personal care sector and 38% in home care. However, KDC/One is still very focused on North America, which currently accounts for 75% of its business, compared to 18% for Europe and Middle East, and only 7% for Asia. With their most recent acquisitions, KDC/One focused on adding their capabilities and broadening their geographic footprint. This was most significantly accomplished through the acquisition of Benchmark, HCT and Paristy. As a formulation development powerhouse, specifically focused on indie and emerging brands, Benchmark helps KDC/One to strengthen their position in this fast-growth segment. The addition of HCT, a leading packaging design and production firm in the prestige cosmetics industry, to KDC's portfolio buoyed their presence with prestige color and skincare brands and enhances their ability to provide a ""one stop shop"" for those clients seeking a full-service solution encompassing both package and product. Following the acquisition of Alkos and Swallowfield, which enabled the group to gain a foothold in Europe, KDC/One set foot in Asia by taking over Paristy, with manufacturing based in Shanghai and R&D in Taiwan. ""Paristy provides a base for expansion into the high growth Chinese Beauty market. The business offers world class technology in lip, eye and complexion products that complement and enhance existing capabilities at Kolmar in the US, as well as Alkos and Inter Cosmétiques in France,"" said Wayne Swanton, President Beauty & Personal Care at KDC. In order to increase its focus in that market ensuring to be able to meet their increased demand and be fully prepared to service its customers' needs in the region, the group has recently added a Head of Asia. In line with the major trends of the moment, KDC/One is currently concentrating its innovations on sustainability. ""In working with our Brand Partners, we are able to deliver high-performance technologies in an effort to help minimize the ecological and global footprint. Our talented R&D Teams collaborate to offer advancements in waterless technology, cold process manufacturing, and incorporating sustainable ingredients to create more transparency for consumers,"" underlines Wayne Swanton. As far as packaging is concerned, KDC/One mainly relies on the capabilities of HCT. At the end of 2020, the company launched CLT (which stands for Crimpless Tube Technology), a new tube collection designed to stand above the limitations of typical tubes by unlocking new aesthetic possibilities and functionalities. In addition, the HCT team strives to increase sustainable options for its customers, through the use of recycled plastics, bioplastics as well as refillable packaging solutions."
Surya Brasil records double digit growth and aims for Africa,"With hair and beauty salons shut down across Brazil for much of 2020 - a scenario that repeated in early 2021 - hair dye addicts had only two options: opt for a more natural look and assume their grey hair, or dyeing their hair themselves. Those who have opted for the second solution have contributed to the growth of the category in the country. ""Our sales of hair dyes in Brazil increased by 15% compared to 2019,"" says Clelia Angelon, CEO of Surya Brasil, a company she founded 25 years ago. A result well above the 3% that the company announced to Brazil Beauty News in June, at the outset of the pandemic in the country. Henna is at the heart of the company's portfolio of natural and vegan products. ""Our henna cream is easy to apply, ready to use, has no unpleasant odour and contains 93.61% ingredients of natural origin. It is compatible with all chemically treated hair (straightening or other). It covers and protects grey hair from the very first application. Our henna powder is 100% natural and vegetable. It colours and treats the hair, giving it intense shine and forming a protective film around the hair fibre,"" explains the founder of the brand. In addition to henna products and colouring accessories, the brand's catalogue includes shampoos, conditioners and hair care masks. Like many cosmetic brands, Surya Brasil recently launched its own alcoholic gel and fabric masks for the prevention of Covid-19. It was in drugstore chains, which never ceased their operations in Brazil during the epidemic, that Surya Brasil experienced the most significant growth last year: +27% compared to 2019. However, according to Clelia Angelon sales also rose in supermarkets and online. ""Although 2020 has been very difficult for companies in Brazil, for Surya Brasil it has been a very rewarding time. We have invested in digital and in our team and we have been surprised by the strong demand for our products from national and international distributors,"" she adds. Surya Brasil's products are already available in more than 40 countries. The company entered the African continent last year, in particular in Congo, Kenya and South Africa. ""The African continent offers a very promising business potential for Surya Brasil. Our formulations are ideal for the afro hair,"" says the CEO. In 2020, the brand also debuted in India, Colombia and Costa Rica. ""Our sales are growing in the different markets where our products are available yet"", adds Angelon. For 2021, the brand intends to enter new African countries and is also working to conquer more space on the Asian continent. In addition to expanding its export sales, the company is also aiming at strengthening its position in Brazil, particularly online. According to its projections, growth in 2021 should continue at an even faster rate as the previous year, around 20%."
Parfums de Marly: a flagship French niche perfume brand,"In 2009, Julien Sprecher, a renowned olfactory expert in the perfume sector, used his broad knowledge of juices to create a collection of perfumes with powerful, statement notes. Les Parfums de Marly soon imposed itself as a pioneer in the fledgling niche perfume sector. On this market, which put forward unisex fragrances, the creator chose well-identified men's and women's lines. ""Although we do have a few unisex references, Julien Sprecher deeply believes in the added value of a gendered collection. This way, we explore many more olfactory notes… and go much further,"" explains Julien Sausset, CEO of the brand. A few years later, Les Parfums de Marly collection counts about thirty fragrances. Most of them are men's perfumes, but the bestseller was designed for women: the Delina perfume with rose/rhubarb notes is available in different versions, including the latest Delina La Rosée. Les Parfums de Marly has also imposed itself as one of the first five niche brands in American department stores. ""We have just achieved 130 million euros in retail, including 50 with sales in the United States, our largest market,"" says Julien Sausset. The brand has also been successful for two years in the Middle East and Brazil. ""Our juices are marked: they are either very masculine or very feminine, which appeals a lot to Brazilians. These consumers like to assert their tastes, they are very sensitive to our classics"", adds the CEO. Julien Sausset also revealed to us the opening of two points of sale in Shanghai and Beijing – about twenty others should open in China within the next 12 months. ""Much is happening in China right now, especially among the 25/35-year-old generation. Tastes are changing fast. The belief that we should launch fresh juices there is less and less true: young people have started changing habits and taking interest in niche, statement perfumes. There is a real perfume culture coming."" Just like for many other niche brands, the French market is not the most dynamic. ""I think niche perfumes will grow in France, but the French are not very keen on bold perfumes. They are still pretty traditional compared to new markets, where these new luxury dynamics are more widely observed,"" says Julien Sausset. If the perfume market's growth remains moderate, niche perfumes are very dynamic. With their bold notes, they often embody innovation and creativity. ""Similarly to what happened with wine, people started taking interest in vines, quality, small producers… they understood that we could do much better with a bit more money. It is the same with perfumes: consumers are interested in ingredients, long wear… All this makes the user experience stronger. It is said that customers do not go back once they have tested a niche perfume. This more qualitative type of perfumery can no longer be considered a 'niche' – it will actually play a huge role in defining the future of perfumes,"" says Julien Sausset. New gestures, new olfactory notes, green approach to juices and packaging… Boldness is indeed often associated with this alternative segment. And as successful as they are, Les Parfums de Marly aim to keep working in this direction."
"""Brands have a responsibility to use sustainable resources,"" Susanne Kaufmann","You have been advocating for a holistic approach to beauty for almost 20 years now. How do you explain the fact that the concept is only now catching on in the mainstream in countries like France or the United States? Susanne Kaufmann - I think beauty is increasingly moving in a holistic direction, something I've always believed in since I started my skincare brand. We all know now that the perfect combination of exercise, nutrition, sleep and skincare is the real secret to long-term beauty. And now more than ever, with the pandemic we're experiencing, and the stress and lifestyle changes that come with it, it's very important to take a holistic approach seriously in order to achieve lasting results. What makes Susanne Kaufmann cosmetics different? Susanne Kaufmann - My brand philosophy is to support the natural functions of the skin so that it can function at its best and bring out its vitality. Our approach is holistic: we look at the whole picture and see skincare as a means of prevention so that we can address the specific needs of the skin with our tailored products and treatments. It's not just about our products, it's about balance: healthy eating, exercise and adequate sleep are among the most important elements. Our commitment to sustainability is also unique and is reflected in every element of our production process. Whether it's the solar and thermal energy used to power our production facilities, responsible sourcing of botanicals for our formulas or our innovative refillable packaging. The use of renewable resources, cutting-edge science and intelligent product design have been integral to our production methods for nearly two decades. Can you tell us about your latest innovations in sustainable beauty? Susanne Kaufmann - We launched a refill pilot program for three of our best-selling products in February 2021. Our brand is the first in the world to use The Simple One, a new lightweight plastic refill bottle developed by ALPLA. Based in Vorarlberg, Austria, near our own production site and headquarters in Bezau, ALPLA is a leader in the development and manufacturing of sustainable plastic packaging solutions. The new 250 ml refills are currently available for three of our best-selling products: Cleansing Gel, Hand Soap and Shower/Shampoo. Will this help reduce the environmental impact? Susanne Kaufmann - Although relatively clean to produce, glass bottles are notoriously heavy to transport. Our new refill bottle is up to 60% lighter than standard HDPE bottles and reduces CO2 emissions during production, transportation and the post-consumer recycling process. Not only does the new lightweight refill significantly reduce the carbon footprint, it also extends the life of the glass bottle well beyond its original single-use design. Each recyclable refill, with its smart cap-less design, not only helps reduce landfill waste, but also reduces carbon emissions by 69%. Our secondary packaging is also made from 100% recyclable paper. How will this change consumers' beauty routines? Susanne Kaufmann - People have a direct link these days to their favorite brands and can find out exactly what is important to them. Living fairly and sustainably means being aware of the consequences of your lifestyle and consumption habits and acting responsibly. Everyone can contribute to making the world a fairer and more sustainable place. Natural resources — such as clean water and air — are finite and must be protected to preserve present and future life on our planet. Is it necessary for cosmetics brands to be sustainable to get the attention of consumers these days? Susanne Kaufmann - It's essential for us; it's part of the DNA of the Susanne Kaufmann brand. What are these new standards that you are going to put in place? Susanne Kaufmann - Our Refill program is a first step. We believe that sustainability is a never-ending journey, and we are committed to continuing to explore opportunities to reduce the brand's environmental impact throughout 2021 and beyond. The brand intends to expand the scope of the refill program with the addition of more products for the second half of 2021. Another sustainability first is the state-of-the-art solar-powered bulk mixer used in the manufacturing facility we share with our longtime production partner, Ingo Metzler. Located in Egg, Austria, just 15 minutes from our headquarters in Bezau, it features a custom-designed, high-capacity (300 kilograms) solar-powered mixing unit that is currently in use around the world. How can these innovations have an impact on the industry as a whole? Susanne Kaufmann - The key to making a difference is education. Brands and consumers alike have a responsibility to use sustainable resources and consume consciously, especially as our impact on the planet becomes increasingly evident. Brands can support this by sharing their knowledge of the new sustainable methods they are implementing. It's a path that will continue to evolve, but if everyone starts thinking sustainably, we can make a big difference. We can easily get lost navigating through the cosmetics landscape between organic, natural and ecologically responsible. What constitutes skincare that respects both the skin and the planet in the present? Susanne Kaufmann - From an early age, I learned to be environmentally conscious and to integrate the idea of sustainability into my daily life. The Bregenzerwald is our greatest asset: wherever I am in the region, I feel its energy, shaped by traditions combined with a unique agricultural culture based on sustainability, modern innovation and solidarity. Terms like 'clean' and 'natural' go far beyond high-quality, natural and effective ingredients. They must also encompass environmentally friendly production, sustainable innovation in packaging, manufacturing processes and a deep respect for nature and people. This has always been our philosophy. It has always been a question of a global vision. It is therefore very important that in everything we do, our philosophy guides our approach. We aim to always maintain the quality and effectiveness of our products, to target the different needs of the skin, to produce in a sustainable way and to stay true to our roots and brand values wherever we are in the world. How can well-being affect external beauty? Susanne Kaufmann - In Austria, we have a holistic view of beauty. This means that if you stay healthy, you look and feel better. At Susanne Kaufmann, we always recommend a holistic lifestyle. Everything is connected: our environment, our mental health and our physical being. It's no secret that the right combination of exercise, a balanced diet, sleep and a personalized skincare regimen can provide significant wellness benefits. These benefits are in turn reflected in our skin, in the form of a radiant, glowing complexion."
Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna to be held from 10 to 14 March 2022,"The reference event for the global cosmetics industry will be back in its traditional format from 10 to 14 March 2022: the Cosmopack pavilion, hosting members of the supply chain, and the Cosmo | Perfumery and Cosmetics pavilion, hosting the retail and perfumery sectors, will be inaugurated from Thursday to Sunday, while Cosmo | Hair, Nail and Beauty Salon will welcome professional operators from Friday to Monday. ""In 2019, Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna hosted over 250,000 operators from 154 countries, of which 47% foreign, and more than 3,000 companies from 70 countries, 70% of which from abroad. Such an international event needs an essential balance of factors. In Bologna, new collections are launched, and collaborations are outlined on a global scale. To ensure a functional edition in line with market expectations, it is necessary to reschedule Cosmoprof for March 2022,"" explained Enrico Zannini, General Manager of BolognaFiere Cosmoprof. To facilitate business activities during the first half of the year, when physical appointments are unlikely to not be allowed yet in Europe, the organizers will hold WeCosmoprof International, a fully digital event scheduled from 7 to 18 June 2021. For the first time, companies and visitors to all the trade fairs of the Cosmoprof network [1] will be able to interact with each other and share new programs for the future. Furthermore, to facilitate the restart of the beauty industry, the organizers announced that a new event in an ""unprecedented format"" will be held from 9 to 13 September 2021. Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna ""will be back in attendance on the expected dates of March, which are traditionally more functional for the needs of the cosmetics industry. However, the need to resume activities is tangible among the players in the sector. Therefore, a new event will be exceptionally organized with an unprecedented format, which will bring stakeholders to Bologna from 9 to 13 September for a first relaunch,"" said declares Gianpiero Calzolari, President of BolognaFiere. ""In September, we will organize an event that will attract operators and companies for a first but fundamental relaunch of activities,"" added Enrico Zannini. Keep connected for further information!"
L'Occitane chooses Tubex post-consumer recycled aluminium tubes,"Tubex Aluminium Tubes is a subsidiary of Austrian-German industrial group CAG, which owns Stölzle Glass Group, among others. They have been specialized for 70 years in the development and manufacturing of aluminium tubes for the cosmetics, food, and pharmaceutical industries. ""We adopted an ecoresponsible approach in 2018. The aluminium tube industry has not changed much over the past few years: we wanted to offer a breakthrough innovation,"" says Thierry Bitout, CEO of Tubex. After launching the Blue Tube in 2018, a tube fully made of recycled aluminium derived from industrial waste, the company developed Blue Tube Evo, which contains 95% of post-consumer waste (PCR for Post-Consumer Recycled) and 5% of PIR (Post-Industrial Recycled). ""We wanted to do even better by producing tubes based on tubes. Blue Tube Evo is 95% derived from used aluminium tubes, cans and aerosols thrown by consumers. The notion of circularity is essential. We have designed our alloy so that we could source very diverse types of waste and be supplied high quantities in unlimited access,"" adds Thierry Bitout. The 5% derived from industrial waste help adjust the chemical and mechanic composition of the whole product to obtain a unique alloy, while preserving both aesthetics and the properties of standard aluminium tubes, and ensuring endless recyclability. In order to keep improving the environmental profile of their products and strategy based on three key parameters – Reduce, Recycle, and React – the brand now aims to get rid of any unnecessary packaging and start using recyclable and/or recycled alternative materials. Although they are already based on a material that can be recycled over and over, all the brand's iconic aluminium tubes will undergo a full transformation in 2021. ""We have already added recycled PET to our bottles, but we did not want to ignore aluminium. We found Tubex's technology really attractive, because it is based on 95% of post-consumer recycled aluminium. To us, cleaning up what comes out of our bins also matters,"" says Corinne Fugier-Garrel, Packaging Concept Development & Innovation Director of L'Occitane en Provence. The Tubex technology reduces CO2 emissions and the carbon footprint by 70% and 60%, respectively, compared to a standard aluminium tube on the market. ""That's exactly what our customers want: a product that is both circular and has a low environmental footprint. L'Occitane has always addressed these issues, so it was the ideal solution,"" adds Thierry Bitout. All 22 references concerned, in particular the 75-ml and 150-ml hand creams, will be made with the Blue Tube Evo solution by the end of 2021. As a result of the conclusive pilot study conducted in 2019 to test shower gel filling in stores, this year, L'Occitane aims to offer this service in about 60 points of sale across the world. ""Thanks to the pilot tests, we learnt a lot from our customers and beauty advisors. Consumers are favourable to this type of re-purchase, but they want a complete routine,"" explains Corinne Fugier-Garrel. As a result, the fountains will offer a routine comprising hand liquid, shower gel, shower oil, shampoo, and conditioners. Two 250-ml and 500-ml bottles made of recycled aluminium will be available for sale, and then filled in and labelled by beauty advisors. Refills help save about 15%, and the aesthetic bottle goes with a leaflet with cleaning and maintenance instructions for successive refills. Tubex launches first 100% aluminium-based tube As for the manufacturer, this spring, they will launch a new innovation: the Monotube. Thanks to this unique, 100% aluminium-based version, they got rid of the tube's plastic cap. It is actually fitted with a cannula which can be separated from the tube: the latter can then be closed by turning the cannula upside down. ""Our Monotube is made of a single recycled material. It is compliant with today's environmental requirements as regards packaging, because it reduces emissions and guarantees a high level of recyclability and circularity,"" says Thierry Bitout."
Emmanuel Guichard appointed General Delegate of FEBEA,"Forty-four-year-old agronomist Emmanuel Guichard started his career as a researcher in the United States and Spain. He then joined the world of professional associations in France and in Brussels. He was first in charge of economic affairs at the French union of beetroot producers (CGB), before working as the secretary general of the European confederation of yeast producers (COFALEC), in Brussels. Since 2016, Emmanuel Guichard had been the General Delegate of Elipso. This industry being in a transitional period, he became an expert in circular economy, from design to packaging recycling, so he boasts a good understanding of consumer goods and a leading expertise in circular economy and the European machinery. ""I'm extremely happy to join the cosmetics manufacturing sector, a flagship industry which contributes to France's influence on the global level. This strong industry's excellence and performance are driven by both major groups and SMEs across the whole territory. Now, in this historic period marked by the COVID crisis, but also by deep changes as regards consumer habits, we need, more than ever, to take action as a group, so that, day after day, we better meet consumer expectations and stay in line with our society's changes. I warmly thank Patrick O'Quin for the outstanding work he did as the head of FEBEA, as he contributed to making it a leading federation and a reference partner for public authorities and our whole ecosystem,"" explains Emmanuel Guichard. Patrick O'Quin, who has decided to retire, will leave his office after a one-month transitional period. ""Thanks to the support and engagement of our members, we can be collectively proud of the work done by FEBEA for the cosmetics industry, throughout the years. It was a pleasure and honour to work with beauty companies, which embody excellence and innovation in France and around the world. I'm delighted to welcome Emmanuel Guichard, who will offer his experience with professional associations, his expertise in circular economy, and his deep knowledge of economic, social, and environmental issues. This will be particularly valuable for our federation and industry in the years to come""."
The Body Shop deploys refill stations globally,"As soon as April 2021, 47 stores in France will offer refill stations for a selection of shower gels, liquid hand soap, shampoos, and conditioners. On the global level, 400 stations should be installed by the end of the year, so that all stores can be equipped within the next five years. In France, 47 stores are part of the plan – the better part of the network. The selection will vary from at least six references to a maximum of 12, depending on the store size. In practice, a 300-ml recyclable aluminium-based bottle will be available for EUR 2.50 to go with the refill dose chosen, which will cost EUR 7 – less than the packed version. The aluminium bottle will then be refilled over and over in a store. Customers are responsible for cleaning the containers. In stores, beauty advisors will stick the labels on the bottles to indicate the expiry dates and batch numbers. ""With this project, The Body Shop sticks to its activist heritage, that of Anita Roddick, its founder. We are proud to be the first cosmetics brand to deploy this solution so broadly, both in terms of number of stores and references. Since we are B-Corp-certified, we feel responsible for the packs we market. All our products are recyclable and contain plastic derived from fair trade,"" explains Hugues Laurençon. Indeed, in 2019, the brand set up an exclusive partnership with a startup based in India to support plastic waste collectors working in the streets, most of whom are ostracised. This partnership provides them with fair, stable revenues, while preventing waste from proliferating in nature. The recycled plastic from this chain is now contained in different proportions in all The Body Shop products. In addition to refill stations, a new store concept called Activist Maker Workshop was created to use second-hand furniture. ""Everything has already had a first life, we actually do industrial recycling. It is a whole, a store redesigned with new products,"" says Hugues Laurençon. The first store opened in London's Oxford Street in 2019. In France, it will start with the city of Dijon in June, and then Carré Sénart in September. As for products, the iconic ""body butters"" that made the brand successful were reviewed to obtain formulas with 95% to 99% of ingredients of natural origin for 96 hours of hydration. And the hardly recyclable black plastic lid was replaced with a new aluminium lid. As for perfumes, the classic White Musk designed in 1981 will now be available in a new bottle based on 42% of recycled glass and fitted with a removable pump, without any overpackaging. The Body Shop is also willing to contribute to making beauty rhyme with inclusiveness. A global study conducted by Ipsos revealed women's lack of self-love in several countries, especially France: French women are ranked last according to this Self-Love Index, together with Saudi Arabians. As a solution, the brand launched the #SelfLoveUprising movement in partnership with different celebs, including singer Lous and the Yakuza in France and Belgium, and Jameela Jamil, an actress and Body Positive activist, in the UK. They are the spokeswomen of a campaign launched on March 16 on the social media and in stores. ""Lous and the Yakuza embodies self-love. She supports us with this campaign to pass on the message that to love others, you need to start with yourself. We suggested she choose an association for which we will organize a fundraising campaign,"" explains the General Manager. Now that the brand is part of the Natura & Co group, they have spoken up again, willing to broaden their presence through physical stores in France and around the world. ""It is crucial to have a human connection, and it is not because the situation is not favourable that we will let down retail. We want to share our values; that is why we need human contact. We believe in the power of relationships,"" says Hugues Laurençon. Asia is a new territory to conquer, he explains. ""Our brand deliberately avoided China until now, despite its dynamism, because we did not support animal testing. But soon, we will be able to enter this market, thanks to the recent government decisions to ban animal cruelty."" As far as France is concerned, the store fleet will need to be optimized with openings or relocations. As regards their joining the Natura & Co group, Hugues Laurençon is delighted about the union of brands with common values and the will to give The Body Shop its roughness back. ""The idea is to give the brand its voice back. It is not a cosmetic brand like others. It is a committed brand. Selling products is the means, the message is the end,"" he concludes."
Arcade Beauty strengthens its full-service offer and expands its CSR approach,"With a drop in demand for samples in some categories such as make-up and perfume, and on the other hand, a huge success for doypacks, especially for refill and home hair care solutions, the year 2020 was a mixed bag for Arcade Beauty, as it was for many beauty packaging manufacturers. ""While the pandemic had a significant impact on our sampling activity, our sales activity, launched five years ago, continued to grow in 2020, thanks in particular to the dynamism of mass retailing,"" underlines Carl Allain, Senior Vice-President, Head of Europe, General Manager, at Arcade Beauty. Beyond the economic situation, where demand for skincare samples is taking off again strongly, driven by Asian and especially Chinese demand, the market is changing profoundly. ""Behaviours are changing too: in-store testing is no longer done in the same way, self-service testers are under threat. We are working hand in hand with POS manufacturers to create touch-free solutions. And we are also addressing the boom in e-commerce and home delivery, with 3D solutions that are easy to fit into parcels and suiting this mode of consumption,"" continues Carl Allain. To carry out this transformation, the group relies in particular on its digital platform Abeo, which supports brands in their e-sampling campaigns, by managing the entire supply chain, from the request for a sample via social networks to its final delivery at home. But Arcade Beauty is also adapting its business model by reinforcing its ready-to-sell retail offer in Europe and North America, in line with the global demand for turnkey solutions allowing to accelerate the time to market of products in line with rapidly changing expectations. ""We are complementing our offer by adding an extra brick to the value chain, thanks to ready-to-use formulas produced with an international network of partners in Asia (Korea and China), but also in France,"" explains Candice Jagut, Global Business Development Retail Market Director at Arcade Beauty. The group already offers a range of ready-to-sell products, including skincare masks packaged in Poland with vegan formulas made in France with 96% ingredients of natural origin, on a 100% biodegradable cotton base. And to meet sustainability expectations, the secondary pack can consist either of single plastic material or of more than 50% paper (making it recyclable in the paper sector). The group also has a range of biocidal hydro-alcoholic gels with a neutral formula that can be perfumed according to the customer's wishes. ""We aim to develop our lines of ready-to-sell skincare products with innovative solutions, in terms of dosage forms and packaging, as well as temporary promotions meeting the various needs of historic or independent brands, but also of retailers looking for private label solutions,"" continues Candice Jagut. Hence, Arcade is responding to the evolution of dosage forms, in particular, the rise of waterless formulations, with the creation in Poland of a workshop dedicated to the conditioning of powders. With increasingly trendy products that fit perfectly with the various types of flexible packaging solutions proposed by the group. And also with flexible packagings which are in line with the demand for weight reduction and recyclability, a domain in which Arcade has multiplied innovations, particularly in terms of sustainability, and decoration options. Finally, on the CSR side, the policy rolled out in Europe since 2019 has been extended to the group's activities in the United States. The aim is to disseminate eco-design practices that are already widespread in the company by integrating CSR criteria into each new project, evaluated with the same life cycle assessment tool in Europe and North America (even if the reference databases necessarily vary). ""For each technology, we review the possible evolutions, to offer an optimised product, around the four key criteria of material reduction, namely, recycling, the use of renewable materials and the reuse or refill possibilities,"" explains Claudie Guérin, CSR Director at Arcade Beauty. This approach also includes the ethical selection of suppliers at every stage of the value chain (which has led, for example, to the generalisation of the purchase of certified paper), the reduction of the impact of operations, with quantified objectives including the certification of sites for the main indicators, and the awareness-raising of all employees. In the end, a company in full transformation, closely aligned with the evolution of its customer markets."

As a member of K-pop girl band BLACKPINK, Jennie is the right model for HERA not just because her charming appearance but her passion and confidence to be herself fit HERA 's brand philosophy, which is 'finding and expressing the confident and strong self and unique individual beauty that exists deep within oneself',"" says the group in statement."
Major beauty brands are now placing bet in Australia,"As Australia is becoming the new Hollywood with great weather, beautiful beaches and few Covid cases comparatively to the rest of the world, major beauty brands are now placing bet in Australia. South Korea's beauty brand LANEIGE just launched this week into Adore Beauty in Australia and New Zealand. The Amorepacific brand launched into Australia and New Zealand in 2018 and since then the LANEIGE Lip Sleeping Mask has become the first Lip Care Product and Water Sleeping Mask the first Mask in the market. LANEIGE is launching on Adore Beauty with thirty of its best-selling skincare products. This will include LANEIGE's most loved ranges; Sleeping Care (including Lip Sleeping Masks), Water Bank, Cream Skin, Basic Care (Cleansers & Toners) and Sets. Adore Beauty is a leading beauty e-commerce platform across the Australian and New Zealand market. ""LANEIGE has become a much coveted beauty brand in Australia and New Zealand since its launch and to be able to share this incredible brand with the highly engaged Adore Beauty community is another significant step for us. We admire and applaud Adore Beauty's deepening reach and appeal with the ANZ beauty customer, and we look forward to our bright future together,"" says Caroline Dunlop, Amore Pacific President, ANZ. At the end of the month, March 30 to be exact, Milk Makeup will land in Australia. They just announced the brand will now stocked online at Sephora Australia and New Zealand. Milk Makeup was born at Milk Studios, a fashion photography studio in downtown NYC. The brand was initially started for Milk's creative community who didn't see themselves represented in the beauty world and creating products that reimagine beauty, not you. Claiming to be all about good ingredients and epic payoff, Milk Makeup has grown as the epitome of the clean beauty trend. The range is cruelty-free, paraben-free, and 100% vegan. The launch sees a selection of the brand's best-selling products available, including Hydro Grip Primer, KUSH High Volume Mascara and Lip + Cheek in Werk."
Brazil's cosmetics industry accelerates its international development,"Brazil Beauty News - Created over 20 years ago, the Beautycare Brazil project supports Brazilian companies to develop their business on foreign markets. How has the program worked in the current context, without international fairs and events? Gueisa Silvério - Beautycare Brazil aims to promote the growth of exports of Brazilian products and services all along the value chain of the personal hygiene, perfume and cosmetics industry. This work encompasses the selection of key markets and the participation of the companies involved in the project in major international fairs. Due to the pandemic, face-to-face events have been suspended worldwide and Beautycare Brazil had to adapt to the new scenario. We have been focusing on online activities, with content developed with specialists from ABIHPEC and international market research firms. This enabled us to present up-to-date information on consumer behaviors and trends in countries such as South Korea, the United Arab Emirates and the United States. In the first half of 2020, we created a working group with members of the program to review our communication strategy and strengthen the image of the Brazilian industry abroad. For 2021, we seek to carry out actions in partnership with Apex-Brasil international offices, as well as with the trade services within Brazilian embassies and consulates. We have also broadened our initiatives to address other topics that may be of interest to member companies of the sector project. Brazil Beauty News - It's a paradox, but the Brazilian beauty sector performed well in 2020, with exports rising and a first trade surplus after a decade of deficit. How do you explain it? Gueisa Silverio - We do not see this as a paradox if we consider both the good performance of our industry on its domestic market and the results of the trade balance. Remember that Brazil is the 4th world market for personal hygiene and beauty products and the 3rd country for the number of product launches. We closed 2020 with sales up 5.8% (ex-factory price), compared to the previous year. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the Brazilian cosmetics industry has shown solidity and agility. Concretely, the sector recorded a positive trade balance of 23.4 million dollars in 2020. The rise of the dollar compared to the Brazilian currency and the reduction in imports linked to the quarantine imposed by the coronavirus led to an estimated reduction in imports of USD 585.9 million for the year, a drop of 16.8% from 2019. However, we must also take into account the increased interest of Brazilians in domestic products, which are always more innovative and of better quality and therefore increasingly able to replace imported goods and gain shares on export markets. Brazilian perfumes, whose sales grew 8.4% in 2020, are a good example. When we look at the performance of the Beautycare Brazil project, we see a 26% growth, notably thanks to ingredient manufacturers, who have won over major customers and gained market share internationally. Brazil Beauty News - What are the main strengths of the Brazilian cosmetics industry on international markets? Gueisa Silvério - Brazilian cosmetics are recognized worldwide for their innovative features in several categories, the use of ingredients from our biodiversity is a real differentiating asset to attract new customers and increase our international competitiveness. It should also be noted that the great diversity of the Brazilian population also stimulates the R&D of our companies and, consequently, the variety of their product offer, in particular for hair care. Brazil Beauty News - Brazilian brands are strong and are developing in Latin America. How is your performance in other parts of the world? Gueisa Silvério - Latin American countries are among the top 15 destinations for Brazilian cosmetic exports, accounting for 79.3% of the total. Argentina leads, followed by Chile and Mexico. It is important to stress that a large part of our exports are made by multinational companies located in Brazil, or by national actors who operate independently, without the support of the project. Things are different among the members of Beautycare Brazil. The project concerns the entire value chain. As a result, Latin America only represents 37% of our exported volumes. In total our members export to 118 countries, with Argentina, the United States, Colombia, Chile, Malaysia and Egypt in the leading pack."
"""Our strength lies in medicine and naturalness,"" Éric Ducournau, Pierre Fabre","Premium Beauty News - You launched a major transformation plan in 2019. Could you tell us a bit more? Éric Ducournau - First, we put an emphasis on what has helped the Pierre Fabre Group stand out since it was founded: the association of Medicine and Naturalness. This positioning is based on our complementary specializations in Life Sciences and Nature: cell biology, biotechnologies, botany, and biodiversity. To highlight our positioning, we invested in three priority areas: oncology, dermatology, and dermocosmetics. We are now the only company in the world to offer solutions to prevent skin cancers, treat them, and also treat their side effects. For example, Eau Thermale Avène offers health cures for women who had chemotherapy as well as replenishing skincare products free from any preservatives, thanks to Sterile Cosmetics. Our transformation plan includes another key part: digitalization, which is implemented in all the company's functions. In 2020, we doubled the share of e-retail in our sales and created a data centre of excellence aimed to support all trades, from R&D to marketing. Premium Beauty News - Why did you sell Galénic to Yatsen and Elancyl to Cantabria? Éric Ducournau - These are two very beautiful, highly innovative brands on their respective markets, but they no longer corresponded to our strategic positioning combining Medicine and Naturalness. Galénic is a high-end face care brand and Elancyl is specialized in slimming products. We wanted to invest in brands that follow dermatologists' recommendations and mainly target damaged or weakened skins, like Eau Thermale Avène, Ducray, and A-Derma, as well as in botany-oriented brands, such as Klorane and René Furterer. Premium Beauty News - Are there synergies between your medical and dermocosmetics businesses? Éric Ducournau - That is actually why we are so strong on the global beauty market! What other cosmetics company can boast having an R&D centre with researchers in oncology, dermatology, and cosmetology? We have a campus in Toulouse, in the south of France, with over 600 Pierre Fabre employees working near basic research laboratories, biotech companies, and hospital doctors. Extraordinary innovation stories emerge from this closeness between researchers from different backgrounds. For example, this year, Avène will launch a sunscreen with a new UV filter named Triasorb. This filter is derived from molecules discovered and patented by a Pierre Fabre medical research team as part of a programme against migraine. The patent registered by our team mentioned a potential for molecule sun protection, which gave another team the idea to focus on this anti-UV performance and led to the discovery of Triasorb. In 2018, it was added to the very short list of UV filters authorized in Europe. Premium Beauty News - The microbiome is also a key issue for the group. Éric Ducournau - Indeed, we are pioneers in understanding the skin microbiome in atopic dermatitis. Almost half of our clients at the Avène spa resort suffer from it, so it is a sort of research centre unique in the world: our researchers work on the observations made to pursue a major research programme called ""skin microbiology and atopic dermatitis"". Their work led to several publications in international journals and our teams developed the first non-invasive method for analyzing the skin microbiome. It helped us set up a collection of microorganisms isolated from both healthy and pathological skins in order to analyze and better understand the skin disorders related to atopic dermatitis, and develop skincare that restores bacterial diversity: Avène's Xéracalm skincare range is based on an active extracted from bacteria found in the unique microflora of thermal water. Our pharmacological work shows that these bacteria boost the production of antimicrobial peptides which defend the skin against pathogenic bacteria. Premium Beauty News - The Pierre Fabre Group was a trail-blazer with the invention of Sterile Cosmetics, a patented technology which avoids the use of preservatives in skincare products. Is there anything new with this? Éric Ducournau - You are absolutely right to remind that Mr Pierre Fabre was a forerunner when, as early as the 1990s, he imagined the first system to make sterile skincare for pathological or weakened skins. At that time, these products were marketed in the form of single-use single doses. Since then, we have enhanced this technology, which became Sterile Cosmetics in 2009. Thanks to Sterile Cosmetics, we formulate products containing only actives essential for the skin, without any preservatives. They are sterilized during the manufacturing phase with a unique process, packed in sterile areas, and their sterility is guaranteed throughout the use phase. In 2020, we further improved the packing system with a very easy-to-use, fully watertight miniaturized pump. This innovation is featured in the new Tolérance Control face care range for highly sensitive skins developed by Eau Thermale Avène. Premium Beauty News - How do you plan to grow in China? Éric Ducournau - 2020 was marked by the boom of e-retail, which now represents over 60% of our dermocosmetics revenue. This digital acceleration helped our hair care brands René Furterer and Klorane settle more quickly than expected in China, a market they recently entered, alongside Eau Thermale Avène, which is already well-known there. In 2021, we will emphasize Avène's medical positioning by working closely with our new strategic partner, the Beijing University Hospital – more precisely its national clinical research centre specialized in skin and immune diseases. In addition, we will develop our precision marketing and widen our presence on social media to attract new consumers. In parallel, we have many projects in oncology. We sell oral chemotherapy for treating lung and breast cancer and we are about to launch clinical trials for a new targeted therapy for colorectal cancer, which we have already marketed in Europe. Plus, we will relaunch an innovative treatment for preventing breast cancer recurrence – we have just got exclusive rights from American biotech company PUMA. Beyond China, the whole Asia-Pacific region will benefit from our investments in oncology. Premium Beauty News - What about CSR? What actions have you taken to reduce your environmental impact? Éric Ducournau - Up until 2018, the group's sustainability and naturalness programmes were followed up by several separate divisions. In 2019, we created a whole entity focused on this issue, the Green Mission Pierre Fabre, which works on our CSR policy as a whole and on natural active sourcing. Our commitments are in line with the Paris Agreement, which is aimed to limit the planet's temperature increase to 2°C by the end of the century. To contribute to these efforts, we will reduce our CO2 emissions by 30% and use 25% of renewable energy by 2025. What's more, we use over 400 plant extracts in the group, 80% of which will soon be derived from organic farming. As an example, Klorane has just launched a moisturizing face care range with organic cornflower grown by our agronomists in the Tarn region. The active is extracted with a solvent-free extrusion process using distilled water. The formula contains more than 95% of natural ingredients and the packaging is based on recyclable glass. It perfectly highlights our Conscious Care commitment, which consists in combining formulas free from controversial or unnecessary ingredients, scientific rigor, controlled sourcing chains, eco-design, and green chemistry."
Bogart innovates in perfumes and enhances synergies with retail network,"French based Groupe Bogart, who owns perfume (Jacques Bogart, Carven, and Ted Lapidus) and cosmetics brands (Méthode Jeanne Piaubert, Stendhal, April), holds the Chevignon licence, and has a retailer network of 380 perfume shops across the world, has scheduled several range launches or redesigns this year. Carven, the group's most dynamic brand since the Dans Ma Bulle perfume was created, will broaden their offering next May with a new men's fragrances by Aurélien Guichard, perfumer-creator at Takasago, and then next September, this time with a new women's perfume designed by Juliette Karagueuzoglou and Caroline Dumur, perfumers at IFF. ""We have been passionately reviving the Carven perfumes for eight years, and it is a real success. This year, this beautiful brand will become the group's leader in terms of turnover. Our main value consists in offering total freedom of creation, while really listening to consumers' desires, thanks to our retailer expertise,"" explains Nicolas Dewitte. Jacques Bogart has also prepared an ambitious launch for the Silver Scent line, which keeps making progress globally, in Europe, Latin America, and as far as Australia. At Ted Lapidus, eight new fragrances called Stories by Lapidus were launched last November for a more affordable price: EUR 39 for 100 ml. ""One market segment is not much developed in Western Europe: that of intermediate ranges. We will try to position ourselves on this segment with perfumes with an excellent value for money, so that we overturn the codes of traditional perfumery,"" says Nicolas Dewitte. If the General Manager revealed he is considering possible new purchases, he also announced a major innovation for this spring: the creation of a new alcohol-free perfume brand. Based on Symrise's Innoscent technology, Néo Colognes has developed five intense fragrances free from alcohol. These products are made in France, in Bogart Group's plants. ""It is the first time a brand has offered clean, alcohol-free eaux de Cologne with a high percentage of ingredients of natural origin developed with a responsible approach,"" says Nicolas Dewitte. These Néo Colognes will first be launched via the group's distribution network, starting from June, for EUR 79 (100 ml), and then through other channels. ""Designed in less than a year, this development was possible because we listened to consumers' needs, thanks to our distribution network and 1,476 beauty advisors,"" emphasizes Nicolas Dewitte. After completely restructuring Méthode Jeanne Piaubert, a year ago, the group is doing the same with premium brand Stendhal. The formulas were reviewed to reach over 90% of ingredients of natural origin and the packaging was made more ecoresponsible, in particular by designing refills and removing both instruction leaflets and bolsters in all products. A new active, Elixir de Lys, developed at the R&D laboratory in the Pyrenees, has also completed the Stendhal range. ""It is a natural active with anti-spot properties which evens out the tone and prevents the harmful effects on the skin of blue light, pollution, and the sun – an increasingly concerning issue for women,"" explains the Deputy General Manager. In addition, the brand is about to relaunch its makeup line: vegan formulas and feminine, timeless shades in uncluttered packaging. April, the private label of the eponymous network, also keeps growing. A few months after the successful relaunch of the bathroom line, they have sped things up with makeup: almost 500 new references are scheduled for October. ""April is designed as a cosmetics and makeup brand to be deployed at other retailers,"" explains the General Manager. Lastly, Bogart aims to keep opening April stores in the Middle East. Today, the network counts 380 perfume shops in Israel, France, Germany, and Benelux. ""While everyone is closing down physical stores, we still intend to develop our retail network. We believe it is still important to exchange with our customers in physical stores, to smell perfumes, discover new launches, and get familiar with textures,"" states Nicolas Dewitte. Next perfume shop will open in May in the heart of Dubai, across 250 m2, and then four other store inaugurations are scheduled for June, also in the United Arab Emirates. The group aims to gradually open about thirty stores in the Middle East. The e-retail part now represents 6% of the group's turnover. They would like to reach 10% with a new website which will be operational next April in Germany, and then next September, throughout Europe. ""E-retail should really be a plus for retail. It should be complementary and provide a new service. We will speed things up with our omnichannel strategy and develop the website accordingly."" The group also made use of the tough year 2020 to implement an information reporting system from store managers to the group's brand development managers. ""The crisis emphasized the need to listen to consumers even more, so that we can offer products better-adapted to their needs. If we are successful with our direct contact system, we will have transformed this difficult year into an opportunity,"" concludes Nicolas Dewitte."
CTK launches turnkey product development digital platform,"Based in Seoul, the CTK Cosmetics company founded in 2001 achieves more than three quarters of its turnover outside its country of origin, in particular in the US. Initially specialized in packaging, in 2017, it was transformed to implement a business model focused on the full development of cosmetic products, by relying on an active R&D service and on innovations - both formulas and packaging. Much affected by the global sanitary situation, just like their customers, this year, the group turned to digital technologies to overcome the slowdown and regain agility. Within the company, a sales-force-oriented system was implemented to provide the organization with better accessibility and accuracy as regards data and data management, as well as more visibility as regards the workflow needed for each project. Externally, the group invested in the digital transformation of their business model through CTKClip, a digital development platform reserved for their customers and accessible all around the world. ""Our customers can find inspiration and create projects themselves, from A to Z, thanks to our formulation and packaging resources. We aim to improve our global reach to widen our influence in Europe, the Middle East, and China,"" says Ian Chung, founder and CEO of the company. CTK has just opened a new innovation laboratory specialized in formulas. The CTK Innolab will help the company meet market sustainability needs with a particularly high quality level to meet the strictest global standards. ""In 2020, our development team created 137 new innovative cosmetic products, including some of the world's best sellers in the face care, concealer, and eyeliner categories, many of them being clean and vegan formulas, in line with the current trends,"" adds CTK Cosmetics Vice-President Sunny Choi. As for packaging, the innovations are mainly focused on sustainability, with concepts based on single materials, banking on recyclable or reusable products and using as many recycled (PCR) plastics or bioplastics possible. Over the past 20 years, the group's packaging division has registered 290 patents, which highlights high design and functionality creativity. The latest developments reflect a will to follow the market's trends. The new Bottom Up Stick enables to use the whole lipstick formula without any product waste. When the user gets to the end, they just need to turn the stick's rotating base, exerting a slight pressure to get rid of any resistance and release the rest of the product. The content and mechanism can be separated for better material recyclability. The Eco-Pact is a 100% recyclable compact pack for powders or balms fully based on PET. The aluminium mirror can be easily removed, so the product can be recycled. CTK has also developed Green pumps, a series of containers and airless pumps perfectly adapted to new environmental conditions. The Eco-Green Springless pump is fully recyclable and features no spring, so the full product can be returned. The container is based on 94% PP and 6% PPM. The pumps are available in 15-ml to 100-ml sizes."
Laboté fights cosmetics waste and hacks used packaging,"If there is one field in which products should meet very personal needs, it is cosmetics. Based on this belief and on the fact that beauty's industrialization often results in waste-generating dissatisfaction, Lucile Battail, PhD in Pharmacy, launched her brand concept Laboté in 2017. In her two Parisian laboratory-points of sale, every product is tailor-made based on a diagnosis made online or in-store. ""I wanted to customize the texture and the perfume, taking into account the customer's environment, weaknesses, intolerances… I needed a lot of flexibility,"" she explains. So, she developed a patented cold-emulsion process to make products in five minutes as soon as they have been ordered. The formulas are based on the active value of medicinal plants. Made by a team of chemists, they are fresh and free from any listed preservatives. To Lucile Battail, this highly customized approach is an answer to overconsumption. ""Waste is very little dealt with in the cosmetics industry,"" she says. According to a study conducted by IFOP, 46% of French women say they do not finish their skincare products. This waste is believed to represent a volume of about 4 tonnes a day in France. To raise awareness of this issue, last February 18, Laboté launched the operation called The Beauty Hack. ""I needed an original idea to pass on this new message. Cosmetics waste is an issue few people are aware of,"" explains Lucile Battail. In the laboratory located Rue Keller, in Paris, customers can bring back their old glass jars, so they are disinfected and repacked with a formula freshly prepared on-site, and of course, personalized. Online, once their diagnosis has been made, customers can choose to purchase an ecorefill based on a material derived from apple peeling upcycling. The refill goes with a label bearing the batch number and the list of ingredients, as well as with instructions to clean up used jars, so they can be reused. In addition, Laboté offers to retrieve the plastic packs that cannot be sterilized to have them recycled by their partner, Terracycle. An informative video released on February 18 on the social media got a significant number of shares and views: over 100,000 views in a week. ""We are definitely legitimate in addressing this issue, and given how successful the operation is, we will do this regularly,"" explains the founder. As Laboté's turnover has almost reached a million euros, they aim to go further with this concept. ""I do believe an on-demand production model can be industrialized, and that is what we aim to do. Within the next two years, we will open a much larger, fully automated laboratory where products will still be made on request,"" promises the founder."
Nippon Shikizai is banking on the natural innovations of its European subsidiaries,"Heavily affected by the COVID crisis and lockdown measures, large Japanese cosmetic brands have seen their profits drop sharply, according to Tsuyoshi Hasuo, President of Nippon Shikizai France. The group reacted to this situation with adaptability and innovation, in particular with a whole range of make-up and skincare products suited to new consumer expectations. In Europe, Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics has developed products suiting both the repeated use of digital devices and their impact on the skin, such as a Self-Protective Mist and an Anti-Blue Light Eye Contour. For enhanced antibacterial protection, the laboratory has also developed a biocidal hand gel, both a disinfectant and a moisturiser, formulated with calendula and hyaluronic acid. Nippon Shikizai intends to leverage on its European teams to establish its global development, increase its expertise and reduce time to market. Since the acquisition of Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics in 2000, more than EUR 13 million have been invested in the production site based in Normandy. With the more recent integration of Orléans Cosmetics, renamed Nippon Shikizai France, the group has stepped up its production capacity to 95 million units per year in Europe. Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics is one of the fastest-growing manufacturers in Europe with a steady increase in sales. The turnover grew from EUR 9 million in 2014 to EUR 18 million in 2018 and EUR 20 million in 2019 (EUR 23 million with Nippon Shikizai France). Despite the overall context, growth remained strong in 2020 (+9%). Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics also generates 50% of its revenues on the American market. Alongside Japanese technical know-how, the group centres its French innovation on the trend of natural performance. ""Europe is the cradle of clean, natural and organic beauty for the group,"" assures Bertrand Lasserre, Managing Director of Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics. A challenge that translates into various clean and hybrid innovations, both in skincare and make-up. Boasting clean, natural, water-free, preservative-free, non-gender and vegan performances, a new range of innovative and high-performance moisturising skincare products is proposed in the form of sticks and with a recyclable packaging solution. It is formulated with 99% natural ingredients (hemp oil, baobab, cellulose, organic mango butter, etc.) and Cosmos certified. Also in skincare, the range of boosters, with well-being, anti-ageing, hydration and skin radiance properties, with more than 97% of ingredients of natural origin, is formulated to suit all skin types. On the side of make-up, the silicone-free line of foundations, concealers and highlighters, plays the card of solid formats with its stick format and claims 97% naturalness and a hybrid action. The mattifying powders, blushes or bronzers, are 100% natural and tinted with vegetable pigments extracted from radish, beetroot and turmeric. The Ultra-Green range of compact powders, blushes and eye shadows has ruled out talcum powder or titanium dioxide, leaving room for 99.9% naturally derived ingredients. Besides the foundation category, which represents the bulk of products manufactured by the group (31%), the mascara/eyeliner range is developing significantly in the Normandy production unit, which offer a brand new natural and hybrid mascara formula featuring active ingredients that strengthen and help the growth of eyelashes. The other main categories are eye-shadow/blush type products (10%), and skin and sun care (10% in 2019) but growing strongly in 2020 thanks to the innovation efforts of Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics. As for Nippon Shikizai France mainly dedicated to powders which account for 70% of the production, the objective for the coming years is to reach a 50/50 distribution between powders and cast products."
"Cécile Lochard, Guerlain: an ""uncompromising"" transition towards naturalness","Premium Beauty News - How did you deal with this transformation towards more natural makeup? Cécile Lochard - We worked hard to apply to makeup what we had managed to do with skincare. Makeup lagged behind for several reasons, the most obvious being that replacing certain ingredients too hastily prevented us from preserving the sensoriality typical of Maison Guerlain. But we had anticipated: for example, it took us over five years to find the right waxes for KissKiss Shine Bloom. It is definitely the trickiest category when it comes to ingredient substitution, but the cosmetics industry has made great progress. Now, we aim to apply this process to all our innovations, in both skincare and makeup. This speeding up consists in developing ever-more high-performing and natural products without compromising on sensoriality, safety, and health. Premium Beauty News - It is a very technical segment. Does the high performance expected make the challenge even more complex? Cécile Lochard - We do not want to talk our customers into accepting the fact that their Terracotta is no longer the same on the grounds that we pushed naturalness as far as possible. At Guerlain, we need performance and sensoriality to meet expectations, including with these new formulas. That is why the search for ingredients involves many steps: we need to obtain properties equivalent to our synthetic materials'. We have worked hard with our partners and historical suppliers. Guerlain had never invested so much in innovation in ""natural beauty"". That is how we managed to make these three iconic launches. Besides, Candice Colin, the founder of the Clean Beauty application, integrated our External Ethics Committee as soon as she created the app, three years ago. She challenges our ecoformulation approach as a whole and supports us with this launch. Premium Beauty News - What about ecopackaging? Cécile Lochard - We work on the packaging and the formula eco-design at the same time. But we do sometimes make progress step by step. Again, for Terracotta, the formula goes far beyond the 90% of ingredients of natural origin we had aimed for, since we obtained 96%. But we were not ready to develop a new case: we need to take the time to make analyses and find out what will be most environmentally ""profitable"". As far as makeup is concerned, the ecopack parameters vary. For Guerlain, it makes more sense to choose refillable solutions for heavy products, like our ultra-premium ranges, and to favour new materials for lighter creations. Although we are not done yet with eco-design for these three product possibilities, we did not want to put a halt to the advances achieved with the formulas. Still, it should be said that at Guerlain, every new pack corresponds to an environmental performance index and should obtain a higher mark than the previous pack. So, there are changes in terms of materials and weight, only they are not always visible. Premium Beauty News - Could you tell us about the achievements obtained with the Bee Respect platform intended to provide transparent information about the composition of Guerlain products? Cécile Lochard - Bee Respect was launched in January 2019. First, we presented our skincare products, then our makeup products, and then gradually, our perfume catalogue. At the end of 2021, 100% of our products will be traceable. We launched it in France first, but we will have more precise and relevant feedback when the platform is launched on the Chinese market in late 2021. However, we were pleasantly surprised with our customers' curiosity. Traffic is increasing. The site is very well-perceived by the people who know about it. Guerlain was a pioneer in this field: we anticipated the huge transparency expectations in the luxury segment. Obviously, the sanitary crisis strengthened the demand for more transparent, traceable, and natural products. It was a catalyst, although Maison Guerlain had been long committed. Premium Beauty News - What are your projects as Maison Guerlain's new Chief Sustainability Officer? Cécile Lochard - We need to go even further. Our new President, Véronique Courtois, aims to go even faster with ecoformulation and ecopackaging. Sustainable development is taken into account on a daily basis in our innovation processes. She really wants to embrace this issue. And she is also committed to speeding up awareness of bees' preservation, since the bee is the emblem of Maison Guerlain and of biodiversity. We are going to work on education about our totem and explain why it is vital to preserve biodiversity. I think Guerlain is unique in that it has drawn inspiration from Nature for almost 200 years. To us, it is important to work on this relationship through sustainable, natural ingredient sourcing and local audits on honey, orchids, royal jelly, but also neroli, ylang, roses, etc. We audit both the environmental and social aspects for continuous improvement. It may not be the most appealing criterion for consumers, but to me, luxury does not exist without biodiversity. It is a very upstream, sourcing-oriented strategy which makes our products qualitative. Of course, we can share beautiful stories, but above all, we need tangible evidence."
L'Oréal aims 95% sustainable ingredients in its products by 2030,"L'Oréal wants to open a new chapter in Research & Innovation by gradually terminating the use of petroleum derivatives in its formulas over the next few years. In order to address today's environmental challenges and meet the demand - heightened by the Covid-19 pandemic - for products that are both good for health and safe for the environment, the group has set itself the goal that by 2030, 95% of its ingredients be derived from renewable plant sources, abundant minerals, or circular processes; and 100% of formulas be respectful of the aquatic environment. Why not aiming 100% sustainable ingredients? According to L'Oréal, for certain categories, in particular haircare products, it is not yet technically possible to replace all oil-derived ingredients without lowering their performance. L'Oréal intends to achieve these results by drawing on recent advances in Green Sciences, especially for the sustainably farming of ingredients and the extraction of actives through cutting-edge technological processes. The group is rallying its full range of resources in Green Sciences, including advances in agronomics, together with new developments in biotechnology, Green Chemistry, formulation science and modelling tools. ""Our ambition is that by 2030 we will be able to offer women and men around the world increasingly effective, safe cosmetics that respect the environment,"" said Nicolas Hieronimus, L'Oréal Deputy Chief Executive Officer, in charge of Divisions. Much remains to be done in this area. According to the group, 80% of its raw materials are ""easily biodegradable"", and 59% are renewable, however only 34% are natural or of natural origin. Furthermore, 29% of the ingredients used in L'Oréal formulas were developed according to the principles of Green Chemistry. To achieve this transition, the group is therefore also building a range of strategic partnerships with universities, start-ups, and its own raw material suppliers. At the same time, L'Oréal remains committed to transparency with new initiatives to further improve information on cosmetic ingredients, specifically through the Inside Our Products website that covers nearly 1,000 listed ingredients and is now available across 45 countries in eight languages. The group also launched, in conjunction with Garnier, an information campaign highlighting the environmental and social impact of its products. The initiative is being deployed around the globe and will gradually encompass all its brands. And to make it all more tangible, L'Oréal will organize a drive on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube in some 20 countries."
Edgewell speeds up brands green transition,"Edgewell's strategic goal is crystal clear for the next five years: adopt the cleanest possible industrial and product approach. The group changed its organization accordingly, by appointing a Global Sustainability Director. This strategy immediately drove changes related to both pack and formula design and production processes. British brand Bulldog put forward sustainable ambitions right from the beginning, with formulas composed of 95% of natural ingredients and biosourced plastic tubes. Last year, they launched the first razor fitted with a bamboo handle in a plastic-free pack. This year, they are pushing limits further with a razor whose handle is 70% glass-based: the glass is derived from recycled beer bottles and the razor is also delivered in a plastic-free bag. ""It is definitely our iconic brand in terms of ecoresponsibility. Edgewell can use its know-how to structure its historic brands following the same logic,"" says Céline Solladié, Head of Marketing Edgewell France. Two major changes were achieved for the Wilkinson's refillable and disposable ranges. The Hydro razor range has gotten rid of plastic, which was replaced with FSC-certified cardboard. The tray is also made of plant-based fibre, and the foil is cellulose-based – the whole is recyclable. The Hydro 3 and 5 versions have been enriched with a moisturizing gel free from titanium dioxide. As for disposable razors, last September, Wilkinson launched their very first ecodesigned disposable razor, Xtreme 3 Eco Green: the handle is made with 95% recycled plastic and the packaging contains over 95% of recycled and recyclable cardboard. ""We are now going to make a substantial change to the rest of the Xtreme 3 range, which accounts for a quarter of the disposable razor market. We have designed a handle composed of at least 70% of recycled plastic. This change will be gradually implemented in all our disposable ranges. We aim to reduce the part of virgin plastic in all our products to less than 50% in four years. We are ahead of schedule with disposable razors,"" reveals the Director. The brand specialized in sun products with addictive fragrances reviewed its formulas to completely remove the octocrylene and octinoxate chemical filters from its lotions. Meanwhile, they launched an SPF 30 lotion on the European market: Reef-friendly-labelled, it contains 100% of mineral filters and no controversial ingredients. The bottle is also composed of 25% of recycled plastic. ""It is a very strong launch for Hawaiian Tropic. All other products will be reformulated over the next three to five years,"" claims Céline Solliadé. On the global razor market affected by a structural decline worsened by the lockdown, Edgewell remains stable and hopes to gain new market shares thanks to these innovations. ""Above all, we aim to go much further with Bulldog. In France, this brand has ranked third for three years among men's brands in supermarkets. Taking into account all skincare products, we have gained 7 points in terms of market shares: we are behind major leaders like L'Oréal and Nivea. It means Bulldog is credible on this market,"" adds Céline Solladié."
"Ajnalogie, when perfumes meet aromachology","Premium Beauty News - Where does Ajnalogie's concept come from? Agathe Jacquinet - Back when I was at the ISIPCA school as an international marketing Master's student, I worked as a trainee for Phyto, a brand which develops plant-based hair care products. It was a fulfilling, deeply inspiring experience about the power of plants. The discovery of aromachology led to both a revelation and a statement of fact: the benefits of plants in perfumes are very little – almost never – highlighted. That is why I felt like creating a brand which would blend the magic of perfumes and the richness of raw materials. I had the idea of a perfume range with real virtues in terms of wellness and emotions. I also banked on a 100% natural range, though I do not think aromachology is only related to naturalness: anyone can feel emotions with chemical molecules. My choice of 100% natural formulas is not meant to run down synthetic substances, but to provide perfumes with both depth and energy. Premium Beauty News - Could you describe your creative process? Agathe Jacquinet - Once the concept was clear in my head, I started to look for a perfumer. I met Éléonore de Staël, a young perfumer specialized in 100% natural formulas. Then, we were lucky enough to meet experts in this field by hosting thematic workshops. Annick Le Guérer enlightened us about the cultural and historical aspect of aromachology. Sabine Le Camus, professor at ISIPCA, explained to us the virtues of certain accords, and thanks to chemist Francine Joly, we studied the influence of materials and perfumes on our emotions. After a creative phase which lasted a bit more than a year, we had our concentrates produced, and then packed in Grasse, in southern France. As for materials, Éléonore likes working with IFF and LMR. Premium Beauty News - What about the isolates derived from natural materials, but which are classified as synthetic notes? Agathe Jacquinet - Right from the beginning, Éléonore wanted to use them, because she is used to formulating perfumes this way. And these molecules actually offer a broader palette for perfumers to structure and facet their fragrances. Premium Beauty News - What do you think makes your brand original? Agathe Jacquinet - Our concept targets customers in search of connection. Beyond selling perfumes, I am very keen to provide wellness and advice to help people develop and accept themselves. For example, I host olfactory meditation sessions. This concept is also original in that we chose to offer ""open"" formulas. Lastly, the main raw materials are indicated on the packaging to present their benefits. Premium Beauty News - Is Ajnalogie intended to revolutionize the niche perfumery landscape? Agathe Jacquinet - Ajnalogie's added value lies in how it diffuses a vision of wellness in the perfume world. For example, beyond perfumes, I created a personality test to determine people's emotional profiles and needs, and guide them into creating their own daily perfume ritual. Above all, I want to help them adapt their perfumes to their moods. To this aim, I designed a ""ritual"" box (€75) composed of five 5 ml flasks, so they can have them all. This box makes it possible to fully experience the brand's concept. That is also why I chose small sizes: I wanted to offer the possibility to have several perfumes for an affordable price (30 ml for EUR 65), despite the high cost of natural formulas. In the perfume industry, it is rare to associate a fragrance and a chakra: Sérénité 4.0 corresponds to the fourth chakra, Désir 2.0 to the second, etc. The renewal we offer with Ajnalogie is also related to perfume application gestures. Each case is fitted with a pipette, a gentler, intimate and sensual application ritual which helps reconnect with yourself, your perfume, and sensorial energies. The spray is somewhat more mechanic, and this gesture in line with the ""slow"" trend is very popular. On Instagram, I regularly post ritual models, for example to explain how to apply the Confiance 5.0 perfume related to the throat chakra on the throat, with the pipette. Premium Beauty News - How do you see Ajnalogie's future? Agathe Jacquinet - I would like to make people discover my brand in studios fully dedicated to wellness – cocoons where you can blend perfumes, meditation, skincare, etc. In the short term, of course, I will develop points of sale, although I do not think a ""niche"" concept store would really be adapted to my concept. I am also considering completing the range with two perfumes related to other chakras. But above all, I intend to create products which improve the notion of ""wellness ritual"", like candles, for meditation, or sensual oil for the Désir 2.0 perfume. I am keen to target life moments when we need these smells. Ultimately, there will be a range of olfactory jewels to diffuse perfume like pomanders, by combining the virtues of stones and perfume plants."
Fiabila innovates to address risks related to semi-permanent gel nail polish,"Premium Beauty News - What are Fiabila's main innovations this year? Alexandre Miasnik - Paradoxically, as consumers increasingly seek purity, naturalness, and safety, ""gel"" or ""semi-permanent"" nail polish is getting ever-more popular in most countries. The problem is that these products are loaded with monomers, which means they are harmful and comply neither with cosmetics regulations nor with most brands' blacklists widely acknowledged on the nail polish market. Their occlusive nail films lead to a risk of allergies and damage for users, as well as a risk of skin or respiratory reactions for manicures. At Fiabila, developing alternative formulas using safe raw materials has been at the core of our R&D strategy for many years. As a result, we have put an emphasis on the development of UV-reactive techniques to exclude monomers, and we now offer two product ranges: Sun Prodigy, which reacts to natural UV rays and can be used at home, and Salon Prodigy, which is more professional, since it is applied under a LED lamp. Both can easily last up to 15 days and can be removed at home without difficulty. Meanwhile, we keep upgrading ""conventional"" formulas to achieve a high performance level, at least taking into account the current situation in terms of research and raw materials available. Premium Beauty News - It seems nail care is getting much stronger. Is it a key growth path for Fiabila? Alexandre Miasnik - Nail care is essential. All women or almost are concerned with breaking, weakened, or dry nails. The use of gels makes things worse, especially since, to cover bad-looking nails after application, most women conceal them with another application, which deprives nails of oxygen for weeks and alters their condition. The fact that salons closed during lockdown, preventing products from being removed, further compounded the problem. There is a high demand for strengthening nail care products, so we developed comprehensive ranges of products intended to repair and nourish nails, in particular by adding natural actives, vitamins, vegetable oils, and fruit extracts. Although these products are cosmetics, not drugs, we guarantee their efficacy with systematic tests on consumer panels. Also, to make our ranges more appealing, since they are often transparent among other products, we have coloured them, and even slightly perfumed a few for more pleasure of use, in particular to seduce younger consumers. Premium Beauty News - Has the notion of naturalness further evolved on the nail polish segment? Alexandre Miasnik - Naturalness is a notion that is getting lost among many others: organic, biosourced, clean, vegan, etc. In fact, consumers, and sometimes even brands, are often lost – or misled. For example, organic semi-permanent nail polish can be harmful, because it still contains allergenic raw materials. When it comes to nail polish, naturalness usually means previously petroleum-based raw materials are replaced by products derived from farming which offer exactly the same performance. It is a significant step forward: today, most range launches involve products of natural origin. Premium Beauty News - Many conventional brands claim their products are partly natural. What do you think about this? Alexandre Miasnik - What matters most is consumer safety. European cosmetics regulations and many others largely contributed to removing harmful substances from the market, and that's all the better. At Fiabila, the search for increasingly pure ingredients led us to contribute to developing raw materials of natural origin for our formulas. Premium Beauty News - What about manufacturing processes? Do brands take them into account when developing clean formulas? Alexandre Miasnik - It is a key issue – our customers' requirements in this field are extreme. Nail polish is a highly technical product; manufacturing requires much know-how. There is a double challenge: using a process which complies with specifications, while providing the performance required and, more recently, complying with very demanding manufacturing standards. At Fiabila, we have fitted our three main sites in France, the USA, and Brazil, with fully automated systems for manufacturing suspension bases, and we are the only ones to have this equipment. As a result, we deliver products with incredible quality consistency, we avoid contamination risks, and we minimize polluting emissions. Premium Beauty News - It seems the global nail polish market has taken advantage of the different lockdown periods. Can you confirm that? Alexandre Miasnik - Women never ceased wearing makeup; they kept buying products. But things do vary from one geographic region to another. In any case, obviously, many women who were used to going to salons applied their own nail polish themselves at home!"
Trade shows: The 2021 calendar focuses on the second half of the year,"Several trade shows initially scheduled for the first half of 2021 were quickly rescheduled when it became clear for everyone that the state of health emergency would be maintained for several months in a large number of countries. While waiting for a physical return, digital editions try to compensate for the lack of real-life encounters. In this context of permanent rescheduling, we tried to offer an updated overview on the current calendar of professional events to date:"
Skin Lab: The new skincare algorithm born out of lockdown,"Premium Beauty News - Can you please tell us a bit more about Skin Lab and how you came up with the idea? Joanna O'Connor - Skin Lab is an online source for independent personalised science-led skincare advice. There are no products, no brands and no advertising on the site. Skin Lab's regime builder is an innovative tool for most women and men to understand what their skin really needs, independently and without bias or agenda. Board-certified dermatologists have recognised that there are 16 'normal' skin types. Our software uses the common questions a dermatologist would ask you on your first visit to identify what your skin type is, and then provides you with a personalised regime of essential and recommended ingredients that are most likely to help with your concerns. I often to say to my friends who asked me why I built Skin Lab for other people. You can go to a nutritionist and find out what foods hold the right nutritional content for you to achieve your goals or maintain a healthy lifestyle. Or you can go to a Michelin star chef who is going to give you a meal that will taste incredible, it'll blow your mind, but it probably isn't balanced with the nutrients your body needs, and you can't live off it. The expensive, wonderfully packaged, great smelling, social influencer endorsed products we're getting are our Michelin star meal. During Melbourne lockdown, I purchased a $400+ moisturiser that was celebrity endorsed and contained things like plant stem cell technology and packed and wrapped like a new iPhone. And I was excited. I had nowhere to go, and nothing else to do. I kept a skin diary, and I had zero results. I kind of had a meltdown. I wanted results! I had paid for results. So… I turned to the nutritionists of skincare. I started reading what the dermatologists were saying. I respected their 10 years of study into skin. I respected that they referenced unbiased scientific evidence. I noticed patterns. I started a scrap book. I joined the dots between common skin ailments, what the research and medical professionals were recommending, and then the products that some types of skin should stay away from. Skin Lab ultimately is a shrine to dermatologists, chemist and cosmetic doctors. The recommendations are a connection of the science, and algorithm behind the profession. It doesn't replace going and having a one on one consultation with a professional that will analyse your skin. But, Skin Lab will help you step away from the brand hype and drama of social media, be able to read an ingredients label and look to find products that have actual ingredients that will work for you. Premium Beauty News - Is Skin Lab backed up by science? Joanna O'Connor - Absolutely. The purpose of Skin Lab is to cut through the marketing, the brand hype and the social media trends, and use the science and medical industry's research and publicly available information. This information is out there, but brands skew it, social media debates it and the marketing is more shiny. Skin Lab doesn't recommend a particular brand or product range. It recommends ingredients that the dermatologists are recommending. Like Dr Davin Lim, a dermatologist from Brisbane, advocating on his YouTube channel that a moisturiser shouldn't cost you more than $40. Because the products that contain all the ingredients you need, are easily and cheaply available. They just aren't packaged like an iPhone. Premium Beauty News - Do you have any experience in the skincare or science industries? Joanna O'Connor - I'm not a medical professional or a chemist. Skin Lab uses the recommendations of independent doctors with decades of study and clinical experience and research that takes the skill and understanding from the most respected and referenced researchers in the scientific community. I have however, over a decade of experience in spending all my discretionary income on skincare. Beauty therapy treatments. Fade potions and lotions. Natural ideologies. Powders and their promises. And my skin wasn't bad, but I was seeing beauty therapists who were selling me laser treatments at $500+ a pop to deal with my melasma (pigmentation) and I felt it wasn't worth it. Premium Beauty News - What can we expect to find on the Skin Lab website? Joanna O'Connor - Here's what you won't find: products, advertising or hype. We have three key areas of the site. The first is a glossary, so skincare enthusiasts can start understanding their alpha-hydroxy-acids from their antioxidants. The second is the Skin Wiki, where every article provides a link to the research, the doctors or chemists that provide the backing behind the recommendation. Then head to Build Your Regime, wait some precious seconds of anticipation for it to load, and straight up you'll pay $10 and then start the journey to identify your skin type. Premium Beauty News - How does one go about building their skincare regime on site? Joanna O'Connor - The Regime Builder will ask a series of questions on your skin concerns and experiences, much like a dermatologist would on your first consultation. Based on the answers, your skin type is identified and with that you'll be presented with a downloadable paper on what your skin needs, and what it doesn't as well as two levels of regime, beginner and advanced. Advanced being for once your skin is tolerant to the actives you've introduced at the beginner stage. To use the Regime Builder and identify your skin type and get a personalised downloadable/printable regime it's $10 – think of it as your first consult with a dermatologist, in fact we recommend taking yours to your dermatologist and cutting straight to your second visit having introduced the fundamentals to your regime already. Once someone knows the ingredient and concentration they need (e.g. 5% benzol peroxide), all they need to do is a google search of the ingredient and they can buy the product or the brand they prefer. Premium Beauty News - How did you come up with the algorithm? Joanna O'Connor - I found a pattern in what medically qualified skincare professionals were advocating and discussing. I started with an enthusiasm to understand it for myself, then for my friends, and then to make this advice more accessible to others. To do that, I identified that there are 16 different 'normal' skin types that each have ingredients that will work, and that should be avoided. With a bunch of mind maps and informational flow charts – I started building the algorithm behind the Skin Lab Regime Builder. Premium Beauty News - Do you have any plans on expanding any of these features? Joanna O'Connor - I do, but the key thing is that I get feedback from Skin Lab users. For now, I've had some great feedback from users about how it's helped them and that's a great starting place."
"""Skincare requires highly sophisticated solutions"", Bertrand Lasserre, Thépenier","Premium Beauty News - Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics has belonged to Japanese group Nippon Shikizai since 2000. Bertrand Lasserre - Absolutely. But our business is quite different from our parent company's. In Japan, Nippon Shikizai is mainly focused on makeup, whereas we primarily formulate water-based skincare, hygiene, and makeup products – in particular mascara and eyeliners. Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics is specialized in liquid and emulsified cosmetics and hygiene formulas. Apart from the pharmaceutical segment, we are present on the oral care, clean beauty, and natural beauty markets. However, we do work in synergy with Nippon Shikizai and Nippon Shikizai France (formerly known as Orléans Cosmetics), which was acquired by TP&C in 2017, and whose business is much closer to our parent company's: the production is 90% focused on anhydrous makeup, in particular powders, hot-poured products, and scented products. We share the same sales teams, so we can offer our customers an almost comprehensive range of cosmetics. Right now, pencils are the only products we cannot manufacture. Premium Beauty News - Still, you subcontract makeup more than skincare. Bertrand Lasserre - Things change very fast as regards subcontracting, in particular due to the emergence of new, very innovative brands in search of highly sophisticated turnkey solutions and mostly based on marketing concepts that do not involve an industrial tool. But it is also due to major brands' growing need for reactivity, which pushes them to increasingly choose subcontracting in order to reduce development times and time-to-market. In fact, Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics can work with both small emerging brands and major global players. We achieve 30% of our turnover with French customers and 70% through export, mainly in Europe and the USA (40%). Historically, we are a renowned player in oral care subcontracting, and we are still a major OTC producer in this category. But we are growing at a fast pace on the cosmetics segment – we have produced cosmetic products for over 30 years. Manufacturing in compliance with pharmaceutical GMPs has become highly differentiating – and a competitive advantage, to a certain extent, namely on all skincare segments related to clean beauty and to the technological healthcare trend, which have boomed since the COVID-19 crisis: they meet an rising consumer need for performance. In fact, we target the high-end segment of the cosmetics market. Our strategy is aimed to provide skincare subcontracting with added value and offer quality guarantees many of our competitors cannot offer. In this respect, I believe a standard offering will not be enough in the long run for a subcontractor to remain on the market. Premium Beauty News - Could you give a few practical examples? Bertrand Lasserre - We offer both formula 'skeletons' and turnkey solutions as part of a full-service offering in partnership with packaging leaders. Depending on our customers' projects, we create the formula, produce it, and suggest a well-adapted pack, recycled or recyclable, whenever possible, in line with the brand's expectations and the DNA of our product/service offering. What's more, we take care of the filling phase and have internal quality control solutions. We actually deliver fewer and fewer bulk products. Following this principle, we have developed our own regulatory offering, partly with external partners. Plus, we integrate sales portfolios before launches to help brands answer the now systematic, increasingly specific questions they get asked on social media. Premium Beauty News - What are your main ambitions in terms of innovation? Virginie Barville - Right from the start, we endeavour to use responsible raw materials mainly sourced in France or Europe. Of course, we strictly comply with our customers' specifications, but we systematically try to minimize the number of ingredients in our formulas, by incorporating multipurpose actives, without focusing on purely sensorial ingredients, and limit the use of potentially irritant preservatives. To meet our customers' expectations, we also need to reduce time-to-market. To this aim, we can patent some of our active cocktails and formula skeletons, so we can offer bases to be personalized with actives, perfumes… We offer an extremely broad base range, so we can reduce development times to 6 months, or even less, as required by the brand - but we do not recommend to. Premium Beauty News - Could you provide a few recent examples of innovations? Virginie Barville - In line with the current trends, we developed a One-For-All cream which can be used as a skincare, face care, or even hair care product. We also designed a 96% natural whitening serum for teeth. It is a completely new gesture: you just drop serum on your toothbrush and use it with toothpaste, or alone as a cure. There is also our Scalp Serum to be applied at night combined with an anti-grey hair active to regulate the scalp microbiota for a global action on hair's health. Lastly, we developed a natural mascara with one of the most accomplished technicity on the market. This mascara is a real eyelash care product: it is enriched with a plant extract derived from Chinese traditional medicine, which enhances lash growth and vitality. Premium Beauty News - How did 2020 go for the company? Bertrand Lasserre - It was quite satisfactory. The company had achieved a two-digit growth since 2015. Of course, the sanitary crisis impacted these dynamics. Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics should end the year 2020 with a 2.5% to 3% growth rate. As for Nippon Shikizai France, they maintained strong momentum: the consolidated growth for our two European entities should reach 8% in 2020, compared to the 23% initially forecast. Premium Beauty News - What are your prospects for the future? Bertrand Lasserre - Our prospects for 2021 are still pretty uncertain, but we believe life will come back to normal in 2022. We had planned to open a sales office in China: the pandemic delayed the project, but it remains an objective for no later than 2022. We are also speeding up our CSR projects: we have undertaken to get the ISO 14001 certification by July 2021, and we are open to external growth opportunities."

"""The era of virtuous perfumes has started,"" Valérie de la Peschardière","Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us about today's consumer expectations for fine perfumery? Valérie de la Peschardière - Consumers still look for perfumes that make them dream, but they also want them to be safe for health and skin. Our consumer studies show that since the Covid-19 crisis, expectations have been evolving even faster: they are mainly related to what is good for health and the environment, and to naturalness in its broad sense. In addition, in France, health and skin protection gained 6 points, naturalness 9 points, and environmental protection, 7 points, while in the US, the first two expectations rose by 6 points. It should also be said that the cosmetics market transformed itself ten years ago! Premium Beauty News - What is an ecoresponsible perfume? Valérie de la Peschardière - It is a perfume whose formula contains eco-friendly ingredients, i.e. ingredients with a low environmental impact. As for natural ingredients, the objective is to improve farming practices in the countries of origin, and minimize the different steps and transport, by transforming raw materials locally, wherever possible. And as for synthetic ingredients, the idea is to apply green chemistry principles and go for biotechnologies! Premium Beauty News - How can natural perfumes become innovative and responsible? Valérie de la Peschardière - First, companies need to work on the plants they use - they should innovate with the fresh material locally, in the country of origin. We have also designed new extraction methods with a lower environmental impact, like flash distillation: we reduced the processing time from 24 hours to 20 minutes for a real innovative olfactory outcome and a much better carbon footprint. Besides, the spices obtained with flash distillation unveil all their freshness. In India, Givaudan designed ginger, turmeric and lemongrass: these products were co-developed with our partner Synthite. We also created a new Sambac jasmine absolute with them. Lastly, thanks to upcycling, we use either waste from other industries, including timber and juices, or our own residues. It is a technical feat which involves capturing the remaining micro-essential oils in their natural state. It is a very encouraging avenue for responsible perfumes with no environmental impact. Premium Beauty News - Do you have any examples of perfume brands? Valérie de la Peschardière - I am trash by État Libre d'Orange was an upcycling pioneer. Perfumer Marc-Antoine Barrois went even farther with Ganymede: he removed all preservatives. In the same vein, Thierry Mugler's Angel Nova contains a highly natural Damask rose whose double extraction combines standard distillation and upcyling. This rose was developed solely for Thierry Mugler. Designed by Sonia Constant, Louise Turner and Quentin Bisch, this fragrance also features our akigalawood derived from biotechnologies. Here, Mugler emphasizes the use of upcycling-derived products - a first for a luxury perfume brand. Premium Beauty News - What is the role of products derived from biotechnologies in eco-responsible perfumery? Valérie de la Peschardière - These processes make it possible to create new responsible molecules, while preserving natural resources. Indeed, it is all based on an enzymatic reaction: the new odorous molecules are generated with very little material and require little energy. In the end, we obtain a biodegradable product with a low carbon footprint. For example, our Ambrofix is obtained using 100 times less natural resources. And it is a real olfactory wonder! Premium Beauty News - How is it possible to create new synthetic molecules, while preserving the environment? Valérie de la Peschardière - Thanks to our Five Carbon Path vision, all our new molecules are derived from renewable sources, transformed in accordance with green chemistry principles, and biodegradable. Since carbon atoms play a key role in perfume manufacturing, Givaudan set up a programme structured around five principles: increase the use of renewable materials, optimization of synthetic processes to decrease the carbon footprint, biodegradability of final molecules, increased ""odour per carbon ratio"" with materials with a strong olfactory impact, and optimisation of recycling and upcycling processes. Premium Beauty News - What remains to be done to enhance perfume plant cultures? Valérie de la Peschardière - For more than 15 years, many programmes have been implemented to support the whole chain and improve practices. Much progress has been made as regards iconic materials: patchouli, vetiver, vanilla, sandalwood, benzoin… We keep supporting the communities involved in the production of these natural materials, and we go further and further every year. This is why we settled in Madagascar to produce vanilla and clove. This year, we helped replant black pepper, which had disappeared for many years. To help farmers in these natural industries, Givaudan teaches good farming and agronomic practices. We develop ad hoc programmes, in particular to fight soil erosion in Haiti to save vetiver, or to promote soil regeneration in Indonesia and reforestation in Madagascar, where we planted over 500,000 trees to protect biodiversity… All this is possible thanks to our agronomic expertise, which directly comes from recent acquisitions, like Naturex."
"""The humanization of the digital is the next step,"" Sabrina Herlory, M.A.C.","What was your experience of the lockdowns at M.A.C. Cosmetics? Sabrina Herlory - I'm not going to lie, it was - and still is - hard! But at the same time, it was exhilarating. The world to come is going to be like this: we're all going to be disrupted 70,000 times in our lives and we're going to have to get out of our comfort zone more regularly. For managers like me, this means making quick decisions based on partial information and no longer with full knowledge of the facts. And this is not an ability that can be learnt overnight, it's a muscle that you train throughout your life. What measures have you taken to withstand the crisis? Sabrina Herlory - We have trained our sales consultants in ""virtual selling"", i.e. one-to-one personalized advice at a distance. This has been appreciated by the teams, who have suffered quite a lot during these periods of partial unemployment, which are very depressing. They realized that even if there was pressure on the retail sector, their occupation could evolve, thanks to digital technology and not disappear! And does ""virtual selling"" work for makeup? Sabrina Herlory - Many doubted it, but I can tell you that, yes, it's very interesting from a human point of view and from a pure business point of view as well. The one-to-one digital concept is a bubble even more insulated than the physical experience in the store. It allowed us to maintain a connection with our customers, who are used to human interaction when buying makeup. We launched these virtual appointments in September 2020 and 70% of the customers who received advice remotely then moved on to a physical store. Real, remote personalized advice can channel traffic for brands when the stores reopen. Is the humanization of digital the next step? Sabrina Herlory - I'm convinced it is! This was the missing piece, and the lockdown allowed us to implement it, thanks to digital tools. It's quite satisfying to say that yes, there has been an explosion of the digital, but what we're learning is that consumers need to talk to real people! For me, the brands that understand this will be the ones that will remain sustainable. If we can prove that the humanization of digital is turning into R.O.I., live chats will be one-to-one, remote consultations will be one-to-one... Because we are all social animals with a real need for quality human interactions. And that goes beyond sales. What does that mean? Sabrina Herlory - Today, if a brand is not organically socially committed to a 360-degree project, I think it will not be able to count in the world to come: it's ""how I treat customers, my suppliers, what footprint do I leave, how do managers treat their employees"". I see more and more managers deeply preoccupied by this global commitment. They often come from the next generation, I must say. They are socially engaged, and that's very gratifying!"
Henkel gets even greener and launches Nature Box in France,"The group's committed objectives are based on a thorough review of all formulas by 2021, to guarantee more naturalness and remove all controversial ingredients. In addition, by 2025, 100% of the packaging will be recyclable and reusable. ""Our mission consists in being the pioneer of more sustainable, ecoresponsible cosmetics accessible to all. We aim to offer better products for the same price,"" says Charlotte Le Buhan, Marketing Director of Henkel Beauty Care. In parallel, Henkel has been developing partnerships with associations, including Force Femmes, and enhancing products' global life cycle, in particular by pooling transport with some competitors to reduce the environmental impact, and by launching a new programme dubbed La beauté du geste to inform and educate consumers so they adopt more virtuous behaviours. Henkel is positioned on the highly competitive hair care and toiletries market driven by the organic wave. To better reach Millennials, they are now launching Nature Box, a fun, environmentally friendly brand. For its French launch, the range features five liquid shampoos and their solid equivalents, plus a conditioner. The formulas are composed of 99% natural ingredients derived from fair sourcing and enriched with cold-pressed hemp, coconut, nut, argan or avocado oil. Each reference is available as a liquid or solid product and packed in eco-packaging. ""We mean to democratize solid shampoos, which have been rising strongly (+422% in 2019) but still only represent 0.3% of the market,"" explains Cyrielle Léonard, Director of Hair Care. The liquid line will be available in supermarkets as soon as January 2021 for EUR 4.50 (250 ml bottle), and solid sizes will be launched next March for the same price. A specific men's range will also be released in April. With the new Natural & Easy range, Schwarzkopf achieves total and long-lasting white hair coverage with formulas composed of 91% to 93% ingredients of natural origin. The growth of the at-home hair colouring segment since lockdown – +1.2 million women recruited on this market, according to Kantar – gets mixed with the demand for more natural products. The Schwarzkopf offering already featured a range of non-permanent botanical dyes; it now counts an exclusive solution. The 10-shade Natural & Easy range will be available as soon as next January for the target price of EUR 9.90. Launched two years ago, the 100% organic cosmetics brand has found its own place in supermarkets. Ranked second in value on the organic hygiene/beauty segment, and third in the face cream category, NAE is now broadening its offering with an Ecocert-certified smoothing anti-ageing line composed of 99% ingredients of natural origin. The three products, a day cream, a night cream, and a serum, will be available next March. Present on the face care market for over 100 years, Diadermine is reinventing itself with a new skincare ritual based on natural retinol. The three new products of the Lift + Algo Retinol range, a day cream, a night cream, and an eye contour, are based on botanical actives harvested in Brittany, France: sea fennel and algae extracts. These products will be available next January."
"""2021 will be better than anticipated"", says Sérgio Sampaio, Grupo Boticário","In a previous interview last August, André Farber, vice president of sales at Boticário Group told Premium Beauty News the Covid-19 pandemic and the temporary closure of all chain stores forced the company to reassess all its expectations for 2020. A month later, in September, Grupo Boticário's factories in Bahia and Paraná announced they had broken their quarterly production records. The company had never produced that much since the O Boticário brand was founded, more than 40 years ago. ""Indeed, the year was very unusual. What we predicted for 2020 has changed a lot over the past few months, and it shows that our dedication and the path traced by the teams worked out,"" commented Sérgio Sampaio, the group's Director of Operations. ""We knew how to act since the beginning of the pandemic to steer our business and reduce the impacts caused by the crisis and not letting it dominate us. This allowed us to reach this record, which we are very proud of"". Compared to January, February and March 2020 (before the lockdown), the production of July, August and September rose by 8.98%, representing the highest volume recorded in a quarter. Sales of O Boticário, the group's historic brand, were driven by the rising demand for hygiene and personal care products. Sales of skin care creams, in particular, increased by 14.5% over the period. Sales of liquid soaps and shampoos also contributed to this record. ""At the beginning of the pandemic, consumers were looking for essential hygiene items, such as hand sanitizers and antibacterial soaps. Then, we saw some other categories gain strength, such as hair care and skin care,"" said Sampaio. ""With no or little access to professional services, the 'do it yourself' trend has gained a lot of momentum. It is a matter of indulgence, of taking care oneself. People had to stay at home, but they wanted to feel good about themselves."" In order to meet this high demand amid the peak of the Covid-19 crisis in Brazil, Grupo Boticário needed to readjust. ""From the very beginning, we dedicated much efforts to provide ideal working conditions, by allowing all of our staff to work from home and by reorganizing the company's areas of densification, so that those who had to be at their posts could do it safely,"" said Sampaio. ""As far as the factories are concerned, we drastically reduced production, maintaining only some lines for items such as hand sanitizers and soaps. When stores reopened, our plants gradually resumed their activity and, to protect everyone's health, we extended the shift of employees from three to four, thus reducing the number of people being inside the factory at the same time,"" he added. The group also deemed necessary to open yet another distribution centre to be able to absorb the increase in volume and dispatch production. ""Located in the city of Campina Grande do Sul, Paraná, the new distribution centre will help us a lot,"" said the director of operations. It will ensure the logistics of e-commerce sales for the brands O Boticário, Eudora and Quem Disse, Berenice? for delivery to different regions of the country. Despite the immense challenges imposed by Covid-19, Sérgio Sampaio said to be proud of what has been achieved this year and optimistic about 2021. ""The work we have done had allowed us to close 2020 in a very positive way and to believe that 2021 will be better than what we anticipated at the start of this crisis,"" he concluded."
"With Beautylitic, ANJAC steers the clean transformation of cosmetic formulations","At a time when consumers are stating their preference for simpler, healthier and more natural beauty solutions free of controversial ingredients, the ANJAC Health & Beauty group is joining forces with Beautylitic, a SaaS BtoB platform for the scientific analysis and evaluation of the composition of beauty and personal care products. After having first appealed to distributors and pure players in e-commerce, eager to better meet the expectations of their customers in terms of clean beauty, Beautylitic is taking its first steps alongside a leading manufacturer. ""A healthier and more transparent beauty concerns all brand profiles and the entire industry, each with its specificities. Brands need benchmarks and therefore data,"" explains Anne Rutigliano, Marketing and Communication Director at ANJAC Health & Beauty. However, with no regulated standards, clean beauty is poorly-defined and relies heavily on the experience of laboratories. ""It was becoming necessary for us to find a tool to characterise and position the clean solutions offered by the ANJAC group's R&D laboratories and thus display the possible solutions transparently,"" continues Anne Rutigliano. Designed to dynamically analyse thousands of references and more efficiently control referencing or development choices, the Beautylitic platform draws on algorithms that take into account a large number of constantly updated data, including ingredient regulations and scientific studies that potentially characterise a robust controversy. Beautylitic thus allows calculating an ""Exposcore"", a score of exposure to controversial ingredients, or to anticipate the ratings that will be attributed by the leading cosmetic evaluation applications (such as Yuka in France, EWG in the United States, or Beauty Evolution in China). An assessment of the formula's impact on natural resources and the environment is also available in a beta version. ""It is first a scientific tool,"" underlines Candice Colin, founder of the platform. ""Today, ingredients have become a key element in deciding whether to buy a product or not. It is therefore important for manufacturers to have tools that allow them to position themselves against the market. Beautylitic provides a concrete answer to the management of the transformation process."" By integrating Beautylic to its innovation approach, the ANJAC group can thus offer its customers an objective and scientific positioning regarding the various formulas proposed by a brand, or of formulas in the process of being created and in relation to the clean beauty universe. ""It is an unbiased tool that brings transparency to discussions. But we approach clean beauty with a lot of flexibility, respecting the DNA of each brand. Of course, this approach is optional,"" explains Anne Rutigliano. ""All our R&D, marketing and sales teams have been trained on the tool with the Beautylitic team. Thus upstream of our internal innovations and customer projects, we can assess the Clean performance of our formulas and challenge them to the maximum, highlighting the strengths but also the levers to go further in the Clean approach,"" adds Pierre Planes, Innovation and R&D Director at Sicaf Cosmétiques, and Chairman of the R&D committee of the ANJAC group. The platform complements the various tools already implemented by the ANJAC Health & Beauty group to provide its customers with personalised and qualified services in the development of formulas meeting consumer expectations, ""without compromising on sensoriality or efficiency, and while respecting the identity of brands."" The industrial partner is thus betting on a streamlined approach to the concept of clean beauty."
Teaology Skincare continues growth trajectory despite tough context,"Premium Beauty News - What is Teaology Skincare about? Paolo and Cecilia Bevegni - At the core of Teology there is a patented technology that enable us to use tea infusions instead of water in the product formulations. We source the most precious teas from all over the world. As a consequence, products offer an extraordinary high concentration of natural active ingredients. Indeed, the tea plant is the most powerful natural source of antioxidant polyphenols. This means our formulas contain 100% active ingredients. We are currently distributed in about 30 countries around the world and our best results are coming today from Europe and Canada. Premium Beauty News - What were the consequences of the pandemic for the brand? Paolo and Cecilia Bevegni - As far as Europe is concerned, the pandemic hit a market that was already growing slowly. Lockdowns had a very strong impact and the increase of online sales did not compensate the drop of the brick-and-mortar business. Recent developments do not allow much optimism till the end of the year. Nevertheless, Teaology will register a significant double-digit growth in 2020, due in particular to the positive development in North America and the launch of new products. Premium Beauty News - What did the COVID-19 crisis change? Paolo and Cecilia Bevegni - Beside the switch to online sales, it seems that the crisis has accelerated awareness of consumers toward sustainability and fuelled the demand for more responsible cosmetic products. As a of clean beauty and sustainable brand, this helped us to consolidate our position in many markets. Premium Beauty News - What are your plans for the next years? Paolo and Cecilia Bevegni - International growth is our priority. We believe that our message is truly international. Tea is the most popular drink on the world after water, so our concept is positively perceived everywhere. Despite a tough context this year, we did not stop any development projects and we launched very successful new lines, such as our Yoga Care line that turned out to be our best seller this year. Also for 2021 we have different new launches in the pipeline. We think that even in the current situation the market needs and deserves novelties and new concepts. Premium Beauty News - And regarding sustainability? Paolo and Cecilia Bevegni - Sustainability is one of our first priorities, we are convinced that today we simply cannot avoid to study carefully how our decisions are impacting our environment and our world. From the beginning we have been choosing only sustainable formulas and packaging and we been doing our best to help our customers to minimize the impact of our products. In addition, we are support some tea farmers communities in Sri Lanka that give us extraordinary teas."
Weckerle responds to crisis with safe & sustainable lipstick sample,"If the global makeup market was shaken by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, nothing better describes the German group's reactivity and flexibility than their impressive capacity to adjust during this period. When consumers turned their backs on lipsticks, the group started to produce their very first protective masks. ""The R&D Division of Weckerle Machines quickly developed fully automated processes to produce masks,"" explains Franz Gilg, COO of Weckerle Holding. First implemented in China, the concept is now operational in Germany. Today, Weckerle Machines provides machines, while Weckerle Cosmetics produces masks for their customers. The whole group very quickly got familiar with a field which does not have much to do with their historic business. Reactivity is probably the group's key strength: they managed to build up a unique network based on local presence, with plants on four continents (Europe, Asia, North America, and South America) and a 360-degree expertise: machine manufacturing, full-service offering, packaging design and manufacturing, but also product formulation and filling. ""One of our customers' main expectations is a fast time-to-market. And to reduce delivery lead times, one needs short supply chains. If it all comes from China, it's unmanageable."" This is what Thomas Weckerle, CEO of Weckerle Companies, told Premium Beauty News last year. And his words were visionary: neo-localism is getting increasingly popular. In 2018, the group inaugurated a site in Torrace, California, and in 2019, two new production sites were opened in Ranipur, India, and in Huamantla, Mexico. At the peak of the crisis, the group was able to rely on this ""global local production"" strategy. ""Today, the situation varies a lot from one region to another. In China, demand is growing again. In South America, after a sudden slowdown, direct-selling local players reacted very quickly and the market soon recovered. To better meet each market's specific needs, we decided to give our subsidiaries even more autonomy,"" explains Franz Gilg. With a production capacity of 25 million units per year, the new French plant, which was completely rebuilt after a fire destroyed the previous site in 2018, was designed to meet all brands' needs. The group's reactivity is also based on their capacity to innovate. In this field, vertical integration is a significant strength. Over the past two years, the Californian, Mexican, and German sites were equipped with Multi Stick 3 (MS3), the latest generation of casting, moulding, and filling machines, which are more efficient, faster, and more resource-efficient. As for products, after unveiling Myconic, a 100% single-material lipstick tube entirely made of recycled plastic, at the beginning of the year, Weckerle is now launching Click'N Break, a mini single-use lipstick tube (0.04 ml) designed for consumers to test products in optimum hygiene and sensorial conditions. The single-material pack can be made of recycled PET or biosourced PP, and a biodegradable solution is also under study. The tube is fitted with a both easy and safe cap for perfect hygiene. These launches are in line with the group's strategy to adopt circular economy principles: they aim to offer 100% recyclable or reusable packaging by 2025."
Matière Première enters booming Chinese perfume market,"Present in China for 16 years, Grégoire Grandchamp created Next Beauty with wife Lulu Yu, former Vice-President of L'Oréal China. They aim to invest and help ""gem"" brands make their own place in the local beauty industry. They look for brands with a unique, authentic history and a strategy focused on a positive impact on both the environment and society. But above all, they emphasize the crucial significance of the leading teams. Already an exclusive partner of several beautiful brands, Next Beauty is now helping Matière Première enter the Chinese market with a high-end fragrance range designed by Aurélien Guichard, Creative Director of Takasago. ""We must remain cautious, but if we look at the facts, in China, there are a few major perfume leaders, like Dior and Chanel, who represent about 50% of the market, and then a few other brands are overrepresented, like Atelier Cologne, Byredo, Dyptique, Jo Malone, and more recently, Francis Kurkdjian, Frédéric Malle, and Maison Martin Margiela. There is definitely something about niche perfumes. Chinese customers are genuinely interested,"" explains Grégoire Grandchamp. This group of customers mainly gathers Millennials and the Generation Z, who seek distinction and differentiation. ""They have no complex and are really partial to emerging brands. 20-year-old consumers are much more sophisticated than their elders on all beauty categories – and not just beauty – so it is only natural for them to take interest in perfumes. The market is taking off, in particular niche brands,"" adds Grégoire Grandchamp. Perfumes and the relationship with perfumes are actually changing on this market, one of the biggest in the world, which is still fond of light, mainly floral and fruity trails. ""Rose is the most popular ingredient, but I am sure there is something to be done to understand and identify smells evocative of the Chinese culture. Something more in line with their memories and history,"" explains the expert. The development of Matière Première is structured around the scheduled opening in 2021 of a flagship store in Shanghai and pop-up stores in other cities, but it is also based on a strategy resolutely oriented towards digitalism, e-, and social-commerce. ""It is all based on a broad collaboration with KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) and on product offerings adapted to e-commerce as soon as the next quarter, including very smart discovery sets featuring mini products for testing fragrances. We are also our brands' unique Tmall [1] partner,"" says Grégoire Grandchamp. Last but not least, to speed up their global development, Matière Première recently raised 1.3 million euros – here is a brand to keep an eye on."
Geka invests and banks on market recovery,"Integrated to Swiss group Sulzer in 2016, German company Geka developed know-how in beauty packaging solutions as soon as 1925. Driven by make-up market dynamics, they achieved a EUR 150 million turnover in 2019 and count 1,000 employees around the world, four production sites based in Bechhofen, Germany (headquarters), São Paulo, Brazil, Elgin, near Chicago, Illinois, and Shanghai, China, and two sales offices in France and Poland. ""We are present on four continents, because it is crucial to be in line with our customers' needs,"" explains Geka CEO Florent Lafont, who considers developing an additional solution for the African continent in the long run. In light of the growing demand of the American market, in particular of indie brands, the company completed its full-service offering, already operational in Germany, in the Elgin plant. Since 2019, the site has provided production, decoration, and filling services thanks to a new automated filling and capping machine with a capacity of 15 million units per year. The Shanghai plant, shared with Sulzer, was also enhanced by integrating Geka's unique expertise in injection moulding, decoration by printing, manufacturing, and product development in colour cosmetics. This way, the company got closer to their ever-increasing client base in Asia and to the Chinese market, which is booming again in the post-COVID era. Lastly, major investments were made to extend the main site in Bechhofen: 10,000 m2 will be added to the current 12,000 m2 to concentrate all activities and divisions, which used to be spread across several sites in Germany, including the former Oeka site in Bamberg, purchased in 2015. ""We aim to create stronger synergies, gain flexibility, and reduce delivery lead times,"" says Florent Lafont. The production tool will be operational as soon as January 2021: it is being enhanced with new technologies, decoration capacities, and improved automation. In addition, Geka endeavours to focus their strategy on all areas of improvement as regards carbon footprint and sustainability, both in terms of production processes and products. ""We are more than ever focused on digitalization, innovation, development, and environmental issues,"" highlights the CEO. Last September, the company won the Platinium prize awarded by Ecovadis, which certifies companies' sustainability, so they are now ranked among the 1% best companies assessed around the world. As for alternative packaging solutions, the Reborn collection unveiled last June offers eye and lip makeup products with sustainable packaging containing 93% recycled materials or biosourced alternatives. An expert in mascara brushes, and even a pioneer in moulded brushes, with 122 million units produced in 2019, Geka also boasts know-how in the development of applicators, containers, and finished products for all beauty segments. ""From nail varnish to hair accessories and lipsticks, we are definitely equipped to offer our added value to a large number of categories. It is our strategy for the future,"" concludes Florent Lafont."
"""Demand for transparency is huge in the cosmetics industry"", Ana Ledesma, NATRUE","Premium Beauty News - Demand for naturalness has been a basic trend for several years in the cosmetics industry. And it seems it has further strengthened with the Covid-19 pandemic. Ana Ledesma - Absolutely. There is a huge need for transparency in our industry, a demand for information about ingredients, their origins, manufacturing processes… Consumers want safe, environmentally friendly and fair products. The need for safety that emerged during the pandemic and the growing concern about our planet's condition have just strengthened expectations. No one can say sustainability is a trend now. It has become a real lifestyle, a particular way to shop - and it is booming. Consumers want multipurpose, sustainable products in line with their beliefs. Premium Beauty News - Labels are also used to inform consumers. But NATRUE remains little known in France and the UK, whereas it is widely recognized in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Ana Ledesma - Today, over 7,000 products are NATRUE-certified, mainly in Europe, which is the area that is most aware of labels, but also in North and South America, and in the Asia-Pacific area. We aim to further develop our label on the global level. More than 300 natural and organic cosmetics brands in the world already trust the NATRUE label as a product certification. The Cosmebio and COSMOS labels have been present in Western and Southern Europe for a long time. NATRUE is more widely known in Austria, Switzerland, and Germany, which is the country of origin of several founding members of the association. To develop the label's presence on the French market, we have attended the Natexpo show in France for several years. This year, we shared our stand with French organic cosmetics brand Beauty Garden. A label like NATRUE guarantees the same requirements and transparency for consumers all over the world. Premium Beauty News - NATRUE has announced the label has been simplified: there will now be two levels instead of three. Ana Ledesma - We tried to make our label easier to understand for consumers. Starting from January 1st, 2021, the standard will no longer include three, but two product levels: natural cosmetics and organic cosmetics. The products labelled as ""natural cosmetics with an organic portion"" will keep this designation on the market until their two-year certificate expires. But we paid attention not to reduce our level of requirements: on the contrary, we have introduced new criteria, in particular as regards environmental protection and raw material sourcing. Premium Beauty News - As a label, what do you think about the naturalness claims related to standard ISO 16128 or to the notion of clean beauty? Ana Ledesma - We had great hopes when we heard about an ISO standard on cosmetics naturalness. But clearly, the guarantees and assurances are quite low compared to what a label like NATRUE can offer. As regards clean beauty, our stance is most probably the same as other labels'. It cannot be denied that this notion involves positive changes and compels brands to give up on certain ingredients. It is a broad concept that is beyond the organic and natural notions. But, for us, it is a claim which lacks clarity and can be misleading. Today, brands can have much different interpretations of the notion of clean beauty. Without common criteria and independent certification, there is definitely a risk of greenwashing and of certain criteria not being more demanding than what basic compliance with current regulations demand. Labels' specifications are made public and involve known criteria which can be verified and - as for NATRUE - are controlled by independent bodies. In addition, natural and organic cosmetic labels are not just formulations that avoid certain substances undesired by consumers: they include many environmental criteria. Premium Beauty News - Do applications which mark products not contribute to offering more transparency? Ana Ledesma - Applications may be an interesting reference for consumers if the information provided is objective and comprehensive. But some of them are actually incomplete and their assessments lack objectivity and scientific rigour. Not all applications use the same criteria, so not all of them offer reliable information! Overall, most tend to play on the fear of certain ingredients. NATRUE's mission is to offer consumers as many guarantees as possible regarding natural and organic cosmetics. It is a way to increase trust in products, and we keep working on increasing the level of information and transparency for the mutual benefit of manufacturers and consumers, in particular through our public database of NATRUE-certified products and raw materials."
How Nippon Shikizai France adjusts its offer to the pandemic,"For manufacturers specializing in make-up products, the current situation is particularly challenging. Lockdowns, remote working and masks have transformed beauty routines! Broadly speaking, the no-make-up trend is rising with women giving-up on color cosmetics, a shift that has a strong impact on sales. In France, according to an Ifop study, 44% of women consumers never wear makeup when they are working from home. However, while skin tone products and lipsticks are suffering, eye makeup and skincare are doing better. ""This coronavirus crisis has raised new expectations among consumers. For us, it was therefore essential to adapt to the market and to think about products adapted to the current health situation,"" says Tsuyoshi Hasuo, President of Nippon Shikizai France and Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics. Nippon Shikizai France therefore focused on the consequences of wearing a protective mask. ""The constant humidity under the mask causes the skin to dry out and cause irritation. As for the breathing that rises to the top of the face, it has the effect of removing what is called the 'curling' effect of a mascara and the eyeliners lose their 'long-lasting' properties. As for the lipstick, of course, it leaves marks on the inside of the mask,"" adds Tsuyoshi Hasuo. The company therefore worked on several products. In particular on a new liquid foundation (Skin Veil Foundation) which creates a sort of second veil on the face during its application and allows to maintain a healthy complexion despite wearing the mask all day. It is a very comfortable texture that does not give that sticky or sticky feeling. ""We recommend to use it with a loose powder from our collection which allows a good fixation of this foundation,"" details the manager. As far as the lips are concerned, it is now important to meet new needs linked to facial covering, without forgetting underlying trends such as the need for more natural and more comfortable products. Nippon Shikizai thus created a new paraben-free, silicon-free, preservative-free, surfactant-free and nanomaterial-free lip balm, with a creamy moisturizing texture that glides on the lips without generating a sticky feeling. As for the lip cream (Cream to Matte Lipstick), it was designed to avoid transferring the red colour to the mask. Its texture may be creamy, but it offers a matte finish on the lips without colour transfer to the mask. And the colour stays on all day. It fixes well on the lips. This product is still free of parabens, mineral oils, nanomaterials and petroleum-derived raw materials. For the eyes, Nippon Shikizai has developed a Curling Waterproof mascara that keeps lashes curled all day, despite the moisture escaping from the mask towards the top of the face. ""It lengthens lashes separately without lumps or smudging."" The approach is the same for the new Waterproof Eyeliner, which is both extremely resistant and very easy to remove, thanks to its combination of polymers. ""This pandemic places enormous strain on our daily lives, that of our customers and consumers. It generates both gloom and stress. In the midst of all this, we must not forget that our sector is also an opportunity. We manufacture optimism and pleasure. It is therefore very important that we fulfill this mission as well as possible, especially during this period, by developing new formulas that meet the needs of our customers,"" concludes Tsuyoshi Hasuo."

As part of the Natura &Co group we are developing our climate action plan to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2030 and establish a science-based emission reduction target by June 2021. This is well underway with ongoing reduction initiatives in our largest sources of emissions: freight, corporate travel and energy. These initiatives include a continued transition to renewable energy, an improved inventory planning tool to optimize freight and reduction in corporate travel through virtual tools. In 2019, we reduced our emissions from flight activity by 7%. Premium Beauty News - What are Aesop's other initiatives to reduce your environmental footprint? Kate Forbes - Several initiatives have been established that focus on packaging, raw material procurement, waste and e-commerce. We are committed to establishing practices that design out waste and support the continued use of our packaging. This topic of conversation allowed Aesop to share our current circularity journey, including the introduction of our packaging re-use trial which has just launched in Adelaide late last month. Moreover, we have increased the amount of recycled content used in our packing with over 70% of Aesop PET plastic bottles made from a minimum of 97% recycled PET sourced from post-consumer recycled content. While our current recycled content in packaging performance surpasses trends and targets being set by the industry, we acknowledge that considerable work remains necessary to improve the circularity of our packaging range and we strive towards our goal for all packaging to be reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. Premium Beauty News - How does the brand combine luxury and sustainability? Kate Forbes - We do not consider there to be a disconnect between luxury and sustainability; each one of us should be of the mindset that it is our responsibility to care for the environment in which we live, making a conscious effort to influence positive social and environmental change. Throughout Aesop's thirty-three years, we have adhered to a fiercely independent approach to skin care; always aiming to deliver products of premium efficacy and sensory pleasure through solid science, uncomplicated packaging and an unwavering sense of humour. We have also maintained a commitment to service of the highest calibre for our customers. We are meticulous in selecting and sourcing ingredients, ensuring each is chosen with the health and safety of our customers and the natural environment foremost in mind. We are on a journey of ever lightening our tread on the planet that generously sustains us while formulating products of the highest quality and efficacy. Beyond the environment, our strategy includes initiatives that will help nurture an inclusive, engaged culture, where all employees are empowered to contribute to strategy, develop and thrive. Premium Beauty News - Concerning the Covid-19 crisis, did you notice any change in consumer habits? Kate Forbes - It is perhaps no surprise that while we have all been enjoying the comfort of our homes a lot more than usual, we have seen rises in our home and body care category. Quite specifically, in the UK, we have seen sales of the Brass Oil Burner experience a quintupled uplift on aesop.com, while the accompanying oil burner blends have soared with more than a 200% rise. On a global level, our home category is experiencing more than a two-fold YOY growth, which ties nicely with the expansion of this offering as we have just this month launched our first trio of Aromatique Candles, formulated in collaboration with French perfumer, Barnabé Fillion. We have already seen a positive response from our customers and anticipate as the current restrictions continue, in one form or another, this type of product will continue to be appealing to those looking to heighten their sensory surroundings at home. Beyond this category, and in line with the current climate, we have also seen a rise in our body care category, with sales almost tripling. While the everyday act of cleansing may once have furnished a relatively routine beginning or end to the day, our perspective on this has changed and we look to find joy and pleasure in the smallest of rituals. There seems to be an emphasis on the mood-enhancing benefits that a favourite aromatic blend can bring to the act of cleansing bringing a sense of luxury to our new normal."
"Perfect Diary, the Chinese unicorn with global ambitions","Few Chinese cosmetics brands can boast catching the Western press's attention as much as Perfect Diary (完美日记). The young brand actually achieved an outstanding performance in China: on November 11, 2018 Singles' Day, a little over a year after it was launched, Perfect Diary got ranked first among Chinese makeup brands. In 2019, the sales on that special day dedicated to singles reached RMB100 million in 13 minutes on Tmall, overtaking global brands like L'Oréal and Maybelline. Perfect Diary mainly targets Generation Z young women aged 18-28, who are more interested in national brands than previous generations. The brand quickly managed to stand out with an innovative online marketing strategy. According to China-based consulting agency Daxue Consulting, beyond promoting the brand on general social platforms Weibo and WeChat, Perfect Diary also takes advantage of the Xiaohongshu community, where 50% of users are less than 30, and of Bilibili: 80% of its users were born in the 1990s. In addition, they partnered with celebs and KOLs in line with the brand, as could be seen with Li Jiaqi, the ""Chinese king of lipstick"". In parallel, Perfect Diary created a KOC virtual character, Xiaowanzi (小完子), who shares characteristics with the brand's target consumers and plays different roles: beauty advisor, friend, promotional information supplier, and customer service in real time. This virtual KOC helps the brand build closer relationships with customers and convert public traffic into private, less expensive traffic. ""The Perfect Diary strategy is a textbook case to learn how to get rid of marketplaces,"" says Daxue Consulting. ""They take advantage of the KOL strategy and create brand recognition on social media platforms to boost the purchase desire. Then, they integrate these external resources to their private traffic pool on WeChat, which encourages customers to re-purchase their products and become loyal."" And yet, in an interview in the Forbes magazine, Vincent Chen, co-founder of Yatsen Global, Perfect Diary's parent company based in Guangzhou, insists upon defining the brand's basics: ""You don't build up a reputation thanks to marketing, but by maintaining consistency between word-of-mouth and product quality. The 'product power' drives the development and growth of Perfect Diary."" The brand's manufacturing partners are mentioned on the website: Italian company Intercos and Korean company Cosmax. According to Reuters, Perfect Diary will open their own manufacturing site in Guangdong by late 2021. Available for affordable prices, Perfect Diary makeup products are well-adapted to social media sharing. Riding the wave of young Chinese people's taste for cultural consumer goods, Perfect Diary signed collaborations with the London British Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC. These agreements led in particular to a limited edition of eight lipsticks showcased in packaging which evoked playing cards depicting royal portraits belonging to museum collections, including Louis XIV, Queen Victoria, and Napoleon. In the same playful, photogenic spirit, Perfect Diary contacted the Discovery and National Geographic China channels to create eyeshadow palettes inspired from the savannah fauna and Chinese landscapes. According to co-founder Vincent Chen, Perfect Diary's online/offline model was one of its main advantages when dealing with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. When physical stores had to close, shop assistants turned into live streaming hosts. ""Last February, the number of Perfect Diary live streaming sessions hosted on Alibaba's Taobao platform rose by 28% compared to January, and sales increased by about 170%,"" he explains in his interview to Forbes. Currently present in the largest Chinese cities, Perfect Diary aims to open 600 stores across China over the next three years to cover all city categories. ""This year, our programme to launch 200 stores will be focused on mid-sized cities,"" Vincent Chen announces. Yet, he acknowledges that ""e-commerce still accounts for most of our sales"". However, he believes that ""physical stores will become a key segment for Yatsen Global and will experience the fastest growth in the years to come."" In June 2020, the group announced they were about to launch a new, skincare-oriented brand called Abby's Choice. They also confirmed their global ambitions. According to the Chinese press, the new USD140-million fundraising is a prerequisite to soon become listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Will Perfect Diary make up for the lack of Chinese beauty, fashion, and lifestyle brands on the international level, when this is so beneficial to soft power and to seducing a country? This lack is all the more significant given the success of Japanese and Korean brands."
Lancôme acquires a rose-farm in Grasse to strengthen their DNA,"Lancôme has acquired an estate in Grasse, the historical cradle of contemporary French perfumery. Dubbed Domaine de la Rose by Lancôme, the estate is comprised of 9.9 acres organically farmed fields, centuries-old terraces as well as a distillery. ""This estate has been cultivated for around five centuries and the family, who previously owned the estate, is one of the pioneers of organic cultivation of perfume plants in Grasse. Thanks to this exceptional estate, Lancôme becomes an owner and producer of organic roses that will be used in our fragrances,"" said Françoise Lehmann, Lancôme Global Brand President. Lancôme is already well established in the region through the exploitation of a 12-acre field in Valensole, where are grown the proprietary and exclusive to Lancôme roses as well as the Centifolia rose that are used in its skin care products. The brand has also been exploiting a field in Grasse where the Centifolia rose, jasmine and lavender are cultivated for its fragrances. These three domains represent a total of 24.7 acres, and all benefit from the unique geographical location and climatic influences of the Grass area. Lancôme's ultimate ambition is to use all parts of the rose bush - from the flower, to the petal, up to the stem and even the root - to develop new active ingredients with a ""zero waste"" approach in all production processes. While the rose is Lancôme's emblem, other flowers are used in brand's signature products. Beyond the existing crops that Lancôme will continue to develop - including roses, olive trees, plum trees, fig trees - the brand will grow emblematic plants of the Grasse region such as iris, jasmine, lavender, bitter orange, tuberose, and osmanthus, ancient aromatic plants including immortelle, verbena and Madonna lily, as well as beehives, in a spirit of biodiversity preservation and development. The L'Oréal-owned brand also said this new acquisition would be an opportunity to contribute to the international promotion of the unique treasures of the Grasse region, which have been classified as an intangible cultural heritage by the UNESCO. ""Lancôme is also keen on sharing know-how around the Rose to internal and external audiences in a spirit of learning and transmission,"" added Françoise Lehmann. In recent years, the Grasse area has seen renewed investment from the various players of perfumery and cosmetics industry, including leading perfume houses like Firmenich and Givaudan, and luxury brands like Dior, or its parent company LVMH. These initiatives respond to consumers' expectations for authenticity, natural ingredients and shorter, more local and more traceable supply chains."
"""Blissim aims to seize beauty growth opportunities online""","Premium Beauty News - You separated from the Birchbox group a few months ago. What does this name change hide? Quentin Reygrobellet - We have had a rather unique business model for ten years, and it changed consumption in France as regards the digital and beauty worlds. With this name, it was important for us to step up and show the market and our consumers we were not just a box, but much more: a real ecosystem which helps all women find their own corresponding beauty in a very simple way. We want to show we are a leader in digital cosmetics. The idea was to choose a name with an international, easily understandable connotation, as ""Bliss"" is English and ""issime"" marks an absolute superlative in French. The letter B is a nod to Birchbox, it evokes femininity, and the double ""i"" in ""Blissim"" makes us smile when pronouncing it, just like women when they receive their products. Premium Beauty News - What are Blissim's objectives? Quentin Reygrobellet - The online beauty market grows at an annual rate of 15% to 20%, and the crisis has made it boom even more. Offline sales are increasingly being transferred online. Since the beginning, in 2011, we have endeavoured to build a bridge between the physical and digital networks. Thanks to our box, we recreate the discovery experience with products available in stores, but which women receive directly at home along with customization and advice. This initial strategy is even more meaningful now, and that is also why we are one of the players that have grown the most on the digital segment. We aim to go even farther. We achieve almost a 50-million-euro turnover with an annual growth rate of 25% compared to the previous year. In three to four years, the digital beauty market will weigh three or four billion euros, so there are many growth opportunities to seize. We believe there is still a lot to do. We aim to keep growing fast, while maintaining a two-digit profitability. It is crucial to show our model is really virtuous, whether it be for brands and subscribers, or for us. Premium Beauty News - Is it also an opportunity for brands? Quentin Reygrobellet - We are the only ones to offer such a broad range including 300 brands and selective, niche, parapharmacy products, and of course, natural products, which account for 40% of our turnover. There is no such complete offering in offline channels. We are trying to cover all women's needs with an affordable, but also premium offering. As a matter of fact, the Splendist box is really doing well: we will soon launch the fourth edition – the winter one. All these innovations have made us a beauty reflex for women. Brands have understood that, so we are getting increasingly popular. Today, the selection of products to be featured in the box is made 10 months ahead: we have countless requests. It used to be one of many channels for brands to grow, and it has become fundamental. Premium Beauty News - Are you considering a global expansion? Quentin Reygrobellet - Definitely. We aim to seize these growth opportunities in France, but also in Europe. Next January, we will launch Blissim in Germany, then in Italy and other European countries, with websites adapted to each country, in their own language, and with the possibility to live the same experiences. Premium Beauty News - How will you promote this new identity? Quentin Reygrobellet - We are lucky enough to be in direct contact with our consumers: through the box, the website, and our CRM. It will be gradual, over the next ten months, but next box in October will obviously bear the name Blissim. We have planned a social media campaign and we have been investing in traditional media with a TV campaign from mid-October to mid-November, as well as in advertizing displays."
"Kenzo Takada, first Japanese designer to conquer Paris fashion, dies aged 81","His death comes 50 years after he launched his first collection in the French capital which he adopted as his home. ""Every wall, every sky and every passer-by helps me build my collections,"" he once said of the city. He retired from fashion in 1999, six years after selling his eponymous fashion brand to luxury conglomerate LVMH, and dedicated his time to one-off projects, including a design collection at the start of this year. Born in 1939 into a family of hoteliers, he chose to study art not catering, becoming a star pupil at Toyko's Bunka Gakuen Fashion College, where he carried off the top prize. He went on to work for Sanai, a major chain of fashion shops, but dreamed of Paris. The 1964 Olympic Games finally gave him his opportunity to come to Europe. The block of flats in which he was renting an apartment was to be demolished to make way for a stadium. Like all the tenants, he was paid compensation and decided to blow the money on a one-way ticket on a cargo boat to Marseille. Arriving in Paris in the winter of 1965, hardly speaking any French, the only job he could get was in a poodle parlour. In 1970, however, he took the lease of premises in the Galerie Vivienne, then a rather down-at-heel shopping arcade. ""With a few friends for three months we painted the walls with jungle scenes like Le Douanier Rousseau's Snake Charmer and baptised it Jungle Jap,"" he recalled later. His first show using amateur models to save money was held there. One of the only 20 people invited included the editor-in-chief of Elle magazine who liked the collection so much she ran it on the front cover. He became a name almost overnight. For financial reasons his first collection was made in cotton, often quilted, a look which young fashion leaders took to instantly. But his real impact was with his revolutionary and totally contemporary knitwear, which revitalised the industry. In 1976 he established his studio and boutique in the Place des Victoires. By the time the likes of Rei Kawakuba of Commes des Garcons and Yohji Yamamoto arrived from Japan in the early 1980s, Takada was already well-established on the French fashion scene. His first men's collection was presented in 1983 and his first perfume, Kenzo Kenzo, in 1988. From the early 1980s boutiques opened all over the world in New York, London, Milan, Toyko and Rome, followed later by Hong Kong, Munich, Venice, Bangkok and Singapore. Kenzo's romantic style, with its eclectic mix of colour, touches of exoticism, ethnic prints and folksy embroidery, suited the mood of the 1970s but adapted well to the sharper-looking 1980s and 1990s. At the end of the 1980s, Kenzo launched several lines of perfumes, including Kenzo Kenzo in 1988, followed Parfum d'été, Jungle and Flower, the latter of which became a classic and remains a best-seller accross the world.. For inspiration, he drew on his travels as well as Japanese work clothes, such as his favourite military tunics and coats. Peruvian striped blanket throws, colourful shawls, oriental blouses, peasant smocks, printed velvet, were all part of his signature. It was a measure of his success that he was notoriously prey to copyists. British designer Jasper Conran, interviewed on the problem, said he knew of a company in South Africa specialising in ripping off Kenzo, seam for seam. ""They make a fortune - more than Kenzo I reckon - but there's nothing he can do about it."" He was made chevalier de l'ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1986 by France in recognition of his career. He tried his hand at film-making with Rêve après Rêve in 1980 and designed costumes for a Stockhausen opera. Apart from travel, his other obsession was gambling. He guarded his privacy by building himself a house in the very heart of Paris, only a few yards from the Bastille opera house, complete with authentic tea pavilion and a pool of carp."
Swedish naturalness in the spotlight with L:A Bruket,"Founded by Monica Kylen and Mats Johansson in Varberg, a spa resort on the West coast of Sweden, near Göteborg, L:A Bruket was born from a Swedish spa heritage perfectly in line with wild nature and its ingredients. Over a hundred face, body, hair, and home references have already made the brand successful in Sweden and beyond, in Scandinavia, a market keen on innovative and clean concepts. ""Our philosophy is based on nature-inspired innovation, featuring ingredients mainly derived from Sweden, and a 100% Swedish production,"" explains Stanislas Le Bert. To highlight the stability of this ten-year-old approach, the brand's products are about to get a Cosmos certificate. ""It is not a direction we are taking out of the blue. We had the basics, and as a matter of fact, most of our formulas created more than ten years ago do not need to be reviewed. The idea is rather to keep up with a market practice with an interesting tool that guides and informs consumers,"" adds the Director. Already distributed in over 500 points of sale across the world, including Liberty in London, Takashimaya and Isetan in Japan, Galleria in Seoul, The Conran Shop, Galeries Lafayette, Champs-Elysées, BHV Marais in France, and Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's platform in the US, L:A Bruket aims to develop their partner network, in particular in Europe and Asia. ""We are selecting rather than prospecting, just to make sure our brand is where it should be, with the service quality, support, and feedback matching our concept,"" explains Stanislas Le Bert. In parallel, the brand is developing its network of wholly-owned stores with two recent openings in Paris, Rue Vielle du Temple and Rue Saint Sulpice, as well as in Berlin. ""Now, we have two stores in Sweden, two in Paris, one in Berlin, and one in Tokyo. For us, it is an opportunity to meet customers and understand the brand's current situation. With these stores, we are going to create positive emotions and make the ephemeral long-lasting in order to, we hope, make these shopping moments stand out. It is the orientation we gave our retail assets and the architectural concept we developed,"" adds the Director, who is also reviewing opportunities in London and Korea. It is also an opportunity for the brand to test a new strategy aimed to put forward authentic naturalness before exporting it to Asia and the US. ""Our ten years of existence provide us with a heritage with multiple possibilities and many angles from which to work. Today, we would like to further highlight our brand's clean facet, and the Cosmos certification is part of this strategy. Other innovations in the same vein will follow. In our catalogue, we already have 'refill' references, like candles, body and face care products, and we will keep developing this ecoresponsible approach. These are excellent opportunities to innovate and make Mats and Monica's ten-year philosophy clearer."" The other development areas of this strategy are focused on innovation and e-commerce. ""Meaningful product consumption will keep developing. That is the way we see what is next, and we are confident consumer behaviour will gradually change in this direction,"" concludes the General Manager."
Le Rouge Français launches new lipsticks with refillable bio-based cases,"Born from the will to preserve the sensorial properties of conventional lipsticks without giving up on the naturalness consumers want, Le Rouge Français was first known for their vegan formulas, made from 100% natural ingredients, including 95% certified organic ingredients, botanical pigments, and using rice wax rather than beeswax to fix pigments. Today a collection of 15 lipstick shades, entirely made from botanical pigments, is available. ""We strive to use local raw materials and suppliers. But in some cases we have to source exotic dye plants, so we take care to choose sustainable and labelled crops,"" Élodie Carpentier tells Premium Beauty News. The brand is now taking a new step forward by offering a luxurious transparent and refillable case for its lipsticks. Entirely made in an exclusive design from bio-sourced castor oil, the case is fully recyclable. However, it is nevertheless intended for a series multiple reuses, thanks to the brand's 15 botanical shades available in aluminium eco-refills that are easy to install and replace. ""A very simple mechanism makes it possible to remove the refill from the case and to insert another one with the desired colour before applying it. A single case can therefore be used to accommodate all Le Rouge Français lipstick shades,"" explains the brand. The refillable tube will retail for EUR 45 and the refill alone for EUR 26. The primary pack (the case, the refill and the lipstick mechanism) was made by PVL Beauté and the secondary pack (printed folded paperboard) was made by MR Cartonnage Numérique. With the objective of becoming ""the leader in botanical pigment in makeup"", Le Rouge Français is already preparing several new launches (lip care balm, blush, mascara, eyeliner) and wants to accelerate its international development. For this purpose, the company has just raised one million euros, in addition to the take-over of a minority stake by the L'Occitane Group last year, and now has a dedicated sales area at 5 rue Rouget de Lille, in Paris."
Capsum confirms growth ambitions with new Texas plant,"Interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, the production line assembly in Capsum's new North-American plant in Austin, Texas, was partly done remotely! ""Our technicians and experts were locked down in France, and the machines were already on-site,"" explains Sébastien Bardon, CEO of the company specialized in the design and production of innovative skincare and makeup formulas. But virtual reality tools helped deal with hitches and launch the site's production in early September. Founded in 2008, the company has since earned a reputation as a technological gem in the French cosmetics industry, thanks to the microfluidic technology which revolutionized skincare and, more recently, makeup formulation. ""Our technology makes it possible to create very aesthetic, but also exceptionally sensorial products for our customers,"" emphasizes Sébastien Bardon. In short, microfluidics helps create a new type of emulsions based on droplets formed one by one, by monitoring their sizes and handling fluids to get the structure desired. Since it was created, Capsum has claimed an average annual growth rate over 50%. ""Usually, such growth rates are achieved by high-tech companies, not cosmetics."" Today, the company's turnover exceeds 50 million euros and is mainly achieved in Europe – a quarter is made in the US. This pace has even hardly been disrupted by the pandemic crisis: Sébastien Bardon foresees a 30% to 40% turnover increase for 2020. The opening of the first North-American production site should help keep up with this pace. The 11,000 m2 site counts 40 employees right now, but it should welcome almost 250 when it is all operational, for an estimated annual production capacity of 250 million units (compared to about 50 million units per year for the French site of Château-Gombert, near Marseille). Starting from scratch, with all the space needed, Capsum was able to create their dream plant in Austin, Texas. ""Right from the beginning, we aimed to minimize our environmental footprint by balancing the site's energy consumption with solar-generated electricity,"" explains Sébastien Bardon. Fitted with one of the largest surfaces of solar panels on an industrial site in Texas, the building got a LEED Silver certificate and claims a neutral carbon balance. To limit its water consumption impact, the plant does not use water from drinking or farming water networks: they draw it from salted groundwater (10 g/L, i.e. 1/3 less than sea water) located in-depth under the site. A small desalination installation powered by solar energy makes the water suitable for cosmetics. ""American brands already account for a quarter of our business, thanks to our sales offices in NYC and Los Angeles. Time-to-market is a crucial criterion for these customers, so it is a real advantage to have a local production site,"" adds the CEO. While the French site is operating at full capacity, the US opening will help Capsum get some leeway in terms of industrial capacities, before opening ""a plant just as ambitious as Austin"" near Marseille. This seems very likely, given the current growth rate achieved, and it will further optimize production processes and naturalize microfluidic technologies to best keep up with market trends."
"Melvita targets ""green moms"" to strengthen growth","Created 35 years ago by Bernard Chevilliat to make cosmetic products based on honey from the French Ardèche region, the brand, now part of the L'Occitane group, is the most well-known on the organic cosmetics segment in France and around the world. Its growth reached 21% in 2019. As the organic and natural market is booming, driven by the post-Covid context and consumers' demand for clean, transparent products, Melvita aims to convert a larger part of increasingly watchful consumers to organic cosmetics. ""We aim to make organic products accessible to all and support consumers who buy natural products in choosing organic ones, especially young mothers. The first child often encourages people to turn to organic cosmetics,"" says Claire Viano, Melvita's CEO France and Benelux. 92% of Melvita's consumers are over 30 and 57% have children. To this aim, Melvita relies on their own basics – Made in France products, expertise in organic formulation, high quality and sensoriality – and strengthens their commitments. Indeed, the brand intends to soon reach excellence in terms of ""clean beauty"" with irreproachable formulas as regards the skin and the environment. Plus, they have defined different objectives for 2025: 100% excellent notes on Yuka, deciphered INCI lists, and 100% biodegradable rinse-off products. As regards biodiversity, Melvita is speeding up the development of projects focused on biodiversity and bee protection: they have already set up 1,150 hives in France – the objective is to reach 2,000 over the next five years. Lastly, as far as packaging ecodesign is concerned, the brand aims to increase the part of recycled plastic in bottles to reach 100% in 2025, while studying refillable solutions for some of their products. The brand chose to address their main target, ""green and committed"" moms, through a TV campaign broadcast last June in France, which targeted women aged 35 and over belonging to better-off families. ""This campaign made our brand's fame increase by 7 points,"" claims Claire Viano. Another communication wave, this time on the web, will be launched in September and October on social media: YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. To this aim, Melvita has launched a major partnership with two star influencers who are both young mothers: @poi.family and @babychoufamily. This action will be combined with a communication plan in points of sale: the training dimension will also be strengthened by the ""organic academy"", a dedicated 12-person team in France. ""We want to create the Melvita reflex"", explains International Training Manager Didier Thevenin. Ultimately, a new version of the online store better adapted to mobile phones will be launched. As a reminder, Melvita is present in 15 countries and very well-established in Asia, in particular in Japan, which counts 32 out of the 82 wholly-owned stores around the world. Apart from this store network, Melvita is available through organic distribution channels, pharmacies and parapharmacies, the selective network (Marionnaud…), and others, which makes 3,700 points of sale in France. With already 180 organic-certified product references covering all cosmetics needs, Melvita proves dynamic and innovative. And they will launch new products and ranges over the next six months. The brand is relaunching the line of four toothpaste references with new ecodesigned tubes made of recyclable plastic and has removed the cardboard case to save 3.8 tonnes of cardboard per year. The relaxing Roll-On with lavender essential oil will broaden the Relaxessence range. In November, three new Lip Oils with RedLove apple oil will be launched. Next March, it will be the turn of the firming body balm-oil in the L'Or Rose range. And in April, the new Argan Bio Active face range designed for a real organic lifting effect will be released with two lifting creams, Crème en Huile and Fluide, and two targeted skincare products: a Serum and an Eye Contour."
"""The niche segment message is confused now,"" Luc Gabriel, TDC","Premium Beauty News - The Different Company was born with the concept of niche perfumery. What was it meant for back then? Luc Gabriel - When the brand was created, there was no ""niche"" market, so to speak. There were only perfumer-composer-creators, designers, and a desire to go back to a genuine form of olfactory luxury, since this dimension had almost disappeared the previous decade. In the 2000s, perfumery as a whole had become very popular, and the luxury category was mostly supposed to help make a lot of money on booming markets. Everyone was happy from an economic standpoint, but as regards the olfactory dimension, since the 1970s/80s, things had been more complicated. As our name suggests, The Different Company emerged with the idea of launching an alternative perfumery with a return to basics. First, it was about rediscovering truly exceptional materials worked very differently, or introducing hardly known olfactory elements. Also, it was aimed to offer the possibility to create a perfume without any constraints related to a type of customers or to what was thought to be a market demand. And all this should be showcased in beautiful, specially designed bottles which were already refillable, much before it became a trend. That was the starting point for the brand, and all this remains true now. Premium Beauty News - Back to basics. Does this still characterize niche perfumery? Luc Gabriel - The message has become very confused. Many players associate their own image to niche values, but they do not respect them. To me, the offering changed after the 2008 crisis. New brands emerged, some of which had creative ambitions, while others were more marketing-oriented. The market had grown big enough for brands to position themselves on a given segment. For example, By Kilian was definitely a luxury brand with very high prices. As for L'Atelier Cologne, they entered a category that had clearly been abandoned, and they managed to develop and add value to it. These are two completely different positionings, but both brands were purchased by major groups. As a matter of fact, with the help of very strong investments, they are now available all around the world, in Asia, in Duty Free stores. In both cases, the model defined at the beginning has changed, and it is no longer the same trade, but the terms used do remain the same: ""niche perfume"" describes completely different products now. It is a message that is difficult to understand for consumers. Premium Beauty News - So, is a niche emerging in the niche segment? Luc Gabriel - There will most probably be a segmentation in the offering of perfume brands, together with a segmentation in the distribution offering. Some niche points of sale offer up to 60 brands, sometimes more. To me, it is antinomical with the very notion of niche. It is just not possible to appropriately advise customers with so much choice. So, the upstream selection done by points of sale will strongly develop. And so will the number of points of sale, with marked specificities meeting the demand of consumers in search for more sophisticated creations. Things will just go back to what niche perfumes were when they emerged in the early 2000s. Premium Beauty News - How has The Different Company evolved over the past 20 years? Luc Gabriel - We have known different phases. A growth phase until 2008, and then there was the crisis: everyone got their fingers burnt. Then, there was a slowdown during which customers were keener on new launches. But, since 2016, we have noticed renewed interest in our fragrances. The market is getting saturated, but our strategy remains coherent. Our bottles have always been refillable, and it is now a strong trend. Everything can be recycled, except for the pump. Customers like that, although we never really communicated about it. We are perceived as an authentic niche brand strongly developing in the whole Asia-Middle East region. Premium Beauty News - What are your projects? Luc Gabriel - We have projects focusing on olfactory products which go beyond the mere bottle and spray combination. We are also working on bases other than alcoholic ones. I am considering all forms possible to use a perfume differently. Premium Beauty News - How do you think the market will evolve? Luc Gabriel - The post-COVID era will make things complicated for many players. This situation will most probably drain the market in terms of purchases, distribution, and brands. It is not necessarily a bad thing."
"With Bath Blend, The Body Shop is banking on the success of upcycling","In a global context of overexploitation of natural resources and while, according to the FAO [1], more than 800 million people suffer from hunger in the world, a third of the food produced globally is wasted. Some of the food is thrown away by consumers themselves [2], but the food industry also discards a significant part of its production, considered as non-compliant with marketing standards. These ""second choice"" fruits and vegetables are the ones that The Body Shop reuses for the formulation of its new range of foaming products for the bath: Bath Blend. ""We have long used 'second choice' fruits in some of our products,"" explains Débora Gentil, Brand Communications and Training Manager of The Body Shop in Brazil [3], where the new line was launched in July. ""Organic, fair trade banana mash that we have been using for years in our banana shampoo and, now in the form of a bath foam, is made from 'second choice' bananas or bananas produced by small Ecuadorian farmers, which would not normally be sold for export,"" she adds. The same goes for other damaged fruits and vegetables. ""We are constantly looking to build on this brand legacy, in line with our clients' growing interest in corporate social responsibility."" With combinations of ingredients like banana and avocado oil or coconut and passion fruit, carrots and mango seed oil, these new bath foams are inspired by smoothies, beverages made with mixed fresh fruits and vegetables. ""We wanted something that went beyond a normal bath foam, that would hydrate and nourish dry skins with natural antioxidants, vitamins and nutrients. At The Body Shop, we are always guided by the benefits provided by natural ingredients, so, for us, a mixture of fruits and vegetables for the bath makes sense,"" emphasizes Débora Gentil. The ingredients are delivered to our labs in the form of oils and extracts, ready to be used safely. Some of them are by-products of the food industry, which have therefore been upcycled. ""The strawberry seed oil used in our bath foam, Berry Bath Blend, is made from the leftover of jellies,"" she explains. ""Cosmetic ingredients of this type help to diversify the outlets of fruit and vegetable suppliers, while ensuring good economic use of the different parts of the food."" According to Débora Gentil, cosmetics based on upcycled food are appreciated by consumers because they are made with ingredients considered noble. ""Since the creation of the brand in 1976, we have been searching the world for the best ethical ingredients, to create beauty products inspired by nature. We hope to continue to find increasingly creative ways to reduce food waste."" Bath foams are packaged in recyclable plastic packaging made from 50% post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic. ""Sustainability is in the DNA of The Body Shop and we hope that with every launch, we can commit ourselves to make the world a better place,"" she concludes."
"""Clean Beauty has revived nail varnish"", Alexandre Miasnik, Fiabila","Premium Beauty News - How did the lockdown period go for Fiabila? Were you able to keep serving your customers around the world? Alexandre Miasnik - The pandemic spread progressively, so all our sites managed to adapt quickly, both internally, to preserve our teams, and from an industrial standpoint, since we aimed to keep producing. Eventually, we were almost able to keep our normal level of activity on all sites, except in India, where all non-essential industries were closed by the government. Premium Beauty News - How are all your different sites doing now? Alexandre Miasnik - Except in India, all sites are working normally. In France, our packaging sites will be very busy over the next few months, as they have been since May. Overall, the other markets are in a much satisfactory situation. Premium Beauty News - How do you think the global nail polish demand will evolve? Alexandre Miasnik - Of course, the Covid-19 pandemic made the global market slow down, since economic activities were partially suspended. But it did not last long. In many countries, beauty salons were closed at least for a short while, but women still took care of themselves at home, so the market remains extremely dynamic. There are adjustments being made in a few regions, but they are mainly related to distribution channels and use habits (salons, mass distribution, selective network, etc.). On many markets, women have also grown aware of the hazards of gel and semi-permanent nail polish, so they are turning their backs on them to buy conventional products which can be very easily applied and removed at home. We believe this positive situation will last, and that safe, compliant formulas will be developed on all markets. Premium Beauty News - In the long term, do you think the nail polish market will enter a significant growth cycle again? Alexandre Miasnik - Definitely. Besides, Euromonitor confirms this, as they forecast a 16% growth in value by 2024. The nail polish market is historically cyclical, and it had picked up again at the beginning of the year. It is a cyclical product, because it competes with other makeup categories and, at least on some markets, it depends on passing fads. But, for a while now, some women have moved away from nail polish, because they have grown wary of it – the chemical industry is viewed negatively. Clean and green beauty, which Fiabila has always promoted, helped reconcile these very demanding consumers with this product. Meanwhile, R&D has been making progress, as products are ever-more efficient, while being perfectly clean and, if needed, featuring ingredients of natural origin. Nail care products are also changing: they are getting more playful and efficient. They have a very high growth potential here. Premium Beauty News - It seems the crisis has also made consumer expectations shift, or strengthened already strong trends, in particular as regards naturalness and CSR. Do you agree? Alexandre Miasnik - Absolutely. Today, nail polish should reach extremely high purity levels, and consumers increasingly expect it to be of natural origin. Also, shoppers pay attention to how nail polish is produced. Over the past few years, Fiabila has invested more than 70 million euros to modernize infrastructures. We are now the only nail polish manufacturer on the main global markets with cutting-edge production sites. Our French plant has even just been rewarded with the Ecovadis Platinum status, which makes us one of the top 1% best-performing sites in terms of environmental protection, out of all the sites audited by this reference body! For example, our plant in Maintenon has acquired a VOC burner to further reduce our carbon footprint, and we have almost finished significant works to automate our colouring solution production lines, as we have already done with bases. In addition, different, shorter channels are getting more popular. The Made in China era, with products containing low-quality or hazardous raw materials shipped all around the world, is no longer a valid model for cosmetics, especially since the cost structure is no longer advantageous. Premium Beauty News - The crisis is likely to have repercussions on the different market players, i.e. both brands and suppliers. Alexandre Miasnik - As far as brands are concerned, the market distribution will undergo many changes – actually, it already did before the crisis. The evolution of consumption patterns is a challenge for all major players facing the competition of very dynamic independent brands. As for nail polish manufacturers, more than ever, Fiabila confirms its leadership on the global and local levels. This is due to our strong investment and innovation policy, but also to our unique philosophy. And we will keep things this way despite the sanitary crisis. On the contrary, other players did not follow the same path, and obviously, a number of them who seemed pretty solid are now in tricky situations and might disappear in the short or medium term."
Is the cosmetics industry sexist?,"Just like in the fashion world, the beauty sector is embodied by women's faces [1]. Estée Lauder, Helena Rubinstein, Aliza Jabbès, Anick Goutal, Bobbi Brown, Huda Kattann, Rihanna, and many others... Women make decisions and drive trends for many brands. And yet, just like in the fashion world, the industrial part of the chain does not offer this equality. ""The beauty world is singular. There are many women, but when you have a look at the top of the pyramid, things are definitely not the same. Women are the bees,"" explains Aïmara Coupet, Expert Marketing and Product Development Consultant and founder of the Be+Radiance brand. ""At my level, I do not feel it is a handicap. But when I put forward my male shareholders, I do feel it has a reassuring impact. When it comes to managing, a woman does not reassure as much as a man,"" she says. Other leaders qualify these observations. ""There is actually no equality. In terms of number of Directors, wage gap, mental load... we are not equal,"" observes Cosmogen CEO Priscille Caucé. ""However, it is an extremely open world, even in industrial companies. It is true that Directors are mostly men, but women and diversity are promoted. It is not a narrow-minded or misogynous world, it is just still very masculine,"" she explains. Co-President of Livcer Aude de Livonnière shares the same opinion: ""I do not feel I had more difficulties than a man during my career. I am not sure there is a glass ceiling."" The same goes for Isabelle Guyomarch, company Director, President of the CCI Productions Group, and founder of the Ozalys/Cancer Survivor laboratory: ""I do not think we can say it is more difficult for a woman. I mean, if you can do what they do, you can do it,"" she says, broadening the issue to the position of Director. ""Being a company Director usually means working twelve hours a day, plus weekends, sacrificing your private and family life, being able to get away, etc. That is how you build up your career. And what is difficult for a woman is to make all these sacrifices: it is both unnatural and tricky from a societal standpoint, and it is not true for men. Careers and responsibilities are demanding, in terms of time, abnegation, and concerns. You need to be able to handle it all,"" adds Isabelle Guyomarch. In an industrial system historically created and directed by men, women still have to make sacrifices they are not necessarily ready to make. And yet, as generations get more flexible with equity, the entrepreneurial model is gradually changing. Still, there is this notion of genre preferences. ""I think the industrial world is not appealing at once for women. They tend to prefer creative trades. Things do change, but the pool of women is much less significant than that of men, because women do not go there because they like it,"" believes Aude de Livonnière. ""What women want to head an industrial company? That is an interesting question,"" confirms Priscille Caucé. In addition, here, like anywhere else, women are allegedly the first victims of their own lack of self-confidence. ""To advance the cause, generally speaking, there is action to take on both sides. Men should promote change, and women should dare,"" says Priscille Caucé. ""Usually, men sell themselves better than women. They dare, they think they are legitimate right from the beginning. On the contrary, women tend to have doubts, to feel they need to prove themselves before they can dare ask for something. It can be a real brake on a career,"" says the Director of Livcer. In unison, they confirm that to evolve, the cosmetics industry has everything to gain from a more feminine managerial environment. ""Women have this ability to deal with their femininity and maternity, which makes them adopt a different managerial method as a leader – they are often more caring. Barack Obama said that if every State were managed for ten years by a woman, societies would truly change,"" says Isabelle Guyomarch, founder – among others – of Ozalys, a dermocosmetics brand dedicated to women with breast cancer. And yet, imposed quotas should not prevail over skill recognition. ""It is a risk when it comes to equity. Things can be turned the other way around: sometimes we do not pay enough attention to merit. For example, when Sue Y. Nabi was appointed as the Head of Coty, it was not to make a buzz, as was often said, but because her great skills were acknowledged,"" claims Aïmara Coupet. ""Parity in board of directors triggered a wave in major companies. It is necessary to have constraints, because things change very slowly. But I do not want a woman's professional success to be related to an enacted law, it should be due to her abilities and skills,"" explains Priscille Caucé. Obviously, the French beauty industry has not really reached diversity yet. ""Some people want to, but it is not done yet,"" according to Aïmara Coupet. ""People wish progress was made, but we are not there yet,"" observes Isabelle Guyomarch. ""There are reasons to be optimistic, but there is still a long way to go,"" says Priscille Caucé. ""It is all pretty stereotyped, still,"" according to Aude de Livonnière. Without pointing at other responsible factors than the industry's codes and anchored mentalities on both sides, the leaders we interviewed do wish the situation would change more quickly. But what do men think?"
"""I want to build up the Netflix of Beauty"", Jean-Michel Karam, IEVA","Premium Beauty News - The IEVA group you created has just purchased the L'Atelier du Sourcil network. What are your ambitions? Jean Michel Karam - I am an entrepreneur. After MEMSCAP, which I listed on the Stock Exchange in 2001, I founded IOMA, and then sold it to Unilever in 2012, though I still headed the brand. In 2016, I created the beauty-oriented IEVA startup. To me, there were quite a lot of interesting things to observe. First, the growth of e-commerce raises a lot of questions about the future of offline selling. In fact, I think these two distribution modes will last, but offline distribution will undergo transformations that will depend on the progress of online selling. Secondly, consumers are now quite knowledgeable. They understand that if you do not have real wellness features, beauty features will not be real either. The beauty and wellness transformation has actually taken place. Lastly, the impact of environmental stress on the ageing of physiological parameters, both skin and hair, is far more significant than that of our genetic capital. The creation of IEVA in 2016 was based on all these observations, and we are now working on the comprehensive solution. Premium Beauty News - What are the main steps to build up the IEVA solution? Jean Michel Karam - In 2016, I raised about 3 million euros as part of a first pool to launch the development of part of the solution. It consisted of an application related to a connected jewel which measured the user's environmental stress to make adapted beauty and nutrition recommendations. This first step took place in June 2019, with a massive deployment in the Marionnaud, Beauty Success, Fnac, Darty networks, and others. Meanwhile, we launched the Elenature hair care range – the first both natural/organic and technical range. It was a powerful launch, so we are now getting new developments ready for this range in 2021. It means that, over six months, we got spectacular results with these launches. Also, I got closer to the IEVA solution as I pictured it in the first place. And here we are, in September 2020: the complete solution is being marketed. Premium Beauty News - What does this new 2020 step consist in? Jean Michel Karam - We took three actions at the same time: a second pool which raised a capital of 17 million euros, we purchased L'Atelier du Sourcil, and we launched the new IEVA application featuring a subscription offering, Mon Moi Beauté. It is free and it works on its own or with the connected jewel to provide a highly accurate skin diagnosis using AI and proprietary dermatological patches. Based on the results, a hair and skincare ritual is suggested in the form of subscriptions and the user gets estimates and advice. They can choose between three subscription formulas, and three days later, they receive two skincare products and one hair care product by one of our brands. We are starting with brands in our ecosystem, IOMA and its sister range M/C for skincare, Elenature for hair care, and L'Atelier du Sourcil for makeup, but we aim to collaborate with other brands. The three subscriptions, L'Expert, L'Essentiel, and L'Unique, are available for €37.90 to €89.90 per month: every month, you receive three products, plus the connected jewel, and personalized skin or hair care products with the most expensive subscription. All subscriptions are non-binding offers, so you can stop any time. You can save up to 70%, it is non-binding, and you get a personalized solution taking into account your physiological characteristics and way of life. The application regularly sends recommendations, in particular top chef recipes with ingredients adapted to your lifestyle, push articles, etc. Premium Beauty News - As part of this strategy, what will be the role of L'Atelier du Sourcil, which is a physical network? Jean Michel Karam - I am mainly focused on a Netflix of Beauty, so choosing offline selling can be surprising, but it should be known that L'Atelier is the leader of eye makeup in France. The 109 stores are not points of sale, but points of experiences. To me, although online selling can cannibalize a big part of offline selling, it will not be able to change experiences and services to the same extent. So, I purchased the undisputed leader of eye makeup, with their very loyal customer base, and in these points of sale I will be able to create points of experiences for IEVA solutions. I do not mean to transform the network into IEVA stores, I just aim to have a point of experience in which the vital community can find a physical post. As soon as early September, the L'Atelier stores will offer the subscription, which will feature surprises, including makeup products or invitations to Atelier sessions. The L'Atelier range counts 40 references, and the development plan is quite ambitious for next year. We will develop synergies between the two subsidiaries, and the technology provided for L'Atelier will also be massive. There are many innovative solutions to enhance services and solutions as regards personalization according to the face's morphology. Premium Beauty News - What are your development projects? Jean Michel Karam - Our action will consist in making L'Atelier strongly develop. Today, it represents 109 stores, including 49 wholly-owned stores and 64 franchises, and there are countless requests. In France, we will follow a pace of about ten openings a year, half being franchises. But we will focus even more on developing L'Atelier abroad, so the brand is present globally, in Europe and the US. It is also what I aim to do with the IEVA solution: next step will be the US and China."
"""Any expectations we had for 2020 had to be reassessed,"" says Boticário's VP","Premium Beauty News - Many of Grupo Boticário's stores have reopened. What was it like going through months of stores being closed? André Farber - It is still a challenge. In the last few months, we became closer with our partners to help them ease the impact of this crisis. We made our relationship with sales representatives more flexible, eliminated the percentage they paid for marketing contribution and suspended fees. It did not take long until we found new possibilities for catering to our customers, such as with omnichat. The WhatsApp customer service system combines the practicality of a digital platform with a home delivery service, with deliveries made by the store nearest to where the order was placed. Premium Beauty News - The group already has a well-established e-commerce platform [1]. Was the online service important during the pandemic? André Farber - The e-commerce platform is increasingly more relevant for business, but during a time in which shopping was done almost exclusively online, we had to increase our presence on digital channels. We registered an increase in online sales, and 34% of purchases were made by new users. Our app was also used more frequently and 25% of online sales are now done through the app. Premium Beauty News - Unlike during other crises, in this one we did not see the ""lipstick effect"". Is that due to social distancing? André Farber - The radical decrease in socialization was the main reason why we did not see the ""lipstick effect"" in this crisis. At the beginning of the pandemic, people focused on essential items. However, this has begun to change. With beauty salons closed, people began to ""do it themselves"" - buying products to use at home. People began to look for cosmetics and perfumery products which are not too expensive but are valuable in terms of promoting well-being. With all of our efforts, we are already back to the level of demand we had before the crisis. Premium Beauty News - How has the reopening period been, especially while the epidemic in Brazil is still growing? André Farber - From the beginning, we established safety measures across the entire chain and followed the recommendations of local governments in places where we have stores. It was like this when we closed and it is like this while we are reopening. Considering the size of the country, it is only natural that there are a range of different situations. The number of people infected, adherence to social isolation and customer demand are some of the things we are considering in our decision of when to reopen. Even if governments have authorized it, if we don't feel safe, we will not reopen. Consumer behavior will be different and it is very important that they feel comfortable. Premium Beauty News - Among some of the safety measures you have adopted, one is the virtual makeup test. What other solutions have been planned? André Farber - Suspending in-store tests forced us to look for safe alternatives. For makeup, the recommendation is the virtual mirror. In a simple, fun and accurate way, consumers can try many different lipsticks, with no need to put them on. We continue to think of other technological solutions to transform the shopping experience into something special, even if there is less human contact. Premium Beauty News - O Boticário grew 9% in 2019. With COVID-19, what are the expectations for 2020? André Farber - This unprecedented crisis completely changed the way we think about our business. Any expectations we had for 2020 had to be reassessed. We are working hard on safety and increasing consumer options in order to maintain a level of growth this year. It is hard, but we will do whatever it takes to make it happen."
Maison Sybarite is riding the green trend with water-based fragrances,"By launching a new generation of water-based perfumes, the two founders of Maison Sybarite wanted to propose innovative fragrances that respected nature. A whole new philosophy involving like-minded partners. The name Sybarite was inspired by the Greek colony which settled in Calabria, in the 8th century BC. In line with the measured pursuit of pleasures associated with self-indulgence, Maison Sybarite claims to be a community of knowledgeable enthusiasts in the field of olfactory sensoriality. To create these ethanol-free fragrances, Maison Sybarite opted for the microemulsion technology (oil-in-water) developed by the Laboratoire AR2i. ""We wanted to go further, and thus propose perfumes with exceptional longevity,"" explained the founders of the brand. This is why formulas have a high concentration of aromatic compounds, which provide its intensity to the fragrance on the skin. Hence the ultradrops® - 160nm micro-drops - in the emulsion allow increasing the perfume's persistence. The micro-emulsion induces a real ""symbiosis"" between the perfume and the skin. A process which, according to the brand, guarantees a unique sensory experience. To achieve this, Maison Sybarite used a specific pump with wide diffusion. What's more, the texture is non-oily, non-sticky and contains no chemical solvents. A solution that recalls the soft liquid perfumes of Sabé Masson or the molecular perfumes of Hermetica. For the perfumer, this technology represents a new challenge in the development of the formula. ""It's a real exercise because the stability is not the same. I learn as I go! In the end, I formulate with higher concentrations for an impacting and lasting result,"" explained the independent perfumer Antoine Lie, who created three of the four fragrances in the Collection (Bed of roses, 720 and Opulent Wood), while Spicy Calabria was devised by Laure Santantoni, a perfumer at Argeville. At a time when the craze for natural cosmetics has now also set foot in the perfume category, choosing an alternative to alcohol could not stand as the only response to new consumer expectations. The two founders sought inspiration from the balanced lifestyle of Sybarites, combining a moderate search for sensory pleasures and productivity, with a concern for harmony with nature. The glass bottle produced by Steklarna Hrastnik and the secondary packaging (BES in Grignan) are made from materials and processes, selected to underpin the brand's ecological commitment. The secondary packaging is olive green, a nod to nature and the Mediterranean world, with hot stamping and a gold logo. ""To deliver on our ecological commitment, we opted for an ecologically produced cardboard, which preserves forest resources,"" stipulated the creators. As for the bottle, its shape is reminiscent of Ancient Greece, and its purple colour recalls the colour that the Sybarites wore until they reached adulthood."
Henkel expands in digital D2C with Invincible Brands Holding acquisition,"The transaction comprises three direct-to-consumer brands: HelloBody, Banana Beauty and Mermaid+Me, which are mostly sold in Europe. The three brands offer premium beauty care products and they also address the growing trend of sustainable and clean beauty. HelloBody is active in the skin, body and hair care categories, Mermaid+Me focuses on hair care products. Banana Beauty offers decorative cosmetics such as lipsticks and eyeliners. In the last twelve months as of June 2020, the businesses generated total sales of around 100 million euros and employed around 180 people, including an experienced incubator team with a strong track record of launching new D2C brands. The three D2C brands capture more than 1.5 million active consumers and should significantly strengthen Henkel Beauty Care's digital footprint. ""With this acquisition we will strengthen our portfolio with fast-growing premium brands in attractive categories. Through 1:1 interactions with consumers we will gain valuable insights that will help us to create meaningful innovations for the entire retail business,"" said Jens-Martin Schwärzler, Executive Vice President and responsible for Henkel's Beauty Care business. The remaining 25 percent stake in the business will stay with the founders of Invincible Brands Holding - Bjoern Keune and Gennadi Tschernow - and private equity fund manager capital D. The founders and existing management team will remain onboard to further expand the existing as well as establishing new businesses. The agreement, the financial terms of which were not disclosed, is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals."
Symrise inaugurates a fragrance oasis in the heart of Paris,"Located at 12 rue de Presbourg, in Paris, L'Appartement Étoile offers an intimate and inviting ambiance as well as a breathtaking view of the Arc de Triomphe. Upon entering, the visitor is transported in the very specific mood of the venue, which mixes business and art. The entrance hall is decorated with an old alembic transformed into a contemporary work of art by French urban artist Skio. Franco-Israeli interior designer Deborah Prasquier created the new space taking inspiration from the traditional Haussmannian style and Parisian chic while offering perfectly functional spaces, integrating not only meeting areas but also a true and fully operational fragrance creation laboratory. ""L'Appartment Étoile, through its conception, design and overall ethos, embodies the Symrise values of excellence, creativity and added value,"" said Heinz-Jürgen Bertram, CEO Symrise AG. ""Symrise Fine Fragrance consistently challenges existing ways of thinking and I am confident that this new hub will continue the Symrise expansion and reinvention of the fine fragrance category."" Beyond fragrance creation, the new hub will also be used to support creative arts and olfactory culture, thus creating a bridge between various areas thanks to a series of exclusive cultural events, including thematic exhibitions, master classes, conversations with iconic speakers and artists to learn, connect and cross-pollinate knowledge. The opening ceremony of L'Appartement Étoile took place on July 22, 2020. The event featured a classical music concert and the creation of an exclusive fragrance by Symrise's team of perfumers in Paris: Maurice Roucel, Annick Ménardo, Émilie Coppermann, Alienor Massenet, Pierre-Constantin Guéros, Alexandra Carlin, Marine Ipert and Suzy Le Helley. ""It is in the Symrise DNA to challenge boundaries - we constantly push ourselves to create differently, with more agility and ingenuity,"" said Ricardo Omori, senior vice president global fine fragrance, Symrise AG. ""We also believe fragrance inspiration is cultivated through collaboration with other artistic disciplines. L'Appartement Étoile Symrise brings together these ideals of imagination and collaboration in an avant-garde space to spark ideas, create opportunities and bring thoroughly modern fragrance solutions for our clients."" This new hub participates in Symrise's strategy to strengthen its Fine Fragrance business. Recently, the group recruited three young perfumers, several confirmed evaluators, and reinforced its sales team with the appointment of Ivan Bagnis. Symrise also invested heavily in the sourcing of new raw materials and the development of new extraction technologies."
Cosmo Fragrances unveils creation flat in Paris,"Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us more about this ""flat""? Alexandrine Demachy - We set up a small team to provide our commercial branch with a creative centre. The high point was the recruitment of our own perfumer, Céline Perdriel, during lockdown. This project results from our will to offer our customers a breath of fresh air: a place to meet people, exchange, and cross-fertilize right in the heart of Paris. It is a beautiful, calm flat located Place Victor Hugo, within walking distance from the mythical avenue of the Champs- Élysées, so dear to our foreign customers. This way, we will be able to sound the city out and enhance our creativity. As a matter of fact, to create beautiful things, you need to be in a beautiful place – hence the choice of this glamorous, smart address which will help develop privileged relationships with our customers. Premium Beauty News - Cosmo Fragrances is already in the United States and Spain. What are your business strategies in France? Alexandrine Demachy - Cosmo Fragrances is a family company whose headquarters are actually located in Florida and are completed with two commercial antennas in NYC and Los Angeles. We are also present in Barcelona. This global dimension is now broadened with a creative centre in Paris, the perfume city par excellence. But perfume is also Grasse, in the south of France – our research centre is situated in this region, in Mougins. Vanessa Lecomte - Our approach is based on an intimate, trust relationship with our customers, in line with the family and independent soul of our company. Our President, Marc Blaison, is also a perfumer, which makes our approach more creative. We want to take our time to create using our complete expertise: perfumer, assessor, laboratory, the whole being served by the cutting-edge technologies of our centre in Mougins. Our strength lies in our ability to meet our local customers' expectations, as they are abandoned by major groups who have absorbed smaller companies. We have a role to play: offering both giants' expertise and the flexibility and warmth of a small team that can develop tailor-made perfumes. Having a creation centre in Paris is also a luxury, since medium-sized structures are now quite rare in the capital city. We want this know-how to be available to fine and high-end perfumes, but also home fragrances, which recently embraced the codes of luxury perfumery. Premium Beauty News - This year was marked by the arrival of a house perfumer. Céline Perdriel, could you tell us about your background? Céline Perdriel - I worked in various structures, so I have a broad vision of creation. First, I worked at Synarome, which offered me a beautiful experience of raw materials, chromatography and formulation. Then, I joined Givaudan, where my main customers were L'Oréal's luxury brands. It was very formative and demanding: I improved my work's creativity as part of a two-person team with 16 different perfumers – and as many methods. Lastly, in order to get closer to Grasse and natural materials, I worked at Azur Fragrances. It was an opportunity to add body care expertise to my ""fine"" experience. Thanks to this multifaceted background, I gradually got familiar with different markets (the US, Europe, Germany, South America). Alexandrine Demachy's proposal was appealing due to the company's human-sized potential in line with what I aspired to. I like the vision of this group, because it is supported by meaningful organization and investments. It is a vision of beautiful perfumery in a very human environment, with a stimulating potential of varied markets and projects. Alexandrine Demachy - Céline's broad expertise, cross-disciplinary approach and propensity to be into everything are much precious to our strategy, which consists in creating diverse products with the same glamour and quality criteria. It guarantees a signature recognizable in all our creations. Contrary to a big company structured with divisions, we favour a customized approach that can fit all projects. Céline's dynamic personality is also valuable for all the challenges we take up, and it is in line with the energy of the women's trio we form with Vanessa Lecomte. This synergy is crucial, because Cosmo Fragrances is a family company whose early employees are still there, but also because we need to establish long-term relationships with our customers. Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us more about the research centre in Mougins? Alexandrine Demachy - In 2012, we purchased a research centre near Grasse for extraction and distillation purposes. Our cutting-edge equipment offers beautiful, qualitative natural materials, like our Timur Pepper or Maté, thanks to green processes like ""craftivity"" or molecular distillation, in order to be as respectful of plants as possible. Cosmo selects green technologies that do not require petrochemical solvents. Everything is devised as part of an ecoresponsible approach - a real philosophy in our company. Premium Beauty News - What are your projects? Alexandrine Demachy - We have been working on trends and collections based on themes like Pantone 2020 Classic Blue or Rebirth, in relation to post-lockdown. And from a more general standpoint, as part of our commercial strategy, we will bring our development centre in Spain back to the heart of Barcelona: the inauguration will take place in September. It will be an opportunity to unveil our new communication strategy and logo. Premium Beauty News - What is your vision of the market? Alexandrine Demachy - Lockdown reinforced the public's expectations in terms of reasonable and responsible consumption. Brands will have to adapt to this new situation by reinventing the pleasure of buying with meaningful products that can seduce consumers in every possible way. We will need to reconcile the notions of dream, glamour and ecology with beautiful refillable bottles, for example. But perfume exhales a part of magic which will always be fascinating, because, as could be seen during lockdown, there is still a way to do yourself good and escape. It is a reassuring, caring value that is precious in these uncertain times."
Arcancil recruits new suppliers for the post-Covid-19 era,"Taking advantage of the reflection period due to the slowdown related to the COVID crisis, CEO Anne Delleur Cabarrus launched a brand performance analysis covering the last months of 2019 and early 2020. ""The analysis highlighted a considerable loss of turnover due to our operations despite the investments made since 2016 as part of a high-performing SAP Business One system of information. We found that we could not handle a number of firm orders because some of our suppliers did not deliver on time or did not have reliable stocks, or there was progress to be made in terms of communication. It was the right moment to re-examine it all, so we could count on safe operations in the future,"" she explains. As an 'Excellence' BPI France member, the company was granted the support of two consultants appointed by the French organization, Lysiane Bessonnet and Christine Le Guennec. The mission consisted in listing all the suppliers that were not part of the brand's active partners and who satisfied determined criteria. ""Our selection criteria are very precise. The companies need to be able to get organic, Cosmos certifications to develop clean, organic makeup and skincare products as soon as 2021, whether their size is adapted to ours or not, and whether they have a family profile or are directly related to the shareholder. We also ask for information about the production chains and technologies, and require that the whole production be managed internally. Lastly, it is important for us that their structures be digitalized and that they have efficient information systems to communicate quickly,"" adds Anne Delleur Cabarrus. About a hundred 90% French companies were selected as part of this first screening; they are answering the RFI (Request for Information) questionnaire set up according to the criteria. ""Based on this selection and on videoconferences with these companies' General Managers, we will make a choice in late July to find our three to five partners for the next five years. Any entity that thinks they correspond to the profile and has not been contacted can still fill in the questionnaire by writing to Lucile Froment, who is in charge of the sourcing [1]"" adds the President. The market situation as a transformation driver ""The current situation shows we need to make transformations even more quickly,"" she continues. ""Today, we require much flexibility, agility, and fast development for smaller quantities and with much transparency and sincerity in our exchanges. We need to quickly adapt to the market and optimize our own internal resources. It is essential in the current context, so we need to change our processes, and other people should be able to question themselves and change too."" Launched as part of an exclusive partnership with Monoprix a year ago, the clean, vegan range Le Lab Végétal by Arcancil Paris became available in 60 additional stores last June, which makes 108 stores, all in all. This acceleration illustrates the brand's commitment to systematically making ""green"" products for the past two years. ""It is also in this context of accelerated deployment with Monoprix, Arcancil Paris's historic partner, that we needed to find partners perfectly familiar with this field. We want to focus makeup innovation on this, so we need to select partners that are better informed as regards the clean and vegan criterion, and more precisely formula/packaging,"" concludes Anne Delleur Cabarrus."
"Beauty salons finally re-open in the UK, with restrictions","Managing the re-opening of the British economy meant phasing out the ease of the lockdown into three steps. The first phase has seen non-essential workers going back to work (construction industry for instance). In the second phase primary schools re-opened and non-essential retailers were allowed to trade from the 15th of June. And in the third phase, starting Saturday 4th July, the Prime Minister announced that pubs, restaurants and hairdressers were be able to reopen. However, beauty salons were still prohibited to welcome back customers. After an agonising wait for salon owners, the British government eventually allowed nail bars, spas and beauticians to go back into business as of July 13th, but some treatments will NOT be permitted such as: – Face waxing, sugaring or threading services; – Facial treatments; – Advanced facial technical (electrical or mechanical); – Eyelash treatments; – Make-up application; – Dermarolling; – Dermaplaning; – Microblading; – Electrolysis on the face; – Eyebrow treatments. [1] The UK government emphasises that treatments or services provided in the 'high risk zone' directly in front of the client's face are the most risky in terms of catching or spreading the virus. The British Beauty Council has been campaigning for the re-opening and has released a series of content to help the beauty industry during the lockdown, including the CTPA guidance's for in-store testers and cosmetic counters, a webinar explaining the latest guidelines for salon owners, but also a Template letter to send to local MP for the Reopening of the Beauty, Spa and Wellness Industry. ""The decision to broaden the scope of available hair and beauty services will allow many more beauty professionals to get back to work and will also allow customers to benefit from a range of beauty treatments which can be carried out safely for both client and practitioner. It's a positive step, but we are still only part of the way there. We will keep working closely with governing bodies and supporting everyone in beauty until we are able to achieve the fully-reinvigorated beauty industry we all want,"" says, Millie Kendall MBE, CEO of the British Beauty Council. The beauty industry brings a £28.4 to the British GDP, and 590 500 jobs which equates to ONE in every 60 jobs in the UK economy [2] and the British Beauty Council hope that the contribution of beauty to the overall re-dynamisation of the economy will be very positive."
"Floratropia, the startup revolutionizing the perfume world","Launched in January 2020 after two years of development and a crowdfunding campaign started in October 2019, the young brand surprised everyone with radical choices marking a complete break from the perfume world's customs. After exactly six months of existence and an exclusive online presence, Floratropia will make their debut at the Paris BHV Marais department store next July. And yet, its creator, Karine Torrent, is from a perfume background. ""Perfume became a passion very early on. I occupied marketing and development positions with people who loved raw materials, and professionally, I evolved with the idea that what actually makes a beautiful perfume is beautiful raw materials,"" she explains. After training at Guerlain and Yves Rocher, she joined the Puig group before turning to niche perfumery. ""All this made me wonder about the model of modern perfumery and think about how to integrate it to a model with a positive impact on the planet, the biodiversity of perfume plants, and the communities that cultivate them,"" she recalls. Floratropia has the ambition to question established truths in the world of perfume. ""The project consisted in methodically deconstructing and questioning every product development phase, from raw material sourcing to packaging design,"" continues Karine Torrent. The objective was to relate the perfumer's know-how to sustainable development objectives. The idea of a 100% natural and vegan perfume is nothing new – it is even a major trend in the current perfume landscape. And the industry's giants have understood that perfectly well: they are all trying to enhance their portfolio of natural ingredients through multiple acquisitions. And yet, people were extremely cautious with the idea of a completely plant-derived creation based on responsible networks. ""We even had a lot of very negative feedback,"" emphasizes the creator. ""There is this firmly anchored conviction that a beautiful perfume cannot be completely natural. Fortunately, lines are shifting thanks to new brands' obstinacy, as can be seen with 100Bon, who have been working very hard on this issue."" The encounter with perfumer Delphine Thierry was eventually a triggering factor. ""She showed me it was possible to make both 100% natural and exceptional perfumes."" The four Floratropia perfumes are based on Robertet's portfolio of natural raw materials, with a few beautiful innovations, like the use of Hedychium, whose culture in Madagascar offers farmers complementary revenue. ""The choice of raw materials is both artistic and ethical,"" highlights Karine Torrent. ""We wanted perfumes that grow in the earth to provide perfume plants and growers with a prospect."" Floratropia also asserts their identity with a packaging choice which breaks with the current perfume codes. Perfumes are no longer sold in luxurious bottles to be thrown away when the product is empty, but in flexible refills which feed a travel size spray decorated with a vegan leather imitation sold separately. Plus, nothing prevents the consumer from using their own spray if they already have one! ""It is the best solution as regards the carbon footprint throughout the value chain. Our aluminium, PET, and PE 'Resources' consume very few materials and are very energy-efficient; they are light and do not require any overpackaging. Of course, they are not perfect, in particular because they are not recyclable. That is why we invite our customers to send them back to us for free, so that we can manage their end-of-lives as part of a partnership with a German recycling player,"" explains the creator. Not only this solution helps reduce the impact of packaging, but it also makes the product more affordable. ""When you buy a perfume, you also buy a lot of packaging. By changing things in terms of packs, we also change the environmental and the economic equations. Natural perfumes are costly, but our packaging solution helps focus the product's value on perfume, by reducing waste and carbon emissions. In short, we offer more perfume for less packaging."" As Floratropia is about to enter the physical distribution channel, the brand is also considering the possibility of providing refills in stores. Launched just before the Covid-19 pandemic, Floratropia aims to provide an answer to several questions regarding contemporary consumption patterns. ""Fast fashion is much criticized, but the current model of fast perfumes is not neutral either, with its furious launch pace combined with a standardization of the offering, even though the overall impacts cannot be compared,"" concludes Karine Torrent. Well, welcome to the world of slow perfumery!"
"900.care, a new concept of refillable products for the bathroom","900 corresponds to the average number of seconds spent in the bathroom, i.e. 15 mn, and Care refers to the will to do oneself good without causing harm to the environment. Aymeric and Thomas, the two young co-founders of 900.care, started working in the bathroom, as they noticed the circle of consumption was far from virtuous. ""We throw away our empty bottles to purchase exactly the same ones, only full. It is an absurd system, so we wanted to find a solution with containers to be kept for a long time, and which could be refilled with a formula without any compromise on the comfort and sensoriality of a standard product,"" explains Aymeric Grange. Both uncluttered and neutral, these containers do not sport any brand sign. ""The logo is concealed and the product information is available on the cardboard packaging of the refill. When you buy a lamp, you don't want it to display the logo. Same principle here,"" adds the creator. The choice of partly recycled plastic for these packs is in line with the brand's commitment. ""We made this choice of material for three reasons. For an object you will keep for a long time, plastic is a good solution, provided you do not create new packs too regularly. Thanks to recycling, you give the existing plastic a second life. It is also pretty energy-efficient as regards manufacturing, and it is lighter to transport than glass or aluminium. The CO2 impact is weaker."" The containers are designed by Romain Lemahieu and manufactured by VPI and Qualiform, two French recycled plastic specialists. They can be washed between two refills, and if they get damaged, the packaging is replaced by the brand: they have it recycled. The 900.care concept is intended for consumers – and there are more and more of them – who prefer clean solutions, but do not want to change their expectations as regards product comfort. It is supposed to be both easy and convenient. ""We do not mean to make people feel guilty; we prefer to encourage them. We aim to make zero waste accessible, i.e. to offer a beautiful customer experience and make it all easy. Our concept is intended for those we call 'imperfect eco-warriors'"", explains Aymeric Grange. The formulas developed and manufactured in France are based on 95% natural ingredients and the specifications are focused on sensoriality and efficacy. The startup launched a 30-day fundraising campaign on Ulule to finance the first production. Contributors will receive their products in November, when the e-shop is launched. Shoppers will be able to purchase single products (€7.5 for a container, €5.5 for a refill) or take out a subscription. By 2021, they aim to join a retail network and gradually broaden their range to all bathroom essentials."
KDC/One to refocus their industrial operations in Europe,"Following a review of the company's operational, project management and commercial teams across Europe, Canada-based cosmetics supplier KDC/One has announced its intention to relocate some of its operations, potentially leading to the closure of the several sites in France and the UK. Indeed, KDC/One plans to consolidate some of its production lines in its most competitive facilities in order to create centres of excellence that ""will provide a strong platform for sustainable growth in the future."" With the acquisition of the Alkos Group and Swallowfiled last year, KDC/One took control of three production sites in France (Inter Cosmétiques, Sagal Cosmétiques and Alkos Cosmétiques) and two sites in the United Kingdom (in Wellington, Somerset, and Bideford, North Devon), plus another industrial facility in Tabor, Czech Republic. The restructuring plan will result in the pencil and soap manufacturing being transferred from the existing Swallowfield Bideford and Sagal Cosmétiques sites to the state-of-the-art Alkos Cosmétiques facility in Hesdin-l'Abbé, in Northern France, closed to Boulogne-sur-Mer. The transfer would involve investing in a new cutting-edge production line for soaps at the site. In addition, deo sticks manufactured by Sagal Cosmétiques in Gallardon and the skin care and lip care products made by Swallowfield in Bideford will go across to Inter Cosmétiques KDC/One's plant in Angers in Western France, which was inaugurated in June 2018. The changes are likely to lead to the closure of the Sagal Cosmétique and Bideford facilities. In addition, some employees are at risk of redundancy at the company's sites in Wellington, Somerset, and Paris, due to the reorganization in sales operations. ""This strategic review of our European businesses has been underway since last November. While these decisions have not been easy ones, they are necessary to move the businesses forward, allowing us to maximise production capabilities, continuously innovate and meet customer expectations in a highly demanding and competitive marketplace,"" said KDC/One Europe President Matthew Gazzard. ""We will be working closely with work representatives to ensure all our employees have access to the support they need during this time,"" he added. Eventually, KDC/One stressed that this refocussing of the company's operations is in no way a response to the COVID-19 pandemic or to Brexit. ""We had been strategically reviewing the business structure for many months following our acquisitions in Europe last year before the pandemic arose, albeit the events of recent months requires the company, as with all businesses, to build additional resilience into its operational model,"" highlights Matthew Gazzard. Consultations will soon commence with employees at risk of redundancy in France and in the UK."
Cosmetics Europe explores the importance of cosmetics in daily life,"With an emphasis on sustainability, product safety and wellbeing, the 'Essentials for Daily Life' series brings into focus the sometimes overlooked ways in which the cosmetics sector enhances the lives of consumers on a daily basis. It offers a behind- the-scenes look at the cosmetics and personal care sector, exploring what it is doing to enhance people's lives, support the planet and improve products. ""It is a unique opportunity to showcase aspects of our industry which are not widely known or understood. The stories in the series give a real insight into our innovative and forward-looking industry. I would like to thank the partner companies and associations who have made this amazing journey possible,"" said John Chave, Director General of Cosmetics Europe. The video series is intended to inform audiences of the key trends and developments in the highly complex and continually evolving cosmetics sector, challenging misconceptions, and developing a better understanding of the scale and economic impact that cosmetics have across the continent. Developed in partnership with Apivita, Beauté Pacifique, Henkel, IKW, Ilcsi, Inuacare, Ivatherm, Kao, Kemon, L'Occitane, L'Oréal, Laponie, NAOS, Orkla, Pierre Fabre, Procter and Gamble, Symrise, Unilever and Weleda, the series can be seen on the 'Essentials for Daily Life' website since the 11th of June and will be promoted on social networks. Among the various videos presented, the documentary ""The Refill Revolution"" shows how Kao has revolutionized the Japanese household and personal care market with its refill packs that have reduced the amount of plastic used in these categories by more than 70% versus a do-nothing scenario. In 1991, the company introduced a refill packaging system that serves both the environment as well as the consumer. The refill pouches are produced with a thin plastic film that significantly reduces the amount of plastic needed and enables consumers to use up even the last drop of product. ""We have been able to convert 80% of all packages purchased in the household and personal care categories here in Japan to these thin film refillable packages,"" points out Dave Muenz, Senior Vice President ESG (Environnement, Social, Gouvernance) at Kao. ""That has resulted in a 74% reduction in the sheer amount of plastic that is used in those categories."" The Kao film, along with the other videos in ""Essentials For Daily Life"" series, might contribute to offer an alternative vision on the cosmetics industry."
"""Our industry is based on contact,"" Laurent Mercier, Eurofragance","Premium Beauty News - How has the crisis impacted your business? Laurent Mercier - In 2018, the whole industry had to deal with an unprecedented raw material crisis. It was a tough economic year, but it all got better in 2019 and we kept growing, geographically speaking. The year 2020 had started very well: the first quarter was the best we had had since the company was founded. And then the pandemic created the biggest problem for any company: mobility. Whether in B2B or B2C, our whole industry is based on us offering an experience. With our customers, we need to reinvent contact with a new parameter then: that of reduced mobility. It is an emotion transfer chain we must pass from one person to another, and now this bond is all gone. Perfume sales are struggling, and the duty free market is seriously impacted. It is going to take several months until everyone flies again. Things will not come back to normal before two years. And yet, do we feel like travelling like we did before? We are only getting out of the health crisis and entering an economic crisis with an underlying societal crisis. People will question things. Premium Beauty News - What are the most affected sectors? Laurent Mercier - Our activity is mainly related to Fine Fragrance, and then Body and Home Care. As regards perfumes, I think there will always be a place for beautiful and expensive things. Anything that is somewhat exclusive and related to a niche has a chance to be more visible. Well-established brands can now seduce consumers who used to buy products that were a little less expensive, but are now more available or just feel like spending money for pleasure. But price is quite significant for everything that does not really stand out. Niche winners will also be those that invest in private networks, like Puig, with Penhaligon's, or L'Artisan Parfumeur. The category that will undergo more changes should be Body Care, because solid cosmetics are making a comeback. Plus, we bank on Home Fragrance: people have rediscovered their homes, so they will feel like enhancing them with beautiful perfuming products. Premium Beauty News - What about the natural perfume trend? Laurent Mercier - Last year, with Marketing and Communication Director Stéphanie Marze, we organized the #GreenIsEasy event to help our customers find their way in this field. About sixty manufacturers took part in it and they had many questions to ask. The idea was also to explain that nature for the sake of Nature can be more of a curse than a blessing. Many conventional fragrances are much more valuable than natural fragrances in terms of carbon footprint, if you make a comparison throughout the value chain. For now it is difficult for the industry to make all-natural products that are actually environmentally friendly. It takes time to achieve a transition. We provided explanations about the situations on the market and the packaging segment, but the main issue was regulations and certification. We need to support customers appropriately, because they are really eager to learn about naturalness, especially after the pandemic. Eurofragance keeps working on this with a palette of perfumers which is evolving and needs to be further enhanced. Our industry has understood that we need to explain what ""real"" naturalness is, because this word conceals a lot of issues and imperfections. Plus, unfortunately, it is often used to the detriment of ""synthetic"", whereas biodiversity-wise, these concepts are complementary. This duty of transparency is dear to us, both for our customers and consumers. It is one of our main missions for the years to come."
"A new website, a new design, new features…","This new version of the Premium Beauty News site is the third major update since its launch in 2008. The challenge was to incorporate a host of new features while maintaining the news readability and an utmost browsing and reading comfort, while offering readers easier access to the huge amount of information available today on the site (nearly 17,000 articles in free access). General navigation has evolved to offer a dual entry menu: the thematic navigation (markets, trends, R&D, packaging, ingredients, regulations, innovations, etc.) is maintained and is now coupled with the possibility to select the geographic area (Europe, Middle East, North America, Asia...), thus offering a unique 360° picture of the global beauty industry. We are multilingual by nature, with a version in English and another in French from the start, and since 2014 a Brazilian edition in Portuguese (the transition of Brazil Beauty News to the new version is underway). The English version is now visited by more than 60% of our reader base, thus offering our advertisers worldwide reach (North America, United Kingdom, Asia and the Middle East representing the main groups of English readers). As for the French version, it guarantees first-hand information on French brands and suppliers, whose weight in the global cosmetics industry cannot be denied. We want to continue our global expansion with a dedicated content by market and continent. And soon, with a new edition, which will further enhance the visibility of our partners and the quality of the information brought to our readers. Navigation on the new site has been further improved and made even more easier, with an augmented visual path, suited to a higher graphic resolution. This enhanced presentation now allows us to offer our advertisers, more space and visibility on banners but also on new formats, while preserving the ease of browsing and readability for visitors. The site now features a section dedicated to multimedia content (video, podcast), which is easier to access and more visible, but also a section dedicated to the innovations of our suppliers for highlighted editorial contents. This model allows companies in the industry to consolidate their notoriety and to actively communicate on their novelties. It also allows us to offer our readers a 100% free quality content. We would like to thank these advertisers for their unwavering support from the start. The website's search engine has been improved to allow you to narrow down your selection criteria. Search results for archived articles always appear according to relevance criteria (according to the rank of the word(s) searched for in the article). The query can now be filtered by language or sorted chronologically. One of the main assets of Premium Beauty News lies in its freely available archives. With nearly 12 years of presence and a considerable amount of news material indexed by the main search engines, Premium Beauty News is today one of the main multi language reference in the industry. This change in design is a first step in the stepping up of our services, new features will be introduced in the course of 2020 and beyond. We wish to also take this opportunity to thank our readers and our advertisers for their loyalty and unwavering support since the very start; our sole commitment is to continue supporting them by staying by their side, especially with the complex times looming ahead! We are here to help with: – Promoting and/or hosting your webinar to educate or introduce your innovations; – Publishing your news and announcements; – Increasing your notoriety in the beauty industry. So please do not hesitate to contact us!"
"""IL Cosmetics aims to keep diversifying activities,"" Jean-François Harpès","Premium Beauty News - The Covid-19 pandemic is an unprecedented crisis. How did IL Cosmetics react? Jean-François Harpès - I am surprised at our countries' absence of preparation for a crisis that started in December in China. Our governments did not take advantage of the two or three months before the epidemic spread outside Asia to take the best-adapted preventive measures. As a matter of fact, Taiwan's example shows the efficacy of an early, adequate reaction. As far as IL Cosmetics is concerned, our contacts with our Asian customers and suppliers helped us anticipate the risk earlier and get ready. Our priority was to protect our employees. Starting from mid-March, we implemented a whole series of preventive measures: quarantine, working from home everywhere possible, temperature checking, importation of masks directly from China, spacings and protective separations between the different workstations, reinforced disinfection and hygiene procedures, detection of Covid traces… Thanks to our teams' motivation and dedication, all these measures were implemented in record time in our bulk and packaging plants, laboratories and offices. It helped us prevent people from being contaminated on our premises and keep working without any interruption. Premium Beauty News - IL Cosmetics also contributed to fighting against the epidemic. Jean-François Harpès - We made hand sanitizers for hospitals in Luxembourg. We had alcohol stocks available, which was an advantage. And like other companies in our sector, we adapted our chains to respond to the emergency situation. Premium Beauty News - What is the current situation at the different IL Cosmetics sites? Jean-François Harpès - We remained operational throughout the lockdown period in our three plants, in Luxembourg, Poland, and Bulgaria. Only our R&D division was impacted, in particular because we had to reorganize the tests with our consumer panels, so they could be carried out at people's homes. Premium Beauty News - What do you think the economic situation will be like in the short term? Jean-François Harpès - If our production capacities were not impacted, obviously demand was, due to many points of sale closing. The orders delivered were stored by brands, so now the products need to be sold. But the missed consumption opportunities will not be made up for and we will not get the consumption months lost back. As a result, we are anticipating a business slowdown. Based on our exchanges with our customers, we can expect a market downturn of -10% to -20% in 2020. But I think we will get back to the same consumption level as before the crisis as soon as 2021. We are lucky because we are very strong in relatively less impacted areas. In Germany, the Netherlands, and in several countries in the North of Europe, distribution was not completely interrupted. Likewise, Asia represents a significant part of our sales, and the crisis was less violent in China, Japan, and South Korea. IL Cosmetics is doing very well. We had implemented significant streamlining measures which have already brought positive results, and we had foreseen a very high growth rate for 2020. In the end, we will probably achieve a stable turnover: given the circumstances, it will be a great result and a real advantage. Premium Beauty News - How will the pandemic impact the different makeup categories? Jean-François Harpès - The first statistics we got from the distributors that remained open during the crisis confirm the fact that the nail and eye categories are on the rise, while lip and face products have declined. This trend should keep developing, since the latter are less adapted to mask wearing. A crisis is also a powerful innovation driver! To meet new needs, we developed disinfectant products in record time with our makeup lines. Our creation process, which places consumer feedback at the core of formula validation, is also an asset. We very quickly implemented a home testing system to preserve our research and development dynamics and keep offering our customers innovations. Premium Beauty News - What will be the impact on cosmetics subcontractors? Jean-François Harpès - The decline of consumption – over one or even several years – will obviously have an impact. The companies which were struggling before the crisis will also struggle to survive, and the concentration movement of subcontractors will intensify. It probably means we will have new external growth opportunities which will help us keep diversifying our activities – we started a few years ago. We come from nail varnish, we benefit from a solid growth in the eye and lip categories, and we are interested in complementary categories or markets we are not serving yet. Premium Beauty News - Consumers seem to have strong expectations for the future as regards sustainability, ethics, and production relocation. How do you think the crisis will end? Jean-François Harpès - What is for sure is that the past two months have changed consumption habits. But it would be presumptuous to pretend to know so soon what dimensions consumption will have after the crisis. Generally speaking, product safety will remain a key concern. This trend applies to formulation, production processes, and applicators: all manufacturers are aware that this cannot be negotiated and that expectations get stronger and stronger. Ethics and environmental protection are and will remain key issues. The crisis revealed the weaknesses of very complex global supply chains. From this standpoint, the relocation movement will keep developing: it had already emerged before the pandemic, in particular to meet reactivity and agility needs. The system had shown its limits. And yet, it would be naïve to think there will be a complete return to the past situation. Quality, efficacy, and production costs remain essential issues. So, I do not believe in production fragmentation into a very high number of small plants. The concentration trend will keep spreading. Premium Beauty News - In conclusion, what would you like to tell your customers? Jean-François Harpès - See you tomorrow! We are 100% operational and cannot wait to introduce our latest innovations during one of our webinars!"
Retail: Pure player Birchbox France unaffected by crisis,"Now that they are independent from the American parent company, Birchbox France, headed by Quentin Reygrobellet, co-founder of the initial concept, keeps developing, with a 10% growth rate since the beginning of the year and a two-digit cost-efficiency. And this progress was unexpectedly amplified by the lockdown. ""Our traffic has more than doubled, and so has the conversion rate. Our average basket has increased by 40%"", says Quentin Reygrobellet. These dynamics were driven by the arrival of 40% new digital consumers who used to shop offline. Meanwhile, the retailer benefits from the additional interest of new brands previously not referenced on the box and the online store. ""They are mainly selective or professional brands sold in places that have had to close their doors. It shows there will a before and after Covid-19. In the digital sector, cosmetics were growing, but they still represented quite a small share, between 10% and 15% of the global market in France. Today, it shows those who were reluctant to use it that the digital solution is actually interesting,"" explains the Director. The fun, accessible way consumers discover new products with the box convinced the most receptive who longed to go shopping. Birchbox France saw their box sales double compared to April 2019, which directly impacted the conversion into purchases online. The winning categories include cocooning care, masks, scrubs, hair dyes, hair care… at the expense of makeup and perfume. The sales of the corner green, which already represented 40% of the distributor's turnover, also boomed. In addition, March marked the launching of a new premium concept, the Splendist box, which guaranteed customers the equivalent of 200 euros of full size products for 49 euros. ""We aimed to meet the demand of consumers with different profiles, in particular those more interested in luxury offerings,"" explains Quentin Reygrobellet. It seems the objective was fulfilled as soon as the first spring edition: the three-month stock was sold out within 22 days. Every season has its own version. Next one is scheduled in June, and 100,000 pre-orders have already been made. No surprise here: 10 products selected by Birchbox and their partner brands are revealed before the box is purchased. For example, the March box included Garancia, Nuxe, Cacharel, and Tony Molly products. ""Contrary to the standard Birchbox, Splendist can be ordered, but we are considering making it available as part of a subscription in the months to come,"" adds Quentin Reygrobellet. With 1.2 million subscribers, Birchbox now provides their partner brands with an access to an exclusive offering: Birchbox Analytics, a platform which analyses in real time data on product performances, consumer trends, and customer insights via their shopping experiences online. ""Also, we have always wanted to change people's minds as regards our retailer relationship with brands. Analytics is a completely transparent strategic tool, and we are the only ones to offer it,"" the Director says. With five entries available, two for quantitative analyses, and three for qualitative analyses, Birchbox by Analytics makes it possible for brands to follow up in real time both sell-in & sell-out information (global ranking, turnover, market shares) and purchase behaviours (number of products ordered, recurrence, basket amount). The quali data provide information about the brand's beauty profile (preferences and physical characteristics), the box campaign (buyers' feedback), and the Birchbox beauty profile. ""The objective is to realign our respective interests. If brands understand their customers better, our subscribers will eventually be more satisfied,"" adds Quentin Reygrobellet. Now that they are operational in Germany and Switzerland, Birchbox aims to keep growing in France, of course, with new offerings and new brands, but also gradually in other European countries, like Italy and the Netherlands. ""Our priority is to get off the beaten track to become the first digital beauty destination,"" emphasizes Quentin Reygrobellet."
"KKR takes over Coty's Professional Beauty, which becomes ""Wella""","Coty has found a buyer for its professional beauty business, including hair care and hair dyeing brands Wella and Clairol, ghd hair styling tool and the nail polish brand OPI, which will be grouped together in a new standalone company named ""Wella"". Coty acquired the professional beauty and retail hair brands in 2016 from Procter & Gamble. With brands such as Wella Professionals, Nioxin, Professional Sebastian, Londa Professional, Sassoon Professional, Clairol Professional, Wella Color Charm, OPI and ghd, Coty's Professional Beauty division is the #2 salon professional company globally, after L'Oréal. Under the terms of the agreement, KKR will acquire a 60 percent stake of the new company and Coty will retain the remaining 40 percent interest. Coty's mass beauty business in Brazil will remain a fully owned business of Coty. This operation is part of a strategic partnership between Coty and KKR, by which the American investment fund will invest $750 million in Coty through convertible preferred shares, which will be followed by an additional $250 million dollars, also in convertible preferred shares, when the transaction will be completed. These transactions will result in significant deleveraging of Coty's balance sheet. ""We are thrilled with this announcement. KKR is one of the world's preeminent investment firms with an exemplary track record of value creation. As a market leader with one of the strongest portfolios of brands in the professional beauty market, we believe this partnership opens up a new set of opportunities for 'Wella,' our people, and our brands,"" commented Sylvie Moreau, President of Coty Professional Beauty. KKR has a long track record of investing in branded consumer businesses, including the beauty sector. Its portfolio includes 109 companies with over US$157 billion in annual revenues and employing more than 637,500 people. ""We are excited to form this partnership to invest in Coty to support it through this period of unprecedented global uncertainty and allow it to emerge as a stronger, more agile business, and to acquire a majority stake in Wella, a market leader with a strong portfolio of brands in the attractive professional hair market where we see significant opportunities to accelerate growth in partnership with its experienced leadership team. We look forward to working towards the establishment of a lasting and value-creating strategic partnership,"" said Johannes Huth, Partner and Head of KKR EMEA. The final deal is expected to be signed by the end of May."

Anjac H&B Group keeps growing with Roval Cosmétiques acquisition,"Specialized in cosmetics formulation, manufacturing and filling, food supplements, medical devices and drugs, the Anjac H&B Group keeps growing, as they have just purchased Normandy-based company Roval Cosmétiques, an expert in cosmetics and hygiene products. Founded in 1980 by Yannick Brunet, Roval Cosmétiques formulates, manufactures, and fills ranges of perfume, toiletries, and hygiene, hair care and skincare products. The company owns two cosmetics production sites in France, in Flers, Normandy, one in Spain (Roval Cosmética), in Alcover, South of Barcelona, and one site for plastic bottle injection, also in Normandy. Roval Cosmétiques is also Ecocert-certified for the manufacturing of organic-certified products. Thanks to this acquisition, Anjac H&B Group completes their portfolio of product expertise with categories they did not or almost did not yet cover (hygiene products, hair care, perfume). But above all, the group gains significant production capacity with ""renowned industrial excellence"" they aim to rely on for future prospects. ""Every new purchase is an opportunity for us to expand our industrial expertise and exclusive innovative capability"", emphasizes Aurélien Chaufour, General Manager of Anjac Health & Beauty. ""This operation represents a major step in our development. It is perfectly in line with our strategy in terms of industrial expectations and continuous investment: we endeavour to keep satisfying our customers and markets with a high added value"", he adds. ""Within this Group, Roval will be able to complete and reinforce strengths, as well as share skills,"" says Yannick Brunet, founder of Roval Cosmétiques. Thanks to this purchase, Anjac H&B achieves a turnover of more than 400 million euros. Today, the group counts over 2,000 employees in France, Spain, and the US. Multiplying purchases over the past few years, the French family group has gradually become a key beauty player in Europe. They have also recently settled in North America by purchasing Californian company Cosmetix West in September 2019. Today, the group covers the whole cosmetics value chain, from research to finished products, including raw materials, with companies like Laboratoire Shadeline, Euro Wipes, Sicaf, Laboratoires Chemineau, Innovi, Pascual Cosmétiques, or Aircos, in France, Laboratoires Feltor in Spain, and Cosmetix West in the US. ""Every new operation provides the group with complementary expertise and new teams that help develop both the offering and technologies,"" explains Anne Rutigliano, Marketing & Communications Director of Anjac H&B Group. ""Thanks to its industrial strength, Roval Cosmétiques both completes Anjac H&B Group's know-how and strong capacity and broadens our made in France offering,"" she concludes."
"""We need to help our industry take off again soon"", Christophe Masson, Cosmetic Valley","Premium Beauty News - What was the role of cosmetics industrial companies over the past few days of crisis? Christophe Masson - Starting from mid-March, our economy quickly slowed down as the pandemic arrived in Europe. That is when our industry started playing a role on hand sanitizer manufacturing. The greatest names in the cosmetics world took action to produce this gel, but not just them, and it is a key point to be noted: locally, many SMEs spontaneously supplied hospitals, nursing homes, and healthcare centres. Then, so that the collective effort could go even further, the Cosmetic Valley issued a call for production which was answered by several dozens of companies. We opened a hotline and put hospitals in contact with manufacturers. That was most important, because none of them really knew how to proceed. Premium Beauty News - Has it changed the relationships and cooperation among the different players? Christophe Masson - As far as hand sanitizers are concerned, manufacturers were soon faced with a lack of supplies, like raw materials and packaging items. So, new operating ways emerged. We observed new solidarity dynamics in our industry. The companies whose activities had been slowing down, but still had stock, sent it to those that could produce the gel. It created a sort of virtuous chain, and the Cosmetic Valley made this easier. A few years ago, we had launched a platform called Impact Plus to put plants with raw materials or pack items left in contact with potential users, like startups, who sometimes need small quantities. So, we gave all French cosmetics companies free access to the platform, and over 200 companies used the tool to register either as a manufacturer in need for supplies or as a stock supplier. A real collaborative system among all companies in the sector was created, and both our companies and their employees were willing to get involved. Premium Beauty News - Do you think things will be any different when it is all over? Christophe Masson - It is tricky to give figures now on companies' economic situation, but the good news comes from Asia: things have taken off again there. It is definitely a sign which helps anticipate ""the after Covid-19"". But we still worry about the West: the crisis has been deepening in the US, and everyone knows how vital this market is for our cosmetics industry. Premium Beauty News - Does that question the value chain and the dependence of our production on global markets? Christophe Masson - As regards dependence, we have to put things into perspective. We are not in the same situation as other sectors, like medicines, where dependence is a critical issue. However, this crisis shows we need to intensify our efforts with manufacturers by supporting SMEs, so that they gain skills and innovate: this way, made in France products will be even more qualitative, safe and innovative. This is vital for us to stand out and preserve our leadership. To boost our economy, we will also need to develop dynamics based on collaboration, solidarity, and responsibility, as can be seen with gel manufacturing. It also echoes the need for our industry to move towards even more CSR. On the global level, French companies are ahead in this field, and it will be a strong value and differentiation parameter for made in France products. Premium Beauty News - What are the financial issues and what will be the future like for the whole industry? Christophe Masson - We export all over the world, so if consumption slows down, our business just cannot do well, even if our companies are competitive on the global stage [note: the cosmetics industry is ranked second among net exporting sectors in the French economy – source: French customs, 2019]. We might also lose market shares if we boost our economy later and more slowly than our Asian friends. It is definitely a worrying issue. So, we need to start working ASAP on how we will proceed. The Cosmetic Valley puts companies in contact with public authorities and supports them with the extensions of due dates and credit carryovers guaranteed by the State. Our role consists in making it easier for company directors to get through this real obstacle course. But above all, we need to get ready for what comes next, i.e. convince the government and local authorities to consider French cosmetics as a strategic industry which needs help to quickly take off again. It is essential to implement boosting dynamics for this sector mainly composed of companies which are small, but export a lot."
Nail polish: Fiabila dispels some given ideas,"Premium Beauty News - At the time of apps helping buyers control the content of products, it seems that a lot of consumers are convinced that a traditional nail polish is composed of ""risky"" ingredients? Alexandre Miasnik - The European cosmetics regulation, the strictest in the world, protect consumers from all products incorporating harmful substances. This is particularly the case for formaldehyde and certain recently banned phthalates. As a consequence, Fiabila has been integrating this requirement, to the benefit of all its customers, for over 20 years, regardless of the country and therefore of regulations in force, and this, for all our production plants across the world. But to go even further in our development of a ""clean"" version, we also excluded from formulas all controversial ingredients, such as toluene or camphor, suspected of being allergens, even if they are authorized by regulations. On top of it, our laboratories are equipped with very efficient tools to control and ensure the purity of raw materials used and received, one batch after another. Premium Beauty News - A natural polish is clean by definition? Alexandre Miasnik - As with all segments in cosmetics, the analogy between natural and ""clean"" is often misleading. Natural raw materials can be produced in an unsustainable way or potentially cause allergies; this can be the case in particular, with some resins extracted from conifers or some essential oils. Conversely, a biochemistry-derived, synthetic product can be perfectly safe for use and sustainable. Fiabila was able to formulate a 97% natural polish. However, to propose a holding power and brightness rivalling that of ""traditional"" polishes, we offer green versions with up to 85% natural ingredients. These consumer products thus combine naturalness and perfect safety. Premium Beauty News - Can a nail polish be labelled organic or vegan? Alexandre Miasnik - There is no organic certification, to date, for nail polishes. However, Fiabila offers 100% vegan formulas containing no ingredients of animal origin, which is also the case with the pigments used. To comply with European regulations, none of our cosmetics are animal-tested. Premium Beauty News - The production of polish has a reputation for having a significant impact on the environment! Alexandre Miasnik - Each manufacturer follows its own commitments. The commitments of Fiabila focus on investing in a closed-circuit production tool, whether in France, the United States or Brazil, thus limiting solvent evaporation as much as possible. Waste has also been reduced by a third over the past 4 years. We are the only nail polish manufacturer in the world to offer such infrastructures. Premium Beauty News - The nail polish segment is not known for being very innovative Alexandre Miasnik - A large part of our investments are dedicated to innovation with a consequent R&D service of 40 people, and we also very recently doubled the surface area of our laboratories. Our formulations are constantly evolving, particularly with regard to the development of both, safe, particularly long-lasting formulas and natural pigments. For instance, our laboratory has recently developed a patented technology, based on an innovative oligomer, which polymerizes in daylight and thus offers a physical hardening and the flexibility of a traditional polish, but with a holding power and shine exceeding 7 days. We adapted this technology to LED lamps, to offer an alternative solution to semi-permanent polishes applied in institutes with up to two weeks' hold. All this, with no use of monomers, and with a nail polish removal routine that can be done at home, with a traditional solvent. For more information, see: www.fiabila.com"
Coronavirus: beauty giant Unilever unveils huge 'United for America' initiative,"As part of a wider global effort by the company, #UnitedForAmerica will see Unilever United States partner with the non-profit organization Feeding America to donate food, soap, personal hygiene and home cleaning products worth more than USD 8 million to help those impacted by the pandemic. The products, which will be distributed via a national network of foodbanks, include items from the personal hygiene brands Dove, Suave, Degree, TRESemmé, Shea Moisture and Axe. The initiative will also include home cleaning and sanitization products from the brand Seventh Generation and food products from Knorr, Hellmann's/Best Foods and Lipton. ""Unilever is 'United for America' because we are all in this together and only together will we defeat this virus,"" said Fabian Garcia, president of Unilever North America, via a statement. ""Our people are committed to supporting all Americans - especially those most in need - with the resources to act to protect the wellbeing of their families and their communities. We will do this by ensuring access to hygiene, nutrition and sanitation products, and by working through our brands to inform and educate people to help them in this difficult time."" The conglomerate is also donating more than 200,000 masks for healthcare workers in local hospitals in New Jersey, as well as working towards a national 'Day of Service.' Scheduled for May 21, the event will see Unilever United States donate every single essential item produced at its 14 US factories that day (or products of equal value) to community partners serving people in need. The company will also redirect its entire marketing and advertising spend for that day to promote non-profit partners, relief organizations and other community groups. United for America follows the news, announced earlier this week, that Unilever was implementing wide-ranging measures to help people all around the world suffering from the crisis. These include donating soaps and sanitizer worth at least EUR 50 million to the COVID Action Platform of the World Economic Forum, and offering EUR 500 million of cash flow relief to support livelihoods across its extended value chain. ""Remarkably, until there is a vaccine for Covid-19, soap remains our best first line of defence. Medical authorities are clear: washing our hands thoroughly and frequently with soap, or using sanitiser where soap and water are not available, is one of the most effective ways to arrest the spread of infection. As the world's biggest soap company, we have a responsibility to help. We have a social, medical and moral obligation to make soap more readily available worldwide. We have to deploy our expertise in how to teach people to handwash effectively, whichever brand they choose to use,"" said Alan Jope, CEO of Unilever. The conglomerate announced initiatives in the US, India, China, UK, Netherlands, Italy and many other countries."
"""There will be a before and after Covid-19,"" Patrick O'Quin, FEBEA","Premium Beauty News - The beauty industry is joining forces to produce hygiene products in mass, in particular hand sanitizers. This ability to take action confirms the importance of this sector in France! Patrick O'Quin - First, it confirms that cosmetic products are essential to our everyday lives. Contrary to preconceived ideas, they are not frivolous products. Hygiene products and toiletries (soap, shower and bath products, hair products, toothpaste…), which represent a significant part of what our industry produces, actually play a vital role in our daily lives. Beyond daily hygiene, skincare products help our skin better manage the increased frequency of hand washing. Plus, even if we are confined, we need to feel good about ourselves. All psychologists recommend we keep taking care of our appearance at home. Again, cosmetic products are a keystone in this search for wellness. Premium Beauty News - What is the outcome of this initiative so far? Patrick O'Quin - It is too early to say. But we do know that over 30 companies have converted their production lines to meet this new demand. And those that keep manufacturing the same hygiene products as usual should also be counted. Over 10% of our members took action from the very beginning, whether major groups or SMEs. However, it should be said that manufacturing antibacterial hand gel requires taking precautions and cannot be done on any industrial tool. The companies that handle alcohol as part of their usual processes have been the most reactive, but it is only natural. Premium Beauty News - How are products distributed? Patrick O'Quin - Distribution criteria are set up with public authorities, and we centralize part of the supply and demand in partnership with the Cosmetic Valley. Hospitals and health centres are the top priority… Premium Beauty News - The crisis related to the Covid-19 epidemic has been shaking the whole economy. Are you considering asking for specific measures for the cosmetics industry? Patrick O'Quin - Not yet. General measures applying to all sectors have been taken. Together with other industrial sectors, we have sent short-term requests, in particular to facilitate logistics in emergency situations. That is how movement restrictions were lifted in the weekend. Premium Beauty News - Some retailers have suspended their payments, so that brands, in particular small ones, are experiencing difficult times. Patrick O'Quin - Indeed, we have heard of that, but not from our members. The cosmetics industry is not the only one concerned, and MEDEF [largest employer federation in France] has sent all companies a letter to prevent these behaviours. Conviction measures are implemented first. To us, from a legal standpoint, the notion of ""force majeure"" is questionable in this case, so it is up to the accusing party to provide evidence that all conditions are met. Premium Beauty News - The epidemic highlights the structural weaknesses of supply chains. Patrick O'Quin - Obviously, there will be a before and after Covid-19, and supply chain fragmentation strategies will need to be reviewed. Many companies had already changed their practices. And as circular economy and sustainable development concepts are gaining importance, we can definitely expect a real transformation in both consumer expectations and company processes. This crisis might also help the European Commission give further thought to what circular economy actually is – a real green deal which better takes into account value chains, and not just plastic bashing. It is too easy and little relevant. Premium Beauty News - It also seems that the epidemic is marking a return to borders, in the world of course, but maybe also in Europe. Are you expecting a swing in economic and commercial policies? Patrick O'Quin - Obviously, renationalization and bilateralism have been making progress. American President Donald Trump's politics are the best example. But, as we operate in a global market, we still believe in multilateralism. Cosmetics manufacturers endeavour to partner on the global level as regards issues of common interest: the end of animal testing and alternative methods – Europe is far ahead when it comes to these matters – the environment, sun filters, and consumer information. Dealing with issues of general interest in a joint effort offers huge collective advantages."
Kure Bazaar now offers coordinated lipsticks with its clean nail polishes,"Relying on a trendy positioning and a selective choice of its points of sale, the Kure Bazaar brand has quickly made a name for itself in the world, as the trend reference for clean make-up. ""Initially we wanted to propose one of the only colour cosmetic products, whose formula did not have a natural alternative: nail polish,"" explains Christian David, co-founder with Kartika Luyet of the brand. With this in mind and an unbridled and very trendy approach to colours, Kure Bazaar launched its first clean formulas, developed in collaboration with the manufacturer Fiabila. One season after another, these colours have added to one another, enriching a catalogue, which now consists of 80 references. Building on the 'lips and nails' colour duo, which, in the 1990s, was a basics of women make-up, Kure Bazaar is now combining its best-selling nails polishes with 30 shades of coordinated lipsticks. ""For the past 4 years we have been focusing on this requirement often expressed by our customers. While changing nothing to our colour specifics, we applied to lipsticks, our vision of making as clean as possible formulas,"" specifies Christian David. With 32 references, 29 shades, 3 textures (matte, satin and coloured balm), this substantial launch in the category, is based on vegan formulas containing up to 100% natural ingredients, rich in vegetable butters (mango, pomegranate, organic cranberry…) and colour pigments derived from synthetic micro-powders. In line with a comprehensive clean approach, the recyclable aluminium packs are refillable. The base of the tube, which is home to the interchangeable grape clipping is made of recyclable PET. The cases can be covered with a recycled jean fabric hand-sewn in Italy. ""We wanted to demonstrate that it was a product worth keeping and that, as such, it deserved to be taken care of,"" notes the founder. An approach, which is in a way, an allusion to the brand's proximity to the world of fashion. Launched exclusively in Paris, at Bon Marché Rive Gauche in 2012 and now distributed worldwide, in controlled and selective distribution channels (concept stores, department stores, luxury hotels, etc.), Kure Bazaar has managed to convince adepts of natural luxury. ""Formulating naturally, means engaging in a discourse, it is a particular twist that immediately strikes the customer's sensitive cord,"" concludes Christian David."
Coronavirus: The cosmetics industry steps up to address the health emergency,"Earlier this week, the L'Oréal group unveiled a Europe-wide solidarity program aimed at supporting the medical, food distribution, beauty and non-profit industries. The French beauty giant is ramping up its production of hand sanitizer in order to bolster supplies for health authorities across France and Europe. In a bid to protect small and medium-sized beauty businesses such as salons and perfume shops from folding under the economic impact of the crisis, L'Oréal has said it will freeze payments due from its distribution networks until business picks up, and increase the frequency of payments to its suppliers where needed. Unfortunately, this exemplary decision from the cosmetics giant, is not imitated by all business players. Indeed, according to information received by Premium Beauty News, several key retailers - whose physical stores are currently closed in France - have chosen to suspend all payments to their suppliers, thus aiming to protect their cash position. In France, the Federation of beauty companies (FEBEA) has announced a strong mobilization of the cosmetics industry to guarantee the supply of basic hygiene products required for the implementation of barrier gestures, such as handwashing. According to the FEBEA and the French Cosmetic Valley, over 50 companies - from multinational firms to SMEs - in the cosmetics sector have volunteered to supply the products requested by health authorities. For instance, in addition to LVMH, Hermès, Coty and L'Oréal, the Grasse-headquartered Arthès group, will supply hand sanitizers to hospitals in the south-east of France, the Guinot-Mary Cohr group, has mobilized its factory in Dammarie-les-Lys (greater Paris area), and the Eugène Perma group put its Reims site (North-East of France) into a battle footing. Upstream of the industry, Arkema, a manufacturer of specialty chemicals, has decided to repurpose a pilot line at their Rhône Alpes Research Center (CRRA), near Lyon, in order to manufacture 20 tons of alcohol-based solution per week to be distributed free of charge and as a matter of urgency to hospitals in France. ""Concretely, this means that many companies that usually manufacture perfumes or soaps have already launched or are about to launch a dedicated production line to manufacture hydroalcoholic gels complying with one of the governmentally approved formulas,"" explains Patrick O'Quin, the president of FEBEA. ""It is by being strong, organized and united that we will overcome this particularly troubled period,"" added Didier Martin, president of the Eugène Perma group. His company has already produced more than 100,000 units of 100ml hand sanitizers, which are offered to hospitals all over France, but also made available to the group's employees in Reims and Paris headquarters. In Switzerland, fragrance maker Firmenich has adapted its production to donate 20 tons of disinfectant solution to the Geneva University Hospital (HUG), and medical and emergency services. In Spain, the National Perfumery and Cosmetics Association (Asociación Nacional de Perfumería y Cosmética - Stanpa) announced that it is working with companies in the sector to provide the nation and the health system with the much needed alcohol-based hand sanitizers. ""It is important to highlight that, due to the low rate of use of this type of products under normal conditions, the production of sanitizing gels and solutions is usually quite specific and somewhat minor in the production of companies, mostly SMEs. In recent weeks, all of them had increased their capacity to supply the system almost to the limit, either through pharmacies, supermarkets or directly to hospitals,"" explains Stanpa. In the UK, among other initiatives, British soap bar brand Nuddy is giving away free soap to customers, with the brand taking to Instagram to explain: ""We believe that EVERY BODY should have the means to wash their hands properly, keep bacteria at bay and try and prevent the spread of this horrible virus."" In the US, Hudson Valley Skincare has also suspended production in order to focus on making hand sanitizer for people in its local community."
"BWX, the ""House of Natural Brands"", is experiencing a strong momentum","Premium Beauty News - Last month, BWX announced that Sukin's skin and hair care lines just arrived at Target.com and were available over 800 brick and mortar Target stores across the U.S.A. early February. Dave Fenlon - As a pioneer in the clean skincare movement, we continue to champion the environment, giving consumers peace of mind that their Sukin products will not negatively impact our planet.

BWX has headquarters in Melbourne, Australia, and California, USA to support this global focus. Premium Beauty News - Do you have any planned investment? Dave Fenlon - At the moment the team is very focused on investing into brand marketing and our people. By marketing we mean investing in our core brands of Sukin, Andalou Naturals, Mineral Fusion and Nourished Life through more digital and social platforms to more effectively educate consumers on the benefits of natural skincare that is affordable, good for you and the environment too. We also listen to our consumers and pay attention to their personal care needs which inspires and innovates new product development. We are also investing in our people and their skillsets so that the company can continue to grow, innovate and evolve our leadership position in the natural and organic personal care industry (which is growing at over 5% annually). The Group will continue its investment in brand building, capability and innovation to drive deeper connections with consumers globally while maintaining a sharp focus on controlling our cost. Premium Beauty News - Anything you would like to add? Dave Fenlon - The Group has delivered a strong financial performance in the first half, with net revenue growing 23% to $84.1m and underlying EBITDA increasing 63% to $11.6m. BWX is well-placed in the growing global beauty and personal care industry, which is expected to reach the value of US$616 billion by 2022, growing at 5.8% annually. We are investing in direct-to-consumer marketing to educate and grow our addressable market; and we are focused on consumer-led innovation in new product development, all underpinned by a multi-channel retail approach and user-friendly digital platforms that accelerate direct-to-consumer access. The positioning of each brand is important: Sukin: the #1 natural skincare brand in Australia Natural pharmacy, Andalou Naturals: the #1 natural skincare brand in North American Natural channel, Mineral Fusion: the #1 natural cosmetics brand in North American Natural channel and Nourished Life: one of Australia's leading natural personal care and lifestyle B2C platforms."

Napoleon Perdis: The Aussie icon saved from the brink and ready more than ever for 2020,"When Napoleon Perdis appointed administrators, the brand owed more than $22 million to creditors including the ANZ bank, the Australian Taxation Office, Australian Pharmaceutical Industries and Myer - with $16 million in ""accumulated losses"" sitting in the US branch of the company. While Mr Lee wasn't with the business at the time, he suspects the brand made a ""typical mistake"" common among retailers that enter the US market - over-investing in infrastructure such as warehouses and stores too quickly before sales actually start pouring in. Premium Beauty News had the chance to meet with Mr Lee. Premium Beauty News - When did you buy Napoleon Perdis and why? Henry Lee - We acquired the business in mid-April 2019 after conducting 6 months of due diligence. The irony is the top-line numbers were there and it was very well received but the numbers did not justify the infrastructure ahead of sales. It's a typical mistake a lot of Australian retailers make, thinking they should go in big and build 10 stores because the US is such a big market, but it just doesn't work like that. The losses were propped up by the Australian arm through a combination of debt and working capital which put enormous pressure on the business and resulted in poor decisions which coincided with Australia's tough retail climate. The Australian business was still profitable but couldn't sustain the levels of debt, a heavy corporate structure that included dual offices in Europe and Australia and wage and rent expenses for its 80 stores. This had a resulting impact on cashflow, which affected stock levels and ultimately led to a further decline in sales. This is a death spiral that has been played out by so many retail businesses of late. The founder and namesake was a pioneer, a leading authority in the beauty industry and his craft in makeup artistry meant that he was an insider for new trends and innovation. He invented new categories and released products before consumers even knew they needed them. Case in point, our best-selling product is our iconic primer, first introduced more than 15 years ago. To this day we continue to sell one primer every 90 seconds. He was still surprised by the ""panic buying"" that took place once news of the administration broke when the chain's future was still unclear, with some customers snapping up enough primers and foundations to last ""several years"". Napoleon Perdis is ranked the number one Australian brand in the Prestige Cosmetic segment. It's also an iconic brand with a cult-like following from professional makeup artists and end-consumers, both in Australia and internationally. The opportunity to acquire such an established and well-loved brand does not come up often, nor does the opportunity to reset a business and re-build it on a solid foundation. This was a challenge we were excited to tackle. Premium Beauty News - As the forefront of runway trends and innovation, Napoleon Perdis Cosmetics will be the official makeup partner for MBFWA in 2020. Henry Lee - We are proud to announce our official makeup partnership with Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia 2020. As MBFWA celebrates its 25th anniversary, we are excited to bring the artistry that has defined Napoleon Perdis to the event. We look forward to sharing our creative expertise and continued passion for the fashion and beauty industry as Australia's leading professional makeup brand. Premium Beauty News - What is your international strategy? Henry Lee - The broader market beyond Australia is extremely important to us, and we expect that international sales will exceed domestic sales by the end of 2020. Clearly, we have our sights set on two of the largest consumers of cosmetics – the North American market and China. The brand has previously had good traction in the U.S. market, having been stocked in Bergdoff Goodman, Neiman Marcus and Ulta. To capitalise on this, we are currently in discussions with several U.S. based department stores and hope to re-enter the North American market in the next 12 to 18 months. In July 2019, we partnered with Access Corporate Group, and launched into the China market via a cross-border e-commerce platform. This has been a phenomenal success having generated $30m in retail sales in as little as 6 months, and this will grow exponentially in the coming year. And over the next three years, Kuba Investments has budgeted to invest more than $21 million in brand development and marketing alone to reconnect with ""loyalists"" and engage with new customers."
"""Sustainably addressing a broader variety of brands and consumer needs is one of our biggest challenges"", Thomas Espinosa, Schwan Cosmetics","Premium Beauty News - Schwan Cosmetics is a key player in the global make-up market. What is your analysis of current trends? Tomas Espinosa - The global beauty market is facing challenging changes and shows big contrasts depending on the region. While Asia is growing across all categories, we see mixed signals in Europe and the USA, partly struggling with a shift into skin care and closely related make-up categories. Eventually, despite a tense economic situation in many countries, big brands are still emerging in South America. Besides, manufacturers must adapt to the new rules of the market: Since significant changes to the barrier of entry occurred, new brands, with different business models, are able to gain a significant share of the market. Brands can now emerge from a strong Instagram presence, for instance. Some of them spike and disappear as fast as they appeared, whereas others have become key-players in the industry. Despite the challenges of this ever-changing market, there are still many new opportunities for growth and success. Consequently, we need to be more flexible and agile to meet consumer demands and customer needs. Premium Beauty News - Is your industrial tool able to address these new challenges? Tomas Espinosa – We are confident it is. Current market trends are more oriented towards regionalisation than globalisation. Our global footprint permits us to respond to the rising needs for short, local and flexible supply chains. Today, most of our technologies are expanded on a global scale. We are investing heavily in digital technology and process manufacturing in order to deliver the best performing formulas and product quality, regardless of the location. In addition, we are consistently expanding our machinery to offer a broad variety of packaging designs. Premium Beauty News - The other big trend is sustainability? Tomas Espinosa - Sustainability is the biggest challenge of our time, raising a lot of questions. One of the key questions is how to communicate on green features? How consumers can have a broad picture of the entire impact of a product, and how to measure it? How to provide accurate information? Transparency is therefore a key topic and a key request. Younger generations have become more concerned about environmental challenges and especially about the negative impact of plastic. From this point of view, our expertise in wood processing is a big asset. In 2018, for instance, we launched a wood technology that is able to compete with plastic pencils for long lasting formulas. As far as sustainability is concerned, we believe short supply chains and plastic reduction are key answers. But we are also working on cleaner formulations and the end life of the components, with biodegradability and recyclability being big challenges. For instance, we are developing single material designs as well as a refillable product range. At this year's Cosmopack Bologna, we will be introducing new products and solutions focusing on the three pillars sustainability, transparency and well-being. Our objective is to provide brands with a comprehensive sustainable concept in order to discuss the best options for their needs together."
"Make-up: ""Deciphering and anticipating the expectations of generations Y and Z to create winning connections""","When it comes to make-up, the youngest generations are leading the way! Millennials (Generation Y or digital natives), born between 1981 and 1997, have transformed the world of make-up in North America and Europe, by endorsing brands who have understood how to reach them via social networks, and offer them breakthrough products: NYX, Anastasia Beverly Hills, Too Faced, Glossier. Born after 1997, in an already highly digitalized world, the gen Z is emerging as the new challenge for the cosmetics industry. Ultra-connected, expert in communication, ultra-creative and eager for collaboration and inclusiveness, while asserting its individuality, this generation is instrumental to changing radically the way of addressing one's self-image. Attentive to global issues, the Gen Z does not hesitate to state its convictions during protests against climate change for example, but also through its purchases by favouring brands with a crystal-clear commitment, in line with their values. Selfies, snapchats, Instagram posts and stories, digital natives and the gen Z live in a world of assertiveness. Explorers of alternatives, addicted to the most diverse online content, they move from one platform to the other, follow influencers, improve their beauty culture thanks to the tutorials, comments and tips of their peers. Fashion and beauty brands are scrutinized and evaluated at high speed by generations who know they have gained a new influence. Always more demanding towards brands, they want products corresponding to their own definition of cosmetics and allowing to state one's specific expression, but avoiding stereotypes and placing the emphasis on inclusiveness. ""When it comes to make-up, decoding the consumption habits of these generations is vital for brands. For IL Cosmetics, as an industrial partner, it is a key element of our expertise in the world of make-up. Our mission is to help our customers understand, and even anticipate the needs of their consumers. This is why we created IL VIEW'R, a strategic tool to foster innovation from a new consumer perspective"", underlines Aurélie Ignaccolo, Head of Marketing at IL Cosmetics, one of the European leaders in nail polish and make-up products based in Luxembourg. To enrich its draft project beyond consumer panels, IL Cosmetics thus collaborates with beauty consultants and make-up artists. ""It is both a question of complementing our expertise and of having a vision focused on consumer expectations,"" explains Aurélie Ignaccolo. As part of IL VIEW'R, the Luxembourg Company offers a detailed analysis of the habits and expectations of consumers who are increasingly versatile, always more connected, more and more attached and attentive to the values expressed by brands. These expectations are connected to the DNA and positioning of brands. A 360-degree approach that will very soon be enhanced by the exploitation of big data collected online, on social networks, in particular via Google Trends, thus offering an immediate knowledge of the evolution of consumer expectations. And to beef up this offer, new recruits will be joining the IL Cosmetics marketing team, with several profiles totally dedicated to the digital world. ""From these analyses we imagine and design technologies that boost the potential of products. What we offer is therefore much more than a technical expertise. In addition to this, our developments are based on our analysis and our vision of markets and supported by patented innovative technologies, by our knowledge of raw materials, formulation process and of our exclusive collaborations with experts. With IL VIEW'R we offer a real B2P (business to person) approach, which allows us to precisely define persona profiles, and thus better meet consumers' expectations,"" stressed Aurélie Ignaccolo. The IL Cosmetics method goes well beyond product development. Once the product has been launched, IL offers to analyse its interaction with consumers. Depending of results, new developments may be put forward, new lines of communication may be recommended. The objective is both to maximize the consumer experience and to generate new opportunities for innovation. And the IL Cosmetics method is paying off! ""Among the millennials' favourite brands, there are customers for whom we have developed products, which are now emblematic,"" underlines the Marketing Director. The Cosmetify platform ranks a number of key players that have best managed to meet the expectations of young generations. A number of brands for which consumers are showing strong interest (Google Trends data, mentions, commitments and followers on social networks), and ""some of which are IL Cosmetics customers."" For the Luxembourg Company, this success is no coincidence but relies largely on the analysis and innovation tools allowing IL Cosmetics to detect emerging trends and anticipate the expectations of younger generations. ""We can truly say that we are the ideal partner for the millennials' favourite brands. Throughout 2020, the brands we work with will see an intensification of our efforts in understanding and getting a grasp of consumer expectations, particularly from the analysis of big data coming from social media. A service primarily focused on understanding the generations Y and Z,"" concludes Aurélie Ignaccolo."
Meiyume: An immersive and creative path to enchant customer experience in beauty and luxury outlets,"The 2020 edition of the Paris Creative Days organized by Meiyume will be held on the company's premises in Levallois Perret from 28 to 31 January 2020. During four days, the French subsidiary of the Hong Kong company will offer its customers an interactive and immersive path of approximately two hours to discover its latest innovations and those of its partners. ""The path was designed as an interactive experience, with our partners Opuscope, a start-up specializing in augmented reality with its Minsar platform, and Temera, an Italian company specialised in RFID and digital solutions, who created the application and digitized the path"", explains Magali Galea, Meiyume designer. ""Upon arrival, our customers will be given three QR codes enabling them to enhance their two-hour experience, access additional content and leave comments on products,"" she adds. Their journey will begin in a dark room with an introduction to the event and a digital access to a series of data on the men's grooming market, as a preamble to the pop-up store experience dedicated to men's skincare and make-up products, organized in the next room. ""The whole of it steeped in a musical atmosphere adapted to the customer's experience."" On this occasion, Meiyume will also introduce the expertise of its Retail Solutions Division in collecting and aggregating the data of each customer path. ""Reflecting what we are able to set up in POS, we will analyse the journey of our visitors, the stands where they stopped and the products they handled,"" continues Magali Galea. The collected data will then be analysed by Meiyume and sent to customers to illustrate how this strategic data can be materialized and used for marketing purposes. The path also features three additional stages, each focused on three innovation themes: the sustainability of primary and secondary packagings, including POS; self-expression (packs and product personalization); and digital innovation, with a presentation of innovations proposed by partnering start-ups. Throughout the customer path, particular emphasis will be placed on Meiyume's expertise in skincare and on the current key ingredient trends - sustainability and formulations with a high level of naturality according to ISO and COSMOS standards - as well as on the company's growing capabilities in the make-up category, and more specifically, multi-moulding technologies for lipsticks and hybrid formulations. Finally, a connected bar will showcase RFID solutions proposed by Meiyume, and enabling to carry out real time inventories. A chatbot will also interact with visitors to further enrich their journey. With this new edition of its Creative Days in Paris, Meiyume intends to state its ability to aggregate technologies, to quickly propose prototyped innovations and to test them. With bases in Asia, Europe and North America, the company relies on five factories dedicated to the formulation and packaging of cosmetic products, but it also relie a broad network of factories to offer a very complete set of solutions. Meiyume Paris Creative Days January 28-31, 2020 Upon invitation only. Contact: Magali Galea - magaligalea@meiyume.com"
The Aromaperfumery of Aimée de Mars combines olfaction and emotion,"But just because Valérie Demars had embarked on the Léa Nature adventure alongside Charles Kloboukoff, does not mean she had forgotten her childhood dream, to create perfumes. In June 2015, she launched the brand Aimée de Mars, named after her grandmother, her source of inspiration. ""It couldn't be more obvious since I wanted to make love perfumes,"" she says. The range consists of ten fragrances formulated with 96 to 100% ingredients of natural origin. She combines the 21 essential oils used in the composition of each perfume with St Genou spring water, which is renowned for its therapeutic benefits. The production is vegan, and is also based on organic wheat alcohol. ""The idea is to reconnect people to their deepest being through the vibration of the plants and the essential oil, this is the registered concept of Aromaparfums®,"" explains Valérie Demars. Hence, to the olfactory value of the plant is added the emotional action emanating from the essential oil. ""Cheerful bergamot, puts a smile on the lips, immortal helps to overcome emotional blows, etc.,"" Illustrates the perfume creator. Valérie Demars works with a limited palette of 300 natural ingredients, yet the olfactory result is very real with sensual, woody, floral fragrances, with a lasting and assertive trail. ""These Eaux de Parfums are a way of reconnecting with the perfumery of times gone by. Many of our customers who no longer wore perfume are now delighted to take a renewed interest in perfumes with these creations. Today, the majority of conventional perfumes are made with more than 80% of chemical ingredients, in which some consumers no longer find their marks,"" explains Valérie Demars. The range of Elixirs brings the combined olfactory and emotional experience to the next level, by including in each bottle a precious or semi-precious stone, carrying beneficial energies. Mystique Améthyste, Sensuel Rubis or Divine Émeraude, the three new compositions, 100% natural and Cosmos certified, like each Elixir de parfum, act on an emotion associated with the mineral. In the Christmas Collection, the precious stones in the bottle are cut and can be recovered from the bottle once empty. With the second brand Eau de Mars, the compositions, again based on AromaPerfumery, are more gourmand and target a young audience. Each perfume is linked to a personality illustrated by a divinity, and a skincare action. Using the Aromatest available on the site, the user can discover the fragrance matching her profile. Proposed at EUR 39 for the 30 ml bottle and EUR 76 for the 50 ml bottle, products from Maison de Mars are available in 400 points of sale in France, in pharmacies, organic stores, the Beauty Success institutes or networks as well as in Germany in the Muller retail network. The e-commerce site is based on the ""Happy or Refunded"" principle, offering for each order three samples, including a sample of the product ordered, with the possibility of returning the product and getting a refund after testing it."
Anjac Health & Beauty is boosting its innovation and leveraging on intrapreneuriality,"Created thanks to successive external growth operations and a dynamic business development, the family Group Anjac Health and Beauty posted sales of EUR 280 million in 2019 with a staff of 1,700 spread in France, Spain and the USA. In a fast-changing environment, where expectations from cosmetic brands vis-a-vis their suppliers are increasing, Anjac Health & Beauty has chosen a very original organizational model intended to consistently offer customers the production and R&D capacities of a large group while preserving the agility and reactive structure of the SMEs composing it. ""It is true that innovation is on the lips of every manufacturers and the term is quite overused. In fact, beauty suppliers and brand owners alike, have understood that, in a world that is constantly accelerating, innovating is the royal road to success, not to say a prerequisite for survival. As far as we are concerned, we are fortunate to be able to rely on a very original and agile organizational model. We advocate intrapreneuriality, the culture to undertake within the Group. And indeed the Group's ten companies [1]]] benefit from this. In practical terms, the companies' different general management remain very autonomous, the founder is often always at the head of his company, as is the case for Aircos, Cosmetix West, Feltor, Innovi…"", explains Anne Rutigliano, Head of Marketing and Communication at the Anjac Health & Beauty Group. Relying on small structures and cross-functional innovation in a project mode, accelerates decision-making, preserves the test and learn culture, which is also similar to the way certain brands, in particular indie brands, operate. However, to go one step further and offer more value to its customers, Anjac Health & Beauty also relies on the Group's specific synergies. ""A Group R&D unit has been created and the teams meet regularly. We are deploying the same type of unit for Marketing teams and we are increasingly integrating consumer trends in our developments,"" explains Anne Rutigliano. Within the Group, expertise in Applied Research, in particular concerning ingredients and molecules, is shared. Abduction research methods, a method of reasoning based on the exploration of very large fields of research, benefit everyone. Innovation in the Anjac Health & Beauty Group is scientific and focused on proven efficiency. In 2019, to give even more value to the innovation dynamics emerging from its teams, and to thank them, Anjac Health & Beauty has launched Anjac'tive, an in-house innovation contest open to its 1,700 employees, and encompassing processes, services and products. The Group also leverages on multiple categorical skills ranging from health products to food supplements, including make-up, personal care and dermocosmetic care, while having a mastery of the entire product designing and manufacturing chain, from ingredients to formulation. ""Our added value stands in our ability to imagine and develop innovative, tailor-made solutions that will have a positive impact on our health and environment. With Innovi, for example, the Group can rely on an entity specializing in research and innovation, capable of developing exclusive ingredients for its customers, depending on the brand's objectives and positioning,"" adds Anne Rutigliano. The Group proposes a natural ingredient SPF BOOST which allows reducing sunscreen levels while maintaining high SPF levels in formulas. Research teams are working on second-generation effective and sensory, solid cosmetics, biodegradable and compostable masks combined with dermocosmetic formulations for the elderly, diabetic populations, etc. This diversity in companies also makes it possible to deal with customers showing very different profiles, to smooth out capacity problems and to provide continuous business solutions. In terms of innovation, it also allows the Group's customers to draw on the multiple skills and specialties developed by each company or at group level, with a particular focus on the key expectations of consumers: naturalness and efficiency. Historically, very much focused in the Made in France, the Group recently established itself in North America with the acquisition of Cosmetix West. The expertise and know-how of the Californian company in clean beauty will thus benefit the entire Group, which also plans to transpose its technologies to its new entity to bring more proximity and service to its local customers."
"""It is our responsibility to become a trusted resource within the industry,"" Shelley Sullivan, ModelCo","Since the brand's early beginning, self-tanning has been at the core of ModelCo's business, closely followed by the premium range of colour cosmetics, both of which gained worldwide attention from collaborations with the likes of creative genius Karl Lagerfeld, high-profile model Hailey Bieber and former Victoria's Secret Angel and founder of Rose Inc, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Since owning the category back in 2002 with Tan Airbrush In a Can, ModelCo has continued to remain a reputable trusted resource within an industry that has embraced self-tanning. Premium Beauty News - What do you think of today consumers? Shelley Sullivan - Today's consumers are demanding and conscious, they want to trust in brands before they make their next purchase and they want to ensure it signifies purpose. We already have a brand that is globally recognised for offering the best quality at an affordable price point, and now we are in a position to be socially responsible and truly relate to our everyday customer. Premium Beauty News - As the brand celebrates its 18th birthday, what was your most challenging experience? Shelley Sullivan - In 2013 we released Super Tan, a product that created extensive buzz around before the official launch. We approved the formula internally, yet it was produced wrong with an over-developed green base and turned our customers green. It was a real turning point for the business and put us in a vulnerable position, and we had to rebuild customer loyalty through direct consumer communications. Shelley Sullivan A trailblazer of the Australian beauty industry, ModelCo's CEO and founder Shelley Sullivan is undoubtfully one of most significant female entrepreneurs in the Australian Beauty industry today. Early in her career Sullivan started her successful model and talent agency before shifting her focus to beauty after identifying a new opportunity to create sophisticated, yet purposeful beauty products that delivered what they promised, proved performance and exuded a sense of luxury at an affordable price point. More than 18 years after the brand's foundation, ModelCo has grown to peak success with globally-renowned collaborations and international stockists while constantly evolving to reflect what women seek in their beauty routines. Last year, Sullivan launched MCoBeauty, a luxe-for-less beauty range that caters to the mass market grocery space. Premium Beauty News - Where do you position the brand now? Shelley Sullivan - We wanted to take a real-life approach to self-tanning and evolve how we speak to the everyday consumer, sparking conversations about beauty with meaning. As we continue to foster brand loyalty, it is our responsibility to become a trusted resource within the industry. ModelCo is a brand that allows people to become part of the conversation through relevance. Premium Beauty News - What is next for ModelCo? Shelley Sullivan - Our global presence has always been at the forefront of ModelCo. It started with our world-first Tan Airbrush In a Can that gained worldwide attention, and went on to be sold in the likes of Colette in Paris, Sephora and New York's Henri Bendel. We've always had a uniqueness to assemble our products with trending celebrities which is another success driver of expanding our global fan base. There has been a lot of interest around ModelCo tan and cosmetics in the US for 2020, and we're looking to widen our distribution."
"""Our goal is to continue to build our unique ecosystem with a strategy that goes well beyond the box"", Quentin Reygrobellet, Birchbox France","Premium Beauty News - What motivated your decision to do without Birchbox to continue the adventure? Quentin Reygrobellet - It was a real desire on our part, we had reached a point where our life stages were different. It seemed logical for both parties to be able to move forward independently. For our part, the company was profitable and growing steadily with a virtuous and sustainable model. By regaining possession of our working tool, we are now opening a third chapter with just as much adrenaline and all the maturity acquired in past years. Our goal is to continue to build the unique ecosystem created over the past 7 years, with a strategy that goes well beyond the box. The box is a discovery experience, a way to consume better, but it is not an end in itself, we know this from the start. It accounts for 60% of our turnover thanks to 220,000 subscribers, the remaining 40% comes from the sale of large size products on the site with 1.2 million customers who subscribe and buy on the e-site and interact with us. We are going to speed up the pace in these two areas: sales through online retail and the increase in the number of subscribers. Premium Beauty News - Precisely what will happen in 2020 with this idea as a driver? Quentin Reygrobellet - We are focusing our development on three directions. The first concerns data - the core of our business from the start - namely the ability to send the right product, the right message to the right person. Today the challenge for brands is to establish a direct contact with consumers. We were one of the main players to pioneer this cross-talk between the brand and its subscribers. We have therefore chosen to make this data freely available to our partnering brands, in an open source mode. They will have access in real time via a platform, to the various data concerning our subscribers, to their sales performance on our site, to all the quantitative and qualitative elements regarding their customers and to a comparison with their competitors. It is a real innovation seen nowhere else. For example, a brand will be able to know which are the other brands in the basket of the customer and therefore which products suit her. It is an asset for the brand and ultimately for the consumer. Through the data provided, we participate in creating products much more in line with the customer's expectations. It is hand in hand work. Premium Beauty News - You also bank on e-commerce? Quentin Reygrobellet - This is the second line of development through the rise in our number of subscribers. Today we are the leader in online sales of cosmetics. The overall beauty market in France represents around 14 billion, while the digital market only represents 1.4 billion but it is growing by 20% per year. There is therefore an clear interest in focusing on this market with a very high growth potential. From time to time, we do make some forays in the off-line market be we deeply remain pure digital players. The site is completely cross channel with more than 5000 references coming from 300 selective, pharmacy, niche or mass retail brands. It is open to everyone, even non-subscribers who account for more than 30% of sales. To go further, we will launch next March a discovery subscription offer for more premium products, a new service dedicated to some high-end brands. Premium Beauty News - The third axis concerns your expansion abroad? Quentin Reygrobellet - Indeed, we want to leverage on this absolutely unique beauty ecosystem built in recent years in France, and roll it out to the rest of Europe. In the coming weeks the brand will be launched in various European countries where Birchbox was not present, such as Germany, Italy, Scandinavia, Poland and the Netherlands. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, under which brand name will you operate? Quentin Reygrobellet - For now, under the Birchbox label but we are allowing ourselves 18 months to change the brand, its name. It is a real challenge because this name is known internationally, however we consider that it is also a great opportunity to show that we are going far beyond the box concept. Premium Beauty News - Why did you choose Otium Capital and the French entrepreneur Pierre-Édouard Stérin to support your growth? Quentin Reygrobellet - Things actually happened quite logically with Pierre-Édouard and his team. They have a thorough entrepreneurial vision, a deep knowledge of the beauty market while on the other hand, leaving us free rein and a total mastery of our project. It was a very important element for us."
Henkel continues its transition to more natural products,"""While concerns about the quality and composition of products remain the main reason behind the evolution of purchasing behaviors, environmental concerns are becoming a new lever for change. There is a real quest for meaning in consumption"", explains Charlotte Le Buhan, Marketing Manager France at Henkel Beauty Care. Thus, 69% of French people say they are ready to buy products from companies that demonstrate their transparency and integrity, and 71% say they are ready to buy products from companies that really respect the environment. In order to address the evolution of the European consumption model, the group has chosen to transition all of its brands [2] towards a greener positioning. ""Henkel wants to be a pioneer in offering more sustainable, and more responsible cosmetics that are accessible to everyone"", continues Charlotte Le Buhan. In 2020, all of Henkel Beauty Care's innovations are therefore designed to incorporate more natural ingredients and be more responsible, including: botanical active ingredients for Diadermine Lift+, a shampoo bar for N.A.E., the organic brand launched by the group at the end of 2018, Schwarzkopf launches Nature Moments, an eco-labeled hair care brand with a minimum of 92% ingredients of natural origin, etc. As far as packaging is concerned, Henkel is generalizing the use FSC-certified cardboards (i.e. cardboards sourced from sustainably managed forests), reducing the volume of plastic of certain jars and is massively incorporating a part of recycled plastics in its packaging materials. For instance, the Fa Ocean Passion line features two shower gels in bottles made of 100% recycled plastic, including 50% of plastic collected on beaches. According to the same line, the various brands of the group are also committed alongside various associations dedicated to social or environmental causes."
"The Italian ""Cosmetic Valley"" in rapid transformation","The region included in a circle of a hundred kilometres in diameter, which centre would be Milan and including the cities of Monza, Bergamo and Crema, is the spearhead of the Italian cosmetics industry. Accordig to the Polo Tecnologico della Cosmesi, the area gathers over 590 businesses in the beauty sector, which in 2017 generated EUR 5.7 billion in sales and with a workforce of more than 25,000 employees. They mainly include manufacturers of machines dedicated to the beauty industry (achieving a turnover of more than EUR 365 million and employing more than 1,300 people), manufacturers of cosmetic formulations, (EUR 3 billion, with 14,000+ staffs) and packaging manufacturers, (EUR 2 billion in sales with 10,000 staffs). Also according to the Polo, 65% of the makeup products sold around the world are produced in the area. With a global demand that has constantly increased, both in volume and quality, over the past five years, the Italian beauty cluster really transformed itself, demonstrating once again its ability to a changing environment. Artcosmetics' brand new 30,000 m2 factory, which also serves as their headquarters, is emblematic of the transformation of Italian makeup specialists. From EUR 33 million in 2010, the company's net sales have jumped to EUR 108 million (forecasted) in 2019. Located in Fornovo San Giovanni, near Bergamo, the new facility houses an innovation centre and an R&D lab spanning over 1500 m2 and the bulk production capacity for emulsion and anhydrous has more than doubled. Gotha Cosmetics made a similar move one year ago. The company, which also specializes in the design and manufacture of makeup products, moved to a new administrative and industrial site, a few blocks away from its former location in the North of Milan. The new facility features 3,000 m2 of offices, a production area of 12,000 m2, i.e., twice the size of the previous factory, the whole of it representing an investment of more than EUR 10 million. And the packaging manufacturers did not stayed away from the general movement! Lumson, which has almost doubled in size in five years (the company's turnover has increased from 49 million euros in 2013 to 96 million in 2018, an average growth of 15% per year), has invested heavily to increase and modernize its production capacities. The company now has brand-new headquarters in Capergnanica, in the suburbs of Crema, together with a state-of-the-art facility dedicated to the production of technical components (mainly airless and atmospheric pumps), and a fully automated warehouse. In June 2019, the production capacity has been increased to135 million pieces, compared to 90 million pieces previously. Two years after the acquisition of Lepolast, a producer of packaging for lipsticks and glosses, Lumson has recently strengthened its make-up business with the acquisition of Marino Belotti, a company specializing in the production of compact cases and other powder boxes. To achieve this transformation, the network of Italian suppliers also had to adapt its capital structure. Mainly family-owned, companies in the beauty industry have gradually opened their capital to investment funds, some of which have sometimes acquired a majority stake. In a context where the global make-up market seems to be slowing down, the Italian industrial fabric can still count on the flexibility of its network, also made up of a multitude of small companies, capable of manually processing small quantities or complex orders. An agile and flexible structure which, combined with a remarkable creativity and product knowledge, is one of the main assets of this cluster."

This new transaction is part of a long series of external growth operations for KDC/ONE over the past four years. Most recently, the company acquired California's Benchmark Cosmetics Laboratories, France's ALKOS Group and the manufacturing operations of UK's Swallowfield."
Le Rouge Français opens new era for natural lipsticks,"Le Rouge Français was born from the will to preserve the sensorial properties of conventional lipsticks without giving up on the naturalness consumers want and get from the organic makeup segment. ""The problem was, according to our research, both offerings could be questioned. For example, although it is banned from food, titanium dioxide is accepted in conventional formulas, and mica is tolerated in organic products, although it is a mineral, i.e. a non-renewable resource whose extraction involves unethical practices. So, to us, it was obvious we had to go farther,"" explains Salem Ghezaili, President and Co-founder of the company. The founders decided to work on a 100% renewable, 100% natural grape-based formula with natural colourants derived from tinctorial plants. ""These plants have been used in textile dyeing for tens of thousands of years, and if Cleopatra used certain pigments like sorghum from the Nile valley for lips, it was never really exploited in makeup,"" adds Salem Ghezaili. The products are composed of 95% organic ingredients and 100% natural ingredients, they are Cosmebio and vegan-certified and contain rice wax rather than beeswax to fix pigments. In line with their initial idea, the founders have added a high-end dimension to their offering. ""We aimed at showing that we could reach the sensoriality of conventional lipsticks in terms of texture, long wear, and coverage, as well as a higher degree of naturalness than most organic-certified brands,"" explains Salem Ghezaili. The unctuous formula rich in shea butter and vegetable oils and waxes is endowed with skincare virtues thanks to its moisturizing properties. Free from any tattooing effect, it lasts as long as a standard lipstick – about four hours. The shade created by the tinting power of plants gives the visual impression of a more natural product with a satin-like appearance. The packaging is also in line with the brand's values, with its Ecocert-certified, 100% recyclable monomer-based transparent case. In addition, the brand makes it possible for customers to collect used packaging with a prepaid envelope and directly send them to recycling companies. For this end of year, Le Rouge Français launches a capsule collection adorned with leather-looking cases made of apple skin, an alternative to animal skin with the same finish and sensoriality. ""Compared to other plant-based skins, apple skin offers a higher biosourced proportion and a better resistance over time,"" explains Salem Ghezaili. Case cladding is handmade by a Patrimoine Vivant-certified craftsman. The collection will be released in December: it will be available for €45, compared to €35 for the standard version. About fifteen new colours will be added to the first three by the end of the first quarter 2020. ""The colour range may seem too reduced, but we do defend this minimalism. Working with nature also means accepting to have less wide a shade offering,"" concludes the Director."
Marvinpac merges its cosmetics business with Strand Cosmetics Europe to form a leading beauty supplier in Europe,"Already partners within the joint-venture MS Swiss Cosmetics, France's Strand Cosmetics Europe and Switzerland's Marvinpac are creating MS BEAUTiLAB, a new entity resulting from the merger of Strand Cosmetics Europe and the cosmetics business of Marvinpac. Their aim is to create ""one of the European leaders in the beauty and well-being sector."" With three production and filling sites in the Czech Republic, in France and in Switzerland, the new entity also aims to provide more flexibility and agility to its customers. The Chinese sourcing entity may also support primary and secondary packaging projects for Full Service offers. Effective as of 1st January 2020, the merger is targeting a consolidated turnover of EUR 100 million by 2024. The group employs more than 250 people in Europe (France, Switzerland, Czech Republic), the USA and China. ""The only player to offer full-service made-in-France and made-in-Switzerland beauty solutions wants to conquer the hearts of French, Swiss and international brands with its innovative product, concept and technology strategy implemented within the framework of an eco-responsible approach,"" explain the two companies in a joint statement. Under the joint management of Eric Bouvier, current CEO of Strand Cosmetics Europe, and Ludovic Hericher, CEO of Marvinpac, MS BEAUTiLAB will be structured into two specialised Business Units: MS Advanced Skincare Solutions, headed by Camille Schmit Deroin, for skincare, and Strand High Tech Color Cosmetics, headed by Denis Richard Orliange, for makeup. ""Each Business Unit is structured around four departments - Project, Product Marketing, Sales, R&D - facilitating the detailed analysis of the target market and its trends, a collaborative internal and external agile work mode and relevant and personalised recommendations,"" writes the release. The creation of two Business Units should help to increase the specialisation of the staff in order to deliver more expertise, creativity, innovation and reactivity with a view to addressing the time-to-market, robustness, and performance demands of the group's clients. ""There is specialized make-up equipment, particularly in the French site, but all of the facilities are available to each of the Business Units and production operations will be organized according to customer priorities: schedule, volume, origin requirement (made in France, Swiss made, etc.),"" Éric Bouvier and Ludovic Hericher told Premium Beauty News."
Cosmetics giant Shiseido gambles on 'Made in Japan',"The Japanese cosmetics industry faces huge competition not only from global and established players such as L'Oréal and Estée Lauder but increasingly also from the ""K-beauty"" craze coming from South Korea. Nevertheless, Japan is more than holding its own, with exports nearly quadrupling since 2013 to 546 billion yen (US$5 billion) last year, according to finance ministry figures, nearly two-thirds of that going to China and Hong Kong. The so-called ""J-beauty"" is also benefitting from an explosion of inbound tourism in recent years ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics - in particular a relaxing of visa requirements for Chinese tourists who lap up the latest Japanese cosmetic fads. Shiseido chief executive Masahiko Uotani told AFP that a focus on the high end of the market and time-honoured attention to detail set them apart from the foreign brands seeking to dominate globally. ""We are focusing on prestige, premium brands. Consumers in those categories see the value of Japanese culture,"" said Uotani. ""So strategically, we are telling consumers: those brands are from Japan, it's Japanese R&D. And that is becoming a very important competitive value."" In addition to the new plant in Otawara, Shiseido plans to open two more in Japan before 2022 - a total investment of 120 billion yen - the fastest pace of expansion in the firm's 150-year history. Otawara's mayor said the plot for the new factory had been barren since the 1990 tech bubble burst. ""We used to use it to hold exercises to prepare for natural disasters,"" Tomio Tsukui explained. The 1,000 jobs it creates will make Shiseido the biggest private employer in the town, Tsukui said, putting it down to a drop in value of the yen that has made relocalising production more profitable. Norio Tadakawa, Shiseido production manager, has a different explanation. ""There are six sake breweries"" around Otawara, he says. This is due to the high-quality water around the region - also a fundamental component in making cosmetics. The three new Shiseido factories in Japan will feature the latest in Japanese tech - from advanced robotics to artificial intelligence - but will also rely heavily on human intervention, especially for the highest-range products. ""Where it's possible we are introducing robots, AI, and digital production capacities. But we still need people, employees that have high craftmanship and skills,"" said Uotani. In Otawara for example, while machines fill the bottles, lines of employees in white, blue or pink overalls fix the tops - there are too many different types of container to automate this process. Despite the highest labour costs, Shiseido is not the only company to bring back production to its home base. In 2017, Kose Corporation sold its factory in China to boost its presence in Japan. The gamble on high-cost, high-quality domestically produced goods appears to be working, said Mitsue Konishi, senior innovation analyst at GlobalData. ""With quality ingredients, luxurious formulations, elegant packaging, and craftsmanship, cosmetics with the 'Made in Japan' tag are gaining appeal in Asian and Western markets,"" she told AFP. But the flip side of Japanese attention to detail means development times and quality checks take longer, pointed out Shima Yamanaka, analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities. ""The product timeline of Japanese companies is very long. Safety and quality are high but the product checking takes a long time,"" she told AFP. For example, Japanese firm Kao on Wednesday unveiled a ""spray-on skin"" they claim is the world's first but that took 10 years to bring to market. Even Shiseido's Uotani admits that the nimble South Koreans have the advantage on this front. ""They are good competitors... They are quite efficient, their development time is quite short, which allows them to be very reactive to the market,"" he said."
"""The perfume offering for the general public needs to evolve in the years to come,"" Nathalie Cetto, perfumer, Givaudan","Premium Beauty News - The My Bloom project was born under the impetus of Arnaud Guggenbuhl, Givaudan's Global Head of Marketing Fine Fragrances, who aimed to explore new creative and olfactory horizons. Nathalie Cetto - Exactly. It all started from a study which revealed that 44% of women in France, and 50% in the US did not identify with the seduction image conveyed by the perfumes currently positioned on this segment, nor did they - on the other side of the olfactory map - with fresh waters and other sanitized fragrances. The current offering is too dichotomous, whereas these women dream of a fragrance that would talk about them and highlight their personalities. Like an extension of their own selves. Opposite transforming trails, there are perfumes that reveal an intimate part of us. As a result, Arnaud Guggenbuhl, our Marketing Fine Fragrances Director, made the NYC and Paris teams work on the idea of a reassuring perfume that would unveil a bit of us. Premium Beauty News - What did the experience actually consist in? Did you have a brief or any specific constraints? Nathalie Cetto - Not at all, we were totally free! It was definitely a new experience for us: usually, we work in collaboration with an evaluator, a sales rep… It was a valuable exercise, because we were the only ones to formulate and decide when the product was ready. It was a ""personal"" approach, but we could also exchange and share with the different teams at the evaluation and presentation sessions… We were given carte blanche from an olfactory standpoint, but it does not mean there were no technical constraints. Arnaud Guggenbuhl put an emphasis on the idea of fluidity and atmospheric diffusion, so we focused on heart and base notes and selected floral, woody, and musky accords… Premium Beauty News - Why such a requirement? Nathalie Cetto - Well, our work consisted in creating the opposite of a ""blitz"" fragrance designed to seduce as soon as the top notes emerge. On the contrary, we were guided by the idea of a perfume slowly revealing itself to wrap its wearer for the whole day. A powerful presence expressed in full transparency. These conditions require adopting a different formulation method. For a bestseller, you mainly work on top notes; here, we paid more attention to the heart and base. In a way, this writing method reflects how society has evolved. The advent of self-service distribution channels, twenty years ago, had an impact on formulation, with perfumes that seduced with their top notes, especially within a context saturated with powerful smells. It is widely known that these selective channels are now losing ground. The public favours more intimate approaches through online discovery or testing in niche stores. The way in which the system is questioned requires inventing other ways to structure fragrances. Premium Beauty News - What did the perfumers' work result in? Nathalie Cetto - About thirty of us took part in the project – there were 80 proposals, all in all. At the evaluation session, five main themes naturally stood out: rebirth (or resilience), self-acceptance (""self-love""), light, the skin, and transcendence (or disembodiment, in a way). About fifteen creations were eventually selected and classified by theme. Premium Beauty News - Including Romy, one of yours. Nathalie Cetto - Of course, it is a reference to actress Romy Schneider, but it is also a way to talk about me, because I accept my taste for smoking. And I think certain perfumes are more compatible than others with the smell of cigarette on the skin, hair, and clothes, so I wanted to work on this idea. I had recently come across sublime pictures of Romy Schneider lasciviously smoking during the never-completed shooting of L'Enfer, by Clouzot. It gave me inspiration for a dark, chypre, spicy, smoky, musky perfume… a very Feminine perfume both inspired from an actress and revealing the smoker in me. This fragrance was presented in the theme ""self-love"". Premium Beauty News - I also remember La Disparition, an intriguing perfume… Nathalie Cetto - Absolutely, this fragrance by Marion Costéro is inspired from the eponymous novel by George Pérec. She played with raw materials she was not familiar with and which, just like the book, did not have any ""E"" in them. Then, she uploaded the ingredients in Carto, our AI software. The result does exhale a very peculiar sensation of absence everyone noticed in the dark, woody, smoky notes perfectly conveying the idea of disembodiment, our fifth theme. Premium Beauty News - Does this experience open new doors for creators? Nathalie Cetto - It involves other ways to compose and structure a perfume, but on the other hand, it also marks the beginning of decline for the sweet trend, to the benefit of more subtle notes, like musks. The success of For Her Pure Musk by Narciso Rodriguez or Idôle by Lancôme perfectly illustrates this evolution. These perfumes more easily create loyalty, women come back to them more easily – they are less likely to favour ""zapping"". Premium Beauty News - How did the experience end? Nathalie Cetto - It ended with an ""olfactory Tinder"": a dating T-shirt. We opposed seven of our creations to two benchmarks on the women's market by asking men for their opinion about a perfumed T-shirt worn by women. Four of them won against the two references, and three won against one, which is very encouraging. To these men, the My Bloom perfumes were more mysterious and revealed a more cheerful, authentic personality. This creative method is similar to what is done in niche perfumery. That is why, the offering intended for the general public needs to evolve in the years to come. As aromatherapy is seducing an increasing number of people and new gestures are emerging, My Bloom is perfectly in line with the perfume-skincare trend. This search for fluidity and intimacy should, at last, be attractive for the Asian market."
Skincare brand Bulldog will go on sale in mainland China while retaining cruelty-free status,"Mainland China requires beauty products to be tested on animals by law, making it impossible for brands to retail in the region and retain cruelty-free credentials. However, Bulldog - which boasts a Leaping Bunny status awarded by Cruelty Free International - is taking part in a special project launched by Cruelty Free International in cooperation with Knudsen & CRC, Shanghai Fengpu Industrial Park and Oriental Beauty Valley. The agreement means that Bulldog products will not face animal testing in China, but will instead have their formulas manufactured in the UK, before the product is filled in the the Fengxian manufacturing zone, south of Shanghai. ""We are delighted to see one of our Leaping Bunny-approved companies come through the pilot project to successfully enter the Chinese market,"" said Michelle Thew, CEO of Cruelty Free International, in a statement. ""Huge congratulations to Bulldog for showing commitment and leading the way. We know there is great demand from consumers in China for cruelty-free cosmetics. This is an amazing opportunity not only for Bulldog, but for consumers in China and for the future of the whole beauty industry."" ""Even with the temptation of the huge Chinese market, we decided that we would never compromise our stance on animal testing,"" added Bulldog Skincare founder Simon Duffy. ""It is fantastic that this scheme has allowed us to enter mainland China while maintaining our cruelty-free status. We hope the success of this scheme will pave the way for more international cruelty-free brands to sell there."" The cruelty-free movement has been gaining traction in the beauty industry in recent years, with several major beauty brands eliminating animal testing from their practices. These include the Unilever-owned skincare and haircare giant Dove, which was awarded cruelty-free status by PETA last year, and the Coty brand Covergirl, which received the same status from Cruelty Free International last November."
"""Brazil is a country that is extremely important for L'Oréal Group's strategy,"" Patrick Sabatier from L'Oréal Brazil","Premium Beauty News - L'Oréal is celebrating its 60th year in Brazil. How important is the country for L'Oréal Group? Patrick Sabatier - Brazil is the fourth largest beauty market in the world, the second in fragrances and third in hair colouring and sun protection. We have been in Brazil for 60 years, sharing beauty with our consumers. When it comes to beauty, Brazilian women are the most demanding in the world. All of this makes Brazil a country that is extremely important for L'Oréal Group's strategy. Premium Beauty News - Brazil is a very diverse country. There are different types of hair and an even larger variety of skin types. How is it to work in a market like this? Patrick Sabatier - It is a challenge and, at the same time, a big opportunity. Brazil is an open laboratory due to its diversity, and the country has a key role in the cosmetics market. In our country, we have eight types of hair that are listed by L'Oréal, from the straightest to the most curled. Brazilian women have the most complicated hair routine in the world: they use five different products every day, while French women use three on average. Out of the 66 skin tones registered by L'Oréal, 55 can be found in Brazil. This ethnic and cultural diversity has inspired L'Oréal for 60 years. That is why we have invested in research in the country for over 10 years and, two years ago, we opened a Research and Innovation Center in Rio de Janeiro - our only center in Latin America and one of the six L'Oréal research hubs in the world. It confirms our long-term commitment to Brazil and it allows us to quickly launch innovations that Brazilian consumers desire, potentially launching them globally. It also allows us to adapt global innovations to Brazilian consumers. Premium Beauty News - Four business divisions of L'Oréal are in Brazil. Is there any that stand out with best-selling products? Patrick Sabatier - We have performances and innovations that stand out in every single one of the four business divisions in Brazil. There are 20 iconic multi-category brands, for every hair, skin and beauty type. The Active Cosmetics division leads the market of dermocosmetics with brands like La Roche-Posay, Vichy, Skinceuticals and Cerave. In the Consumer Products division, I highlight our iconic brand L'Oréal Paris. The brand kick-started our journey in Brazil in 1959 with Imédia Cream, a hair dye that is popular among women to this day. We also have Niely, a national brand with over 30 million consumers that aims to make beauty care more democratic. In our Luxe division we grew strongly - two digits - in a very competitive market thanks to brands such as Lancôme, Giorgio Armani, Ralph Lauren and Yves Saint Laurent. In this sector, we lead in female perfumery with Lancôme's La Vie et Belle and we recently launched Idôle - from the same brand - that has been selling well. Finally, there is the Professional Products division, with L'Oréal Professional, Kérastase and Redken. Redken was a brand built through the relationship with beauty salons and it now has an omni-channel strategy - going from beauty salons, to e-commerce platforms and kiosks in shopping malls. Premium Beauty News - Among L'Oréal's innovations in the country is the launch of Episkin. How will it work? Patrick Sabatier - Episkin is already fully operational in our Research and Innovation Center in Rio de Janeiro. In September, in order to contribute to making alternative methods a reality in Brazil, we opened the Brazilian subsidiary of Episkin. The brand is a world leader in reconstructed skin. We then made this innovation available to other companies in Brazil, so they can assess the safety and efficiency of new ingredients and products without testing on animals. Premium Beauty News - The company is also investing in a plant in São Paulo. What is the goal? Patrick Sabatier - L'Oréal Brazil is investing so it can have a 4.0 industry in São Paulo, with digitalizing, automation, augmented reality technology and artificial intelligence to optimize the production process. Together with our global program Sharing Beauty With All, we are also investing in our plant's sustainability. We currently buy 100% of our electricity from renewable sources for all of our locations in Brazil. The next step is to install solar energy panels in our São Paulo plant, just like we did with our Research and Innovation Center in Rio de Janeiro."
Coty takes controlling stake in Kylie Cosmetics for USD 600 million,"The USD 600 million deal will give Coty ""overall responsibility for the portfolio's development, leveraging its global knowledge and capabilities in R&D, manufacturing, distribution, commercial and go-to-market expertise, as well as its deep understanding of the fragrances, cosmetics and skincare categories,"" according to a press release. It is a major milestone for Jenner, who made her entry into the beauty arena back in 2015 with the launch of what was then 'Lip Kits by Kylie' and was renamed Kylie Cosmetics the following year. The brand has made an estimated USD 177 million in net revenues over the past 12 months. Named third most influential global beauty personality in a recent study from Cosmetify, Kylie Jenner counts 151 million followers on Instagram, making her one of the world's 10 most followed personalities of the social network, together with soccer player Christiano Ronaldo, singer Ariana Grande or her older sister Kim Kardashian. Her strong presence on social networks has greatly contributed to the success of her brand. The move will see Jenner and Coty work to transform the business into a ""global powerhouse brand,"" with a focus on global expansion and entry into new beauty categories. According to Coty, Kylie and her team will continue to lead all creative efforts in terms of product and communications initiatives, building on her unrivalled global reach capabilities through social media. Coty will have overall responsibility for the brand's category expansions, such as skin care, fragrance and nail products, leveraging its capabilities in R&D, manufacturing, distribution, commercial and go-to-market expertise. ""This new partnership between Kylie and Coty is an exciting step in Coty's renewed emphasis on its beauty business. Kylie is a modern-day icon, with an incredible sense of the beauty consumer, and we believe in the high potential of building a global beauty brand together,"" said Peter Harf, Chairman of the Board, in a statement. The deal came at a time when Coty has met some difficulties in integrating the assets of its recent acquisitions, including those related to the take-over of Procter & Gamble's beauty businesses in 2015 for USD 12.5 billion. Coty recently announced its intention to refocus on its fragrances, cosmetics and skin care through the divestment of its professional beauty business and its activities in Brazil."
Reload: The Brazilian brand that wants to change the game in beauty packaging,"""A plastic bottle takes 600 years to decompose at sea, but we use it for no longer than just 20 minutes,"" says Teodoro Bava, Commercial Director at Reload Beleza Positiva. The Brazilian cosmetics company is the first in the world to reuse mineral water bottles to package its haircare products. ""We came up with this idea while assessing how products are currently consumed and disposed of,"" adds Bava. The company was first launched in 2013 but underwent a complete overhaul last year and now focuses heavily on sustainability. ""We repositioned Reload to challenge old, unsustainable market models and provide a new option for consumers who are concerned about their health and the environment,"" says Bava. Reload thus collaborated with mineral water company Água Mineral São Lourenço. They proceeded to map out the establishments where Água Mineral São Lourenço's products are sold, such as bars, hotels and restaurants, and later started collecting disposed water bottles from them directly. The company then developed and patented a new sanitizing technique to clean all collected bottles, which are then reused to package Reload's products. At the moment, only two products in the company's portfolio are sold packaged in reused water bottles - a shampoo and a conditioner. Both of these products are all-natural and vegan, as well as sulphate- and parabens-free with an exclusive fragrance developed by Givaudan. Prices vary between R$ 60 to R$ 70 (about 14 and 17 US dollars) for 300ml bottles, putting them in the high-end category in Brazil. ""With this launch, we were able to confirm Brazilian consumers' willingness to pay more for a product that has high performance, but is environmentally friendly."" The shampoo and conditioner, as well as a kit containing both products, are available for purchase at Reload's e-commerce website. Bava says that the company is currently in negotiations with gyms, natural product stores and beauty salons that share the company's values, meaning its products. For instance, the company's products were recently launched in some Mundo Verde stores in São Paulo. ""We will also include a company display at each of these locations so that consumers can correctly dispose of Reload's product packaging,"" explains Bava. ""The bottles will be put through the sanitization process again, being reused once more after the process is completed. Should the packaging be damaged in any way, it will be sent to a recycling facility."" Reload does not intend to limit this new offering to two products and is looking to scale up things. ""We have exciting projects to launch new products and lines, all of which will be packaged in reused bottles,"" explains Teodoro Bava. ""This model is at the core of Reload and we refuse to change the way we are. We have entered this new market to show we must rethink production and consumerism."""
Natura wants to grow globally while maintaining its sustainable ethos,"For João Paulo Ferreira, the group's CEO, one of the main reasons for Natura's success lies in Brazil's huge biodiversity, particularly in the Amazon region, where the group has forged partnerships with local communities to extract natural essences. ""The Amazon is a global heritage. We are lucky to benefit from it as a large part of the forest is in Brazil,"" said the leader, who received AFP at the group's headquarters, near São Paulo, the economic capital of the country. Natura ""has shown that it is possible to combine economic progress with the protection of the environment,"" said Ferreira. Such remarks are far from being innocuous in a country widely divided by the environmental policy of President Jair Bolsonaro. This notorious climate sceptic has provoked much controversy because of its intention to promote the expansion of agribusiness and mining activities in the Amazon, where deforestation and fires have increased sharply in recent months. ""Let's hope that when this moment of polarization is behind us, we will succeed in fostering dialogue"" between government, landowners, traditional communities and NGOs, Ferreira adds. Natura's head considers the activities of the company have contributed to protect 1.8 million hectares in the Amazon region, ""almost half of the entire surface of the Netherlands."" As an example, Mr Ferreira points ucuuba, the fruit of an Amazonian tree also known as baboonwood or wild nutmeg (Virola surinamensis), which is part of many of the group's products. According to the CEO, picking this fruit has tripled the income of local communities, without cutting any tree. ""It shows that it is possible to create wealth from the forest while leaving it standing,"" he insists. According Paulo Branco, a researcher at the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV), ""Natura faces a constant dilemma: how to continue with a strategy of growth while respecting the ecosystems and local communities?"" Mr Branco considers that Natura is ""a pioneering company"" in Brazil. Natura's founder, Luis Seabra, opened his first store in 1969, and the group took off on a direct sales model. Today, the Natura&Co group is established in 73 countries, with 32,000 employees around the world, including 6,600 in Brazil. In 2018, the group achieved a turnover of 13.4 billion Brazilian réais (approximately USD 3.7 billion at the annual average conversion rate), an increase of 35% compared to the previous year. Net profit, however, fell by 18% to 584.4 million réais, mainly due to the absorption of the debt of UK's The Body Shop, that Natura took over in 2017. In May, Natura acquired Avon, another iconic brand originating from the United States. Once this transaction is approved by the shareholders of both groups and by the anti-trust authorities, Natura&Co will become the world's fourth largest seller of cosmetic products, lagging just behind France's L'Oréal, US's Procter & Gamble and the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate Unilever. This expansion was welcomed by investors at São Paulo's Stock Exchange where the share price of the Brazilian group is currently twice as high as one year ago. ""Ten years ago, 95% of our business was in Brazil. But during this decade, we have experienced strong growth in Latin America and a third of our sales now take place outside Brazil,"" highlighted the CEO, who does not hide his ambition to transform its company into a leading global player."
Polo Tecnologico della Cosmesi: An Innovation Day dedicated to sustainability,"Premium Beauty News - Why do you think this new edition will stand as a real turning point for your association? Matteo Moretti - First of all, because of its growing success! Last year's edition really exceeded our expectations and now we can feel it's a real dynamic that is building up over the months. This also obviously explains the rising number of members to our association. And this year's conferences programme, that we recently released, is already a huge success in the entire cosmetic sector both in Italy and abroad. Among the highlights, the presence of several high-profile personalities from major brands such as L'Oréal, Coty, Sephora. A day dedicated to the environment, where the emphasis will be placed on the major challenges that await the packaging and formulation industries. Premium Beauty News - Your Association has nothing to compare with in the world! Matteo Moretti - That's true! To my knowledge, we are the only Association in the world that represents only the cosmetic industry, ""industrially speaking"", from the design stage to the manufacture of machines and of cosmetic formulas including packaging, accessories, etc. Most of the other organizations also integrate the downstream part of the sector, i.e. Brands and Distribution. However, I think it is important for this industrial sector that we represent, to retain its autonomy and independence, while collaborating, of course, very closely with all of its customers. Premium Beauty News - Will you take advantage of this 4th edition of the Innovation Day to present new projects? Matteo Moretti - What is important for an association like ours, aside from the truly significant relational benefit our members can draw from, are the other ""services"" that the Polo della Cosmesi must also propose. We are not a big association which implies, among other things, a number of budgetary constraints. We must find solutions which are consistent with the means at our disposal and, as much as possible, develop these means. And everyone knows that unity is strength. This is why we have, for example, entered into discussions to reach a cooperation agreement with another French association very similar to ours in its functioning and its economic approach: the Cosmed, and this, concerning several areas, particularly on the regulatory field. Our event of October 29 will be the opportunity to describe its key aspects. Premium Beauty News - Any other plans for 2020? Matteo Moretti - Yes, of course! It is most likely that our annual event will take place in another venue. Probably in Milan..., and this with other partners. We also intend to be much more present in terms communication with the creation of a new website supported by a series of regular newsletters. We also plan to organize more themed meetings and not just in Italy. Information and registration: www.poloinnovationday.com"
"In memory of Hubert Varlet: ""A Great Man!""","It is impossible to not remember Hubert Varlet! He was born on February 27, 1946 in Paris. After graduating from Sup de Co Paris and Insead, he met Michèle, whom he married in 1969 before leaving for the Ivory Coast the following year to do his military service. In 1971 he joined the export department of the BSN Group and later became Commercial Director of the Bottle Division. He stayed in office twenty years. 1971 is also the year when, the Pochet Group, under the impulse of the two sons of Charles Colonna de Giovellina, Henri and Jean, dared take the shift of modernity by deciding to build, in the French site of Guimerville, a fully automated line for the production of glass bottles. The investment represented at the time, one year of turnover. The encounter between the Colonna family and Hubert Varlet eventually took place 14 years later. Hence in 1985, the Colonna family who had immediately recognized the exceptional commercial skills of this man with a strong personality all agreed on the fact they had to convince Hubert to join the Pochet team. This was done a few months later on October 1st, 1985! Thereafter, the story of the Pochet Group is the proof that they were right. From this complicity and complementarity emerged, exponentially, with the support of a team of motivated collaborators and technicians, what became the world reference for luxury bottles. Hubert Varlet stay in the Group for 27 years and ""Uncle Hubert"" will in no time become a member of the family. In 50 years, he will have worked for two companies only... ""It was certainly the finest example of sheer commercial talent one could dream of,"" explained Irène Gosset, now President of the Group and daughter of Henri Colonna de Giovellina. ""Relentlessly, Hubert travelled the world and build, as only he knew how, very close and personal relationships with customers. He and Gabriel Colonna, son of Henri, who joined the Group in 1983 will form a winning pair. Many customers who knew him well admitted that it was a real privilege to do business with him"". In a nutshell, ""he had the knack for relationships!"" ""What was fantastic about him, was his ability to not talk straightforwardly with a customer of the reason why he was actually visiting him, (i.e., to sell him bottles), but to focus more on the evolution of the global market and of the retail sector that he knew like the back of his hand. He spoke on an equal footing with the Presidents of the world's leading beauty brands. But, in the end, he sold much more than just bottles. He was promoting the Pochet Group and its excellence. He knew the market better than anyone,"" was keen to point out Thierry de la Fléchère, former Sales Manager for France. During these 27 years of collaboration, the Pochet Group changed a lot. The strategy of internationalization, focused more particularly on the United States, Brazil and Asia, and which was initiated by the Colonna family as early as the 1970s, was quickly taken over and managed by Hubert Varlet. Hence the Group entered the very closed circle of world glassmakers capable of achieving the most astonishing prowess and of taking up the biggest technical challenges. Challenges that no one was afraid of in the Group, including of course Hubert. He was also instrumental in Pochet's decision to diversify in 1991 in the plastic processing sector with the creation of Qualipac, and by reinforcing this business unit through additional acquisitions or creations, such as Priminter, Qualipac's two Chinese sites, Qualiform, IPEL in Brazil, Lisi Cosmetics. ""But on the other hand, being late at a meeting was not an option and even less of having not worked sufficiently on the agenda of the meeting. No one was more punctual and demanding than Hubert! He always wanted to get to the bottom of things and he had the knack for saying the right words at the right time,"" clearly remembered Thierry de la Fléchère. ""In terms of interpersonal skills, Hubert was the king! He was flamboyant! But he knew how to put himself in the position of his interlocutors,"" explained Isabelle Lallemant, Group Marketing and Innovation Director. ""I remember the day when we received an award at Luxe Pack Monaco for our CSR approach. He managed to convincingly talked Prince Albert of Monaco into visiting the stand of the Group he then immediately took him to."" ""Unquestionably, he impressed people with his charisma,"" highlighted Astrid Rutkowski Mauduit who spent some 17 years in the Pochet Group before creating her own cosmetic brand. ""What was striking about him was that he could be both very demanding and benevolent with his colleagues. A commercial meeting with Hubert always took the form of a ritual gathering where personal failure was not an option. But his great strength was also his ability to listen to his colleagues and of course to customers."" ""Eventually 'Hubert was very Pochet' or it was 'Pochet who was very Hubert'. As you know, Customer Commitment became one of the Group's four cardinal virtues. We have made it a strategic priority for our development,"" said Irène Gosset, President of the Group. ""The history of Pochet is one of unwavering commitment for the success of our customers. It cannot be denied that it is under his impetus that we now have a customer-centric organization, with a dense network of contact points thanks to which we are able to meet very different requests by providing tailor-made answers."" Concerning the Pochet Group's other cardinal virtues, which are described at length in its corporate charter, and can fully apply to Hubert Varlet... That of Excellence first, with a capital ""E"" where Hubert Varlet, like the Group, made a point of standing out through the absolute quality of its achievements and the uniqueness of its know-how, at the crossroads of art and industry. That of Customer Commitment, which we already talked about. That of Consideration, which is a strong term, it's a mixture of respect, esteem and benevolence that reflects our vision of the Group and of the world. Aware that the Group owes its success to the involvement of everyone, Hubert Varlet, like the Group, wanted employees to feel listened to, and valued in their work. So he left us on a 1st of August. There were many people attending the Mass given in his memory, end of September in Paris, France."
Sand & Sky: The A-Beauty pioneer brand who is taking the world by storm,"Inspired from the Australian way of life, A-Beauty could be defined as ""beauty made in nature, not the lab"". It is effortless beauty that starts with great skin with at its heart the natural ingredients that are unique to Australia: Pink Clay, Kakadu Plum, Finger Lime just to name a few. It echoes the ""clean beauty"" trend as formulas are usually free from ""nasties"" and natural where possible. A-beauty is about easy-to-use products and fuss-free routines that deliver visible results, fast. Witnessing a growing hunger for all things Australian, twin sisters Sarah and Emily Hamilton had a simple goal: to put A-Beauty on the map. They set about creating an Australian botanical skincare brand that worked, while embodying the legendary Aussie laidback lifestyle and fun-loving personality. The result is Sand & Sky, launched in April 2017 with a now-cult, even sold-out last year, Australian Pink Clay Porefining Face Mask. Sarah explains: ""The detoxifying powers of clay are well known, and we knew that we wanted to start with an Australian-made clay mask. Our Head of Product, Sam, went on a bush medicine course in Alice Springs and learned so much about native Australian ingredients and their benefits. She explained the power of Australian Pink Clay, alongside the purity of the Australian environment and these gorgeous ingredients - like Kakadu Plum and Old Man's Weed, would push results beyond typical clay masks. And our testing process showed immediate results that backed this up"". Sand & Sky avoids crazy claims, indecipherable ingredients list, and 10-step regimes. The brand aims at keeping things as simple as possible with effective, clean and easy-and-lovely-to-use Australian botanical products that give a holiday skin. ""Our collective experience in living in New York, London, Berlin and Basel told us that the international audience wanted natural products produced in pristine environments, most specifically, Australia,"" says Sarah Hamilton. Claimed to be sourced from ""the purest environment on earth"", and combined with a series of Australian botanical ingredients, Australian Pink Clay has been designed to ""absorb dirt and impurities, drawing out toxins and combating pollution,"" in order to ""restore the skin's natural defence shield and instantly shrink and refine pores"" while being ""gentle on sensitive skin"" and ""non-drying."" ""We've seen first-hand how the Aussie accent immediately paints a picture of sandy hair, glowing skin and life by the beach... That all seems like a great way to live, and a perfect cocktail when creating an effective and fun product,"" states Emily Hamilton. The success of Sand & Sky contributed to accelerate the growth of A-Beauty in the global skincare market. Two years after its creation, the brand has become the leading direct-to-consumer A-beauty brand and has built an impressive and engaged community of 480,000 followers across social medias."
China: Pechoin or the resounding return of a sleeping beauty,"Pechoin has come a long way. The brand founded in 1931 in Shanghai, handicapped by a dated image, nearly disappeared from the market. Today, the Chinese business magazine Cyzone (创业 邦) ranks it first in the list of China's heritage brands (across all categories) with annual sales estimated to 17.7 billion yuan (2.26 billion euros). Advertising has been a particularly effective lever for repositioning the brand. In 2017, Pechoin launched an animated digital series for people to follow on their phones, staging an elegant Shanghainese female spy on a secret mission in 1931. In the same spirit of empowerment, the commercial Four Angry Beauties recounted, in a humorous tone, the rebellion of women breaking the codes of imperial China. ""Pechoin's campaigns are deeply rooted in Chinese history, triggering strong emotional resonance among consumers,"" analysed the Cyzone magazine. In early 2019, Pechoin launched a joint operation with Hey Tea, a young Chinese chain store specialized in tea (including cheese tea and fresh fruit tea), on the theme ""The Republic of China (1912-1946)"". The aesthetics and climate of the time inspired more particular the creation of Hey Tea x Pechoin gift sets, as well as special menus in Hey Tea boutiques. Decorated with phonographs and old trunks, a bus in the colours of the operation welcomed visitors in a setting recalling the nostalgic atmosphere of old Shanghai. Currently very common in China, this inter-sectoral collaboration, did not lead this time to the creation of a new product, as was the case with the Milk Candy Flavoured Lip Balm from the heritage brand White Rabbit, a result of its partnership with the Chinese skincare brand Maxam. Pechoin has also managed to take advantage of Chinese shopping festivals, among which, the Singles Day on November 11, launched by the Chinese Internet giant Alibaba, by leveraging on KOLs (Key Opinion Leader) specialized in beauty. ""These influencers were chosen for their ability to 'zhongcao' (种草). This term, which means 'planting the seed of an idea in the mind of the consumer' is currently very popular among Chinese marketers,"" explained the Chinese marketing agency ParkLu. These KOLs posted videos of them testing Pechoin products while sharing their first impressions. These actions enabled Pechoin to be the best-selling cosmetic brand at the Singles Days 2018. ""127 KOLs referred to Pechoin, reaching a spectre of 143 million followers, leading to more than 160,000 engagements on online platforms such as Weitao, Weibo, WeChat, Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), and Douyin,"" ParkLu reported. According to the agency, by working with KOLs, Pechoin succeeded in transforming its image and win over young consumers, thus establishing a case study for other ageing brands seeking to reinvent themselves. On the lookout for trendy concepts, the brand launched new beauty masks ""'Little moments of joy"" (小 确 幸). In a context marked by strong growth in men's products (+51% in 2018 on the Tmall platform, which coined the era ""Male Beauty Era""), the offer also included a Pechoin Men's line. Pechoin also launched limited series of a box in the traditional Chinese style designed by Zhong Hua, Chief Designer at the Oriental Royal Jewellery located in the Forbidden City. ""The success of Pechoin shows the growing confidence of Chinese consumers in local brands,"" commented ParkLu. It also takes place in a context of declining attractiveness for Korean products, especially among younger generations. A trend that benefits Pechoin, known for its use of traditional Chinese plant-based ingredients. ""Beauty product addicts aged between 18 and 22 are particularly proud of buying Chinese brands,"" highlighted the South China Morning Post. The newspaper owned by the Alibaba Group refers to the study of the Business Intelligence Institute Gartner L2, according to which in December 2018, 72% of Chinese brands used the keyword Made in China in their list of products sold on the Tmall platform, against less than 50% the year before. Does Pechoin have projects outside China? Its recent membership to the International Federation of Societies of Cosmetic Chemists (IFSCC) could be an indication pointing in that direction. Moreover the IFSCC awarded the 2019 Maison G de Navarre Young Scientist Award to Yan Liu, chemist at Pechoin, for his work on the skin microbiome."
Roos & Roos keeps growing and unveils new fragrance,"Premium Beauty News - Why change the brand name? And why Roos & Roos? Chantal Roos - We had chosen the name of Dear Rose as a way to keep telling new stories, because to us, ""Rose"" both refers to a first name and a mythical flower. The problem was, customers thought all our fragrances were based on rose, when they were not. It could be confusing and disappointing, so we decided to review our story. And what regularly stood out from customer insights was that our brand was marked by femininity. Two women, mother and daughter, with both complicity and differences, a complementary vision with a contemporary touch – that is not so common on the market. And it is really our point of difference. So, the brand became Roos & Roos. Premium Beauty News - So, what is Roos & Roos today? Chantal Roos - Roos & Roos is composed of the original range of five 100 ml Eaux de parfum for which we have just launched the 50 ml size. There is also the Exclusifs range – still created with perfumer-creator Fabrice Pellegrin, of Firmenich –, a line of six fragrances which goes even farther in our search of raw materials and sophisticated packaging designed by artists. Also, we have just launched two new Oud-based perfumes to meet demand from the Middle East, a market on which the brand is already successful. Lastly, the new fragrance named Pale Blue Eyes, as a reference to the mythical hit by The Velvet Underground, was created by Dominique Ropion and will be launched in late September. It is both radiant and sensual. Premium Beauty News - What is the brand's main strength? Chantal Roos - We have been working with a perfumer-creator as part of our constant search for new raw materials, which we systematically combine with others, and for new ideas. For example, we won a Fifi Award for the Mentha Religiosa fragrance, a most surprising, innovative association of peppermint and patchouli & incense as base notes. Our strength also lies in how we work, in what both of us bring to the other, depending on her experiences. Alexandra is very creative, she is an artist. For example, she is the one who found the names of our fragrances, often in relation to her musical world. She can move me out of my comfort zone, out of my story. It is a mother-daughter duo; it is not always that easy. She had to find her own place, and I had to learn to say ""you're right, I got it wrong"". Premium Beauty News - Beyond products, what are your next developments, export-wise? Chantal Roos - We launched a fundraising campaign a year ago, which helped us increase our workforce and recruit a sales manager to get global. So, we have just entered several markets in the Middle East, in Qatar, Kuwait, Lebanon, Dubai, and Saudi Arabia. We are also present in Europe through distributors in Italy, Switzerland, Germany, the UK…We have ongoing projects in the US and we are expanding in Russia, where we had already partly settled via the L'Etoile niche brand points of sale. And of course, our fragrances are available in France, at the Bon Marché department store, as well as in a beautiful selection of niche perfume stores. The other big investment is aimed to gain fame, which will depend on the work done by our people locally, in every country, with the press, in social media, etc. In some countries, our distributors have their own press attachés. In the others, we recruited them. The Web is also an issue on which we have been working – our website has already much evolved. Premium Beauty News - Given your experience, how do you view conventional perfumery compared to niche perfumery, which you chose with Roos & Roos? Chantal Roos - At the time of my first launches with Yves Saint Laurent, Opium or Paris, for example, there were only few launches and distribution only involved perfume retailers and a few department stores. Then, distribution changed a lot, as chains like Sephora and Marionnaud emerged, and brands created an increasing number of new fragrances. We can almost talk about overabundance, perfumes tended to smell like one another, and as soon as the 2000s, women turned to what was soon called niche perfumery. Now, the risk is that too many niche brands may emerge, but as usual, consumers are those who choose, especially given the growing influence of websites. Fragrance Innovation Summit Chantal Roos will share her expérience and vision of the fragrance market during the Fragrance Innovation Summit, on 7th November 2019 in Paris.

Anjac Health & Beauty sets up in North America with the acquisition of Cosmetix West,"Anjac Health & Beauty continues its offensive external growth strategy and consolidates its cosmetics offer. The Californian company could be a key asset for the French group to expand in several growth markets, including Clean Beauty. ""We are pleased to expand our know-how in such a dynamic and influential region for our key markets. Great opportunities and synergies are opening up to the Group,"" said Aurélien Chaufour, General Manager of Anjac Health & Beauty. The business of Cosmetix West (about US$40 million in 2018), which develops skincare products for numerous indie and historic brands in North America, allows Anjac Health & Beauty to strengthen its position in the cosmetics and dermo-cosmetics sectors, in addition to the offer of the group's other entities in this sector: Sicaf, Shadeline, Eurowipes and Feltor Laboratories. This acquisition also provides the group with new opportunities to expand its product offer to address new consumer expectations that have become essential for cosmetic brands, such as Clean Beauty - in other words, transparent, minimalist and efficient cosmetic solutions that emphasize naturalness - as well as men's grooming, or Japanese-inspired cosmetics known as ""J-Beauty"". Located in the Los Angeles area, Cosmetix West has acquired an extensive know-how in the formulation, development, manufacture and filling of skin, hair care and hygiene products and fragrances, developed in various galenics. Thanks to its capacity to innovate and adapt, the company has been able to attract many major indie brands to its customers line up. This is the fifth acquisition in less than two years for Anjac Health & Beauty. This external development strategy allowed the group to double its turnover between 2016 and 2019. Anjac Health & Beauty now includes ten companies and 14 R&D and production sites in the fields of health, hygiene, beauty and nutritional supplements: Innovi, Chemineau, Feltor Laboratories, Shadeline, SICAF, LPEV, Euro Wipes, Aircos, Pascual Cosmetics, and Cosmetix West, for a turnover of 280 million euros expected in 2019."
Aircos is structuring itself and sets course for North America,"Recognized above all for its expertise in the manufacture and packaging of make-up powders (free, compacted or multi-compacted powders, or back-injected powders), Aircos has seen its sales jump from 13.5 million euros in 2015 to 25 million (forecast) in 2019. A performance linked, according to Thomas Sirot, Commercial Director, to ""the success met by the formulas designed in-house, in particular powders developed thanks to our IPM [1] back-injection technology, which allows obtaining a new generation of formulas, which are a lot more creamier and with a high content of nacres, but also to the concomitant opening of new export markets"". Today, exports account for 47% of the company's sales (mainly to the United States and the Middle East). The company offers its customers operating mainly in premium and luxury segments, eye and complexion products, blushes, bronzers and also body powders, but Aircos also knows how to hot-fill lipsticks, glosses and concealers, using formulas made by partners. To meet a challenging growth, Aircos integrated, at the end of 2017, the Anjac Health & Beauty Group and invested both heavily in its production tool with, in 2018, a 50% increase in the size of its make-up site in Romorantin, dedicated to the manufacture of powders, and in the construction of controlled atmosphere rooms, not to mention the acquisition of new equipment for the Ardon site, near Orléans, more specifically dedicated to packaging production. ""Today we have a fleet of 35 injection machines. We mostly manufacture custom products, but due to high demand, we are starting to offer standard products in ready-to go mini formats. We are actually going to expand our standard offer to better meet the expectations of brands,"" specified Thomas Sirot. In total, more than 6.5 million euros have been invested over the last three years (2017, 2018, 2019) mainly in new equipment and for the plant expansion, with the aim of obtaining the ISO 22716 certification (Good Manufacturing Practices in Cosmetics) in the first quarter of 2020. To note that the company currently has two R&D laboratories, one in Paris, focused on innovation, and the other in Romorantin, which specializes in the industrialization of new formulas. ""We are investing heavily in formulas. At the level of Aircos and of the Anjac Health & Beauty Group, where Innovation Committees meet suppliers, share their information on raw materials, on processes,"" emphasised Thomas Sirot. ""We recently launched, under the name Crystal Fusion, formulas mixing creamy and matte textures, as well as matte powder bases with a very strong metallic pay-off"". The teams were also beefed up with the arrival of Philippe Proust, (formerly Sanofi), who took over the management of the Romorantin plant in November 2018, of Nathalie Soulard, who was appointed Supply Chain Manager in February 2019, and of Éric Hoisnard, former Nuxe Packaging Development Director and who was appointed Project Development Manager in January. Finally, to meet the expectations of the marketplace, Aircos has engaged since mid-2018 in a CSR approach led by Frédéric Lancesseur, CEO of the company. A strategy structured around three pillars : More sustainable products, a positive contribution to the territories, and the development of employees. ""In a context clearly oriented towards naturalness, the creation of more sustainable products is undeniably a key strategy. This involves a sustainable purchasing policy, a 'clean formulation' offer based on an Aircos list inspired by the Cosmos label. We can also offer natural formulas to customers wishing to go one step further in the area. In our laboratories, we master and adjust the level of naturalness in our formulas, as of the conception stages. We are also focusing on the eco-design of our products and packaging,"" detailed Thomas Sirot. At a time when brands, especially young emerging and promising start-ups in North America, rely more and more on their suppliers but with rising levels of requirements, the integration of Aircos in the Anjac Health & Beauty Group has helped consolidate investment capabilities and meet the challenges of a rapidly growing market along with a strong international development. Next stage? ""A sales office backed by new production resources in North America,"" revealed Thomas Sirot. More information on the above will probably be disclosed at the upcoming MakeUp in New York trade show, next September 11 and 12, 2019, where Aircos will present its new products to its American customers."
"pH fragrances: ""Towards a premium and clean perfumery""","""We are positioning ourselves as the first Luxury and Clean perfume brand in France,"" explains Camille Le Feuvre, founder and President of pH fragrances, a young niche brand created in December 2018. The brand currently proposes a line of eight fragrances developed exclusively with Givaudan and available as eaux de parfum (15ml and 100ml and boxes), candles and detergents. A range of products for the body (deodorants, shower gels, body creams) is in preparation. ""What we had in mind was to offer a complete universe made of exceptional fragrances which could be found in every day to day products,"" says Camille Le Feuvre. To state its difference regarding its societal and ecological approach, pH fragrances adopted ultra-restrictive specifications in terms of formulation, which the brand has imposed to all its suppliers across all product categories. ""We have banned all ingredients regarded as toxic, harmful, controversial, both in the personal care and home care lines,"" confirms Camille Le Feuvre. Overall, the brand has selected ""the finest qualities of naturals and perfume ingredients, as respectful as possible to the environment and human health."" However, because natural substances were favoured, not all allergens could be removed from the products, while remaining of course within the regulatory framework. For each application (fragrances, candles, detergents, deodorants, creams, shower gels) specific requirements, more stringent than the regulations in force, were also defined. Thus, phenoxyethanol, SLS, SLES, BHT, BHA, formaldehyde ... have been banned from the personal care formulas. Finally, for candles and detergents, the aim was to present ""clean labels"", that is to say: with no warnings or risk pictograms such as: ""environment hazard"", ""health hazard""; no labelling such as: ""may lead or cause long-term adverse effects"", or ""toxic to aquatic life"". Warnings, which are actually not found on cosmetic packagings, which fall under another regulation, but whose total elimination is a first for home care products. ""Of course, with respect to this level of innovation, it was impossible to use catalogue formulas. We had to start from scratch. More than two years of Research and Development were required to reach this level of innovation,"" explains Camille Le Feuvre. Especially since the brand only wanted to use a single formula for each of the eight fragrances in the range, regardless of the medium for which it was intended. ""Only choosing to rely on a single and unique scented oil for each fragrance in the personal care range and one oil for the home care range was a real technical feat and a major environmental plus"". This innovative approach will also be used as part of the future concept store. In addition to its policy in terms of drastic selection of ingredients, the brand is also very committed at the environmental and societal level. ""The ingredients in each of our eight fragrances were also selected according to their level of sustainability. We focused more particularly on Givaudan's Orpur® ingredients, the finest of ingredients collected in an ethical and responsible way"". On the manufacturing side, pH fragrances chose local sourcing by working with 20 industrial partners based in the Paris region and in the south of France. ""Everything is ""Made in France"", including the packagings,"" insists the founder. ""We refuse to use plastic for our cases and packagings, because there is already too much plastic scattered everywhere on the planet and we want to place the emphasis on the products"". The tinted glass bottles pay tribute to the bottles traditionally used in perfumery, while protecting formulas that do not contain UV filters. The range has a very sleek design, in keeping with the apothecary trend, which reflects the care taken in the selection of ingredients. The brand, which is already sold in concept stores, in particular at Nous (previously Colette), in Paris, Geneva, Saint-Tropez, and soon Miami and Dubai, was also introduced to Parisian customers in the pop-up store La Fabrique, in the Paris Marais district, where it was met with great success, according to the designer. ""The customer feedback is excellent, 95% of people who smell our perfumes buy them. The Givaudan teams have managed to overcome these highly restrictive specifications, and achieve an outstanding technical and olfactory feat. The eight fragrances with eight different olfactory directions are of exceptional quality,"" she concludes. The brand now aims to develop itself in the United States, where the clean trend is very strong and, well beyond beauty, extends to the entire lifestyle; hence the brand intends to open its own concept store, where customers will be able to create, on the spot, their own products. Our architects have already drawn up the plans, now we need to find the right location... and investors! Fragrance Innovation Summit Camille Le Feuvre will introduce the pH Fragrance brand and concept at the next Fragrance Innovation Summit in Paris, on November 7, 2019.

Start-up: Be + Radiance complexion products go clean & inclusive,"With its very light, aqueous formula, the BelleRadiance cucumber water-based foundation by Be + Radiance leaves a thin, even, matte veil on the skin. The texture is perfectly in line with the yoga skin trend, which promotes discreet, but efficient textures for a flawless complexion without any makeup effect. The brand adopted a clean makeup approach consisting in banning all the ingredients suspected of disturbing the skin balance (silicones, mineral oils, perfumes, phenoxyethanol, nanoparticles…). To Aïmara Coupet, the brand founder, makeup is lagging behind in terms of clean beauty, compared to skincare or hair care. ""Consumers want to choose their beauty products in line with their lifestyles. They do sport to keep fit and pay attention to what they eat and what their skincare creams and shampoos contain, so there is no reason why they should not do the same with makeup. This idea of a 360° lifestyle coherence is a booming trend."" The brand already offers a range of foundation shades designed to meet the needs of all complexions. ""The core of inclusivity does not consist in taking part in a race for shades and references, but in including everyone from the very beginning, on a fair basis. The rainbow of the BelleRadiance foundation is composed of 15 shades equally representing the wide variety of skin tones,"" she explains. Already available in France in a dozen Monoprix stores, in pharmacies, and on beradiancebeauty.com, the brand aims to expand in the US and Canada, as well as in Asia. The first step for it involves showcasing products to North-American buyers at the Cosmoprof North America show on July 28-30, 2019, in Las Vegas. ""Our cucumber water-based foundation was selected for the final of the Cosmoprof North America Awards in the makeup category,"" rejoices Aïmara Coupet. Next fall, Be + Radiance will launch a silicone-free primer, followed by highlighters, blushes, and powders - of course, all of them will preserve the skin's microbiological balance. Already supported by ex-SIMP Alain Blondel's Montaigu Développement funds, the brand has launched a new fundraising campaign with an objective of 500,000 euros to finalize a comprehensive range and start developing on the global level, both physically and digitally, as part of a reasonable business plan which forecasts a 10-million-euro turnover in five years."
KDC/One continues to expand into Europe with the acquisition of Swallowfield in the UK,"Knowlton Development Corporation (KDC/One) continues its external growth strategy. Already the #1 subcontractor for the cosmetics industry in North America, the company, headquartered in Longueil, Quebec, continues to expand its manufacturing capabilities in Europe with the acquisition of the manufacturing business of the UK-based Swallowfield Group. The GBP 35 million transaction does include Swallowfield's owned brands division, which will now be based in Teddington and is expected to change its name to Brand Architekts Group. ""Following KDC/One's successful acquisition of Paris-based Alkos Group earlier this month, we are confident that Swallowfield's operations will further enhance our strategic presence in the region and solidify our leadership in beauty, health and personal care around the world,"" explained Nicholas Whitley, President and CEO of KDC/One. With more than 140 years of experience, Swallowfield is an established leader in the personal care and beauty space. Swallowfield's Manufacturing business focuses on the development, formulation, and supply of products for customers which include many of the world's leading brands.

Tim Perman will remain Chief Executive Officer of Swallowfield's brand business to be renamed Brand Architekts Group."
The Bogart Group finds balance in retail,"Premium Beauty News - How does a group of perfume and cosmetics brands, like Bogart, ends up doing retail? Nicolas Dewitte - The whole group's strategy results from its history. The Bogart Group was founded in 1975 and quickly developed on the global stage. Year after year, the company grew by acquiring perfume brands, like Ted Lapidus and Balenciaga – we sold the latter to Kering 20 years later. Today, The Bogart Group counts four perfume brands (Jacques Bogart, Ted Lapidus, Carven, and Chevignon), two skincare brands (Méthode Jeanne Piaubert and Stendhal), and April, the multi-segment brand specialized in skincare, makeup, and bath products. We gradually developed the R&D part, and then purchased more and more perfume and cosmetics/makeup plants in France. We have adopted a very integrated model, with our plants, laboratories, and R&D, so it was only natural to add retail. We aim to become a significant player in selective beauty. Premium Beauty News - How is this distribution activity doing today? Nicolas Dewitte - Fifteen years ago, The Bogart Group purchased 20 April stores in Israel, so we tested this manufacturer/retailer model at that period. Now, we have 42 April stores there, 32 stores in France, 87 points of sale in Germany, with the HC network, and since November 2018, we have reached 200 points of sale in Belgium, through the Planet Parfums and Di networks, which are very well-established in this country, in addition to six new perfume stores in Flanders, since May. Then, we have also just partnered for three years with the Printemps department store, starting with Metz, France. It is materialized by an April perfume corner offering the main selective brands on the market, including the group's brands, so we benefit from a significant traffic to reach a broader range of customers. Premium Beauty News - Are you considering making it the main activity of the group? Nicolas Dewitte - Our positioning is that of a perfume and cosmetics manufacturer-retailer, but it is true that for the first time this year, with 370 perfume stores, our turnover in stores will have exceeded that of the ""brand"" activity. Overall, our turnover will reach about 300 million euros for the year 2019. We have managed to develop a model which works well in terms of profitability. It is an outstanding tool for us to develop the best products and brands, and best meet consumer expectations. Premium Beauty News - It is a bold challenge within the current context in selective distribution. How can we explain these particular dynamics? Nicolas Dewitte - We highlight the broadest offering possible, with our products, of course, but also with other groups' brands. But what characterizes us most is that we are both a manufacturer and retailer, with the corresponding reactions that feed both activities. On the one hand, we listen to our customers' needs to develop an adapted offering. With 370 perfume stores, we listen a lot, and what is incredible is that we receive information directly from five different countries about how trends and consumer needs change, and then we can send it to our marketing teams and laboratories. This system is very fulfilling. On the other hand, the manufacturer's reflex involves a strong expertise on the part of sales teams in perfume stores, with people who really understand what an olfactory concept is, for example, as well as certified beauty and wellness professionals. We endeavour to share the industrial know-how of our R&D laboratories down to our stores, so that our customers feel this particular listening skill at April perfume stores. We have a special quality in France, which we are not always aware of: we have highly specialized advisors. It is definitely in our interest to develop this French standard. It makes us stronger and more demanding in other countries. The development of partnerships with prestigious brands is a strong area of development for the group (as can be seen with Hermès in Israel, for example). And we pay attention to any other proposal that might help develop our network, in particular in Europe. Premium Beauty News - Is this how you view sales in French stores? Nicolas Dewitte - We believe there must be a very strong bond between manufacturers and retailers. Our growth will depend on smart partnerships with real cosmetics experts working for brands to both have a broad, complete offering and target particular areas. For example, the latest Carven perfume, Dans Ma Bulle, reached the Top 5 in April perfume stores in several countries after a few months, alongside heavyweights, like La Vie Est Belle and J'Adore. It just shows that by showcasing a brand with very qualitative work, even if it is an alternative brand, we can do outstanding things with customers who love discovering a different way to create perfumes. Clearly, by developing a broader offering, we can reach a different range of customers. The main thing is to keep paying attention to customer expectations. Premium Beauty News - How do you think things are going to evolve? Nicolas Dewitte - Retail and e-commerce will merge. Everyone predicted the end of retail when e-commerce boomed, and yet although it is a huge rise, it will not actually replace retail. The real trend is that they will merge. E-commerce functions, like re-targeting, are better and better used in physical stores, and data transmission will also come from points of sale. Everyone thought data would come from the web, through significant traffic, but inside stores, there is already a lot of precious information about consumer needs and behaviour: it will complete a whole system. Retailers like April, who will adapt to these changes to serve their customers, have a role to play. We aim to accelerate our e-commerce growth, so we just relaunched the www.april-beauty.com website a month ago, in France."
Nippon Shikizai relies on innovation to conquer the global makeup market,"While the Japanese company will celebrate next year the 90th anniversary of its foundation in Japan in 1930 and the 20th anniversary of its establishment in France, it has given itself the means to achieve its new ambitions with a sharp increase in its production capabilities in France and Europe. ""Today our formulas are used by many very different brands all over the world, from Asia to Europe and including the two American continents,"" states Kouji Okumura, the group's chairman. ""Our strength is really to be recognized as the R&D specialist for the manufacture of cosmetic formulas, and this for many years. We have the capacity to understand the needs of brands and propose them the formulas they were looking for."" The company has taken full advantage of the recent revival of the J-Beauty (as made in Japan cosmetics are usually dubbed). ""Japan is once again the main creativity hub in Asia,"" said Leïla Rochet Podvin, CEO and Founder of trend agency Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation. Over the past five years, the group's turnover has nearly doubled to reach USD 110 million in 2018 (from USD 63 million in 2014). Export sales, the main driver of the company's growth, have increased by 44% over three years, especially towards China which accounts for 34% of the Nippon Shikizai's turnover. To meet this demand and maintain its leadership, Nippon Shikizai has accelerated its investments. Thus, more than USD 30 million were earmarked over the 2018/2020 period, mostly to increase the bulk production capacity in the Tsukuba factory, which had already benefited from significant investments between 2014 and 2017, with the construction of a new facility for the packaging of makeup products. It should be noted that this factory was approved by the U.S. authorities for the production of OTC products. The group also recorded strong growth in Europe, where the it has been present in France since 2000, when it acquired Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics. After an investment of EUR eight million over four years to modernize the production tool and standardize the production techniques dedicated to ""pharma"" and cosmetic products, the turnover of Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics jumped from EUR 9 million in 2014 to EUR 20 million in 2018 and profitability was up to expectations. An impressive growth followed in 2017 by the acquisition of a second French company with a staff of 35 employees, Orléans Cosmetics (now Nippon Shikizai France), specializing in the manufacture of make-up powders, hot-poured products and scented derivatives. A company in which the group, in line with its strategy, invested in 2018 and 2019 nearly one million euros, with the commissioning of new lines dedicated to compaction, the filling of loose powders, hot filling, not to mention the creation of a new cleaning room and new blenders. The aim: modernize the entire machine pool and quickly increase the production capacity by 30%! Beyond production capacity, R&D is at the heart of the investments made by Nippon Shikizai. Today, the group employs more than 60 researchers in cosmetic formulation and some 40 engineers dedicated to the design of manufacturing and filling lines and more generally to all industrial processes. The group's best known formula is the famous Warm Water Washable mascara, which is resistant to both tears and humidity but can be removed under warm water. Over the last ten years, more than six million units of this formula were produced each year serving the many Asian brands that adopted the solution. Introduced this year on the U.S. market, the formula is already a hit among American consumers. To complete his makeup ranges, which still account for 85% of its sales, the group presented at the Cosmoprof show in Bologna a complete range of products designed to protect the skin against the harmful effects of the blue light generated by the screens (mobiles, computers) that have invaded our daily life. The continuation of the group's international development strategy should lead to new investments in the United States and Asia. ""As you know, cosmetics are not just about trends, they are closely influenced by the cultures and traditions of each country and region. And we must absolutely take these facts into account for our effective and successful development,"" concludes Kouji Okumura."
"Schwan Cosmetics: ""We are much more than pencils makers""","Premium Beauty News - You are 43 years old but as you take on these new responsibilities, you are not really a ""newcomer"" in the company! Tomas Espinosa - Not really, you are right! I am of Mexican origin and, as such, I have worked for Schwan Cosmetics as Managing Director in my country for ten years. So, I know the company, its products and its assets. As you know, this Mexican base does not only produce make-up pencils that account for 50% of the activity, it is also specialized in cocreation development with mayor brands to bring their unique brand DNA with our expertise which is way more than pencils. Premium Beauty News - Could you, first recall what makes the DNA, strength and therefore the philosophy of Schwan Cosmetics. Tomas Espinosa - The DNA and the history of our company are punctuated by innovations. More than 90 years ago, we invented the cosmetics pencil and since then we are constantly thinking ahead. What is important for us is that, whether you are a fledging start-up or a well-established brand, , we develop, in close cooperation with you, custom solutions that are perfectly tailored to your target groups. And it's very important to us that current and future generations can consciously experience beauty. That's why we create products that combine quality, aesthetics, and responsibility. But what is just as important today is our desire to harvest from our expertise in formula and process and broaden our product offering by developing a real ""eco-system"" with partners, particularly in packaging. That allows us to ensure a real differentiation. Always with the same motto: ""Desire, Performance, Quality, Safety"" Premium Beauty News - Could you give us an overview of your company and its position in the cosmetic market with you some figures? Tomas Espinosa - It is easy! We have the trust of 700 brands in 70 Countries and more than half a billion women annually worldwide. We continue to develop region, brand, climate and skin specific textures- Eyeliner in China, eyeshadow in South Africa, lip gloss in Brazil…, we have the perfect solution for any demand. People from over 30 nationalities work for us. Together we have one mission: To create sustainable, innovative products that excite consumers all over the world. Worldwide there are about 3,000 dedicated employees working for us. And we have 9 production facilities around the globe to guarantee sustained production and short supply routes. Premium Beauty News - In a few months' time a new Schwan Cosmetics has emerged? Tomas Espinosa - Yes! We can say that we are adapting ourselves to a world that is changing extremely quickly. Who could have predicted the sudden and impressive emergence of all these new brands? Who could have predicted the overwhelming influence of Social Media and of influencers? And, most of all, so quickly. Still, the pencil remains and will remain an essential feature on the cosmetics market. Schwan Cosmetics allows to design a cosmetic line just the way the customer wants it, down to the finest details. Our 360° customizing-approach that zeros in on a brand's individuality offers one-of-a-kind products, formulas, and packaging that are tailored to the needs of our customer. But today, that's no longer enough anymore. This is why, with the collaboration of partners, we also offer new"" product solutions"" that help the brands specific USP and, above all, other packaging solutions. Premium Beauty News - The environment is also a challenge for your industry. How do you address it? Tomas Espinosa - Well yes, it is a challenge but we also see a big opportunity for a new wave of disruptive innovation. We have started this journey some years ago and we now offer a full range of more sustainable products. To bring transparency to our effort, we are part of the Sustainable Packaging Initiative for CosmEtics - SPICE - which is an initiative that brings together organizations in the cosmetics industry to work towards a common goal: to collectively shape the future of sustainable packaging. SPICE develops and publishes business-oriented methodologies and data to support resilient decision-making to improve the environmental performance of the entire packaging value chain. At Schwan Cosmetics, we have been working hard on this issue and will continue to do so in the future."
Pierre Fabre consolidates presence on the Brazilian dermocosmetics market,"The Pierre Fabre group started exploring the dermocosmetics segment in Brazil in 1999, with Eau Thermale d'Avène, their flagship brand. ""It is a complex country, but dermocosmetics involve a positive combination of factors,"" explains Philippe de Carvalho. ""Dermatologists play a significant prescriptive role, so we had to convince them. Then, women consumers are very actively involved, so they expect results, and there is also a large network of 70,000 pharmacies, which represents an important distribution capacity."" In 2006, the group sped things up, by acquiring the Darrow Laboratório brand, a renowned oily skin specialist. This operation helped Pierre Fabre lay its hands on a strong sales network and on an industrial site on the outskirts of Rio. As a complement to the Darrow lines, the group invested to produce a few Avène ranges locally and adapt them to the market's specific sensorialities, while asserting its leadership in terms of oily skin prescriptions. ""The issue of oily skins, or skins perceived as such, is typically Brazilian. Apart from hygiene, here, the beauty routine also includes photoprotection. So, we pool our expertises in these fields to offer a healthcare solution that is also a deeply cosmetic product combining an oily or acne-prone skin treatment and a safe sun protection,"" explains Anne-Laure Gaudry. Starting from 2012, the work done by the group's medical visitors with Brazilian dermatologists gave a further boost to the development and reputation of Pierre Fabre products. The fact that healthcare professionals contribute to raising awareness of the risks of sun exposure oriented the market towards products guaranteeing both quality and safety. Today, sun care represents a third of the country's dermocosmetics market. With Mat Perfect, a photoprotection product specially designed for Brazil, Eau Thermale Avène offers a dry skin feel (toque seco), a 12h matte effect, and an SPF up to 60. ""Another major trend requires offering matching shades. Mat Perfect is available in a white/colourless version, or with concealing pigments,"" adds Anne-Laure Gaudry. In Brazil, like all around the world, the formulation of Pierre Fabre sun products complies with the group's strict guidelines. Mat Perfect is actually based on a unique, minimalist technology involving only four filters, excluding oxybenzone, which do not penetrate the skin barrier for more safety and protection. In Brazil, Pierre Fabre also banks on A-Oxitive, the anti-ageing Avène line enriched in vitamin C. If anti-ageing is not one of the most popular claims in Brazil, vitamin C is widely appreciated by consumers, and the company relies on their interest in efficient radiance-enhancing solutions. ""We highlighted one of our global gems, i.e., a cutting edge technology which protects the active and releases it in the dermis, to develop a product that matches local expectations and satisfies the criteria we use all around the world. The advantage of a research centre based in the country itself lies in its local dimension,"" emphasizes Anne-Laure Gaudry. The BIC should make it possible to launch ten new products a year, the first being expected for July 2019, regarding the Darrow ranges intended for Brazil, and the Avène ranges designed for the whole Latin American market. On a more global level, Pierre Fabre is also present on the huge Brazilian hair segment, with Ducray, the expert in hair dermatology. And in the field of body care, new launches are under study at Darrow: the Nutriol line of moisturizers will offer consumers a more affordable dermocosmetics option. ""Here, we comply with the group's international quality standards using the same equipment, while acting as a research arm for the world. Brazil is a source of inspiration for Pierre Fabre, in particular for its biodiversity. Our expertise is already a reference on the global level,"" explains the Director of the Centre, which already counts twelve employees, including three exclusively dedicated to formulation. Sun protection, oily skins, hair care, body care… Thanks to this new research and development centre, the Pierre Fabre group benefits from a strong tool to consolidate its presence in Brazil."
Canada's KDC/One acquires France's Alkos Group,"If you remember: In March 2018, Nicholas Whitley, CEO of the KDC/One Group, had announced in an interview to Premium Beauty News that after acquiring five businesses in three years, he was targeting a twofold increase in sales in the next coming months, adding that the billion dollar target in revenues was in sight and that the next steps for external growth could very well be in Europe and Asia. Meanwhile, in June 2018, the Alkos Group was inaugurating its brand new Inter Cosmétiques factory in Angers, France. An investment of 12 million euros including buildings over a surface area of 17,000 m² on a site of 46,000 m² (three times the surface of the previous site), R&D laboratories (800 m2) and administrative premises (900 m2). This investment enabled Inter Cosmétiques to increase its manufacturing capacity by nearly 40%, and to leverage on a bulk manufacturing workshop boasting the best international standards, while also gaining in competitiveness through a consolidated service offer. A year later, this acquisition by the Canadian Group becomes a reality! For Nicholas Whitley, CEO of KDC/One, ""the Alkos Group is deeply rooted in the cosmetics industry and has an unparalleled reputation for innovation and product quality. Its customer-centric vision will give KDC/One strategic access to the European market and to unique technologies that will strengthen our leading position in high-end beauty products. We look forward to working with the Alkos team and with our partners at Cornell Capital in order to leverage on the entire product portfolio, further diversify our customer base, and seize cross-selling opportunities benefiting all stakeholders involved."" And for Gérard Gieux, founder and owner of the Alkos Group, ""thanks to KDC/One, the Alkos Group will have access to the financial resources it needs to continue making the investments that will help strengthen its strategic position in the market. The Group is excited to enter new markets and continue to offer quality products to its current and future customers alongside a trusted partner who shares its values, in order to grow its business in the long-term."" Over the past six years, the Canadian group KDC/One, headquartered in Longueuil, Quebec, has undergone a significant transformation, mainly through successive acquisitions across all sub-contracting beauty sectors. The Group, which achieved sales of $ 950 million, employs some 4,800 people in Canada and the United States. Indeed, the KDC Group (Knowlton Development Corporation) has quite a track record! It all started in 2002 with the creation of the Emballages Knowlton Company, with a staff of 300 people and sales of $ 80 million. In 2003, the Novacap Investment Fund took control of the Company. The first acquisitions took place in 2007 with Tri Tech Laboratories and Body Blue Inc. But it is really in 2014 that things started gaining momentum with the launch of the Novacap Industries IV Fund, which gave the Group the means for its expansion. In January 2015, KDC acquired ChemAid Laboratories Company, a formulator and manufacturer of skincare, hair care and bath and body care products located in Saddle Brook, New Jersey. On October 14 and 21 of the same year, KDC acquired the Kolmar Laboratories and Acupac Packaging Companies to the Kolmar Labs, a New York formulator and manufacturer of make-up and skincare products, as well as Cosmetic Technologies, a Californian cosmetics contract manufacturer; an acquisition which allowed the Canadian Group to gain a foothold on the West Coast. The external growth momentum continued with the takeover, on November 16, 2016, of the Thibiant International Company, based in Chatsworth, California, a formulator and manufacturer of personal care and skincare products. On November 9, 2017, KDC took over Aromair Fine Fragrance, a full-service Company specialised in home fragrances, based in New Albany, Ohio. One month later, on December 12, KDC officials announced the acquisition of Northern Labs, a contract manufacturer, located in Wisconsin, specialising in liquid, gel, lotion, and paste products dedicated to personal and home care markets. And to further state the message according to which KDC/One is committed to be the leader and a showcase when it comes to innovations, the network of companies launched a state-of-the-art Innovation Lab in the summer of 2018 in Saddle Brook, New Jersey. In November 2018, KDC/One joined forces with Cornell Capital, a private equity firm with offices in New York and Hong Kong, to expand its international growth, invest in high-end product innovation and strengthen its production resources. Cornell Capital LLC is a U.S. private investment firm with $3 billion of capital under management. With offices in New York and Hong Kong. ""Partnering with strong and entrepreneurial management teams,"" detailed the release, ""the company takes a value-oriented approach for investing in the financial, industrial and consumer sectors."" Henry Cornell, the former Vice Chairman of Goldman Sachs' Merchant Banking Division, founded Cornell Capital in 2013. With the Alkos Group, KDC/One now operates thirteen production units in North America and France and employs more than 5,200 people for sales totalling more than $ 1 billion. In 1996, Gérard Gieux set foot in the formulation and manufacture of cosmetics products with the acquisition of Alkos Cosmétiques, a French manufacturer of make-up pencils, previously named Conté Cosmétiques, owned by the BIC Group. In 2008, Gérard Gieux founded the Alkos Group following the acquisition of two other French companies, Inter Cosmétiques (make-up and skincare products) and Sagal Cosmétiques (scented soaps and deo sticks). In 2014, to support an ambitious investment programme, he called on the MBO Partenaires Investment Fund, which had become the majority shareholder (51%) of the Holding Company (AAXEN). The latter included the Alkos Group and Cosmogen, a company specialised in packaging solutions and applicators, also created by Gérard Gieux in 1982. After a rapid growth of all these entities, in March 2017, the sale of Cosmogen (fully taken over by MBO Partenaires) allowed the Alkos Group to repay all of its senior debt and to consider continuing its investment programme by taking advantage of the construction of the new Inter Cosmétiques plant in Angers and of the development of innovative products. 2011 was a turning point for the French Group. Because, at the time, under the leadership of its new management team, both the image of a now full-fledged Group will be strengthened, and the products and services offer also considerably expanded. French and proud to be! ""It is not by chance if we wanted to assert our feeling of belonging to the long-standing expertise for the manufacture of French cosmetics, with our small Eiffel Tower at the centre of our communication,"" explained that year, Florence Lefeuvre, Group Sales VP, Marketing & Communication, in an interview to Premium Beauty News. Especially since this expertise of the Alkos Group is quite actual. First line of development at the time: reinforce the image of the Group in its own right, which concentrated on the one hand, the know-how of Alkos, the only manufacturer of made-in-France make-up pencils praised by export markets, and on the other of Inter Cosmétiques, specialized in the formulation and manufacture of cosmetics and skincare products and finally of Sagal Cosmétiques, a manufacturer of scented soaps and deo sticks. Second line: highlight the capacity for innovation and the full extent of the offer of these three entities: Make-up in all its texture forms, personal care products, scented soaps and deos. Third line: invest at the industrial level to sustain growth. A comprehensive and attractive offer combined with a ""product repositioning"" and industrial investments that will have borne fruit eight years later."
Arcancil goes green with a range codeveloped with Monoprix,"By jumping on the green bandwagon with a new vegan and committed range with a strong natural overtone, the French brand is back on the shelves of the French downtown retailer. ""The green movement is nothing new to Arcancil: we have already launched natural, clean and vegan references as part of our ranges, but this new opportunity with Monoprix was a way for us to create a new, much coherent specific line,"" explains CEO Anne Delleur Cabarrus. The formulas developed for Lab Végétal are free from any ingredient of animal origin. For example, in mascaras, beeswax was replaced by vegetable waxes, like carnauba wax. But beyond these simple substitutions, Arcancil endeavoured to remove certain controversial ingredients, without compromising on efficacy and safety. ""Our laboratories have designed formulas free from allergens, parabens, phthalates, and silicones D4 and D5, while maintaining the preservation quality of products,"" adds Alix Pélegrin, Brand Manager Arcancil Paris. In addition, a natural active highlighted on the packaging was added to every product to enhance performance in terms of comfort and gentleness, like cotton oil, aloe vera, tapioca, or camomile. The challenge was to preserve the brightness and intensity of Arcancil colours in a range of highly innovative formulas. ""Lab Végétal is not a nude range. It is an integral part of the Arcancil story, a brand specialized in intense makeup,"" emphasizes Anne Delleur Cabarrus. Arcancil Paris also integrated Lab Végétal to an ecoresponsible approach, by using recyclable kraft paper outer packs sourced from sustainable forests (FSC label) and reducing plastic with powder packaging increasingly made of cardboard. Lab Végétal also joined up to the 1% for the Planet association. Every year, Arcancil Paris will donate 1% of the Lab Végétal turnover to associations committed to environmental protection. So far, the range counts about fifty references. It will be available in about twenty Monoprix stores in Paris and across France starting from June 2019, but also on Amazon and on the Arcancil website. It will replace the selection of vegan products introduced by the brand last February, and new references are expected after summer and by the end of the year. By going green, Arcancil aims to recruit younger consumers. ""Monoprix attracts downtown customers in search of green cosmetics. Young customers are increasingly turning to natural products, and we know that is how they will enter makeup,"" concludes Anne Delleur. Apart from France, over the next few weeks, Arcancil will offer Lab Végétal in Monoprix stores in Luxembourg and test it on markets with a high demand for natural products: Europe, Canada, Australia, Tunisia, Morocco, and the French West Indies, among others."
"ELSI revisits Clean Beauty with a personalized, microbiome-friendly solution","The ELSI startup aims to shake up the American Clean Beauty model – they recently won the French-American Entrepreneurship Award. ""In the US, there is no dermocosmetics culture, like in France. So, we aim to help most consumers with a sensitive skin, because they feel a bit confused,"" explains Elsa Jungman, the brand founder. Launched last May, the moisturizing serum composed of three ingredients meets the demand of a community the brand identified over a year on Instagram, and which already counts 10,000 followers. The product is available online and has already been ordered in over 40 States. In return, the young entrepreneur collects consumers' data to get as close as possible to their expectations and set up the second part of the project. Following the model developed by Stitch Fix, a dynamic American startup which, every month, offers a range of clothing adapted to their subscribers' tastes in a box, based on a questionnaire, ELSI aims to collect data based on their users' feedback in order to offer skincare products adapted to sensitive skins and optimized depending on the issues, lifestyles, and seasons. As a complement, the company aims to conduct investigations on the skin microbiome of its ""love community"" of volunteers across the country. The startup has launched a fundraising campaign for its non-standard cosmetics model to develop over the next few months."
L'Oréal strives for transparency with 'Inside Our Products' platform,"""Consumers are changing their way of buying consumer products, and are asking brands to provide more transparent and clearer information on the composition of products,"" said the L'Oréal group in a statement. Each year, the brands belonging to the L'Oréal group - L'Oréal Paris, Kiehl's, Maybelline New York, Yves Saint Laurent Beauté, Lancôme and Biotherm, just to name a few - offer consumers a multitude of products, from makeup and face and body care to fragrance and sunscreen. L'Oréal has now launched a platform giving customers access to information about what's in the firm's cosmetics, the ingredients it uses, and the group's commitments to safety. ""Through this site, we are committed to transparently providing clear and honest information to our consumers, based both on our in-depth knowledge of cosmetic ingredients inherited from more than 100 years of research and on recognized scientific realities,"" says Hervé Navellou, General Manager of L'Oréal in France. The platform sheds light on to the way in which products are formulated and manufactured. Among the ingredients in the spotlight, L'Oréal focuses in particular on parabens, palm oil, sun filters, permanent oxidative hair dyes, silicones and mineral oils. Each ingredient is accompanied by a detailed information page explaining its origin, its various uses, and, if necessary, the reasons why it may be questioned. Plus, the pages let users know how such ingredients are listed on product packaging for easy identification. L'Oréal also provides a contact form for web users' questions on the subject. The platform, which is due to evolve over time, is available in French and English. Many cosmetic brands are now questioning the best way to meet the new expectations of consumers. The launch of natural ranges, including certified organic products, was a first response, along with the launch of environment-friendly packaging. For instance, in 2018 L'Oréal launched Seed Phytonutrients in the USA, ""the most organic brand"" ever launched within the group. In the same vein, French luxury beauty house Guerlain (LVMH Group) has launched Bee Respect, a transparency and traceability platform for all its skincare products. Among others, the Bee Respect traceability tool provides consumers with the product composition, the sourcing and function of the ingredients, and the origin of the packaging materials: a first for the luxury cosmetics industry. There is every reason to believe that the trend towards more transparency will continue."
2009-2019: The Weckerle Group is celebrating at Eislingen ten years of growth of its Full-Service activity,"The plant was successfully integrated in the Group with its full expertise benefiting to all of its customers around the world. ""We use our own technologies to develop innovative product lines and our customers are very satisfied,"" had explained at the time Thomas Weckerle, CEO, ""And then Full-Service, at the start, a ""heavy trend"", became an essential and sustainable activity"", he added. The entire team at the Eislingen factory (250 people) can be proud of the gone through road. The growth of the Group's Full-Service activity has been particularly robust over the last five years, growing by more than 40%. First ""product"" category across all segments, the production of lipsticks followed by mascaras, foundations and skin care products. ""In the past years, we have repositioned both our products and our development strategies,"" explained Randolf Lehmann-Tolkmitt. ""It was also about rebalancing our customer portfolio by making the right choices."" Decisions that have paid off. Especially since, at the same time, the Group increased its R&D capabilities (15 people today), in packaging materials and storage areas that can now store 5,500 pallets. This is also the first plant to have integrated, last July, the new multistick filling machine ""MS3"" developed by Weckerle Machines. A series of investments that concerned almost all of the Group's filling activities, including more recently, the filling of jars. The ""powder"" activity is not left out either. ""Our goal is also to increase our foothold in this product range as well as in skincare,"" detailed Bernhard Starzer. Among the other strengths of the Eislingen unit: its expertise and notoriety in the manufacture and packaging of natural products and toothpastes. ""We focus on natural cosmetics because - for us - it is not a trend but a philosophy,"" emphasizes Randolf Lehmann-Tolkmitt. Taking advantage from their long-time know-how Weckerle Cosmetics is able to create client specific products that are certified. Talking about certifications: the site meets a very high standard. They hold for example the certificates of IFS and Ecovadis gold status. The commitment for sustainability results even in the fact that Weckerle Cosmetics is certified a climate neutral company."
Kao to debut Sensai in Japan as a first step to broader Asian launch,"Initially a local brand focus on Europe, Sensai is growing as a key asset of Kao's global portfolio of cosmetic brands. The Japanese group prepares to introduce the brand into the Japanese market in September 2019 before a Sensai debut in China in 2020 followed by an expansion of the brand throughout Asia. Launched in 1983, Sensai products are now sold in some 4,000 department stores and perfumeries in more than forty countries, mainly in Europe and the Middle East. All the products in the range are manufactured in Japan and are deeply rooted in the Japanese culture with Koishimaru silk as a key ingredient and skin care and make-up rituals inspired from the etiquette of the Japanese tea ceremony. Sensai will debut in Japan with 75 items already marketed globally. The core of the Sensai range in Japan will be the anti-aging care ""AS Series"" comprised of three products: beauty lotion, emulsion, and cream. However, Sensai's Japan debut will focus on the travel retail channel for overseas customers. Only a limited number of prestigious department stores as well as an official Sensai online shop will carry the brand domestically, announced Kao. ""Points of sale such as exclusive duty-free counters in Japan and other major hubs in Asia will strengthen Sensai in travel retail. Customers in China will also have the opportunity to purchase products before the launch in China through a cross-border e-commerce site from this autumn,"" states the group in a release. This decision follows the global reorganization of the group's brand portfolio announced by Kao in May 2018."
"""Clean Beauty is much more than natural or synthetic ingredients,"" Pierre Miasnik, Fiabila","Premium Beauty News - The nail varnish market has not escaped the natural trend, has it? Pierre Miasnik - Today, the green movement is much more than a trend. It is a structural, irreversible, universal shift that can be observed in all cosmetics categories. The younger the consumers, the more concerned they are with these issues. We have already invested a lot in research and development in this field: this year, Fiabila even offers 100% natural nail varnish – a real technical feat! Still, natural resins are not as effective as synthetic ones, which is why we have developed nail varnish that meets all consumer requirements in terms of colour, gloss effect, coverage, drying time, long wear, and application, and which contains 77% natural ingredients, no controversial substance, and a biosourced plasticizer patented in 2010. Again, it was a huge technological challenge! Premium Beauty News - Would it be wiser to talk about a ""clean product"", then? Pierre Miasnik - We need to be realistic in our approach. We aim to guarantee the safety of products, while minimizing their environmental impact. Naturalness at all costs is not the answer, so indeed, it would be best to aim at ""clean products"". Brands increasingly share this view, and it is actually gaining ground among consumers too, as can be seen with the rise of clean beauty in the US, and with the success of concepts like The Detox Market, or Credo Beauty. A synthetic product is not necessarily ""dirty"", just like a natural product is not necessarily ""clean"". Many synthetic compounds are absolutely safe for consumers and the environment, while not all natural raw materials are produced in a sustainable way – some are even harmful for health. We should not reject all synthetic products on principle, and neither should we be overoptimistic as regards natural products. That is what is interesting about the notion of clean beauty, and that is also what Credo Beauty express when they tell their customers that ""synthetic ingredients can be safe and sustainable, and natural ingredients can be harmful and non-sustainable"". The most important thing is to use ""clean"" raw materials which are harmless in all respects, but also a ""clean"" production tool. This aspect is often overlooked, and it is also the most complex to implement, given the associated costs. But our credibility is at stake here. Premium Beauty News - What have you implemented? Pierre Miasnik - As soon as 2001, we removed risky materials from our formulas, like formaldehyde, phthalates, toluene, etc., in order to work exclusively with ""clean"" raw materials with high purity levels. Our production sites are now free from any traces of toluene or formaldehyde. In addition, we invested a lot to prevent any cross-contamination or pollution in our raw materials. In 2015, we started to build secure, automated production units specially designed for nail varnish in France, the US, and Brazil. It helps us guarantee the purity level of the materials and products we deliver our customers. In practice, we rent six trailers on an annual basis, each one being dedicated to the transport of one raw material (resins, solvents, plasticizers…), and each raw material has its own storage and pumping system, as well as its own pipe system, including production reactors. We are the only nail varnish manufacturer to have fully ""clean"" plants exclusively focused on nail varnish, which means we are a good way ahead of our competitors. Lastly, we keep investing in R&D, and we have been making much progress with natural pigments, which do not cover the whole colour palette yet. Besides, we are doubling the surface of our laboratories on the French site of Maintenon. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, as far as innovation is concerned, what has Fiabila developed lately? Pierre Miasnik - Last March, we launched the Salon Prodigy innovation, an alternative to permanent gels without the drawbacks. This development was the next step after the Sun Prodigy nail varnish range. Its patented solution is based on the invention of an innovative oligomer which polymerizes under daylight to offer physical hardening properties and the flexibility of standard varnish, while providing a long-lasting result and a gloss effect beyond seven days. Brands still need to better convey this message to consumers, although these products have penetrated the market quite successfully, lately. On the other hand, we used one of our real patents on nitrosamines to produce an exclusive formula with extremely low original nitrosamine levels, in which we added an efficient patented inhibitor. In addition, we have noticed a rising demand for nail care products, so we have developed a full range specially designed for nail health. There is a real efficacy challenge to meet with these products. The future is clearly focused on more natural, sustainable, renewable solutions. Nine years ago, already, we registered a patent on a natural plasticizer. And this year, we created the first 100% natural nail varnish. Our research strategy is definitely oriented towards ever-greener, safer, more sustainable and responsible solutions, but without being dogmatic. If there is no safe, sustainable natural alternative to a ""clean"" synthetic substance, then we keep the synthetic one until we find a better solution. As a matter of fact, although there are still improvements to be made, applications like Yuka and Clean Beauty will play a major educating role in fighting against greenwashing."
France dominates the global beauty market but needs to adapt,"Two recent studies commissioned by the French Federation of Beauty Companies (FEBEA) highligh the global influence of the French cosmetics industry. On the occasion of its general assembly, the FEBEA unveiled a macro-economic study carried out by Asterès, an economic research and consultancy firm on the French cosmetics industry. This study was completed by an analysis by consulting firm CH2 Conseil which highlights the global reach of the French industry and its main assets while alerting on the risks it is facing. With net sales of the entire industry reaching 45 billion euros in 2017, including 2.9 billion achieved by raw material suppliers, 24 billion by finished product manufacturers and 5 billion by retailers, completed by 14 billion for exports, France dominates the global cosmetics market with a 23% share. Moreover, this domination has not been eroded but was strengthened in recent years as French exports grew by 5% a year over the period 2010-2018, while the world market grew by 4% per year on average over the same period. Namely, the outperformance of the French cosmetics industry is based on significant investments in innovation. Each year, the French cosmetics industry spends about 2% of the sector's turnover in R&D. Major groups are strong innovation propellers with R&D spending comprised between 3% and 3.5% of their turnover. Beyond this directly quantifiable aspect, the dominant position of the French cosmetics industry is also based on less tangible elements, in particular an emotional and cultural heritage combining tourism, culture, art de vivre and products of excellence. As a result, according to CH2 Conseil, the strength of the French cosmetics takes form through: – Strong brands benefitting from an undeniable historical heritage, – Emerging brands that can use ""French attractiveness"" as a signature even from their very beginning, – Companies of all sizes offering safe and innovative products, – A recognized and constantly renewed quality, which is illustrated today by the international expansion of the dermo-cosmetic category. However, like many other industrial sectors, cosmetics companies must deal with several destabilizing factors such as the relocation of the economy (for economic or ecological reasons), the need to give meaning to consumption, new concerns for the environment. Beyond these general changes, the French cosmetics industry must also adapt to more specific developments: the rise of brands from countries with a strong cosmetic tradition (Japan, South Korea, etc.), the rise of an Italian industry taking inspiration from French recipes, and the rise of Chinese competitors strongly backed by their national authorities, or the rise of of ""indie brands"" targeting young people. To deal with these new challenges, the FEBEA believes that the industry must be better supported by the French authorities, especially on international markets."
"""We aim to put artificial intelligence at the service of perfumers' creativity,"" Calice Becker, Givaudan","Premium Beauty News - Which principles is Carto based on? Calice Becker - In perfumery, we do not really have direct access to all our ingredients, because everything is based on the perfumer's memory. His memory of ingredients, of what they smell, of their accords… The problem is, memory works by getting rid of unused information to better focus on what's new, which is why we forget about things. Fortunately! But since we forget about certain things, maybe we miss interesting parts. So, we had to find an answer to this frustration. We started by classifying odorous substances by family and by physical and chemical function, but also accords, etc. This huge work helped organize information based on physico-chemical, hedonic data, or descriptors, for every ingredient multi-labelled and studied by Givaudan for 30 years. Premium Beauty News - But, since it includes the notion of artificial intelligence, does Carto not go beyond this? Calice Becker - It does. This tool should be considered as a highly intuitive, easy-to-use tablet in which we recorded all the information and functionalities that will meet most of perfumers' needs. Carto invites them to dare create new accords, thanks to a visual, playful approach on a touch screen, while performing instantaneous tests at a speed current sampling methods cannot reach. Noses will actually be able to carry out more tests and assess them to get faster results. They will no longer have to go through repetitive tasks, and their noses and brains will be freed from tedious activities. Premium Beauty News - How can this benefit the perfumery world? Calice Becker - The spectrum of new fragrances will certainly broaden. Over 150 years, we created six olfactory families, which is not much, compared to the number of ingredients. The advent of gourmand perfumes is the latest great invention in perfumery, and it was already 20 years ago. Carto can make suggestions. Combining science and technology will help those that long for new olfactory forms blossom in this creation process. The perfumer will be freed from any constraints; he will be able to focus on his creations."
IL Cosmetics: A successful diversification!,"Premium Beauty News - So obviously it was not a cyclical downturn. The nail polish market is experiencing a real structural crisis? Jean-François Harpes - When the global markets for nail polish experience drops of 50% to 60% and with no real hope of significant recovery, we can indeed refer to it as a structural crisis. When you think about it, this is what happened to lipstick manufacturers about ten years ago with the arrival of lip-gloss. Premium Beauty News - This must have been quite a challenge for your company which was almost only specialized in nail polish? Jean-François Harpes - There is no mystery! The development of new product categories and, above all, the diversification of our portfolio, started 15 years ago, were two key elements that today allow us to maintain our growth momentum, to have our factories running at full capacity, to increase our investments in R&D and to cut down costs in order to remain competitive while ensuring our profitability. This is how we manage to overcome both cyclical and current structural market fluctuations. Premium Beauty News - But all this would not have been possible if you had not made the right choices? Jean-François Harpes - To achieve this, you must start by decrypting purchasing behaviors, which is not in the DNA of a sub-contractor. In a customer-driven approach, it is important to communicate with the end consumer as well. This analytical approach that combines panels, digital interactions and organoleptic analyzes allows us to get a global picture of polishes but also of the entire ""nail"" category, which includes nail polishes, semi-permanent formulas, water-based formulas, natural formulas, hybrid formulas and nail care. This approach allows us to allocate our resources to the most productive production units. But, of course, innovation is obviously essential. In 2018, we filed no less than 15 patents for products directly related to consumer needs like, for example, next generation patented bio-sourced formulas free of traditional solvents and of scents which could be perceived as not user friendly, but also of water based formulas with optimized performances and of hybrid formulas developed thanks to the expertise in crosslinking of our ""Gel Lacquers"" production unit to offer holding power and shine, without forgetting of course, to continue the research work started some years ago on alternatives to nitrocellulose... Premium Beauty News - You really played your card well by diversifying yourself in time? Jean-François Harpes - Indeed, and this strategy is paying off today! For example, we expect a 25% increase this year for our Luxcos makeup entity, which allows us to broaden our offer to customers who see IL Cosmetics as a Group able to provide them with comprehensive solutions addressing their needs. Note that, given our already very strong position on mascaras, we have been strengthening in recent months our product lines for the eyes and lips, complementing them with new references. For eye products, where we are already leaders in waterproof formulas, the aim is to offer a solution for each of the consumer profiles we identified, such as the development of high-performance Vegan formulas (both cream and waterproof), but also of products suiting sport addicts with perspiration resistant formulas, whatever the circumstances, and of easy to remove formulas for active women. For the latter we will showcase, at the upcoming MakeUp in Paris trade show, a new makeup removal technique developed and directly inspired from consumer needs. And of course, don't forget that all our products will soon be supported and validated by consumer panels. Premium Beauty News - This diversification necessarily involved industrial investments? Jean-François Harpes - Absolutely! [Industrially speaking, we have modernized and expanded our production plant specialized in bulk makeup in Luxembourg by doubling its production capacity, while packaging operations for makeup products will start this summer in our unit located in Bulgaria (capacity of 100 million units). In total we have tripled our full-service packaging capacity. Premium Beauty News - Your presence abroad, particularly in China, is indeed an ideal line of vision? Jean-François Harpes - That's right! Asian markets are often considered today as those who are influencing Western beauty. China for example, is the country with the biggest concentration of ""Millennials"", a consumer base, which is a key target today for all cosmetic payers. Being a leader in this market, allows us to anticipate future consumer needs on the European continent. Simply take the example of water-based polishes that already represent 20% to 30% of the Chinese market and which are slowly but surely gaining in importance in France."

From East to West: Takasago reasserts inspiration with new visual identity,"""To start with, we had to understand Takasago's DNA, just like for any brand"", explains Nathalie Helloin-Kamel, Head of Global Fine Fragrance of Takasago. As the only Japanese perfume creation house, Takasago makes a real difference on the perfume market. Their fine fragrance creation centre was established in 1978, in Paris, by two renowned perfumers: Pierre Bourdon and Michel Almairac. Their era was marked by blockbusters, like Cool Water, Jil Sander Sun, Jazz by Saint-Laurent, and Tsar by Van Cleef. Today, the house owns two other centres, in NYC and São Paulo. ""Great perfumes emerge from inspirational encounters, but also from deep beliefs. In fact, at some point, we need to understand each other and speak the same language,"" adds Nathalie Helloin-Kamel. That is why perfume creation is a human adventure, above all. This belief was the common thread that helped build up a new visual identity and signature and infuse perfume with poetry again. ""I wanted to unveil and highlight the fact that the act of perfume creation mainly depends on what the perfumer has on his mind. That is where beauty and magic lie,"" she explains. To create the visual, the Marystone agency contacted artist and Artistic Director Valérie Lade. She started with a collage, an artistic piece of work made with elements that had nothing to do with each other. ""To me, this artistic form corresponded to Takasago's world,"" she reveals. There is only one step from a dreamlike, fantasy, almost surreal form to a journey into the imaginary world. ""First, I chose a modern Japanese woman with lips adorned with red. But then, I deliberately made her nose disappear! The presence of clouds evokes the air, but above all, a journey into the imaginary world, with flowers of different colours. It is a way to highlight the fact that the perfumer's creativity depends on what he has on his mind,"" explains Valérie Lade. In other words, this creation combines the Eastern and Western cultures: Takasago's philosophy and vision for almost 100 years – an invitation to travel and immerse oneself in the creator's sensorial world, from which the company draws its inspiration, dreams, and ingredients, to better imagine tomorrow's perfumes. It is a real nod to the first journey of Tadaka Kainosho, founder of Takasago, from Kyoto to Grasse, in 1910. A chemist by training, Tadaka Kainosho founded his company based on a strong R&D culture (Nobel Prize 2001, Ryoji Noyori, with chiral chemistry, green chemistry…). Created in 1920 in Kyoto, the company owes its name to a Japanese Noh drama tale about a couple who lived in peace and harmony under the twin pine tree of the town of Takasago. It may not really be a coincidence if pine is one of the iconic ingredients of the company's R&D! With this new signature, ""Takasago. Maison de Parfumeurs. From Kyoto to Grasse. Since 1920"", the company intends to unite its story, that of its founder, of its origins, and of its inspirations. There is also a desire for refinement, delicacy, and beauty. In a word, ""our raison d'être is to sell difference"", concludes Nathalie Helloin-Kamel."
Natura buys Avon and becomes the world's 4th largest cosmetics group,"The merger creates a group with leading positions in relationship selling through Avon´s and Natura's over 6.3 million Consultants and Representatives, a global footprint through 3,200 stores, as well as an expanded digital presence across all companies. The combined Group is expected to have annual gross revenues of over US$10 billion, over 40,000 associates and be present in 100 countries. With this acquisition, Natura &Co becomes the world's fourth-largest beauty group. Natura &Co's portfolio includes the brands Natura, The Body Shop and Aesop. The addition of Avon should enhance the group's ability to better serve its different consumer profiles and distribution channels and expand into new geographies. The company expects the combination to result in synergies estimated at US$150 million to US$250 million annually, ""some of which will be reinvested to further enhance capabilities in digital and social selling, research & development and brand initiatives and to continue to grow the Group's geographic footprint."" ""Direct selling was a social network before the word even existed, and the arrival of technology and globalization only multiplied opportunities to connect with consumers in a meaningful way. The peer-to-peer sales model is evolving towards social selling,"" said Luiz Seabra, Co-Founder of Natura. The transition from the traditional model of relationship selling to a more digital scheme should indeed be the key to the success of the operation. As part of this transaction, a new Brazilian holding company, Natura Holding S.A., has been created. Natura &Co's shareholders will own approximately 76% of the combined company, while Avon shareholders will own approximately 24%."
Beauty startups and the challenge of growth,"On the hyper-competitive beauty market, the key to last lies in the validity of the product or service offered. This obvious fact is subject to the filter of an increasingly well-informed, hyper-connected population. ""The first selection occurs quite early. The product reality vs the brand promise is essential. You cannot fool consumers for long in this world exacerbated by influencers and social media,"" observes Maxime Garcia-Janin, creator of Sillages Paris, the first fully online, customizable Haute Parfumerie brand. The relevance of the product to its potential target also depends on the choice of an adapted distribution channel. ""Entrepreneurs often focus on making their products perfect, whereas first, they need to find their distribution channel to make the best-adapted offer,"" explains Laure Bouguen, founder of the Ho Karan brand, a natural, vegan, made in France range with a flagship ingredient: cannabis. ""Initially, we had planned to be distributed in pharmacies and through organic networks, but it is actually when we found our own place in the selective world that we were able to develop, although we had to adapt the product to match this channel's criteria,"" she adds. After a first version intended for men launched in 2016, the brand was revamped to become mixed and offer new formulas and packaging. Once it is on the right track, the young brand can be faced with the other side of success. So, to avoid disappointing its new customers, it should be able to meet their expectations through a better-structured development strategy. ""The limiting factor for all young brands is the company cash. It is tricky to anticipate stock management and advance production fees,"" explains Marie Drago, creator of Gallinée, a range of skin microbiome-balancing skincare products which has enjoyed a three-digit growth for three years – since it was founded. ""Distributors pay brands quite late after they have been delivered the products, although these have already been paid for to manufacturers. All this creates a real need in terms of working capital,"" she adds. Then, in addition to these production and cash management constraints, there are new logistics, marketing and communication needs, so you need to find new recruits for your team. As a result, Marie Drago chose a minority shareholder for its capital: Unilever Venture. ""It is true I had to divest a minimal part of my shares, but I get much more than with a financing solution. I also get tips, I can reach new distributors, and I benefit from the support of experts,"" says the entrepreneur. Soon after it was created, Sillages Paris also started raising funds. ""The brand was launched in November 2017, and in November 2018, L'Oréal bought into our capital with a minority investment, which helped us keep our independence. It was the first time the group had invested in a startup, which they thought was in line with perfumery's evolution towards digital technologies. It is not only about financial resources, because we have access to mentors who help us with logistics, regulations, retail, online presence optimization… It is a real win-win partnership,"" claims Maxime Garcia-Janin. Sillages Paris will open their first wholly-owned store next month. As she is dealing with the success of her application, Marine Chevalier, co-founder of My Beauty Community, is looking for funds to structure her team and develop on the global level. Intended to guide users towards the best choice of cosmetic products, based on feedback shared by a tailor-made community, the app will soon celebrate its third anniversary – and it already counts 50,000 subscribers. ""We are still the first players on the market to give the floor to consumers this way, which provides us with a widely recognized reference status as regards data, because we get an exceptional quantity of insights. We have been looking for funds to maintain this lead, it is crucial. But the key to our success is based on our independence from brands, so they cannot buy into our capital. It is up to us to find people who understand what we do, while remaining impartial,"" she explains. Based on these various approaches, Marine Chevalier highlights the importance of the network of experts or other startups, which is usually built up through incubators directly related to the cosmetics world or not. ""It is important to spend time exchanging with other startups. It is not a waste of time, quite the contrary. It is cooperation!"" The need for additional funds at a key moment in brands' development corresponds to an obligation to stay in the race, in this very fast-changing, competitive market. Still, they should keep their progress under control, without indulging in a growth frenzy. ""We tend to forget that hypergrowth is as dangerous as undergrowth,"" says Maxime Garcia-Janin. This is confirmed by Juliette Munoz, co-founder with her sister of La Canopée, a range of 100% natural, vegan, made in France skincare products. ""We started with our own website, which was an immediate success. Today, many e-shops offer La Canopée online, and we are present in 90 points of sale in France and Europe, and Thailand as well, soon. The difficulty lies in trying to go step by step, without rushing, and managing our growth so that we can develop in a healthy way,"" says the founder. After three years of research and development, the duo developed its range based on the ""homemade"" manufacturing concept. This deliberate running strategy provides great flexibility and independence as regards issues like cash management. ""We control the whole chain, from sourcing to distribution, so we have no constraints related to manufacturers or money to pay in advance. It helps us keep things under control,"" she emphasizes. To her, the challenge this year lies in entering new major export markets. ""We need to understand how it works in regulatory terms, in every country, and go discover countries we don't know…"" Validating a driving, differentiating concept, being and remaining close to customers, choosing the right distribution channels, learning to meet the right experts, sharing experiences, finding financial support, while remaining independent, integrating the manufacturing chain, stepping back, staying in line with market trends and one's basis… here are a few keys to success for brands willing to last!"
Superga Beauty shows off their ambitions in full service with a first product development for HOC,"Resulting from the merger of the respective activities of BPS - a subsidiary of the Superga Group specialising in manufacturing, packing and co-packing with six production sites in Northern France - and Manifesto Factory, which designs and manufactures promotional items dedicated to the luggage, jewellery, textile, perfume and prestige alcohol markets, Superga Beauty made their first appearance last January during the PCD trade show in Paris. Based on a design by Thierry de Baschmakoff, Masha Zanier, a young Parisian of Russian and Georgian heritage hailing from the fashion world, entrusted Superga Beauty to give substance to her project of a new fragrance brand dedicated to highlight the talent of creators of perfumes. A talented master perfumer, one of Firmenich's main perfumers, and the creator of 200 perfumes, Vincent Schaller was chosen as the very first artist to create HOC first set of perfumes dubbed London City and featuring three fragrances 11:00 AM, 5:00 PM and 9:00 PM inspired from the very specific atmosphere of the British capital. With a vibrantly-coloured adornment on its four outer sides, the bottle features an original engraving that tells the perfume's story on the top of the magnetic cap. Each fragrance is presented in a magnetised wooden box with a matte varnish finish bearing the brand's monogram. ""Our know-how, which serves the beauty industry, coupled with the Superga Invest Group's reach in the luxury sector, have allowed us to currently offer niche brands tailormade solutions for their perfume creation, skincare and makeup initiatives,"" explains Nathalie Dickeli-Duvoisin, Director of the Superga Beauty Full Service Division. Indeed, Superga Beauty intends to build on the emergence and growing success of Indies Brands, which are looking for suppliers able to support them from the outset of their project, to develop a unique offer based both on Manifesto's tailor-made design capabilities and BPS's production and packaging capabilities. In addition, Manifesto Factory has recently expanded its offer with the acquisition of Pictogramme, a French company specializing in the design, manufacture and marketing of high-end advertising objects and gifts. This strategic acquisition will enable the company to provide its customers with ""made in France"" (or in ""made Europe"") premium solutions and to meet the increasing demand for small series. This acquisition is a step further in the strengthening of Superga. Founded in 2001 by Alain Bréau, the group is focusing on services to companies operating in the leading sectors of the French economy: luxury, cosmetics, fashion, and retail. Today, the group has annual turnover of approximately 100 million euros and employs nearly 1,000 employees mainly in France."
Fashion and beauty brands: startups' founders share experiences on stage,"Premium Beauty News - What is the purpose of the FaB community? Odile Roujol - Most venture capitalists, business angels have a preference for tech-led businesses and ideas. Investors spend more easily into tech products and tend to be sceptical about physical products and the potential return on investment. However, there is a sea of untapped opportunities in the fashion and beauty worlds. We have created this network to help investors and founders of fashion and beauty brands to meet and share experiences together. Premium Beauty News - How do you support them? Odile Roujol - Brands founders can learn from each other at dedicated events and exchange best practices. Product safety and manufacturing is part of having great products and keep customers loyal, we try to make them aware in a context where the regulation doesn't control all brands. I encourage them to have advisors and mentors to continue to grow as leaders. Some founders have ""love money"" (money from family, friends and acquaintances) in funding and just raised a seed round, other are at a later stage and even generate revenues above USD 10 million. Premium Beauty News - What is your relationship with investors? Odile Roujol - Investors love the conversation as most entrepreneurs they meet pitch them, here they talk about trends, they don't have to take a decision at the end of the meeting. They meet people they wouldn't have time to during their business days. Elsa Jungman, founder of ELSI Beauty Former skin care microbiome expert at AO Biome, Elsa Jungman founded its own brand ELSI Beauty at the beginning of this year and benefited from the very start of the network in San Francisco. ""This network has helped me understand the process of creating my own brand. Sometimes you can meet people that are a bit more advanced in the process and you can learn best practices or how to pitch to investors for instance,"" states Elsa. Premium Beauty News - How did the FaB community start? Odile Roujol - The movement started with meetings in San Francisco, California, and has expanded in Europe (with London, Paris, Berlin and Spain), and is now expanding into Latin America and Asia (Shanghai, Singapore. Seoul, Tokyo) and for sure in NY and LA. The local chapters are entrepreneurs knowing well the ecosystem. The whole idea is the ""pay forward"" and ""give back"" culture dear to the Silicon Valley. We raise a voice together, we support each other, we are stronger as a global movement. We may also bring some industry experts into the mix so they could help founders about formulation, clean beauty, but also about influence, growth... FaB meets every three months in San Francisco, every six months in Paris for example. It's flexible and connected to the local network and regional needs. The price of tickets just cover the food and beverage and taking pictures. Exciting period as we are a fast-growing community! Built for founders and funders, by entrepreneurs sharing the same passion, the community gathers around 1500 members worldwide."
Guerlain banks on transparency with Bee Respect,"The project was born in 2015, when Sandrine Sommer introduced Robin Cornelius to Laurent Boillot. The Swiss transparency expert made them discover the ""Respect Code"" concept: this renowned QR Code affixed on product labels recaps the whole product life, from raw materials to end-of-life management. Guerlain's President was seduced and considered it a potential tool for continuous improvement. But, initially, the Maison only adopted it for internal use. ""We worked with all the teams involved to collect and compile all the data available on each product's life cycle. The tool provided an overview of the product, so everyone could work on their environmental impact, based on this information,"" explains Sandrine Sommer. ""We developed the platform hand in hand with Product DNA, because the traceability of a cosmetic product is complex, especially when it is composed of many ingredients,"" she adds. Today, the platform lists 80% of every skincare formula's ingredients, including key actives. The origin and function are also provided for every ingredient. ""It is like inviting our customers behind the scenes. We do not hide anything, even if not everything is perfect. And it is an opportunity for us to explain the efforts we make about certain controversial ingredients,"" says Sandrine Sommer. As regards packaging, the website both provides the suppliers' names and geographical situations and highlights the outstanding actions taken to preserve the environment. Users can also find information about transport, the carbon impact, the points of sale all around the world, products' end-of-life, and recycling. ""Being transparent means honestly and genuinely sharing our actions as part of our social and environmental commitment, and BEE RESPECT is an additional milestone in our sustainable approach. It also corresponds to customers' growing need for more information about the products they use,"" explains Guerlain's Sustainable Development Director. Opened to the public since last April, the platform is accessible either by scanning the products' QR Codes, or on Guerlain's website, via the Bee Respect tab. Right now, it only covers skincare, but it will be completed with makeup products by this summer, and then perfumes, by the end of the year."
Capsum explores the green trend and invests in the US,"Every year, Capsum gathers customers to introduce a newly inspired collection of textures and formulas and highlight the potential of their exclusive microfluidic technology, which consists in forming droplets one by one, by controlling their sizes and manipulating fluids to obtain innovative emulsions. ""These proposals help us explore different ways to innovate and stimulate our customers' curiosity. But they are not turnkey solutions. It is only afterwards that we work on tailor-made offers using our technologies, according to our customers' specific requests,"" explains Laurie Dewandel, Communication Director. This year's theme, Tomorrow Natural Glow, seemed only natural, given what all beauty brands expect: more naturalness and sustainability. ""This new collection offers solutions combining naturalness, innovation, aesthetics, and sensoriality. It is an invitation to discuss beauty's sustainable future. We made clear choices in terms of sustainability and we encourage brands to exchange with us about these issues,"" adds Laurie Dewandel. For their formulas to be both natural and ecoresponsible, Capsum partnered with Le Paysan Urbain, an urban farming structure which develops agro-ecological farms in city centres or close suburbs for cultures without inputs or buckwheat sprout pesticides. The extraction of actives with a non-polluting, ultrasound-based technology is outsourced to Crodarom. The range is composed of an energizing essence, a comforting serum, a quenching jelly and a nourishing pearl cream, with rates of natural ingredients between 90% and 96%. In addition, Capsum has been working on new technologies to get rid of silicones and get as close as possible to 98% natural formulas. As regards packaging, the company has chosen not to use any plastic – except for the cap's gasket seal – or glue. They selected secondary packaging made of folding board and pump-free bottles and jars based on lightweight glass. ""It is the first time we have incorporated our bubbles in jars. It really transforms the cream's appearance,"" emphasizes Laurie Dewandel. Capsum will showcase the Tomorrow Natural Glow collection in NYC on May 14-16, and then in Los Angeles, on June 4-6, 2019. The company will use this opportunity to introduce American customers to its future production site in Austin, Texas. The LEED-certified ecodesigned building is under construction and should be operational in early 2020. ""North America is an increasingly important market for Capsum. We had to be there, as close as possible to our customers. Plus, it is line with the global production relocation trend,"" concludes Laurie Dewandel."
China is already Ioma's second largest market,"How can a brand based on the concept of skin diagnosis – it claims more than 1 million of them so far, performed using in-store analytical devices –, convince people in a market where it is physically not present ? ""We have a local co-investing partner who develops cross-border e-commerce on different platforms like Taobao and Little Red Book. Because upstream, since September 2018, we have signed collaboration agreements with 30 KOL (Key Opinion Leaders) asking them to talk about us on Chinese social networks,"" explained Jean-Michel Karam. This practice of recommendation funded online - Zhong Cao ( 种草) or grass planting in Chinese Internet lingo - allowed it to generate promotional articles on the brand, coined for the occasion with a Chinese homophone name (ioma 艾欧码). A total of 260 local websites spoke about Ioma. And it is mostly live streaming, very popular among young Chinese consumers, that enables faster buying decisions. ""One of our influencers was filmed live performing a skin diagnosis of her skin in our Parisian boutique on Boulevard Saint Germain and in a few hours, 2,000 products at US$150 piece were sold,"" said Jean-Michel Karam. Trained as an engineer, the entrepreneur founded Memscap in 1997, a provider of innovative solutions and innovative products based on micro-electromechanical systems (Mems), mainly for the aeronautics and aerospace sectors. Convinced that these complex electronic components capable of detecting physical phenomena could have a disruptive application in the field of cosmetics, he gathered 45 million euros of investments in R&D technologies before launching Ioma in 2010. ""The personalization that a truly scientific and precise skin analysis provides, is the basis for efficiency. And this is the epitome of luxury,"" he highlighted. And in fact, the ""Ma Crème"" range, proposed in 40,257 possible formulas, is positioned at the higher end of the market. The next step was the launch, last January, of jewels, under the brand name Ieva, to measure the temperature, the level of pollution, humidity, noise, brightness and the UV index. The collected data is then translated into beauty, nutrition and lifestyle recommendations. ""Because half of ageing results from a genetic origin and from stress, the environment and lifestyle,"" added Jean-Michel Karam, who believes that beauty brands will gradually shift to more global well-being brands. Acquired by the Unilever Group in 2013, Ioma is present in more than 25 countries, ""China already being our second market, and our strategic priority after France"". ""We have had China in sight for four years now. In Asia, we have 20 POS in department stores in Singapore and Taiwan. And a six-month pop-up corner in Hong Kong,"" detailed the Head of Ioma. In the wake of this ""encouraging first phase"" on the Chinese Internet, ""with its influencers ten times more expensive than in Europe"", the opening of physical stores is scheduled for September 2019, after obtaining CFDA certifications. ""And this will be quite something. We will offer Chinese consumers a memorable shopping experience,"" guaranteed Jean-Michel Karam."
BODY'Minute to develop their concept in Europe,"Jean-Christophe David was the son of renowned hairdresser Jean-Louis David, who died last April 3, aged 85. He inherited a family passion for hairdressing, and 20 years ago, he banked on a wellness concept for women, in particular young women who were not used to going to beauty salons. BODY'Minute offers subscriptions for quick treatments without an appointment. Subscriptions also give access to the NAIL'Minute and HAIR'Minute services, which soon completed the network's offering. ""We offer high quality, affordable services for women from 15 to 45,"" explains the founder. Today, the network ranks first in terms of number of beauty salons in Paris, and second in France, behind giant Yves Rocher. The group keeps growing – +7% in 2018, at constant scope – and achieves a 150-million-euro turnover for four million transactions every year. Five years ago, the concept was completed with cosmetics ranges to meet customers' needs: SKIN'minute, EPIL'minute, SOAP'minute, SLIM'minute, BODY'minute, and BABY'minute. In keeping with its dynamics of 30 new openings every year, the BODY'Minute network aims to develop outside French borders. ""Today, we are definitely able to deploy the 'minute' concept throughout Europe,"" says Jean-Christophe David. To this aim, the Director is looking for partners specialized in retail, and who can open new salons in the UK, Germany, and Italy. ""The idea is to sell wellness to all women,"" he claims."
"""Services are today a driving force for beauty sales"" Stéphanie Chalard","Premium Beauty News - What is the situation like for the Beauty Success network of perfumeries-institutes within the Group? Stéphanie Chalard - Perfume sales are on a par with the market trend, which is down, compensated on the one hand, partially by end-of-year sales and mostly by service activities, which are continuing to do well. Our website was also very successful. About ten branches were opened in France; the network today consists of 310 POS. Premium Beauty News - And outside France? Stéphanie Chalard - The export momentum is continuing; it stands as a growth axis. In 2018, we opened new outlets in Djibouti, Morocco, Reunion and Abidjan, which means today we have 23 outlets in the overseas departments and territories, Morocco and West Africa. Premium Beauty News - Services are becoming an important sales driver. What actions did you undertake in this area? Stéphanie Chalard - There is an institute in almost every Beauty Success perfumeries, this is our model. We have worked a lot on the profitability side. The card is made up of our own protocols with our own retail brand, which enables us to offer a very good price/quality ratio. The program ""Pretty, from mother to daughter"" has also encouraged daughters to visit our outlets, for a first skincare treatment or make-up application. Concerning the design of outlets, eight of them are now equipped with two entries: one for the perfumery and another one the beauty institute, to facilitate the access to the institute without having to walk through the perfume store. We are studying the possibility of extending this solution to all other existing outlets. In 2019, we will test a new store model with quicker service areas. Premium Beauty News - What are the major projects underway? Stéphanie Chalard - On the one hand, digital, with a completely redesigned website for September, with a stronger focus on our outlets, and a redesigned platform for making appointments in institutes. In addition, our media budget previously dedicated to TV, will be switched, to digital, with actions starting in May. The other important news is the Beauty Full Days retail brand, consisting of 15 institutes, that we are going to integrate in the ""Beauty Success L'institut de beauté"" retail brand as of June. We clearly wish to fully capitalize on the reputation of Beauty Success. This will allow us to broaden implantation opportunities on the territory and therefore reinforce our network and presence under the same name. This is an important change for the Group which will now consist of three main pillars: Beauty Success, Esthetic Center and Parapharmacies Tanguy, while keeping our two incubating nuggets: Beauty Sisters (for millennials), and Nicole (for the upper middle-class customer base). Premium Beauty News - Precisely tell us more about these nuggets? Stéphanie Chalard - We are going to open a new Beauty Sisters boutique in downtown Périgueux and a second Nicole boutique at the end of the year. These two young retail brands are just as important to us as the others, but they must first be tested in a branch format to validate the business model before launching it as a franchise. Premium Beauty News - And what is your assessment of the Nicole ""neo perfumery"" concept launched a year ago in Périgueux? Stéphanie Chalard - Results are very good with 30% increase in value compared to the perfume store that previously existed. It is a perfumery with a developed service that attracts new customers without competing with our Beauty Success perfumeries, despite some common brands. New highly demanded exclusive brands have joined us. Another finding, the institute we opened with Cinq Mondes and Pure Alttitude is very popular, and we are considering opening a second cabin in 2019. We also propose brands specialized in accessories, scarves, leather goods, jewelry, at different price levels, which are also very popular. Premium Beauty News - What would be your overall conclusion concerning the Group? Stéphanie Chalard - In parallel to the ongoing momentum of the Beauty Success Group, our goal is to win over new customers by working on our offer and communication, and always stay attractive to our current customers."
Meitu to develop own beauty recommendation technology,"According to Ian Wu, beauty online sales have reached a ceiling of 30% of the global market. To him, although they have always known the Internet, the Generation Z has not deserted physical stores. ""The concept consisting in testing before buying is very important to them, and beauty advisors still play an essential role,"" he said, as there are no other explanations than the relative stagnation of the share of online beauty sales. To stimulate sales in stores, Meitu has developed a skin analysis device. It is now possible to test customers' skins at the point of sale and recommend them specific products. Meitu sells these devices to brands or retailers and offers a licensing agreement to use the associated software. ""Our licensing agreement currently offers facial feature analysis, skin testing, and skincare/makeup product recommendation technologies. These technologies will enhance the retail experience by allowing consumers to better understand their skin condition and purchase the products that best fit their needs,"" said Ian Wu. It seems the company has decided to focus on this type of software and to gradually withdraw from telephony. For example, last November, the group signed a partnership with fellow Chinese Xiaomi, who acquired the Meitu Smartphone exclusive license. ""The deal will allow Meitu to better focus on developing its next-generation image processing, AI technologies, and image algorithms,"" the group emphasized. The group is proud of its status of personalized beauty pioneer in China. Countless selfie retouch applications were developed in the country, after the launch of Meitu's flagship application (美图, beautiful picture) and BeautyCam and BeautyPlus video applications – a range said to count 1.5 billion users around the world, including over a third outside China. For example, the My Beauty function on the flagship Meitu App allows users to personalize their beautification settings according to their preferences by logging into their Meitu Accounts (MTid). The criteria a user can personalize include, but are not limited to, the smoothness of the skin, the preservation of specific facial attribute(s) (such as a beauty mark), facial structure adjustments, facial and/or body reshaping, and eye size adjustment. Once set, these effects will be saved for all future logins and may be readjusted at any time. This analysis provides brands with insights into customers': – Makeup and skincare product preferences – Behavior, such as their number of SKU clicks, sessions, purchases, usage duration, and purchase rate – Consumer needs based on their skin conditions such as skin age, blackheads, acne, dark-circles, and wrinkles – Users can also choose to input their demographic information such as age and gender ""All of these insights can be used to help businesses develop their marketing strategies and enable them to create multiple online touch points that can re-engage customers, or even reach a similar audience through precision marketing"", explained Ian Wu, to whom the targeted use of data is ""the future of online marketing"". There is a last pending issue, though: personal data protection. Meitu promises that ""the purpose and scope of our data collection is strictly limited to the normal operation of our products and their functions"". Quite a hot topic!"
CED Cosmetics unearths beauty gems for retailers,"CED Cosmetics has positioned as a brand consulting partner for the best-adapted distribution. ""We aim to act as the local subsidiary they do not have and make suggestions about their expansion strategy and all the animation and communication actions it involves, so that they can last,"" says co-founder Jean-Louis Schöller. To select these brands, CED Cosmetics founders Jean-Louis Schöller and Olivier Vinot defined a first criterion: ""It has to be love at first sight, we need to have a feeling for the brand,"" explains Jean-Louis Schöller. The following criteria have to do with compliance with French regulations, multilingual packs, an affordable price - no more than 10% higher than the source market - and of course, the products need to be trendy. ""Naturalness definitely prevails today. Yesterday, it was the formula that was targeted, tomorrow, people will also focus on the pack. Sustainable packaging is a trend that is not fully exploited yet, compared to the expectations of the Millennials generation. Consumers want brands to be more innovative as regards packaging and material recycling. That's why we focus our research on this aspect, now,"" he explains. Right now, CED Cosmetics counts 25 brands in their portfolio, including Dr Bronner's, OGX, Maui, Herbacin, Ikoo, The Humble Brush, Real Techniques, PureHeals, Adopt - for Benelux – and CoLab Dry Shampoo. ""We provide an added value in the sense that some of the brands we unearth are far away, in Korea or in the US. Today's consumers really search for talented, original brands. They want differentiating products, and they are fond of our own, in particular in supermarkets, because they can always get a premium extra,"" adds the CEO. Mass distribution, selective perfumery, parapharmacies, department stores, drugstores and concept stores, organic stores… CED Cosmetics works with all channels to get more opportunities and put these new brands on the same level as the many players already on the French market. ""Overall, we have always managed to make our brands settle on retail markets. Also, sometimes we launch them on exclusive terms at only one retailer. Brands are willing to stand out,"" concludes Jean-Louis Schöller."
"Chlitina, the Taiwanese brand which is winning over Chinese customers","Chlitina now boasts a network of over 4400 franchisees in Greater China and Southeast Asia. The franchise generated more than 1 billion yuan (131 million euros or 147 million US dollars) in sales in 2018, 95% of which, in mainland China, making it the leading beauty salon brand in the region. The aim of the franchise is to achieve a net annual growth of 500 institutes, not only in the Greater China region but also in countries like Vietnam where it already has a foothold and soon in Malaysia and Indonesia. To ensure its development, the Company relies on its own R & D centers and manufacturing plants in Taiwan and China. This allows the Company to master the quality of products and their traceability and thus guarantee their authenticity. In-house development also allows for increased responsiveness on the market. Chlitina also has a training school in Shanghai and 27 regional centers spread across China. These schools train beauticians to skincare methods, but also to health practices and to the management of the Beauty institutes. Chlitina believes that 300,000 beauticians - i.e., about 90% of all beauty professionals in China - were trained by the franchise brand. The Company stands out with its feminist commitment and encourages women's entrepreneurship. ""The brand seeks to help women emancipate themselves economically and to take a leading role in their family and community,"" said Ryan Chao, COO of Chlitina. Chlitina leverages on a Taiwanese concept of customer service and skin care. Beyond cosmetic treatments, beauticians are trained to the well-being of their customers and to the management and growth of their salons thanks to new selling techniques, with loyalty programs for their customer who generally call on their services three or four times a month. Beauty salons also communicate on WeChat, Line, Weibo among other micro-blogging platforms, etc. Everywhere, except in China, where the American social network is blocked, every salon also updates its own Facebook page. There is a profit-sharing scheme for salons on their sales of cosmetic treatments and products. Supplies are managed in a just-in-time mode to limit costly stocks. Yet, customers are not only encouraged to go to their salons to benefit from technical skin treatments and get the beauty tips that the brand's sophisticated products require, they can also buy online: Chlitina has created its own e-commerce platform to expand its range by offering the brand's products, but also wellness products such as dietary supplements. In line with its development strategy, the beauty salon franchise brand is leveraging particularly on light cosmetic procedures (such as Botox injections, laser treatments, etc.) and has recently acquired a beauty care clinic in Beijing and announced that it would shortly be opening two more clinics in Shanghai."
Faber-Castell launches its clean beauty offer,"Pure2 Beauty is another step further in the development of a ""clean beauty"" offering presented at MakeUp in Los Angeles under the Pure Beauty seal. As the first opus, the new range of wood and plastic pencils is guaranteed without controversial ingredients (D5 silicones, parabens, non-sustainable palm oil, mineral mica, fragrances, etc.), and offers in addition vegan and natural (or greener) formulas, free from microplastics, silicons and synthetic waxes and with PEFC certified wood. ""The wave of clean beauty is encouraging brands to rethink their offering. With our Pure Beauty and Pure2 Beauty seals, we offer a clear reading grid for our ranges of pencils,"" explains Kathrin Hecht, Marketing Communication Manager at Faber-Castell Cosmetics. The Pure and Pure2 Beauty collections consist of 12 different colour cosmetic pencils, for eyes and lips make-up, with high performance and rich pigments. The Pure2 Beauty Divin Red Wooden Jumbo Pencil, for instance, offers a lipstick formula based on natural waxes and oils and vitamin E to help lips stay soft and hydrated. The colour-rich, creamy texture in deep, dense hues perfectly defines and fills in. The wooden Jumbo-sized pencil unites the precision of a liner with the convenience of a lipstick. For the pencil body, Faber-Castell Cosmetics uses PEFC-certified wood and the formula is free from D5, microplastics, parabens, silicones, fragrance, synthetic waxes, mineral mica, unsustainable palm oil, and is vegan."
Schwan Cosmetics reinvents itself with 3D-printed solutions and new designs,"The German manufacturer of wood and plastic cosmetic pencils is continuing the transformation of its offer and organisation. After having introduced new airtight wooden pencils at MakeUp in Paris and a luxury a ceramic case at MakeUp in New York last year, Schwan Cosmetics has showcased new 3D-printed solutions and exclusive wood designs at the latest Cosmopack Worldwide Bologna. ""Consumers all around the world are becoming less and less willing to compromise on their cosmetics products: They are striving for both individualized and instagrammable solutions, constant newness, sustainability and transparency,"" explains Dagmar Chlosta, Chief Market Officer Schwan Cosmetics. In order to help cosmetics brands to address this new demand, Schwan Cosmetics wants to provide end-to-end solutions combining innovation, individualization and sustainability. In order to increase its agility and offer brands of all sizes fast prototyping solutions with unlimited shapes and geometry forms, Schwan Cosmetics has invested in new 3D printing machines. ""We can therefore increase the variety of our designs within shorter delays,"" highlights Dagmar Chlosta. The unit price of 3D printed caps and primary packaging is higher than for injected products but the technology allows to produce small quantities with no extra costs and to accelerate time to market. All types of decorations and finishes are possible. In the wake of the launch of Perfect, the first line of airtight wooden pencils, last year, Schwan Cosmetics is expanding its portfolio by putting the emphasis on design to increase the ""instagrammability"" of the products with two new lines: ""Shifted Lead Next Generation"" and the ""Jumbo Chopstick Oriental"". In order to address consumer's demand for more sustainable packaging, Schwan Cosmetics is also working at the development of a new refillable version of the Treasure Collection, the luxury line feature ceramic cases launched at MakeUp in New York last year. A new innovation to discover soon!"

Makeup artist to the stars, Charlotte Tilbury's prolific career spans over 26 years working on shoots, runways and red carpets with the world's top celebrities including Penelope Cruz, Kate Moss, Sofia Vergara, Jennifer Aniston, Salma Hayek and many more. Charlotte's philosophy of ""Give everyone the right make-up, and they can conquer the world!"" led the way to creating her easy-to-choose, easy-to-use brand, Charlotte Tilbury Beauty, which launched in 2013. The now world-famous, award-winning makeup, skincare and fragrance hybrid is renowned for bottling the beauty DNA and secrets of supermodels, stars and screen sirens, and sharing them with the world!

Cosmetic subcontracting: Technature surfs on new consumer expectations,"It was a serious blow, but the company managed to bounce back beautifully. In February 2017, a devastating accidental fire burned to the ground the industrial site that Technature had acquired a few months earlier to Laboratoires Science et Mer. ""The next day, all of the Group's employees got organized and focused on what was essential, namely to maintain production and fulfil pending orders,"" detailed Pierre Morvan, CEO of the Breton Company. Pierre Morvan makes no secrets of the fact the following months were difficult. But today he can only be pleased and proud of the long way his company has come from. Throughout this period, the French subcontractor retained the confidence of almost all of its customers, ensured continuity of production and maintained sales level. ""We very quickly started rebuilding the factory, while the offices had not been destroyed,"" he explained. Fully operational since the beginning of the year, the new building has a filtered air system, over-pressured in the manufacturing areas and a supply in filtered and biosmosed water to comply with FDA requirements. The production area spanning over 3500 m² (including 2000 m² dedicated solely to manufacturing and packaging operations) was designed to allow an increase of 1000m². Similarly, 1000m² of additional storage space remains available for the future. ""This reconstruction has already allowed us to increase threefold our production capacity and anticipate future production ramp-ups."" At the same time, production was re-thought to specialize the sites. Today, Technature can rely on two production units located a few kilometres apart, near Brest: in Dirinon, the historical 4500 m² unit now focuses on powders, while at Relecq-Kerhuon the reconstructed unit is dedicated to leave-on cosmetics. There is also a logistics platform of 5000 m² located on a plot adjacent to the Dirinon site. ""We hadn't planned things like that at first, but when the opportunity arose we immediately seized it. This enabled us to separate the flows of raw materials and of packaging. This is also where are grouped all the finished products before their shipping. This enables us to maximize the space dedicated to production,"" said enthused Pierre Morvan. This additional space will also facilitate the upgrading works for the historic site, which have just begun, thus allowing Technature to have homogeneous units. With this solidly reconfigured industrial base, Technature can now entirely focus on winning over new customers. And for this, the subcontractor has a number of assets! Specialized at first in alginate-based formulas, the company has since, widely diversified its offering and now proposes a wide range of products, designed, produced and packaged in its facilities. Being the only manufacturer in Europe of hydrogel for cosmetic applications, Technature is facing growing demand for these products. New packaging lines are being installed and several innovations will soon be presented, including a natural gel from algae extracts. A COSMOS certified gel is even planned in the short term. ""Even though we never restricted our activity to that, Technature's DNA lies in natural cosmetics. Our offer for natural products is fully in line with market demand and new consumer expectations,"" emphasized Anne-Claire Roudaut, Marketing and Communication Manager. ""We can rely on a well-developed expertise and technologies to meet market demand, which is sky-rocketing, including for our anhydrous formulas, in line with current demand."" Initially recognized for its expertise in masks, the company has successfully expanded its expertise to many other categories, well beyond the professional circuit. Technature, for example, supplied a glittery scented powder to Quadpack, who was showcasing a powder spray bottle at the last PCD Paris. ""What our customers expect from us are innovative and original textures. This is how we manage to stand out from the pack,"" added Anne-Claire Roudaut. Technature is therefore resolutely setting course on innovation with the aim of going even further in terms of naturalness and use of new materials. ""For our teams, we pay a lot of attention in preserving their moments of creativity and collaboration, with a lot of freedom to foster the emergence of ideas,"" explained Pierre Morvan. A strategy which has paid off so far. While the company's activity was slowed down for two years after the 2017 fire, teams remained loyal and united. Technature, which employs 160 employees for a turnover of 20 million euros, half of which generated by export sales (25% in Europe and 25% for the rest of the world), wants to return to growth, with an ambitious target of 20% per year in the next three years. The company was identified by BPI as part of its national accelerator programme to become a mid-market company in the short-term. ""We have all the assets to succeed: loyal teams, innovative products in line with current trends, a high-performance industrial tool and significant production resources,"" concluded the CEO."
"Delbôve, a ""magic ritual"" in line with current trends","In the 1960s, Roger Delbôve and his wife Marion, who used to work for Helena Rubinstein, designed a skincare product based on medicinal plants to restore the skin's balance and natural functions. It took the form of a ritual combining an Eau and a Crème, later called the Magic Ritual. When Marion died, Gina d'Ansembourg, who loved this method and its results, decided to revive the Delbôve brand and the formulas making up the ritual. A first wholly-owned store opened in Brussels in 2013, then a second in Antwerp, which helped reconnect the brand with its users. Delbôve is now coming to France. The Magic Ritual on which all Delbôve treatments are based suits all skin types and ages. Morning and night, thanks to the Crème Sorcière and Eau Sorcière emulsion, the three-minute ritual helps restore the balancing and regenerating power of the skin. This duo containing 19 natural actives becomes a five-in-one product: a cleanser, a makeup remover, a toner, and a day & night cream. As a complement, a range composed of 25 formulas ""highly concentrated in botanical actives"" offers both face and body care for specific needs. The Delbôve products are available at the Bon Marché department store and at the Liquides perfume store for EUR38 to EUR82."
"Fiabila, always one ""stroke ahead""!","Premium Beauty News - Your trade requires continuous questioning! Pierre Miasnik - We do not have a choice! Our trade has become considerably more complex over the past ten years. We cannot afford to make mistakes, whether with the industrial tool or the products we make and place on the market. We must manage and, to a certain extent, anticipate stricter and stricter regulations, while offering ever-more innovative, high-performance, perfectly safe products for the brands we supply. For example, can you imagine we have over two thousand tonnes of flammable materials on a permanent basis in one of our main plants in France? Plus, we have 12 plants around the world. All our sites are fully compliant with environmental regulations. We recycle 97% of our hazardous materials, 83% of our total waste, and 100% of industrial wastewater is retreated. We have already proven, and we keep proving on a daily basis that we deeply believe in quality, excellence, and in the development of this nail varnish market. We have geographically diversified our production tools, and we keep investing in new techniques, thanks to our powerful R&D services. But nail varnish remains a beauty product, so there must be no compromise on creativity, which Fiabila keeps developing. Premium Beauty News - Over the past few months, people have been talking about a nail varnish consumption crisis. Pierre Miasnik - Well, we did have to cope with a cyclical market slowdown, but it is getting dynamic again. Obviously, the arrival and development of gel-based formulas, whose use is not perfectly safe, had a real impact. So, we had to innovate, and we did. We keep innovating with our 40 laboratory researchers. First of all, we need to ask the right questions… What do consumers want? What level of requirement, comfort, but also, and above all, quality and safety? We have been working this way for about three years in order to remove nitrosamines from our formulas, which led us to register three patents about the addition of inhibitors, bentonite substitutes, and nitrocellulose substitutes, respectively. Only the latter remains under study. The two others are finalized, and we are the only ones to offer a reliable, efficient solution. All this just shows that Fiabila is most likely the most advanced company as regards these technical changes, because we give ourselves the means to progress, in terms of production tools, consumer safety, and full compliance with the legislation, all around the world. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, let's talk about this! Today, you have plants in seven countries. Alexandre Miasnik - That is what was said a bit earlier. We have geographically diversified our production tools to be as close as possible to our customers. We can meet the requirements of a very strict regulatory framework, but also of consumers, on a global basis, in line with their needs. And we are the only ones to be able to do this. It is the privilege, but also the difficulty of being number one. In Brazil, we cannot but be satisfied. The year 2018 will have been the first full year of production, and we have excellent forecasts. As a reminder, it is the first market in volume in the world, and its monthly potential reaches about 90 million units. Our plant is way above the local level. It employs more than 50 people who produce bulk and conditioned products on five automated lines. Besides, if our customers request it, we can double our current capacity. In Japan, we are building a new extension to enhance our storage capacity, and we have actually become the main supplier of this country. It took us no less than 18 years to gradually reach this rank. In the US, our position is the same and, as you know, we have invested as much as 23 million dollars there over the past few years. Today, we have a wonderful plant. Lastly, we settled in India twenty years ago, deliberately positioning ourselves at the higher end of the scale, which represents about 15% to 20% of the market. We are more and more satisfied of our presence there. We are still present in Mexico, which remains a dynamic market, and we are continuing our efforts in China, despite the very tricky regulatory context. Premium Beauty News – You have made ""content"", but also ""container"" innovations! Pierre Miasnik - Exactly! We have been partly developing and registering our own packaging shapes for two years. It is an additional service we offer our customers, thanks to our technical service: they can draw a whole pack and have it developed by our suppliers. As regards packaging, we have just received a new filling machine in France, whose pace can reach 150 strokes per minute, so the line can produce about 100,000 units per day, with two teams working on it."
"""Green is the new black"" at Alkos!","With the ever-growing ""green"" phenomenon, cosmetic manufacturers are anticipating the new expectations of consumers who are increasingly checking on the origin of products and ingredients, the manufacturing conditions... Transparency has therefore become the rule in the beauty industry. With this in mind, the Alkos Group continues to imagine new sustainable and innovative solutions that respect the environment and its customers. Environmental and societal issues are part of the Group's DNA, which has always been committed to promoting Made in France products. Its three plants are located in France - Alkos Cosmétiques in Boulogne-sur-Mer, Inter Cosmétiques in Angers and SAGAL Cosmétiques in Chartres. The Alkos Group produces all its products (pencils, make-up, skincare, soaps and sticks) in France, thus contributing to the local sourcing, involving most of the major players in the French cosmetics industry. The Alkos Group, which has been specialising in a full service offer for many years, proposes eco-friendly solutions both in terms of formulation and packaging, which are consistent with its CSR approach. After partnering with the RPC Group to offer a 100% Made in France Chubby pencil offering (reduced carbon footprint and shortened lead times), the Group proposes for its new range of ""Natural Beauty"" products, packs made of recycled materials. At Cosmopack, the Group will unveil a range of almost 100% natural make-up and skincare products in PCR tubes or bottles and a range of pencils with several textures, coated with cellulose! At Cosmopack, the Alkos Group will present for the first time a brand new technological innovation consisting of cellulose pencils made from recycled paper fibres. An innovative solution for a sustainable and ecological recycling. These pencils made of bio-based materials can be sharpened as easily as wood or plastic pencils. In terms of formulation the main advantage is that these pencils can be filled with either 100% natural ""Clean"" formulas or long-lasting waterproof formulas requiring an airtight container. An ecological alternative to plastic of course but also to wood, a natural resource to protect. Don't miss the Cosmopack trade show, which will take place from March 14 to 17, and visit us at our Alkos stand (Hall 15 Stand E6D5) to discover all these brand-new innovations!"
IL Cosmetics wants to be perfectly in line with Clean Beauty,"As they strongly believe that, in the long run, actual growth cannot but be aligned with social development and environmental responsibility, IL Cosmetics have been strengthening their commitment and action. ""Far from being a constraint, the group's sustainable strategy represents both an economic driver and a source of inspiration and creativity for the teams,"" claims the company. As consumers increasingly mistrust chemical products, in particular in the nail varnish sector, manufacturers aim to gain their confidence, to offer reassuring transparency, and to meet growing concerns about the safe use of these products. The IL Cosmetics group has committed to working with consumers, brands, retailers, researchers, and the industry to demonstrate the key role the chemical technology can play in the transition towards a sustainable planet and society. ""A growing part of the population expects sustainable products, including nail varnish and makeup. Suppliers and brands get together to provide an answer,"" states IL Cosmetics. Overall, IL Cosmetics has undertaken to develop their nail varnish and makeup portfolio, while limiting the environmental impact and ensuring the safety of the final consumer. The vast majority of products in the company's portfolio can be highlighted as vegan, free from any controversial ingredients, not tested on animals and formulated with biosourced components. ""Obviously, just like for all IL Cosmetics products, no compromise is made on quality and sensoriality. Both colour and skincare biosourced formulas go through the same validation process as the rest of the portfolio. New biosourced skincare textures (cuticles, nail strengthening, finishing) have actually just been added to the offering, so that the percentage of natural ingredients can reach 90%."" As regards makeup, the Vegalash mascara provides a Vegan Cruelty Free solution without any compromise on volume. Plus, it is free from any controversial ingredients and beeswax, and enriched in jojoba oil and shea butter. Endowed with the same product benefits, 90% of the company's lip formulas (lipgloss, liquid lipstick, long-lasting, metallic formulations…) can be claimed as vegan, nano free, paraben free and mineral oil free. Of course, pursuant to the European regulation, all the formulas are cruelty-free. IL Cosmetics's CSR commitment is based on four pillars, the first being the environment. It is conveyed by the creation of a range of eco-friendly nail varnish and mascara containing up to 90% natural ingredients, and by responsible waste and energy management. Over the past five years, IL Cosmetics has increased their waste recycling rate by 400%. Over 70% of their waste is recycled. As regards energy, water consumption was reduced by more than 30% between 2014 and 2016, thanks to new installations. Then, there is social commitment and business ethics. IL Cosmetics complies with the fair trade rules regularly used by competent professional bodies to assess them and maintain the excellence of their quality processes, sustainability solutions, and ethics. Lastly, the last pillar is the sustainable purchasing policy. Suppliers are selected based on strict quality and logistics standards, taking into account their social and environmental commitments. Everyone goes through this internal approval process and signs a charter for compliance with the ethical commitment of IL Cosmetics. Until 2020, IL Cosmetics aims to go on with this CSR strategy and further improve their objectives for each of the four pillars."
Unilever to launch Love Beauty & Planet in France,"The Love Beauty & Planet project was born out of the desire of a team of Unilever's young employees in the U.S. to create the brand of their dreams. A brand that would take care of both people and the planet, with a reduced carbon footprint and a careful attention to every step of the production chain. From ingredients sourcing to the use of recyclable packaging made from recycled plastics and vegan formulas based on at least 98% natural substances: nothing is left to chance. In a market that is increasingly sensitive to ethical and environmental issues, natural cosmetics have become one of the main drivers of hygiene and beauty sales in the mass channel in France. Although they currently represent only a small part of the personal care market, organic and natural cosmetics are posting strong growth, thus forcing big brands to adapt their offer. In this respect, millennials are a very attractive target. This generation, which represents 25% of French households, but will account for half of the active population by 2020, is very sensitive to social and environmental issues, with a strong preference for ethical and recyclable products, with a strong attraction for everything natural. To appeal to Millennials, Love Beauty & Planet offers a positive and committed message, in line with the actions undertaken by Unilever for several years: ethical sourcing, in the food sector, and women's self-esteem campaigns with the Dove brand, for instance. Nourishing coconut oil, moisturising essential oil of Bulgarian rose, ylang-ylang with an exotic and powerful scent, not to mention the purifying effects of vetiver and rosemary: the range boasts many organic ingredients, and paraben, silicone and colour-free vegan formulas, offering up to 98% natural ingredients. However, synthetic ingredients may still be used in order to offer optimal sensorial results in terms of fragrances or hair texture. As far as oral hygiene is concerned, the range includes bamboo toothbrushes and toothpastes with activated charcoal and coconut oil. Most raw materials come from ethical sourcing, thanks to Givaudan's sustainable and responsible sourcing programs. All products use 100% recyclable packaging made from recycled plastics and featuring joyful colours, because pleasure is important too. Furthermore, to complete its eco-responsible approach, Unilever applies a self-imposed tax of 40 euros per tonne of carbon emitted, to fund a large European recycling program. As a result: a strong and bold brand, driven by a 100% digital communication in partnership with key influencers and communities, a range with a premium positioning, which aims to take a significant place on the natural market."
Essentia Beauty: Innovating to go beyond the boundaries of full service,"Premium Beauty News - What do you mean when you say, ""go beyond the mere notion of full service""? Katia di Martino - Our mission is to create unique concepts capable of meeting the expectations of a highly connected and informed consumer and accelerate their launch into the market. The single greatest challenge in beauty is just staying relevant and in the race. Given the way the beauty market is currently evolving, I think that agility is becoming more important than size now. We have shifted our focus from the corporate bottom line, to everyday human interests and behaviours due to the social media impact. That's the consumer side of the equation that is currently driving the market. And it is through innovation focused on real consumer's needs that we go beyond full service and develop beauty concepts integrated with AI and digital leverage. Premium Beauty News - Everyone pretends to be ""innovative""! Katia di Martino - True but today it is necessary to renew and regenarate the innovation process and that is what Essentia Beauty is doing. For instance, on ""Allmazing"", our web platform we use crowdsourcing to involve creatives in the development process. . Millennials are really the engine behind this new collaborative approach to idea making. I was 27 years old when I founded Essentia Beauty after having met a particularly talented formulator who lit the fire of my own creative potential. Twenty years later the ""Allmazing"" project has perpetuated the ideas I had in my youth and give voice to emerging creatives and professionals that will be the future of this business. We have to embrace challenges, as you know. Premium Beauty News - What is ultimately the best approach to make a difference? Katia di Martino - Marketing Basics dictate that the customer is at the center of the thinking process but, in practice, for companies, especially large ones, it is not that simple. To develop an empathetic relationship with the consumer, you need to put yourself in their place. This is well understood by ""indie brands"" such as Glossier or Merci Handy that find ways to involve their communities in their development process. Being ""Consumer focused"" means understanding the experience of the consumer, their desires and frustrations. They are sometimes banal everyday concerns that are beyond the limelight of the beauty world. Today the consumer has to deal with the paradox of an oversupply of cosmetic products that, at least superficially, seem to address all his or her possible needs. However, this same consumer is often unable to choose the right product from this ""disarray"" of options. Most women admit to having a hard time choosing their foundation and are lost amongst the myriad possibilities. We must provide solutions by understanding the root cause this consumer dilemma. This led us toward a targeted product approach. Along the way we incorporated artificial intelligence to match products to users. Today, we are the only full service company in the world to offer a personalized matching application based on facial recognition. This was pitched to ""native digitals"" who were immediately attracted by this kind of proposition. First it is a way of shopping that is familiar to them and secondly it better met their specific needs. Premium Beauty News - Environment, health, wellness: the new black? Katia di Martino - It is a fact that the consumer, especially the younger generation, is more aware of ""wellbeing"" and in search of forms of ""increased wellness"" for themselves and their community. This is a demand which reflects their desire to integrate ethical values into their consumption criteria. This explains the strong interest in ""clean beauty"" concepts imported from the United States, which combines the principle of safe formulation with ""cruelty free"" and ""eco-friendly"" requirements. But while this is all good news for people and the planet we must proceed with caution. For instance, 72% of millennials say they do not hesitate to switch brands if it does not correspond to their values. The old adage that what you consume defines who you are has never been truer. Essentia Beauty has been working on different research areas in order to provide customized solutions for different expectations. We're developing both Cosmos certified natural and organic lines and we also work on the Clean Beauty new growing demand which we believe has a high potential of development. Regarding packaging we work both on refill solutions, especially for premium packs and on new eco-friendly materials. At ADF&PCD Paris we have unveiled a new cap that makes a real ecological contribution since it is made with a single bio base material and is biodegradable with a variety of finishing options and will keep working on exploring make up packaging solution using the same know-how."
IL Cosmetics puts the analytical approach at the core of their strategy,"The approach consists in carrying out and regularly updating an analysis of the main beauty players on the main markets. The idea is to analyze their volumes, positioning, prices, assets… and get a global vision of all product segments for each market. The study relies on external sources (Mintel, Euromonitor, Nielsen, etc.), but also on a consumer analysis based on a comparative, qualitative, quantitative, and digital approach that better assesses their needs and behaviours. This analytical approach results in a map of each market, so that brands can fulfil their objectives. Let's take the example of the analytical approach IL Cosmetics applied to the nail varnish market. After several years of rapid growth, and then a drop in sales, the market is now stable. As a reminder, the nail varnish market fell by almost 50% between 2013 and 2018, declining from 6 billion units sold per year to less than 3 billion. The last fall was even more important due to various factors: – The increase in the market shares of gel varnish, which is also getting more stable. – The ratio of the quantity of products purchased: 1 gel varnish bottle for four standard nail varnish bottles. This is due to the fact that almost all gel solutions are intended for professional use. IL Cosmetics supplies semi-permanent varnish and has been working on a solution better-adapted to the retail channel. – A change in consumption habits. Women no longer change colours that often, plus they can wear the same semi-permanent varnish for several weeks. – The pressure of category and brand management at points of sale. Priority is given to products with a better margin per square meter. The nail varnish category loses presence and visibility, given its low retail prices, compared to other product categories. Still, it should be said that private labels have either managed to strongly increase their market shares or become leaders on their respective markets. They have chosen a business model based on a partnership with a full-service provider that helps them enter the market with efficient, trendy, more competitive solutions and a much shorter time-to-market. By applying this analytical strategy to all their development priorities, IL Cosmetics managed to contribute to the success of private labels in multichannel distribution networks, in the segments of nail varnish, but also makeup, with their Luxcos dedicated entity, whose market shares doubled in three years. Perfectly aware of the crucial role played by customer insight, the company has adopted a customer-oriented approach coupled with a quantitative assessment. Digital data complete the analysis table to take into account the fast-changing trends and consumer behaviours. ""Market research is at the core of our marketing strategy. It will help us strengthen our leadership on the market and consolidate our business units,"" says IL Cosmetics. The Long Wear technologies developed by IL Cosmetics helped their customer brands gain market shares, despite the current downturn, and reach the first rank in Europe. To consolidate this position, IL Cosmetics went on with their research work: they will introduce new formulas based on a brand new process at the next Cosmoprof show. These Last+Light Catch'R formulas are designed to boost the nail varnish gloss and adherence performance. Meanwhile, following a rising trend, formulas increasingly offer Long Wear+Care benefits, as they provide both the performance required for a nail varnish and the actives needed to strengthen nails."
Natura Brasil launches a perfume line for Europe and aims to strengthen their global identity,"Premium Beauty News - What does coordinating innovation at Natura & Co consist in? Roger Schmid - We have set up a joint fundamental research project between the three brands, Natura Brasil, Aesop, and The Body Shop, based on their different Best Practices. These three brands come from three different countries and offer three different cultures, with all the wealth it represents, but we do share basic values: we respect both nature and its people. We share the same desire to think more deeply about new approaches to reduce the environmental impact or revisit beauty rituals. We need to devise a new generation of products and better educate consumers. It is all being gradually implemented. And yet, the Natura culture does not involve a global unification – each brand should keep its own DNA. Premium Beauty News - How can you stand out on a market that sees so many brands emerge based on the same values, i.e. environmental protection? Roger Schmid - If this approach to cosmetics becomes widespread, even better! Natura has never tried to stand out with these values to make profit: they are intrinsic and involve much more than competition. Our mantra is ""Bem Estar Bem"", Feeling good together, and it is conveyed in many actions other than manufacturing cosmetic products. It has already been a few years since we received the B-Corp label, which certifies companies' commitment for the common good. We work with local communities in Amazonia, in accordance with the fair trade principles, so we respect their cultures and know-how. Natura has had a neutral carbon footprint since 2007, and we have been working on transparency and eco-design. The Ekos range will actually be relaunched in the middle of the year to become 100% Vegan. It is already 50% made of recycled and biosourced plastic, and soon we will reach 100%. We will do the same for all our ranges. We certainly need to share even more about all these actions. They also target biodiversity protection, knowledge transfer within communities, etc. But our group's culture is also about staying humble! Premium Beauty News - What about this new collection of eight perfumes, ""Collages""? Roger Schmid - Likewise, it was designed in line with our philosophy, with 100% organic alcohol derived from sugar cane and a recyclable bottle based on recycled cardboard. Collages was initially launched in the US, where we have two points of sale and an e-shop. It will be available this summer in France, our bridgehead for our presence in Europe. These perfumes are not designed to be offered in Brazil, because the unit price – 85 euros – is too high for our local customers. The range is rather aimed to invite international consumers to discover our country through the inspiration and olfactory perception of the three perfumers dedicated to these creations. For example, with its warm wood, pepper, and musk notes, Madeira Branca evokes a Niemeyer-like, strong and modern architecture. And Dom recalls the roughness of southern Brazilian gauchos, with vetiver, cypress, and musk notes… Brazil is the country of perfume, so we were legitimate in developing this category in Europe. Premium Beauty News - How does the group intend to develop in Europe and globally? Edouard Macquart-Moulin - As a reminder, Natura Brasil is the leader in Brazil and Latin America, thanks to direct selling, the brand's historical channel. In Brazil, we recently developed a network of about thirty points of sale to reach a different customer profile, without competing with our network of beauty advisors. In France, we opened two new points of sale a year ago, in addition to the store in Le Marais district. But, right now, we need some distance in France and Europe, so we are waiting before opening any new stores. As a complement to the e-shop, our strategy also focused on partnerships in different channels, online and offline (Birchbox, Amazon, Printemps, Beauty Monop). As for Natura Brasil's global development, we are going to rely on the experience of other brands in the group (for example, The Body Shop is very present in Asia) to adapt our distribution method – direct selling, online selling, or stores – to the culture and maturity of our markets. In line with the brand's globalization, the group has been working on revamping their visual identity with a new product and store design for next June."
TechnicoFlor aims to accelerate growth and explore potential acquisitions in France and abroad,"As their turnover rose by 18% in 2018, the TechnicoFlor group can boast strong performance, despite a tense situation on the perfume raw material market. ""We managed to keep up our growth pace. But the pressure on the price of raw materials compelled us to make huge efforts. We had to swell our lead-time inventory and reduce our margins,"" explains General Manager Patrice Rouan. To enhance its growth, the perfume house based near Marseille, in the south of France, benefits both from the strong growth of many Asian markets and a solid presence in the Middle East. Today, 75% of TechnicoFlor's turnover is achieved outside France. The group has four production sites around the world, in Marseille (France), Shanghai (China), Miami (Florida, USA), and Jakarta (Indonesia), for a total capacity of about 2,750 tonnes per yearé. They also count business offices in Dubai and Singapore. Asia accounts for about 40% of total sales, and the Middle East and Africa region, 15% to 20%. Lastly, the company benefits from a consolidated presence in Russia and a few countries in Europe and central Asia. ""Ever since the company was founded in 1982, we have aimed to develop our presence on the global level, by entering multiple markets. The idea was to accelerate our return on investment, while limiting risks,"" recalls Patrice Rouan. To him, the company's development potential is still huge. ""In the short and medium term, we intend to enter new major markets, like Brazil and India, and to strengthen our foothold in areas offering a strong growth potential, like China and the US. Here and there, our development may involve acquisitions or alliances."" As regards North America, the company is about to restructure its business to secure a commercial presence in the New York City region by 2020. TechnicoFlor, whose motto is Creating is our Nature, perceived the potential of naturalness as soon as it was created, even when it was still a niche in the perfume world. The team is committed to exceptional perfumery, protecting both the product and the environment, and intends to become an expert in this field. The Natflor range by TechnicoFlor – 100% natural, Cosmos-compliant perfumes – has already become a reference for their customers. Meanwhile, to ensure both the continuity and quality of natural raw material supplies and a fair income for producers, the group developed a sustainable patchouli supply chain in Indonesia. And they are about to do the same with ylang-ylang in Madagascar. While the natural market is booming, TechnicoFlor benefits from a pioneering position on this segment. ""We aim to offer natural perfumes with absolute creativity and quality, while protecting both producers and the environment. We offer a very wide palette, with a great variety of essential oils and isolates. Today, thanks to this diversity of raw materials and to the talent of our committed perfumers, we can create almost without any limits, including notes that would surprise you, like '100% natural gourmand notes'"", highlights Caroline Catherine, Development Director for the European market. The breadth of their portfolio of olfactory creations and natural raw materials helped TechnicoFlor seduce many of the greatest names in perfumes and cosmetics, with customers such as Unilever, Nuxe (both the Nuxe and Bio Beauté by Nuxe ranges), LVMH, as well as niche players, like luxury perfume house Ormaie Paris. ""Every year, we develop creative books for various product categories. This way, we can make multiple suggestions, innovate, and keep inspiring both our perfumers and customers,"" emphasizes Marketing Director Pauline Vesque. To maintain their lead in the field of naturalness, TechnicoFlor is considering an external growth operation in France in 2019. ""We want to make strong progress on the European market and be more present for global players,"" explains Patrice Rouan. They have already established contacts with operators in the French region of Grasse. In the meantime, TechnicoFlor will launch construction works for their new France-based plant in early April. The 12-million-euro project is aimed to double the production capacity and enhance the company's reactivity and agility for delivery lead times reduced to less than five days. To be continued!"
The Beauty Partners supports new beauty brands on the French market,"Being the birthplace of cosmetics, France has the reputation of having a very competitive market, where it is complicated for new entrants to create an efficient direct bond with retailers. ""Foreign brands are too far and do not benefit from any local intermediary, and young French brands do not necessarily have the means to form a sales team that could follow up their presence in stores or online,"" explains Gabrielle Levasseur, founder of The Beauty Partners. ""I felt like offering this local commercial intermediary solution between the brand and retailers, because when you are not out in the field to follow a brand, it just does not grow,"" adds the former Sales Development Director Cosmetics of La Prairie and Guerlain, among others. To The Beauty Partners, a ""commercial intermediary"" ensures a field monitoring and guarantees key parameters: enforcement of the agreements signed with the point(s) of sale, compliant merchandising, a coherent brand image, trained sales teams, implementation of sales drivers, negotiation, active search of new prospects... The Beauty Partners provides this service for selective distribution (networks, concept stores, department stores), physical points of sale, and websites in France, Luxembourg, and Monaco. ""We define ourselves as agents acting as intermediaries between brands and the selective distribution,"" sums up Gabrielle Levasseur. The advantage of this sales force outsourcing offer is that it both helps these brands settle, sticking to their own image, and ensures they will last on the market through a strategy of visibility- and dynamics-oriented actions. Today, The Beauty Partners works with almost ten brands, including Ellis Faas, NCLA, La Brûmée, Lavandière de Provence, and newly arrived Italian skincare leader Collistar, now distributed in Marionnaud stores: the company helps them with product training. They also support natural Korean brand Pure Heal's in the field. Thanks to high flexibility and affordability, The Beauty Partners adapts to the expectations of new brands increasingly present and popular in the selective channel."
Adopt' aims to open 30 new stores annually in France over the next five years,"Premium Beauty News - Your offering was initially focused on accessories. How did perfume become a key element? Olivier Raulin - We observed a change in consumption patterns: today, people want simpler, more affordable, faster-changing fragrances. So, we chose simple, pure scents, like Coco, Vanille Gourmande des Antilles, or Ylang Ylang de Madagascar. The idea is to offer sober, interchangeable, travel-size (30 ml) perfumes that can be associated with other fragrances in the range and cost less than 7 euros. Now, we have 150 references which we regularly modify, and we plan one or two launches per month. Our simple, colourful packaging is identical for all references – only the juices and labels change. We make our products in France, in our plant near Bordeaux, and we work on juices with some of the greatest noses in Grasse. Beyond perfume, we aim to develop the notion of look through affordable cosmetics and fashion accessories. We target 20-30-year-old working women with an average budget. Today, each activity represents about a third of our turnover (perfumes, cosmetics, and accessories) – perfumes only accounted for 18% of it in 2015. Premium Beauty News - How do you communicate with your customers? Olivier Raulin - We do not use corporate communication for advertising, but we are very present on social media through partnerships with influencers. We launch co-created perfumes, and we organize events with influencers, like the 8th anniversary of La Penderie de Chloé. We are very active with our community: we share product creations, meetings with perfumer creators… All this helped us reach the 98th rank on the TubeReach barometer for YouTube in Europe (in July-August 2018), and the 143rd rank on Instagram, out of 500 brands, on the European level. That is quite interesting, because we are only present in France. In addition, we have just launched a new store concept at the Belle Épine shopping mall, south of Paris, where our customers can interact with a screen and fill in a questionnaire to get suggestions of adapted perfumes! See box. Premium Beauty News - What are your development priorities? Olivier Raulin - Our consumers are young working women. We are positioned in shopping malls, near fashion stores, but also in city centres. And we are very well-established in big French cities and their suburbs, with six points of sale in Marseille and Lyon, five in Bordeaux, and seven in Paris. We own 185 stores (190 by the end of 2019), including 40 franchises, mainly located in France's overseas territories. Our turnover reached 36 million euros in 2017 and we sell one fragrance every 10 seconds in France. We intend to grow by opening as many as 30 stores annually over the next five years in France, and then around the world, on neighbouring, similar markets in terms of consumption, like Italy, Spain, and Germany. We also sell our products on the global level, thanks to distributors in China, Russia, Belgium, Algeria, Taiwan, and Dubai, among others. We boast key advantages to seduce foreign consumers, in particular in China, where we aim to open about 100 stores in four years. We would like to keep using an accessible language, with an approach based on the use, rather than on the technicity of perfume. Our range already makes it possible to use layering, a current growing trend, and we would like to develop this. On top of that, we have diversified our business by launching perfume derivatives (body care, shower gels, etc.) and boxes containing 125 ml bottles, together with soaps, shower gels, or body milks. Adopt' is gradually finding its own place in the French landscape. We highlight our local manufacturing choice (France and Europe) to seduce our consumers in search of authenticity. A digitized store concept At the Belle Épine shopping mall, Adopt' partnered with HMY to launch a digitized concept aimed to renew the customer experience. It is now focused on the brand's three basics: perfumes, cosmetics, and fashion accessories. Three innovations were designed and implemented: – The parfumothèque, the flagship feature of the new concept, is fitted with an interactive screen: after a few questions on her search, mood, and tastes, the application offers the customer a selection of three perfumes which light up on the wall to make it easier to discover the fragrances selected. – Make-up stations enable customers to test the products they chose on their own or to ask a beauty advisor for a free makeup session or personalized tips. Thanks to the tablet under the mirror, the customer has access to various tutorials and associated product advice. The tables are fitted with cameras for customers to take pictures of themselves and share them on social media. – There are screens in the windows and in the stores (on the walls and behind the cashdesks). The Adopt' headquarters manage their content so it is adapted to the year's events, commercial operations, and product launches. The products can be personalized in the stores."
Groupe GM in line with the dynamics of the hotel amenities market,"Premium Beauty News - Groupe GM seems to be doing very well. Stéphanie Thévenot - Indeed, we have achieved very strong growth over the past few years, both on the production and distribution levels. Business-wise, we have signed several partnership contracts with renowned global hotel chains, like Mandarin Oriental and Sofitel, and we have just been referenced in the amenities programme of one of the biggest world groups in the luxury hotel industry, with five of the brands we represent: Éditions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, Guerlain, Atelier Cologne, Codage, and Le petit Prince. In 2015, we produced 40 million tubes and bottles. In 2018, this figure reached 65 million, and we plan to make 85 million in 2019! To meet these new production requirements, we have invested 4.5 million euros to extend our French site in Lyon, dedicated to foaming products (shower gels, shampoos…) and emulsions, plus 2.4 million in our Portugal-based soap plant. Premium Beauty News - You have just inaugurated a new subsidiary in Hong Kong to enhance your presence in Asia. What are your next external growth projects? Stéphanie Thévenot - This new subsidiary in Hong Kong also covers Macau, so, in addition to China and Taiwan, we now have three subsidiaries in Asia, where we are present in most countries. We will now target new strategic markets, like India. Premium Beauty News - What about Brazil? Stéphanie Thévenot - Since the elections, there has been a new momentum, an acceleration. We have beautiful projects in this country. Premium Beauty News - Just like most manufacturers, you are facing an ecological emergency. Can you tell us more about brands' demand and your strategy? Stéphanie Thévenot - We are at an ecological turning point, so we have been questioning our model. We need to think about new solutions, about a different approach to these single-use products. A few of our customers have already committed to this strategy, like Mandarin Oriental. They have embraced a zero plastic policy for 2019, and it integrates their amenities. All these major groups are aware of the emergency to get rid of plastic. As an answer, we have set up the Care about Earth programme: we undertake to reduce our products' impact on the environment as soon as the development phase. More specifically, as an alternative for voluntary brands, we offer 300 ml Ecopumps with a plant-based bottle made of resins derived from sugar cane. We also make eco-sourced wall-mounted airless dispensers, which represent 58 times less plastic material than 30 ml bottles. Some of our packs are already based on recycled plastic, in particular our own line, Scandinavian White. Two other solutions are under study: they are based on additives which accelerate the decomposition of plastics chemical structure. As regards our formulations, they are already highly environmentally friendly, since they contain at least 90% natural ingredients – 92% for shampoos. Our formulas are Ecocert-approved and Cosmebio-labelled. Our soaps are 99% derived from plants and we are committed to using sustainable, RSPO-certified palm oil. Ultimately, we have been working on a Care about Earth formula containing no controversial ingredient. Last, but not least, we have developed solid formulas, in particular for shampoos. This plastic-free solution also helps reduce water consumption during the manufacturing phase. Premium Beauty News - What are your future objectives? Stéphanie Thévenot - One of our main objectives is to broaden our brand portfolio. It is a major ambition, because we endeavour to keep offering new services and exclusive products. Apart from the green demand, today, many hotels want to be able to choose among different luxury brands. Right now, we have about thirty brands, including new ones, like Courrèges and Caudalie, and a new, very important one will soon be announced."
"Dario Ferrari, Intercos: ""Innovation is more than ever at the centre of the game!""","Premium Beauty News - The year 2017 will be remembered by Intercos officials as banner year... What about 2018? Dario Ferrari - We are clearly not in the same configuration. Globally, in 2017 demand was strong, especially in the field of make-up. This year, on the other hand, it was more difficult, and this is true whatever the place in the world. Yet, skincare has succeeded in staying afloat and if brand owners managed to achieve significant growth, it certainly due to this sector. What is driving the market today is both the prestige market and, geographically-speaking, the Chinese market where the skincare category has more than doubled from one year to the other. Europe is clearly at a standstill in terms of growth. Premium Beauty News - Did had to review your growth prospects? Dario Ferrari - That's right! We had optimistically forecasted an overall growth of 14% for the Group, and we will eventually close the year at 7%, which is still a very good performance. Premium Beauty News - Innovation remains the main driver! Dario Ferrari - Always, of course! This is our strength and will always be in the face of competition. 900 hundred people are exclusively dedicated to this task in our 11 innovation centres around the world. An innovation management that gives fantastic results in Korea, Switzerland and the Netherlands a country where as you know, our laboratory in Maastricht works in close collaboration with a cluster of Universities and start-ups (nearly 150!). And the hot issue right now as you can imagine, concerns sustainability and clean beauty. We are working together on new products and polymers in a research and technology environment that clearly does not exist anywhere else. But we also work with two other universities in Germany and Belgium. Premium Beauty News - Packaging is a building block of your activity. Do you agree? Dario Ferrari - Indeed, packaging is clearly a very important element of our business. And the idea of improving our expertise in this field is always on the agenda. Integrating in the group a company specialized in this area is one of the options."
Olfaplay: Guerlain's vocal app dedicated to perfume lovers,"Our first olfactory emotions, love stories, trips, outstanding personalities, exceptional dishes... These are all memories and emotions we can now listen to and share online thanks to this new podcast app that gives pride of place to sensoriality. In nine minutes maximum, everyone can share some of their olfactory intimacy, anonymously. Olfaplay stages what perfume finally does so well: recount stories. While synaesthetic processes around perfume abound, they generally only explore the link between smell and taste or smell and images. This new application that sublimates the emotional part of the perfume, through the sense of hearing is rather original. As Laurent Boillot, CEO of Guerlain highlighted, it is a way of ""giving life to memories conveyed by perfume, to transcribe invisible, impalpable emotions."" But it is also an attempt to federate the community of perfume lovers around audio creations, like blogs did, about a decade ago, through writing. Indeed, with Olfaplay, the aim is not to talk about the perfume offer in the Guerlain catalogue, but about perfumes in a broader sense. And actually, during recording sessions, it was not possible to mention names of perfumes; the idea was more to share some intimate memories, to go deep in one's olfactory memory. Developed by Guerlain's digital service in collaboration with Plink (for the recording of podcasts) and Octave & Octave (for the digital application), Olfaplay enables perfumes lovers to record one of their memories on the theme of their choice. But also to listen to those of others, filtering them by mood, or olfactory universe. Like other social networks, it is possible to ""like"" a story and leave a comment. New features could be added in 2019, since the app could be enriched with an audio message, to leave or listen to when someone offers or receives a gift for example. Next year looks just as exciting, since Guerlain also plans to develop an audio series around its 180 years of history, to develop an olfactory card in the manner of an audio-guide, or to imagine ""olfactory contests"" in order to meet people via the Olfaplay app. Quite a programme in perspective! For the time being, Olfaplay is only available in French but the app should be available in English in the course of 2019."
LF Beauty looks to the future of beauty under its new brand name Meiyume,"Premium Beauty News - Can tell us more about your rebrand as Meiyume? Gérard J. Raymond - That's right! LF Beauty divested from Li & Fung in April 2018 and is now owned by the Fung Group (55%) and Hony Capital (45%). Since then, we've been on a transformation journey and believed it was the right time for us to take on a new brand identity that better reflects who we are, the values that make us unique, and our direction moving forward. Pronounced ""may-you-may"", which is a fusion of Mei (美), Chinese for beauty, and Yume (夢), Japanese for dream, Meiyume marks our next chapter with a renewed focus on our business strategy of (Em)powering Beauty Solutions. At the same time we took the opportunity to restructure the company into three key divisions: Packaging & Turnkey Solutions, Retail Solutions and Brands. Our company employs 2000 people across 5 production sites and 15 subsidiaries globally (including the US, France, UK, Germany, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, China and Hong Kong). More than just a name change, our rebrand represents a whole new philosophy and unique commercial and industrial strategy. The world has changed, and it is still changing every day at an exponential pace. The relationship between suppliers - like Meiyume - and our customers are and must be totally different. Simply producing is not enough to sell products to our customers, just like simply reacting to the needs of our customers will no longer suffice either. We have entered another world that's digital and with fast-changing consumption habits where the old supplier and customer scheme no longer works. Moving forward, we need to empower and work as a collaborator with brands, retailers, start ups etc to help them find innovative solutions that shape their dreams into reality through experimentation & rapid prototyping. Premium Beauty News - Would you say that listening, understanding and supporting customers have become cardinal virtues? Gérard J. Raymond - In a way, yes you could say that. Rather than having this ""supplier"" mindset, we see ourselves as a collaborator. Customers today are forced to cope with huge constraints, truly unimaginable from just a few years ago, in terms of speed-to-market, quality, sustainability, social responsibility and consumer safety. Competition is accelerating Customers need support, advice, attentive listening and, above all, concrete results. Premium Beauty News - Can you elaborate a little bit more on this idea of Meiyume as a partner to its customers? Gérard J. Raymond - Our approach can be summed up by these four words: ""Try, Learn, Improve, Apply"". The idea is to create a true notion of collaboration with our customers by having them participate in brainstorming sessions where, through attentive listening, discussions and proposals, we then create solutions that are closest to consumers' expectations. The key is to do this quickly. For instance, can we do in 9 months what previously took 18 months? That's demonstrating our value. On our side of the partnership, we always adhere to the rule of never saying ""I know"". Rather, our teams must listen, learn and start again until the right solution emerges. Our message to customers is: ""Trust us, we are here to find solutions. We are creating the right links to help Beauty take on its full meaning. We are much more than a, supplier we are your collaborator."""
Henkel goes on the offensive in the segment of organic and natural beauty,"For the German multinational Group, there is no doubt that the hygiene-beauty market is undergoing a profound transformation. ""The drop in sales on the mass market has to do with two major phenomena,"" explained the Group's marketing team in France. ""For 60% it is due to a phenomenon of de-consumption, in connection with concerns about products and the ingredients they contain and to the simplification of beauty routines, and for 40% to consumers migrating to other circuits."" To these two explanations, can also be added the ageing of the population, which is very noticeable in some European countries. Between 2016 and 2017, the share of consumers who said they had reduced their purchases and consumption of cosmetic and toiletry products, because of concerns on the quality of products, has jumped from 31% to 41%! This therefore is a particularly strong trend. However, some beauty routines and products seem to have played their cards better. ""Products like dry shampoos or micellar waters, which did not exist a few years ago, now have a significant weight in the market,"" said Henkel officials. The Group believes that the beauty market is undergoing profound changes, driven by three fundamental trends: a desire to consume more wisely, with a varying level of commitment depending on the product category (from the mere rejection of certain controversial ingredients to a requirement for certified products, including a preference for natural products); the emergence of new uses and new targets likely to represent important growth drivers (seniors, women aged 35-55, men, millennials, multi-ethnic groups) and finally, the need to reinvent the store experience. The success of natural and organic cosmetics brands like SO 'BiO étic from the Léa Nature Group shows that it is the trend for a ""wiser consumption"" that is driving growth in many categories, particularly in skincare, hair care and shower products. Dental hygiene is in an intermediate position while hair styling products and hair dyes are somewhat behind, yet, in these categories, things can change rather quickly as and when a new and performing offer appears on store shelves. In short, the takeover of small brands in terms of sales growth is prompting large groups to react. It is therefore on these grounds for ""a wiser consumption"" that Henkel has chosen to concentrate its offensive. The Group, which can already rely on an organic expertise thanks to the success on the marked of its Vademecum Bio toothpastes, believes that the offer is insufficient in supermarkets while organic stands as an important source of revenue growth in the hygiene and beauty segment. Following the launch of Nature Box, more specifically in Germany, Henkel is giving a new significant impetus to the repositioning of its offer with the launch of N.A.E. (Naturale Antica Erboristeria), a 100% organic variation of the Italian multi-category brand Antica Erboristeria founded in 1979 and which belongs to the Group since 2012. The positioning is clearly on a face-to-face competition with La Provençale Bio, launched by L'Oréal this year. All N.A.E. products are made up with a minimum of 97% natural ingredients and sustainability efforts have also been made on packagings. Bottles for the liquid soap are made of 100% recycled and recyclable PET, cardboard cases are designed with inks specially suited to meet the recycling process while tubes are made of plant based plastic (Braskem). The offer consists of 26 references in the average price line for organic products (from 4.5 euros). N.A.E. id being launched first in France (December 2018 and early 2019) and in Scandinavia, which are the most advanced European markets in terms of organic cosmetics. The brand will then be rolled out in Italy in the course of 2019. But Henkel's offensive does not stop here. The Group is also planning to relaunch its Vademecum Bio toothpaste brand with a new reference for sensitive teeth and two references for children (1-6 year olds and 6+). The launch of a toothbrush with a 100% biodegradable bamboo handle is planned for May 2019. Most of the other brands in the Group will also go through the wringer of organic and natural. The cosmetic offer of Le Chat soaps for example, will be relaunched in April 2019. The new hand wash gels will be made of 94% natural ingredients, paraben free, mineral oil free and vegan certified. The Barnängen brand, which has snatched more than 1% MS in the French body care market in just 5 months, will expand its offering to hand care products. The Fa brand, whose paraben free and vegan line, Island Vibe, was a big hit with under-25, will consist of 90% natural ingredients. Interestingly, this realignment towards a ""wiser consumption"" was not necessarily met with an increase in prices, although some adjustments were sometimes necessary. ""Prices must remain affordable because what is also at stake with this wiser consumption trend is also to democratize it and make it accessible to as many people as possible,"" explained the Group."
Léa Nature to double cosmetics production capacity in two years,"Founded in 1993 by Charles Kloboukoff on the outskirts of La Rochelle, France, the Léa Nature group managed to settle as one of the main players in the fields of organic food and organic & natural cosmetics in just over two decades. In the cosmetics sector, the flagship brand sold in supermarkets, SO' BiO étic, holds 28.3% market shares, which ranks it first, with a growth rate of over 35%. The Jonzac, Natessance, and Douce Nature brands, which are sold through specialized networks, also achieve a strong growth. All in all, Léa Nature counts 500 different references in skincare, hygiene, makeup, and hair care. Today, the group supports this development in line with consumer expectations by opening an ecodesigned plant that spreads across 6,000 m2 dedicated to the manufacturing and conditioning of hypoallergenic, hygiene, and beauty products. ""The project was initially launched in 2010. At first, we had an 800 m2 manufacturing workshop within the company. But, since 2012, the permanent growth curve has enhanced the project with more ambitious objectives. It has turned from a workshop to a plant, an autonomous site designed around a process aimed to produce with a high reliability and quality level,"" explains Julien Campion, the group's Cosmetics Production Manager. ""In 2016, we produced 10 million units. Now, it is 15 million, and in 2019, it will be 20. This figure already doubled in two years, so we need to get ready for this continuous growth, which corresponds to the market shares we gained from conventional products,"" he adds. The site is divided into 4 parts: an area dedicated to manufacturing, which went from 250 m2 to over 1,000 m2, a 1,100 m2 conditioning workshop featuring five filling lines, 2,000 m2 for packaging and raw material flow management, and 2,000 m2 for administration offices and Quality, Innovation, and R&D laboratories. Faithful to its values, the group imposed a specific design and process to minimize the production environmental impact. They mainly focused on three aspects: water consumption, the discharge of effluents, and energy consumption. ""The cosmetics industry is subject to critical water consumption, whether it is to make products with purified water or to clean up machines. We were committed to focusing on this point,"" explains Julien Campion. The approach consisted in building a three-floor osmosis facility to produce 1,500 litres/hour of purified water, while minimizing discharge to the sewer. As regards tool disinfecting water, the idea is to optimize the various rinsing cycles, wastewater recovery, and pasteurization. Osmosis optimization will save 500 m3 of water per year, and 1,000 m3 will be saved as part of the cleaning process. ""This model should make it possible to save more than 10% of our water needs,"" says Julien Campion. The site will also be fitted with a treatment facility based on the ""biological disc"" technology to capture all effluents and treat them naturally. In addition, most materials are ecological: linoleum floors made of natural fibres, without PVC, or wooden floors, natural paints, and LED lighting. ""If Léa Nature did not use to be widely perceived as an industrial reference in cosmetics, it is becoming one,"" observes Julien Campion. Designed to evolve and get larger, depending on the group's growth, the plant will be inaugurated in its first phase, in January 2019, and will start operating in April. It will help fulfil the production objective estimated at 21 million units in 2019, and then 40 million in 2021. It represents an investment of 20 million euros, including seven for manufacturing and conditioning equipment. ""We need to be able to make both small series and shower gels in large quantities to match the diversity of our references. The challenge for this plant is to keep our natural flexibility, while satisfying the industrial capacity needs, so that the organic sector can keep booming,"" concludes the production manager."
Cosnova enters the Brazilian market aiming makeup leadership,"After entering the US market, Cosnova Beauty will now be expanding their operations to Brazil with their makeup brand Essence. The German group has had Brazil on its radar for a few years and made its final decision last year, when its sales outside Germany grew by a record 18.6%, according to figures published by Nielsen. ""We believe now is the time to do it. Brazil is one of the most important cosmetics markets in the world, so Essence will have many opportunities as it launches in the country,"" said Tatiana D'Alessio Sombra, marketing manager at Cosnova Brasil. ""We are very excited and confident that our new Brazil operation will help us achieve our goal of becoming the leading cosmetics company worldwide in terms of volume."" In Brazil specifically, the goal is to have Essence figure among the top five leading industry companies within five years. The company has opted to ship all products directly from Germany to set up their brand-new operations in Brazil. Essence outsources all manufacturing, since it does not have production plants of its own. In Brazil, it will start by selling around 300 of their nail, lip, eye and face makeup products (out of a portfolio consisting of more than 800 products). The diversity of the Essence product range, which is geared towards younger consumers, is one of the brand's main assets to stand out among the competition already in place in Brazil. ""Our business model is based on innovation - 50% of our portfolio is renewed every year. We also launch limited editions every two months. Brazilian women traditionally like having this much variety, because they are always in search of new products,"" said Sombra. According to her, approximately two-thirds of all company employees work in innovation, analyzing and researching the main global fashion and beauty trends, as well as consumer behavior and desires, in order to develop new product lines. ""It is an ongoing, rigorous process."" Sombra also said that Cosnova Beauty has already determined the items that will be launched or discontinued in its two upcoming six-month collections. Essence's other big draw is its price-point. The company assures it will be maintained its reasonable prices in Brazil, despite the recent rise in the US dollar exchange rate and the high import duties levied on foreign products. ""Essence's market positioning will be strategic and competitive, with accessible prices, starting from R$ 5.90 for nail polishes and going up to R$ 42.90 for liquid foundation,"" said Sombra. ""We are investing long-term in Brazil, and our plans will not be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate. Our production scale offsets our import duties."" To distribute its products in Brazil, Cosnova Beauty has formed partnerships with local companies. A logistics company will import and disembark all products, while a second company will be responsible for product storage. According to Sombra, product distribution in Brazil will follow the company's international commercial planning guidelines, with items being sold at drugstores, department stores, cosmetics stores, fashion chains, and online shops, as well as through their very own e-commerce platform. Currently, Essence products are available at large cosmetics stores in São Paulo, such as Sumirê, RaiaDrograsil's online shopping platforms and the website Beleza Web. In 2019, sales will be expanded to Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo, after which they will go nation-wide. Sombra also said that in the near future Cosnova Beauty will start looking for local partners to develop and manufacture their products directly in Brazil. ""We want to effectively identify and address the needs of Brazilian consumers,"" she said."
IL Cosmetics is stepping up a gear!,"""When you observe such a sharp and rapid decline in a market like nail polish and when you see that it is not only cyclical but structural, not that many solutions are available, you have to change gear and make the right decisions,"" explains Jean-François Harpes, President of IL Cosmetics. Some solutions had already been implemented in the past by the Luxembourg firm. Like for example, the diversification towards make-up products started as early as 2003, or in terms of logistics, with the decision to relocate the filling and packaging operations in more competitive countries (Poland and Bulgaria). ""As you know,"" says Jean-François Harpes, ""we haven't stopped modernizing our historic industrial site in Luxembourg by increasing its capacity. We also have a new R&D centre. But at the same time, we absolutely needed to increase our filling capacity. This allowed us to double the size of our Polish factory and to open a brand new production site in Bulgaria. This site also has an oversized logistics platform. A unit which can be used to package other products in our make-up range, especially mascaras and lip gloss, and which will also enable a future expansion for the production of nail polish and gel polish."" In Poland (25 packaging lines over a 12,000 m² production area), the firm mostly packages nail polishes and some make-up products. While Bulgaria (10,000 m²) is more focused on the packaging of make-up products. ""Regarding the nail polish market, the finding is clear and irrevocable. Gel has become unavoidable. Its development has radically changed consumer habits. It obviously changes the quantities of nail polish produced in the world. We therefore decided to offer a complete range of Gel Polish. Compared to other popular products on the market, our products offer the same glossiness, holding power and ease of removal but at a much more competitive price. One of our strong points is that our colour approach allows us to offer the entire nail colour sample library (seasonal, trend editions, special effects...) in a gel polish version,"" details the Head of IL Cosmetics. As for the make-up approach, Dr. Christophe Delas, Head of the Luxcos entity, wanted it to be specifically focused on the lips, eyes and face. Mascaras developments for example focus mostly on volume with a clear R&D work to increase separation / definition. In general, whether for cream mascaras or waterproof mascaras, vegan products add up to the performances mentioned above. ""On the side of lip products, whether for long-lasting matte formulas or glossy formulas, the R&D work (formula and / or colour) is based on common guidelines. That is to say, always more payoff and comfort, and gliding formulas, that remain homogeneous upon application,"" he explains. ""For matte formulas, we are working on products that do not dry the lips. For glossy formulas, again we must avoid both a feeling of heaviness and a thick or sticky film and work on an optimum shine. Note that we are also working on formulas that blur lip imperfections or even give them a plump effect (without using ingredients that give a stinging sensation). Finally for foundations, what matters is the holding power and comfort with a strong skincare orientation."" This is obviously a ""key asset"". The Luxembourg firm is keen to highlight its Made in Luxembourg expertise, which, according to Jean-François Harpes, allows a perfect balance between rigour and creativity. ""We have invested a lot in this area,"" he says, ""by creating a real pole of colour expertise for all the products in the Group's portfolio, by creating independent Marketing / R&D Business Units for each product category, the whole of it in a multicultural environment (marketing and sales) which is a real plus to understand the needs of the different markets. As for rigour, the fact that all the products manufactured are in strict conformity with European regulations is a real seal of guarantee. It is a batch to batch guarantee of reproducibility. It is also a commitment to quality through a complete system of procedures and of objectified consumer panels. It is finally also the proof of an industrial know-how and of a full service approach enabling to offer Made in Luxembourg products at a very competitive price."""
My Beauty Community lets consumers speak,"Today, the application is part of the Top 3 beauty apps on Android and keeps widening its community circle: it already counts almost 50,000 downloads. The founder, Marine Chevalier, started from the simple observation that an increasing number of consumers are interested in sharing their opinions on cosmetic products online. However, these comments raise suspicion and create restraint among people in search of advice who think they are often biased, due to the influence of brands on certain platforms. ""In 2017, over 70% of consumers visited online platforms before making a purchase, but 90% of them had doubts about the authenticity of the reviews they read. So, I wanted to create a genuine, neutral platform where real customers would talk about Beauty,"" she explains. Following a ten-year professional marketing career at Doux Me, Birchbox, and Sephora, and after creating and maintaining a beauty blog, Marine Chevalier benefitted from a 360° vision of the industry. In 2017, she partnered with computer scientist and technical director David Moothen to launch My Beauty Community, based on the idea that people would share their opinions within a community of subscribers. The user shapes up their own profile by answering a few questions to be able to exchange with other community subscribers with a similar profile. ""We suggest other profiles of users sharing the same problems and interests, so that they can create a bespoke community to their own image and receive authentic, relevant reviews,"" adds Marine Chevalier. Then, they can have conversations about products, needs, tips, or flops, and they can share their own favourite products and make recommendations. The more active the user, the more points they get in their own kitty, which gives them priority access to product tests at home or to various event experiences. The lucrative side of the concept lies in the test campaigns, which are accurately targeted according to the beauty profiles of a community. ""We have extremely precise data and we know our subscribers very well, which helps brands very accurately target individuals based on 30 profiling questions, but also on their activities,"" says the co-founder. Personal data are absolutely never transmitted to brands. ""As regards test campaigns, it is not the brand that manages the shipments to our subscribers' postal addresses, it is a supplier,"" she adds. Based on these data, My Beauty Community also conducts ad hoc researches at the request of brands . The website generates 250 spontaneous posts per day on average, which represents a valuable source of information for them. The other profitable part of the concept relies on the membership to various platforms: it gives access to product flows suggested to the subscribers willing to buy a product directly on the distributor's website. So far, 60,000 product references have been made available through the Sephora, Feelunique, Nocibé, or Yves Rocher catalogues. ""What is also differentiating is that we put people in contact with each other, and they help each other, for example by recommending products. We do not take part in this, we do not push products. And it corresponds to our vision: it is much better to be advised by someone authentic,"" explains Marine Chevalier. Today, My Beauty Community mainly reaches the Millennials generation and is developing in France, Benelux, and North Africa. Right now, they are raising funds for the application, which should be deployed on the global level."
Nichebox: A new fund to help independent brands develop,"Former Director of Perfume Holding, Dino Pace founded Nichebox thanks to the support of private investors and of a Swiss fund. He aimed to be positioned as a partner, rather than a purchaser of brands with a strong potential on the growth-driving niche market. ""We travel the world in search of brands with a unique signature, a story to tell, and a strong concept,"" he explains. ""We are not only a financial investor, we also offer our thorough expertise, while keeping the founding creators in the driver's seat to ensure the continuity of the concept,"" he adds. Liquides Imaginaires perfectly matched this profile, so they became the first brand to join the Nichebox portfolio. Dino Pace intends to partner with founders Philippe Di Méo and David Frossard, who are still shareholders and respectively General Manager and Artistic Director, in order to make various investments in digital communication, product development, and commercial initiatives. ""We have great ambitions for Liquides Imaginaires. This brand has a huge potential, in particular in China,"" says Dino Pace. In fact, the brand will open several wholly-owned stores in China by the end of the year and inaugurated a first flagship store in Beijing on October 26. As for Nichebox, they should announce new purchases before 2018 ends. Independent perfume and cosmetics brands with a strong growth potential are increasingly attracting investors and major groups, because they are seen as a way to accelerate growth. The Cattleya Finance S.A. fund from Luxembourg, the holding investment company owned by Benjamin and Ariane de Rothschild, has just taken hold of Caron, one of the oldest French perfume houses. And as for Silvio Denz, president of the board of directors and majority shareholder of the Lalique Group, he has told Swiss magazine Finanz und Wirtschaft he has been looking for small perfume brands likely to offer ""good margins""."
"""Organics and probiotics are the main skincare trends today,"" Bridget Carmady founder of Clémence Organics","Premium Beauty News - What is the history behind the creation of Clémence Organics? Bridget Carmady - Part of the reason I began making my own products was because I wanted to know that what I put on my skin could in no way cause me any harm. I lost both my father and sister to cancer, and their stories fortified in me a passion for nurturing health and reducing cancer risk wherever possible. The role that skincare plays in health may seem small and insignificant for some, but when the body absorbs around 80% of what we put on it, I don't feel we can take it too lightly. I know for me, having full confidence in what I put on my skin (and therefore in my body) makes me feel that I have at least taken control of that aspect of my health. I also wanted my naturopathic clients to have the best products for their skin that were gentle and made from organic ingredients but still able to deliver powerful results for their specific skin conditions. My clients loved the products I made for them and because of this the skincare side of my business grew quite quickly. Pretty soon I had to decide between my naturopathic practice and making organic skincare. My heart was pulling me towards Clémence and so I launched it as a stand-alone skincare brand in 2016. Premium Beauty News - What is your background? Bridget Carmady - I studied a Bachelor of Naturopathy and then went on to do my Honours degree in Health Medicine. I use this naturopathic approach when it comes to creating my products. Naturopathy is a practice of medicine that is based on the body's inherent ability to heal itself. Therefore, each Clémence Organic product is formulated to support the body's own healing process, using both traditional and scientifically validated nutritional medicine and herbal medicine. Premium Beauty News - Where are your products available? Bridget Carmady - We are currently only available in Australia but ship internationally via our website. Our distribution is expanding, with Asia soon to come on board, and Europe and the USA within the next two years. Premium Beauty News - What are the biggest trends you are currently addressing? Bridget Carmady - Organic is definitely on trend with more people becoming aware of the benefits both for their general health and for the health of their skin. Probiotics in skincare is also trending, and so we jumped on this with our latest product, Ultimate Biome Spritz. Premium Beauty News - What are the most challenges you are facing? Bridget Carmady - I think the biggest challenge is teaching customers that natural and organic skincare can be highly effective for a range of skin conditions, sometimes even more effective than conventional skincare. Premium Beauty News - Do you have any investment planned? Bridget Carmady - With expansion into Asia on the horizon, we are investing money into increasing our production capabilities. We are also investing in brand awareness, utilising influencers on social media to share the message of our brand."
Subcontractors: Pharma & Beauty Group and Cetes Cosmetics join forces,"The two companies have plans to create a joint venture under the name Pharma & Beauty International (PBI), with Cetes Cosmetics as a minor shareholder Thanks to the complementarity of their two production networks and of their customer portfolios, the two companies intend to position PBI as a new global cosmetic subcontractor in order to meet the increasingly diverse needs of beauty brands around the world. Created in 2012 by Laurent Dodet and Jean-Marie Total, France's Pharma & Beauty Group operates four factories in France and specializes in the manufacture and filling of cosmetic (skincare, make-up, perfume, hygiene) and pharmaceutical products (medical devices, pharmaceuticals) and dietary supplements. Pharma & Beauty Group has a strong position as a contract manufacturer in France. For its part, Cetes Cosmetics is the manufacturing arm of Swedish cosmetics group Oriflame. Established in 2017 with headquarters in Schaffhausen, Switzerland, Cetes Cosmetics has six plants in four countries (Poland, Russia, India and China). The company manufactures cosmetic products for both Oriflame and for external third-party customers. PBI will be incorporated in France with headquarters in Paris and will be headed by Laurent Dodet as CEO. ""With PBI we will bring together the best from both partners; global footprint, wide range of technologies, breakthrough innovations, high-quality factories and a dynamic experienced management. PBI will be able to offer clients flexible production solutions in the combined 10 factories of both joint venture partners,"" said Laurent Dodet in a release."
Marie Claire Group to speed up diversification in beauty,"Thibaut Fougeras created France Lab ten years ago after a marketing and management career at the L'Oréal and LVMH groups. He got the idea of offering brands and companies willing to develop their own product lines a ""one-stop shop"" that would gather all the skills needed for it under one roof. As a result, today, France Lab activities cover R&D – they have got their own formulation laboratory –, marketing, design, regulatory affairs, manufacturing, and quality, with either a full-service or tailored offering. ""Our positioning is tailor-made beauty delivered as fast as possible. And we focus on high-end, sophisticated, complex, and innovative projects in all product categories,"" explains the founding President. ""Our strength lies in our ability to talk marketing and R&D at the same time - these two dimensions are key to make a product original and successful,"" he adds. France Lab has another asset: they joined the Marie Claire Group in 2015, which helped them broaden their scope of action to the group's many customers on the global level. ""Marie Claire is one of the most famous French brands in the world. The group is at the core of global cosmetics trends and is present in 30 countries. Now, we have access to all these sources of information, and it is extremely precious for us to create our products as well as for our customers,"" says Thibaut Fougeras. Under the impetus of Thibaut Fougeras, the Marie Claire Group completes the France Lab strategy to seduce all customer types on the global stage. Already present in New York City, France Lab will inaugurate brand new offices in Shanghai by the end of the year. ""This means we will be done with our international expansion, bearing in mind that over half our customers are based abroad,"" comments the Director. At the heart of the Chinese metropolis, the new offices will be designed like in Manhattan: a whole ecosystem housing both the France Lab services and an incubator space for innovative start-ups to develop. This initiative is perfectly in line with the group's second ongoing project: the creation of Marie Claire Beauty Ventures, a new investment structure to help promising young cosmetics start-ups break through. ""We are on the look-out for promising concepts, wherever they be. This strategy is coherent with the new market situation – there is a revolution going on. We aim to make a difference by identifying these innovative projects very early, and then supporting them with the whole ecosystem they need to succeed. We have already acquired holdings in the Prose and Loli brands in the US and provide them with full support in our offices in New York City,"" explains Thibaut Fougeras. Lastly, the group has just purchased two industrial sites in France: ABO Cosmétiques is based in Mantes, west of Paris, and specialized in cosmetics manufacturing and packaging, while Cegedis is based in Chartres, south-west of Paris, and specialized in perfumes manufacturing and packaging. This acquisition involves their logistics platform that can store and ship products all over the world. The idea is to add yet another string to Marie Claire's bow, by reaching customers willing to directly exchange with a plant, without going through the development phase offered by France Lab. ""These super agile plants are not meant to become France Lab plants, quite the contrary. France Lab will keep working with their historic network of industrial partners to offer customers the best solution possible. These plants' development approach consists in searching for global brands that highlight made in France products and want to produce in France. As a result, every company will keep growing independently, but as a complementary entity within the group."" With this new beauty division, the Marie Claire Group intends not only to pursue their mission of serving beauty players, wherever they be in the world, but to expand it."
Birchbox and Walgreens team up to offer multichannel beauty experiences,"In a move to expand its beauty aisles by including high-end cosmetics to its assortment of products, Walgreens has taken a minority stake in subscription-box company Birchbox. For its part, the beauty e-retailer will have the opportunity to expand its physical presence across the USA. Birchbox has claimed since the opening of its first physical store in New York that the development of its physical presence will be key to its growth. The company has been facing competition from both pure players and more traditional beauty retailers, such as Sephora, and has seen online growth slowing but continues to report ""over 2.5 million"" active users. The first six Birchbox-branded Walgreens beauty departments are scheduled to open in December of this year in New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Minneapolis. And in early 2019, Walgreens will add Birchbox shops to five more stores in Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Miami. In addition, a curated Birchbox shop will be added on Walgreens.com. ""Our customers want to shop the most sought-after brands in a welcoming and accessible environment, and the addition of Birchbox to our growing beauty offering is a big step in delivering on our promise to differentiate and elevate the beauty experience at Walgreens. This collaboration will help enable Walgreens to continue to strengthen our beauty offering and build our prestige portfolio,"" said Richard Ashworth, President of Operations, Walgreens. The in-store Birchbox experiences within Walgreens will have dedicated space with Birchbox branding, elevated design and a curated product assortment featuring full-sized skincare, hair and makeup products from more than 40 prestige brands. Birchbox-trained Walgreens Beauty Consultants will be available to offer advice and guide the customer through the experience. Additionally, within the Walgreens pilot stores, Birchbox will offer subscriptions to its monthly delivery services of personalized samples and a ""Build Your Own Birchbox"" experience (BYOB), which is a signature element of Birchbox's flagship stores in New York City and Paris. ""In Walgreens, we have found an exciting partner that supports our mission of reaching an underserved customer who doesn't prioritize beauty,"" said Katia Beauchamp, CEO and Cofounder of Birchbox. ""Birchbox has effectively changed the relationship that this customer, who represents 70 percent of the market, has with beauty and increased her spend in the category. Walgreens is deeply committed to beauty and shares our vision for a different type of retail experience - one that is holistic, seamless and designed to help shoppers make informed, confident decisions. Together we will continue to evolve the integration of our physical and digital shopping experiences."""

Pierre Fabre invests to better meet the needs of Brazilian consumers,"Covering an area of 320 sq. metres, Pierre Fabre's new dermo-cosmetics innovation centre is located in the district of Barra da Tijuca, in Rio de Janeiro, and has a branch at the group's industrial facility in Areal, in the state of Rio de Janeiro. It will have around twenty researchers and technicians by 2021. Headed by Anne-Laure Gaudry under the responsibility of Xavier Ormancey, Director of Dermo-Cosmetics (PFDC) Division R&D, the Brazilian Innovation Center of PFDC will pursue a three-fold mission: – to better understand Brazilian skin types from a dermatological point of view as well as the sociological needs of Brazilian consumers, – to detect in advance upcoming trends in the Brazilian cosmetics markets, ""one of the most sophisticated and inventive in the world,"" according to Pierre Fabre, – and to boost the development of new products adapted to the local market for the Eau Thermale Avène, Ducray and Darrow brands. ""The Brazilian dermatological school is famous all over the world. The Brazilian population has an incredible mix of skin and hair types and Brazilian consumers are particularly sophisticated and demanding when it comes to cosmetic products. It was therefore natural for PFDC to set up its second international innovation center in this country, and I am confident that its teams will develop formulas and products that will be appreciated first locally and then beyond Brazilian borders,"" explains Nuria Perez-Cullell, CEO Dermo-Cosmetics Division. As the world's fourth largest cosmetics market, Brazil is of major importance for the Pierre Fabre Group. In 2017, the products marketed by Pierre Fabre do Brasil achieved consumer sales in excess of BRL 300 million (EUR 62 million), up 10% compared to the previous year. Even if this figure represents only a small part of the group's global sales (2.3 billion euros, including 1.4 billion euros for the dermo-cosmetic branch), Pierre Fabre is - with its brands Eau Thermale Avène, Darrow and Ducray - the 3rd player in the Brazilian dermo-cosmetic market. With a presence in Brazil since 1985, the Pierre Fabre Group is now developing both its pharmaceutical and dermo-cosmetics businesses here. Following the acquisition of Darrow Laboratories in 2006, the Group owns a plant specialized in the production of dermo-cosmetic products in Areal. ""Brazil is a country of strategic interest for our Group and Pierre Fabre do Brasil is one of our most dynamic subsidiaries with an average annual growth of 24% over the past five years. In 2015, we launched a major investment plan to the tune of 50 million real, notably to modernize our Areal plant. We are furthering this effort today by opening our second international innovation center in Rio de Janeiro. It is a great opportunity for us to welcome Brazilian talent into our R&D teams and thus enrich the human and cultural diversity of our Group,"" said Eric Ducournau, Pierre Fabre Group's CEO."
"Aurélien Chaufour, ANJAC: ""Acquisitions will keep going at the same pace!""","Premium Beauty News - You started gaining strength in the health-beauty sector in 2008, ten years ago. Aurélien Chaufour - Absolutely. That year, we opened a new chapter in our history when we created the Health & Beauty ANJAC division. And within only ten years, we purchased and developed eight complementary innovative companies in the fields of beauty, pharmaceutics, and natural food supplements. Together, they achieve a 200-million-euro turnover and count 1,100 employees across eleven production sites in France. These companies are: – Shadeline, a laboratory specialized in the R&D of dermocosmetics, parapharmaceutical products, and class I and II MDs – Chemineau, also a laboratory specialized in the development and bespoke production of pharmaceuticals and cosmetic products, as well as medical devices (CDMO) – Euro Wipes, one of today's major players on the wipe market, who now offers a whole range of soaked wipes and cotton pads, some of them being class II medical devices – LPEV, specialized in phytonutrition and micronutrition. They innovate thanks to their expertise in plants – SICAF, a partner of major luxury cosmetics brands renowned for their know-how in tailor-made formulation, manufacturing, and packaging – Aircos, an expert in the field of makeup powders, but also a plastic injection specialist, among others – Lastly, Pascual Cosmétiques, a specialist of cast and liquid shapes for makeup Premium Beauty News - Two of these acquisitions, Aircos and Pascual, helped you gain a foothold in the makeup world! Aurélien Chaufour - Definitely, and we are really delighted! You know Aircos is now shifting into high gear, as they are doubling their production site in Romorantin, France, with an operating surface area of 4,600 m2. With their back injection process, Aircos can really assert their expertise in terms of container/content compatibility. This process highlights all the ingredients' properties (in particular of pigments and mother-of-pearls) and provides astonishing softness and brightness. As for Pascual Cosmétiques, they are specialized in lipsticks and liquid forms for makeup (foundation, gloss, eyeshadow, nail polish). Created in 2010, the company achieved a six-million-euro turnover in 2017, a result that tripled in three years. As their offering gradually diversified and their R&D activity grew, they were able to provide more and more comprehensive a service offering. In 2017, they purchased a new building in Ferrières-en-Brie, France, to enhance their production: a 5,000 m2 plant next to an R&D laboratory. Premium Beauty News - You have always asserted your passion for industrial business and management. It seems you will not stop here, will you? Aurélien Chaufour - It may sound a bit ridiculous, but it is true! I have a real passion for the industry and the men and women that make it thrive. Development and innovation are real drivers for me. It is also fascinating how we can play with the synergies between these different entities – they are actually great. But, did you say ""stop""?! Certainly not. We will keep making progress on all segments, in particular in the cosmetics and dermocosmetics sectors. We are at an advanced stage of negotiations with several other companies. No doubt we will soon make an announcement."
"Symrise wants to be a ""game changer"" of fine perfumery","A multi-sensory and multidisciplinary project that combines texts, photography and scents, ""A World Tour Through Scent"" explores the relations of the peoples around the world with perfume. Presented from 19 to 23 September within the Rives de la Beauté, the project was conceived by Symrise in collaboration with the magazine Nez and photographers of the Tendance Floue group. This scented world tour reveals a global cultural cartography of olfaction. For several months, thirteen Symrise perfumers visited eleven destinations around the world, accompanied by a reporter from Nez and a photographer from the Tendance Floue group to discover global scents and olfactory cultures and illustrate them through words and images. Between creative Odyssey and anthropological expedition, these trips have inspired twelve olfactory scents and eleven photographic white cards analysing the representation of odours and olfactory concepts. This large-scale project invites us to rethink creative processes that open up new perspectives for photography, perfumery and reporting. As part of this opening, Ricardo Omori, Vice-President of the Fine Fragrance Division at Symrise, announced that he is strengthening his Fine Fragrance perfume team with the arrival of three young talents coming directly from the Symrise perfumery school: Leslie Gauthier, Marine Ipert and Suzy Le Helley. Additionally, Mr. Omori announced the arrival of Master Perfumer Annick Ménardo with the Symrise team. A talented scent designer who has marked the contemporary history of perfumery with iconic creations such as Lolita Lempicka, Dior Bois d'Argent, Dior Hypnotic Poison, Boss Bottled, YSL Body Kouros, and Bulgari Black, Annick Ménardo was previously working for Firmenich. Mr. Omori also announced a new exclusive partnership with Payan Bertrand, a producer of raw materials from Grasse, to expand its range of natural ingredients. Payan Bertrand develops natural materials for perfumes and flavours, a know-how that it will now develop alongside Symrise. A move that illustrates the group's desire to work with local producers to sublimate and renew its palette of ingredients. These announcements, in the wake of other important news earlier this year, including the launch of several new De Laire bases and of new natural fragrance ingredients, confirm that Symrise intends to challenge the status quo in Fine Perfumery."
Filorga reinvents Le Couvent des Minimes,"Premium Beauty News - What is the brand's original story? Laure Maluski - Le Couvent des Minimes was created in 2004 by the L'Occitane group with a very similar positioning to the globally renowned brand. Located in Mane, in the Provence region, it capitalized on the origin of the place. It told the history of the nuns that lived there in the 19th century with colognes and beneficial skincare recipes. Purchased in 2017 thanks to the support of the HLD fund by Didier Tabary, President of Laboratoires Filorga, the brand was restructured and its positioning completely rethought. Premium Beauty News - So, you changed everything, except for the name? Laure Maluski - Exactly. As we were looking into the archives, we discovered that an extraordinary man, Louis Feuillée, King Louis XIV's botanist, had actually lived in the Couvent des Minimes. A real pioneer in this field, he was ordered by the King to travel the world in search of yet unknown botanical species. A historian helped us find his narratives, botanical drawings, and navigation charts, which were amazingly rich. They inspired us in many ways. Based on his adventures, we designed a singular, exploratory, innovative brand combining art with material. Thanks to his botanical explorations, we created a contemporary, bold, green and inspired, luxurious, but affordable High Perfumery concept. Plus, it is 100% vegan, and beautiful both in the form and content. Premium Beauty News - Perfumes are the flagship products of the new range, aren't they? Laure Maluski - They are, but they are based on a different approach from that of the rest of the market. We believe the future of perfumery should be invented avoiding mainstream standards. So, we thought we should reinvent the codes of luxury perfume by creating a daring French high perfumery – far from standards, but affordable to all. In our Parfums Remarquables collection, we recreated the atmosphere of legendary harbours, from Valparaiso to Santa Cruz, through signed compositions mixing exotic spices, wood, fruit, and flowers with both strength and personality. In Colognes Botaniques, we walked in the Gardens of the Couvent des Minimes to capture their essence and provide intense, long-lasting freshness. Lastly, in the Intérieurs Singuliers collection, we retranscribed the unique atmospheres of different places of the Court of Versailles, which is full of secret stories, and with which Louis Feuillée was familiar. At the head of the olfactory department, we chose a passionate creator, Hervé Gambs, who is supported by a team of 10 French perfumers carefully selected for their ability to change the game. Premium Beauty News - But there are also vegan skincare products… why this decision? Laure Maluski - Indeed, for both our skincare products and the rest of the range, we worked on green formulas, favouring botanical essences and natural materials, and avoiding any controversial ingredient (no sulphates, no parabens, no silicones), while making sure they were all 100% vegan. This philosophy is only natural to us: it is intended for a public willing to combine being with appearance. For us, offering skincare in addition to perfumes was also a way to create a real botanical Art de Vivre and keep paying tribute not only to the skincare recipes of the Couvent, but also to the wonderful plants discovered by Louis Feuillée, the King's botanist. What was the result? Revisited mythical balms, like the Gardener's Hand Healer or the Hiker's Healer, a collection of natural, 100% hypoallergenic skincare products with a lovely name, Amorem, and Soins Remarquables for the body, featuring seven botanical oils inspired from Louis Feuillée's travels. Premium Beauty News - Are you targeting a new customer profile with this high perfumery positioning? Laure Maluski - Our brand's rich DNA makes it possible for us to target quite broad a profile: both men and women of all ages in search of non-standardized scents. Search for meaning and real stories, longing to escape, craze for singularity, desire for quality and elegance at an affordable price… I think we do meet all these needs. And I am deeply convinced they are fundamental trends that transcend both age and sex. Premium Beauty News - New concept, new design, new products and new distribution? Laure Maluski - Absolutely. The brand will only be distributed through the selective perfumery channel and department stores. In France, it has been exclusively available at Marionnaud stores since mid-July. Also, we will soon be opening a flagship store in Paris. Premium Beauty News - Do you have ambitions on the global level? Laure Maluski - This year, we are launching our range across Europe and in Japan, and we will keep expanding our global presence in the medium term."
Faber-Castell Cosmetics to open first manufacturing facility in the US,"At a ceremony on the sidelines of the MakeUp in New York tradeshow, Countess Mary von Faber-Castell, President of Faber-Castell Cosmetics, has announced the opening of the company's first production facility in Elgin, Illinois. ""This area is probably the best location for this factory because it is placed near one of the largest logistics hubs globally, the O'Hare airport which is easy to reach from any place in the world via direct flights,"" the Countess said. The plant, which is placed at an equal distance to the East Coast and the West Coast markets, will occupy an initial space of 45,000 sq. ft (about 4,180 sqm), with the possibility to extend it to 73,000 sq ft. (about 6,782 sqm), entirely dedicated to the manufacture of the company's cosmetic solutions. ""I am proud to announce this project during the 40th year of Faber-Castell Cosmetics,"" added Mary von Faber-Castell. ""The U.S. facility will offer U.S. customers the same speed-to-market and convenience now enjoyed by Europe and Brazil."" To provide their North American customers with the same processes, systems and manufacturing standards than in the rest of the world, Faber-Castell Cosmetics has leased a state-of-the-art facility and has planned to invest 9 million dollars in the project. ""Adding a North American facility is a remarkable milestone for our company,"" said Dr. Christina Zech, Managing Director of Faber-Castell Cosmetics. ""The production will start in Q4 with first shipping expected next year. The fast-growth North American market is a priority for us and, as on other key markets, agility and speed to market are key factors of success. It is therefore very important to be located as close as possible from our customers. Thanks to this new plant, we'll able to produce extremely fast,"" she added. As a first step, the company will offer a selection of its range focusing on plastic pencils as wood pencils are not as popular in the US than in Europe or Brazil. At the MakeUp in New York tradeshow, which took place on 12-13 September 2018 at Center 415, on Manhattan's 5th Avenue, Faber-Castell Cosmetics presented their latest ready-to-market concept Universal Beauty which is targeted to all beauty lovers. To embrace diversity and self-expression, they introduced innovative textures in vivid colours that work for all skin tones. The new line includes, among many other products: Carribbean Breeze, a shimmer highlighter in pencil-shape, or Latin Dance, a cloud coordinated eye make-up duo."
"François Luscan, Albéa: ""We need to combine skills!""","Premium Beauty News - What challenges do groups like Albéa deal with on a daily basis? François Luscan - It may sound trite to say so, but our market speeds up the number of launches, the development time, lead times, the emergence of new trends… it all goes faster. For all of us manufacturers, it requires strengthening basics, in particular in terms of operational performance, but also accelerating, simplifying, and making all our processes more efficient when it comes to decision-making, purchase, planning, processing, manufacturing, and innovation. Although we all tend to highlight technologies, in particular digital technologies, which are incredible levers, I am more than ever convinced that it is actually men and women, thanks to their creativity, adaptability, values, and commitment, who will make a real difference and secure their companies' reputations and the industry's future. The opportunities of Industry 4.0, the talent war, the importance of training, and environmental protection are all challenges we need to address today. Premium Beauty News - You last expressed your views on Premium Beauty News a little less than two years ago. In the meantime, your group changed shareholders. What are the consequences? François Luscan - Let's say a few words about PAI Partners, Albéa's new partner. It should be emphasized that this company was founded in 1872 and contributed to France's industrialization in the late 19th century and early 20th. Today,PAI Partners' industrial investment vision is based on long-term goals and focuses on highly specialized sectors. They clearly assert their desire for growth. With our former partner, Sun Capital, our top priority was industrial optimization through investment to go faster and be more efficient, more modern. As a matter of fact, this period also helped us purchase and integrate seven companies, the latest being metal component manufacturer Covit in February 2018. With PAI, we opened a new chapter in our history: now, we focus on both organic and external growth. Our strategic plan is solid. It was validated with our shareholder and it benefits from our customers' and teams' support. Premium Beauty News - In two years, your group has kept investing not only in its industrial tool, but also in acquisitions, to capture new market shares. François Luscan - Generally speaking, it should be reminded that our industrial investments kept reaching about 80 million dollars a year, which helped us innovate, get automated, integrate new production lines to boost our capacity and performance, and acquire new manufacturing processes. As regards acquisitions, I would like to put an emphasis on Covit, the Spanish metal component manufacturer, and on a site specialized in laminated tubes in Levice, Slovakia. You know metal parts are ""critical"" components for flagship products in our portfolio, like lipsticks and pumps. Covit was one of our strategic suppliers in Europe, and we already had a site in the US and capacities in China. With this acquisition, we contribute to the development of a solid global metal supplier that is recognized on the market. We also develop our expertise together, while preserving independent management techniques. As for the purchase of the Levice site, it strengthened our position on the tube segment in Europe and helped us integrate a new business model combining key accounts and smaller customers with a very entrepreneurial operating mode. It makes it possible to emphasize our vision in terms of acquisitions, but also joint ventures and partnerships. I believe in flexible systems that contribute to developing know-how, combining financial means, and increasing industrial capacities through total or partial integration approaches, for example when it comes to preserving freedom of entrepreneurial action or only purchasing industrial assets. Premium Beauty News - Nowadays, digital technologies, the environment, corporate social responsibility, and full-service offers are more than ever major requisites. How do you adapt? What means do you use to assert your differences? François Luscan - To me, Albéa can be proud of its historic CSR commitment – we started taking action in 2004 and still have the same beliefs today. It is a growth lever that boosts our reputation and attractiveness in the short- and long-term. As a matter of fact, we won the Luxepack in Green award in 2016 for the approach we adopted. But obviously, the context changes quickly. CSR keeps gaining importance to our major customers. International regulations increasingly tackle this issue. It also matters for our ""employer brand"", our employees and future recruits, in particular Millennials, who are even more committed than the previous generation. And of course, environmental protection is a major challenge for all States and international associations. At Albéa, our approach is based on four pillars. First, the people. The idea is to guarantee the safety, wellness, and societal compliance of our activities, but also to develop the know-how at the core of packaging trades. The second has to do with our operations and will to reduce our carbon footprint – our energy and water consumption. The third focuses on the products we make. We need to actively contribute to the development of a high-performing circular economy in the field of hygiene-beauty, in relation to the importance of primary packaging and in line with our customers' commitment. The fourth concerns all our partners: customers, suppliers and associations. Actually, we launched a ""Materiality Analysis"" among our internal and external stakeholders. This Matrix will help us define a new four-year CSR plan by identifying, prioritizing, and committing to the right stakes for Albéa. As usual, we will ensure we align with our ecosystem and get our teams involved. The results are expected by the end of the year. As for the boom of digital technologies, it is a fact that it changes the way we consume products, communicate, share data, and interact with consumers, brands, and suppliers. Digital technologies make influencers, e-shops, and indie brands emerge and contribute to connected beauty. They also help innovate on more collaborative and cross-disciplinary terms with both agility and speed. Digital technologies contribute to the Industry 4.0 challenges we are addressing. We must adapt to an ever-more complex, volatile, uncertain, and ambiguous world – a world that is getting increasingly more digital and interconnected, and which also keeps speeding up. As far as we are concerned, Industry 4.0 covers 3D prototyping, digital printing, robotics, artificial intelligence, but also open innovation, creativity, human intelligence… Industry 4.0 is based on the development of skills and teams, the acquisition of new talents within a global context of talent war, and the simplification of industrial and administrative processes. There is quite a lot to do! As for the full-service concept, I would like to highlight what was recently pointed out by Xavier Leclerc de Hauteclocque, our Director for our Beauty Solutions activity, which weighs almost 100 million dollars. It guides the market towards turnkey solutions. We have recruited new skills, in particular as regards formulas – not to do our formulators' job, but to anticipate formula trends and the impacts on packaging, so we can help our customers gain time! We will collaborate with formulators to get their own expertise and offer brands adapted project management. In addition, we will develop our supplier and partner ecosystem, in particular with strong quality and CSR requirements. And of course, we will structure our value proposition to meet the needs of each customer type. We also believe in the value of an ecosystem when it comes to full-service! Premium Beauty News - Will 2018 be a good year for Albéa? What is your forecast for 2019? François Luscan - I have no crystal ball, but the market is growing all over the world, in particular in the selective network, and on almost all segments. Overall, I can say the first quarter 2018 is encouraging and this year should be another positive year, with the 3% or 4% growth rate we aim for. But for this to happen, we must provide our trusting customers with some peace of mind. Our teams are mobilized accordingly. That being said, if you look further ahead, you can see our market changes fast. As far as customers are concerned, there are major groups, but also smaller and smaller brands. They have different needs, especially if you carry out an accurate segmentation. Most of them are growing with very diverse business models. Our challenge consists in supporting the growth of these different markets at the same time, with adapted offerings. Now, as for products, innovation should be faster and more personalized. So, we must implement an agile organization with efficient governance between the local and global levels, between trendy design and disruptive innovation, between the animation of our existing ranges and the novelty arms race, and between standard and specific products: on the market, we are recognized for our process solidity and technical experts' quality. Premium Beauty News - You talk a lot about the issue of environmental protection. François Luscan - We are all affected by the recent changes in plastics regulations! Of course, Albéa is concerned, but so are our suppliers, our customers and their own consumers. The most visible part of this is the end-of-life of products and plastic packaging, in particular single-use packs. As a matter of fact, mathematically, the consumption of such products increases with urbanization, demographics, the crowds… All sectors are concerned, from supermarket bags to crisp packets, water bottles, detergents… and hygiene-beauty. Basically, the challenge consists in giving up single-use packs and going for recyclable and recycled solutions. It involves the collecting sector and its territorial coverage, the treatment sector (landfilling activities, incineration… and recycling) and its environmental efficiency in the short-, medium-, and long-term, and of course, the regulations on authorized plastic materials for such or such application. Also, the tax system implemented for collecting and waste treatment companies should favour new economic balances. For the cosmetics industry in particular, given the low overall volume and the small size of packs, their image (they are beautiful objects before being plastic packs), and their functionalities (multiple components and materials are often used), today, the main challenge concerns the development of a high-performing circular economy throughout the value chain: how can we set up adapted collection systems? How can we make tax, environmental, but also public health regulations change to support this transition? And how can we manufacturers and suppliers keep integrating eco-design (fewer components, fewer materials, less plastic…), or even circular design to make our packs reusable or recyclable and use recycled (Post-Consumer Recycled) or biosourced raw materials? It is a real challenge for the whole industry, but I strongly believe we will successfully meet it with our customers, suppliers, and competitors. Premium Beauty News - Is it easy today to be a packaging supplier, with all the industrial constraints it involves, in a world where everything is going fast, sometimes ""too fast"", and where industrial and technical legitimacy is no longer measured at its fair value? François Luscan - I am fascinated by the cosmetics industry and proud to be a manufacturer in this sector. As a matter of fact, several managers who had started out in the car industry joined us. They tell me that the cosmetics sector goes faster and is more unpredictable and exciting due to the countless challenges we face on a daily basis. To me, the industry is men, sites, territories, a history, and rare skills. It is not a constraint, it is a value – hence the importance of CSR for my group. I am always eager for challenges: today, we must make the industry agile and bank on boldness, creativity, and digital technologies. Premium Beauty News - Your vision has always involved predicting an acceleration of industrial merging. Your group is a leading player in this field. Do you think this will keep going? François Luscan - Yes, there will always be merges. The market has changed a lot, with the notion of time-to-market, digital technologies, the importance of speed and agility, the buzz of turnkey solutions… There are many people coming in, many new business models. Whether small or big, old or new, all players will have to quickly adapt. As far as I am concerned, as I have already said, I strongly believe in partnerships. In our complex world, we need to find win/win opportunities. We must associate in a specific region or in the world, on a segment or a market. Basically, I think any financial operation, whether it be an acquisition, partnership, joint venture, or disposal of assets, is aimed to keep serving our customers better and better. Value compatibility is essential, and so is the quality of our teams. I want to expand my family, not eliminate competitors or launch trying restructuring processes that will slow down my group's growth. Premium Beauty News - What are the main new launches your group will showcase in the weeks to come, in particular at the Luxe Pack Monaco show? François Luscan - The 2018 Albéa stand will be designed as a pop-up store, where visitors will enjoy a real retail experience: products that can be touched, like in a store, personalized areas, digital features, trends... They will also discover corners adapted to their own brand's positioning, in particular a green area filled with innovative, environmentally friendly solutions, as well as a formula bar showcasing our turnkey ""pack + formula"" solutions. Our flagship products will include tubes and foam pumps made of biosourced PE and Post-Consumer Recycled Plastic - some will be competing for the Luxepack In Green Award, and we will highlight multiple new features in our broad range of standard solutions for all brands, applications, and regions – from oval tubes to airless packs, from astonishing decorations to new mascara brushes, masks, and even comprehensive makeup lines…"
Sephora unveils new omni-channel retail concept in China,"The beauty retail giant has lifted the lid on a new retail concept designed to enhance the shopping experience of its Chinese customers. Dubbed ""My Beauty Power Turn It On"", the new concept takes its name from Sephora's advertising campaigns in China, where beauty is often perceived as a weapon to successfully achieve one's own goals. The aim of the project is to increase the number of contact points with Chinese beauty addicts to encourage them to generate their own beauty trends, as well as encouraging them to get creative and share their beauty content online. To that end, Sephora has built a comprehensive omni-channel retail system, which includes 228 physical stores covering 74 cities in China, the official Sephora app, the official website, a Tmall flagship store, a JD flagship store and the recently launched a ""mini program"" store on WeChat, a system allowing to sell products though the main social network in China. In addition, Sephora will also inaugurate in September its new Asian flagship store, a five-storey building on Nanjing Road in the heart of Shanghai. The company also plans to open twenty new stores each year in China over the next five years. Sephora thus intend to become the first beauty retailer to offer a comprehensive shopping experience, encompassing physical, online and social retail. To publicize the new development, Sephora has snapped up Chinese entertainer Z.TAO, who joins the brand as its new ambassador. The former Exo boy band member has made a name for himself as a solo artist and actor, earning credits in movies such as ""You Are My Sunshine"" and ""The Negotiator."" A choice that certainly owes nothing to chance at a time when young Chinese men are more and more interested in beauty products."
"""Our two major export challenges are Germany and Asia,"" Anne Hubel, Natura Siberica","Premium Beauty News - Could you briefly sum up Natura Siberica's story? Anne Hubel - Natura Siberica was founded in 2007 in Russia by Andrei Trubnikov, a visionary entrepreneur. His idea was to use Russia's and Siberia's richness to create an organic beauty brand based on plants from Siberia, this vast area whose preserved ecosystem offers a flora with highly beneficial qualities. Based on this natural wealth, the brand's founder imagined a varied range of face, hair, and body care products. Andrei Trubnikov wanted this very qualitative line of Ecocert and COSMOS-certified products to be affordable to the general public with an interesting price positioning. Cherry on top, every product is adorned with sophisticated packaging as a nod to his passion for design. Premium Beauty News - How many points of sale are there in Russia today? Anne Hubel - It all started with a wholly-owned store in Saint Petersburg. Today, we count 40 of them across the country, with a presence in all major beauty channels. Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us more about Russia's biodiversity? Anne Hubel - Siberian plants live under extreme climate conditions. What we call ""adaptogenic"" plants survived the ice age by adapting to one of the harshest environments on Earth. To resist temperatures of -50 °C, violent winds, and very short growing seasons, they synthesize powerful protective actives and are endowed with antioxidant properties above average. Premium Beauty News - How do you take advantage of this biodiversity? Anne Hubel - Siberia is a vast area comprising four time zones, from the Ural to the Pacific, and from the far north to the southern steppes. We have built four organic farms that each benefit from diverse climates and botanical species. They are all located in regions preserved from any human activity: in Khakassia, on the bank of the Yenisei, in Kamtchatka, along the Pacific Ocean, on the Sakhalin peninsula, and in Kunashir, on the Kuril Islands archipelago. The advantage of an organic farm is that it preserves the natural growth cycles of plants, the optimum harvesting periods, and the fallow times for the soil. When our materials do not come from our farms, but from their surroundings, we choose hand picking, which has been practised for thousands of years according to the rites of local tribes' ancestors. The harvest should take place when the plant has accumulated the maximum of nutrients and actives. Six hand picking areas were defined, including one in TUVA, in the south of Siberia, on the borders of China and Mongolia. It inspired our new TUVA SIBERICA line, which will be exclusively launched in Monoprix stores in late October 2018. We have an agreement with the local tribes which takes into account sustainable development and preserves their own culture and traditions. Outside Siberia, we have been enriching our ingredient range by turning towards regions whose climate imposes the same harshness as Siberia, like the Highlands in Scotland (thistle harvesting) or the Faroe Islands, off the Danish coast (algae picking). Premium Beauty News - As a matter of fact, you have recently developed a range with the Grasse rose, Sibérie Mon Amour. Anne Hubel - After the brand's success in France, we wanted to pay tribute to the country with one of its culture's iconic plants, by combining it with Siberian herbs. We chose Rose de Grasse, in particular for its cosmetics virtues. We used a Grasse rose hydrolate obtained by distillation: it is an ingredient rich in vitamins A, C, and E. It is excellent for the skin's youth and much concentrated in essential fatty acids. It enhances the synthesis of collagen and ensures efficient protection against free radicals. We mixed it with Siberian plants grown in our organic farms. This mixture of ingredients resulted in an Ecocert-certified range of face and body care products which recently arrived in Parashop and Nocibé stores, in Birchbox boxes, and in a few parapharmacies. Premium Beauty News - Apart from Monoprix, what are your points of sale in France today? Matthieu Sipp - We have set up a pyramid-like distribution system. Our products have been available in Monoprix and Monop'Beauty stores since late 2015, and since the beginning of the year in Nocibé and Parashop stores and beautiful independent pharmacies. Birchbox also offers them. Premium Beauty News - What is your development strategy in France in terms of growth and point-of-sale openings? Matthieu Sipp - We want to find a place in all beauty networks in France, from department stores to supermarkets, from the selective network to pharmacies. The richness of our products helps us offer exclusive ranges adapted to every channel to best meet distributors' demand and consumer expectations. For example, with Système U, we have designed a range which is gradually settling in the natural brand department of the new U beauty concept. As a result, Natura Siberica customers will be able to find their favourite brand in their different beauty shopping places in France, whenever they want to. Premium Beauty News - Can we talk about your presence in Europe? Matthieu Sipp - We are present in all EU countries. The brand successfully settled in France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, and the UK. We have a nice challenge ahead with Germany, where the brand is gradually finding a place in 'organic' networks and drugstores. Our production in Tallinn, Estonia, makes it easier for us to export to Europe and across the world and deal with logistics and the required authorizations. Premium Beauty News - Do you consider developing the brand in other countries? Matthieu Sipp - Apart from Germany, our main challenge remains Asia. The huge success of our brand in France is an advantage, since it can be felt by our global customers. Paradoxically, the craze for our products in France is a guarantee for quality in Russia. It makes Natura Siberica seem more valuable to Russian consumers. That is why we first chose Europe – to make our brand legitimate. So, in the future, we will develop in Asia, in particular in Japan and China. We have exclusive ranges to come, there will be new distributors in France and Europe, and we will also conquer Asia: there is a lot going on for Natura Siberica."
Asquan well under way to its growth target,"Premium Beauty News - It was not that easy to start from ""almost"" scratch? Henri Tinchant - Not that simple you are right, but thanks to both the skills of a team and a clear vision of the current needs and wants of brands in the Beauty sector, the result is the one expected! After two years of work, communication, meetings, explanations, Asquan is a reality. We can be proud of the gone through road. Premium Beauty News - What are your recipes for success? Henri Tinchant - The first of them, a comprehensive service. Like for example, visiting customers with product mock-ups that we present. It doesn't look like much, even if it is a significant investment for us, but it is fundamental to win customer adhesion! Innovation is on everyone's lips, but in fact few companies adopt a real R&D approach. Hence, it is important being able to rely on a top level creative team. We have a team consisting of no less than five designers, two of them based on the U.S. West Coast, two in Hong Kong and one in Europe. This creative strategy revolves around biannual presentations (spring-summer and fall-winter). Each year we present a total of 150 new products! The whole of it, supported of course by a strong R&D team. The other plus is our ability to ensure an excellent sourcing while offering the appropriate production capacity in terms of packaging and formulation ranges in all areas. Another important component of the recipe: a recognized, competent and very efficient team. A team of industry professionals, each of them with 10 years of experience in the field of beauty. Because I must stress on the fact that our strategy is based on three pillars: proximity, communication and service. To this end, we have seven people in the United States and a very experienced team of twenty five people in Hong Kong. To note that the Hong-Kong team is a perfect blend of Asian and Western employees (respectively 65 and 35 percent). This allows us to ensure a quality customer service with no less than seven languages spoken. Premium Beauty News - What new areas of development have you been working on? Henri Tinchant - On the commercial front, we decided to increase our scope of action in the skincare area. One person will be specifically dedicated to this market and will be based in the U.S. The second priority: Europe and, in particular, France. Third axis: we have redefined our organization around four divisions (Packaging, Full Service, Brushes and kits). Finally, fourth line of development: meet growing demand concerning environment. We are in the process of initiating a sustainability program, which we are currently developing with the help of a team of young graduates specialized in the field of environment. This program is called the ""3 Rs"" (Refill-Re-use-Recycle). Premium Beauty News - What will you be showcasing at MakeUp in New York? Henri Tinchant - We will premiere our 2019 Autumn-Winter Innovation Program covering our four divisions as well as our new range, ""Frame""."

"Dagmar Chlosta, Schwan Cosmetics: ""We have to rethink our strategy!""","Premium Beauty News - You were appointed Chief Market Officer of the Schwan Cosmetics Group a few months ago. What were your feelings at first concerning this company? Dagmar Chlosta - I worked over the last 20 years for the Adidas Group, where I held various executive positions ranging from operations (including R&D, Materials Management, Innovation, Sourcing, Supply Chain Management) to strategy (including Digitalization) and marketing. In 2015 I moved to the USA and worked for the sporting goods brand Under Armour as SVP Global Operations. A couple of years ago, I wanted to change direction in my career: Working in the cosmetics industry was my lifelong dream, a dream that has finally come true. I found Schwan Cosmetics exciting because of its people and its culture. It is a value-based, traditional and yet international company with a high level of innovation. We are a global market leader and, although we have a low-key presence for end users, we are bursting with ideas and passion. Also, changing perspective and literally sitting at the other side of the table, namely on the supplier vs. the brand side is a great way of expanding my horizons. Here it helps that I was responsible for procurement, product development and range management for two major brands for many years. I know all too well which challenges brands are facing in today's world. Premium Beauty News - The makeup market has changed considerably in the last three years with the arrival of new brands? Dagmar Chlosta - What was once a brand driven market, is now ruled by the consumer and their expectations are presenting us all with very new challenges. As a consequence, we have to rethink our strategy and how we can service our customers to meet and exceed the desires of this new consumer. We are in the process of changing our organization, we are evaluating our processes and we are laser focused on customer centricity and product leadership. We will offer true end-to-end solutions to our customers – from product to marketing to supply chain. All based on speed to market, agility, individualization and innovation beyond product. We have also onboarded new capabilities in terms of resources. Our strategy and positioning is based on data, experience and total commitment to deliver nothing short of excellence to our customers. Premium Beauty News - Can you give us an update on your digital approach? Dagmar Chlosta - In today's world it is paramount that we know how to be part of the digital community. Hence, we are consistently enriching our portfolio with new business concepts and ideas from the digital world. It's all about touch points, about connectivity. We want to be open and learn from digital natives, gather their ideas and see how we can translate these into compelling offers for our customers. The BeautyThon 2018 was another step in this journey. Events like this help us to expand our network in the digital ecosystem. It also allows us to become a network partner for our customers in the digital space. Collaboration, connectivity, innovation, digitalization - these are not just buzz words for us, this is how we define Schwan Cosmetics and our various touch points in our ecosystem. Premium Beauty News - The DNA and the history of your Group are punctuated by innovations in the fields of pencils and formulas. Is it still possible to innovate in this area? Dagmar Chlosta - Of course it is! We have clearly defined our future strategy - we will not create more 'me too' products but have identified for ourselves what we believe customers and consumers alike will desire in the future - sustainable innovation. Consumers want it all - high performing product, newness, diversification and a sustainable product that mirrors their beliefs, their lifestyle. This is what we will bring to the market. We are determined, in collaboration with our customers and other partners, to define the future of color cosmetics from a sustainable innovation point of view. You saw a first glimpse at MakeUp in Paris where we launched an industry first with our new product ""PERFECT"" – the ultimate blend of environmental consciousness in a wooden pen and high performing formula. Stay tuned for more information on this as we are launching our new positioning in the weeks to come: #sustainableinnovation. Premium Beauty News - End consumers have changed dramatically? Dagmar Chlosta - Consumers are now fully connected, they expect instant gratification, they dictate what's in and what's out and all at a speed that nobody expected to be possible. They are less interested in brand loyalty and more focused on what a product can do for them. They are connected to their tribe, fully immersed in social media, critical and discerning. As I already stated, what was once a market driven by brands has turned into a completely consumer-driven market. We must be able to respond to this development by working with the brands to satisfy consumer desires. Fortunately, we have a global network of subsidiaries that are close to our customer base. We invest in the future by being in sync with what is happening in the markets and translating this into sustainable innovation. Premium Beauty News - How is your Group addressing the environmental challenge? Dagmar Chlosta - Conscious beauty and sustainability are a worldwide movement. Especially the millennials are a very conscious generation, and as a beauty manufacturer, we have to provide them with products that are in line with their beliefs in a sustainable planet. Therefore, we invest heavily in sustainable innovation also on the packaging side. We are relentlessly researching sustainable materials and are seeing the resurgence of wood through the launch of our PERFECT line. Schwan Cosmetics, with its longstanding history as a key innovator, is now moving into the space of being a ""sustainable innovator""."

Chromavis-Fareva is investing over 50 Million euros in Italy in a new building,"It is true that the architectural project of this new plant, which will also be home to the head office of the Company, is surprising to say the least. First of all, with the colour chosen, black! Then through the concept itself of the first buildings that will house the offices and research laboratories, in the form of faceted cubes emerging from the ground, all of them very generously glazed to let light penetrate everywhere. Integrated in the plant a mini workshop entirely dedicated to product industrialization, will enable to speed up processes and ensure maximum efficiency while maintaining flexibility. Finally, the 50,000 m2 site itself settled on a plot of 100,000 m2, will be located in the middle of a lush nature made of gardens and terraces. These new premises will bring together on one site, on the edge of the small town of Offanengo near the city of Crema, all the current offices and factories located in Vaiano Cremasco, Chieve and Crespiatica. ""This is, undoubtedly, the biggest industrial investment in the history of the Fareva Group,"" explained Jean-Pierre Fraisse. ""A project that will become a reality in the coming months and which obviously could not have been possible without the will and financial resources of the Fareva Group"", insisted Fabrizio Buscaini. Fareva and beauty, a constant strategy... In just ten years, the Fareva Group (1.65 billion euros in sales, 12,000 employees, 39 plants) will have come a long way in this beauty segment. In August 2013, the Group announced the acquisition of the Italian manufacturer Chromavis, and then finalized in July 2014 the integration within Chromavis of its Farevacolor division. ""This integration is part of a coherent process in creating new products and new production systems that will benefit to the cosmetic industry by providing Chromavis (130 million euros in sales), with a new potential strength,"" the Group explained in a statement. Chromavis thus became the dedicated make-up centre of the Fareva Group and could benefit from new production platforms, such as Cosmeva (France) and Fareva Richmond (VA, USA). At the same time, the Fareva Group also recovered the nail polish activity of Chromavis and its factory in Brazil. Just a year ago, in July 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance announced the sale of its cosmetics manufacturing wing to Fareva. Under the terms of the agreement, Fareva was taking ownership of BCM. Simultaneously, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Fareva made a agreement for a 10-year global partnership for the manufacture and supply of Walgreens Boots Alliance own beauty brands and private label products, including products for sale in the USA. BCM operates factories in Nottingham in the UK, Vitré in France and Frankfurt in Germany. In 2017, the turnover of Chromavis reached EUR 150 million and the target for 2018 is of 185 million, for a total workforce of 880 employees. The Group owns five R&D centers and serves some 300 customers in 34 countries. ""Being part of the Fareva Group,"" insisted Fabrizio Buscaini, ""guarantees a strong financial, industrial and strategic backup with industrial sites all over the world: United States, Brazil, Poland, Ukraine, France and Germany. Our goal is clearly to double our turnover in the medium term. We are the second manufacturer in the sector today in Italy; we want to be the first! To reach this goal we need vision, passion, determination and pride. Everything is moving very fast in the beauty sphere. We can develop new products in less than three months. We have become a real laboratory of ideas where we anticipate makeup products of tomorrow. This new site of Offanengo will be a genuine platform dedicated to innovation and creativity""."
Biologique Recherche to take profit of the dynamic Brazilian high-end market,"The Biologique Recherche family company, created by Physician Philippe Alouche and specialized in skin treatments for 40 years, has long been developing its expertise in sophisticated face, body, and hair care based on products highly concentrated in actives and a three-phase method.

""Luxury is a prominent sector in Brazil, just like a few segments like hair care. Biologique Recherche is very well-positioned in these fields,"" he adds. As a matter of fact, the brand has developed a post-beach hair care protocol containing at least 20% actives, like all products in the range. This expansion meets the expectations of a specific consumer category. The professional believes it is also due to the market transformation related to the development of the Internet. ""Today, women are connected. They are better-informed of what occurs in the sector and of the product offering in other countries. They want the same thing. It also breaks down many access barriers in such a large country,"" he explains."

Juliette has a Gun chooses Paperscent for dispensing scented blotters in their first shop in Paris,"Launched in 2006 by the perfumer Romano Ricci, the great-grandson of Nina Ricci, niche perfume brand Juliette has a Gun recently opened the doors of its first standalone shop, designed as place where coffee and perfume meet. Dubbed Café Juliette, the new shop offers a convivial place where women can spend a pleasant moment, not only to test a perfume but also to taste coffee or drink champagne. ""The idea behind Café Juliette is to go beyond the simple perfume shop in order to offer a friendly place dedicated to women and to perfumes. Women will not hesitate to drop in unexpectedly, or by a flash, to perfume themselves, to have a quick makeover, to drink a glass of champagne, a Mariages Frères tea or a Coutume café, offered by the brand,"" explains Romano Ricci, creator of Juliette has a Gun. Within the shop, women will not only be able to discover the 13 Juliette has a Gun perfumes, including Moscow Mule, Lady Vengeance, and Not a Perfume, as well as the scents of the brand's Luxury Collection, but also to attend a Barista workshop, in partnership with Coutume Café. The shop's setting mixes modern merchandising and an intimate vibe where a waitress-perfumista welcome customers behind a bar. To help consumers to test their perfumes, Juliette has a Gun has chosen Paperscent, an innovative system that dispenses scented cards on-demand. The user-friendly device is integrated into the shop's interior design: consumers just have to pull on a strip of paper to instantly get a scented card. The system, developed by Gaudier Kuppel, a French merchandising specialist, has the advantage to save perfume, compared to a standard sampler, and to avoid air saturation. Thanks to Paperscent's user friendly and automatic operation, Juliette has a Gun was able to place one of the devices in the facade of Café Juliette with the aim to offer passer-by the opportunity to discover the brand's perfumes 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. Day and night, people walking in front of the store can leave with a scented card designed as a business card: with the name of the brand, the mail and address of the store. Integrated behind a slate, the device offers a real olfactory communication space for the perfumes that the shop wants to put under the spotlights.

Now chaired by Countess Mary von Faber-Castell, the wife of Count Anton-Wolfgang von Faber-Castell, who passed away two years ago, the Faber-Castell Cosmetics division relies on three production sites - two sites in Germany (in Stein and Geroldsgruen), and a site in Brazil (in Sao Carlos, near Sao Paulo) - as well as on a global network of sales offices in 14 different countries. Taking example on the Faber-Castell group, whose origins date back to 1761 and the creation of a wood-cased pencils factory by the cabinetmaker Kaspar Faber, the cosmetics division has been innovating continuously. ""In the last 2 years, we developed two new packaging options: The sharpenable slim plastic pencil MAGNETIC is the perfect packaging for super long-lasting formulations and can easily be customized from 'tip to toe'. And STYLER - our second slim liquid liner generation - is available with four different felt tips and provides an incredibly stunning, deep, saturated ink flow in one stroke whether you prefer an eyeliner in deep, dense black or icy metallic,"" said Mary von Faber-Castell. At the MakeUp in Paris trade show, held on June 21 -22, Faber-Castell Cosmetics celebrated its 40th birthday with the launched of the Countess' Classics box, a set of five pencils featuring a lipstick, a lip liner, an eye shadow, an eyeliner and an eyebrow pencil, selected by the Countess herself. The company also took advantage of the show to highlight its latest market-ready concepts: long-lasting kohl eyeliners; metallic pigments that amaze with an extra sparkle when blended; and velvety-matte lip colours that make lips feel moisturized and comfortable; fluid-like formulations in pencil-shape to softly beautify and retouch the skin. After having built a state-of-the-art production plant producing wood-cased and mechanical pencils for the international markets as well as liquid products for the Latin American region, Faber-Castell Cosmetics seeks to further expand its international presence to better address its customers' requests for increased flexibility and responsiveness. ""Future not only means product and process development for us. We are also working on diversifying and internationalizing our organization. Lean and flexible structures are a must in the ever changing environment of the global cosmetics landscape as well as proximity to Markets, customers, consumers and their needs and trends,"" said Christina Zech, Managing Director at Faber-Castell Cosmetics. Asked by Premium Beauty News about the possible opening of a production site in North America, Mary von Faber-Castell said that the company is ""very close to make an announcement with this respect."" Stay tuned!"
Brittany - a region at the helm of France's marine cosmetics industry,"The region is home to a 2,730km coastline and many companies have tapped into the research and innovation opportunities presented by its ecosystem. Brittany's cosmetics industry generates EUR 1.8 billion in sales and provides some 6,000 jobs, according to figures from a study carried out by technology transfer centre CBB Capbiotek. However, the cosmetics giant Yves Rocher, which is firmly established in the region and produces 85% of its cosmetics here, accounts for the lion's share of sales and jobs. Excluding Yves Rocher, Brittany's cosmetics industry generates EUR 400 million in sales and provides work for some 2,600-2,700 people, the study found. 167 Breton groups operate in the cosmetics industry, about half of which record more than 50% of their sales in cosmetics. Of these, half again work in finished products; a quarter in ingredients and raw materials; and another quarter in service, tests, formulation and packaging, the study identified. Of the 167 companies, 61% export internationally, principally to Europe, North America and Asia. The average export rate within these companies is 40%. Brittany is home to some 700 species of seaweed. 30% of the companies work in marine cosmetics, half of which are based in Finistère. These businesses account for total sales of EUR 150 million and around 730 jobs. The region boasts three marine biology stations (Concarneau, Dinard and Roscoff) and close to 40 innovation centres and platforms. The Station Biologique de Roscoff is involved in the GENIALG project which aims to promote marine cultures and their use in the cosmetics field. This centre also recently teamed up with researchers from the Biologie Intégrative des Modèles Marins and the Laboratoire des Sciences de l'Environnement Marin to conduct research on brown algae. The result of the study was a patent which claims to aid the production of phlorotannins (a type of tannins found in brown algae), which are used as natural extracts by the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. Besides Yves Rocher, Brittany is also home to several key players in the cosmetic field, which has seen particularly strong growth over the last 20 years or so. Based in Dirinon and Relecq-Kerhuon, Technature specializes in the treatment of alginate and is a global leader in the production of masks. The company generates sales of EUR 20 million, 50% of which comes from outside France. R&D represents 10% of its workforce. Laboratoires Gilbert makes gels, creams oils and balms for its Algotherm range; as well as aromatherapy products, liquid soaps and oleo limestone baby milk for its Laboratories Gilbert arm. The group's Plouédern production unit is specialized in the biotechnological exploitation of algae and in marine cosmetics and employs 100 people. Lessonia, which was founded in 2002, works with global cosmetics brands such as L'Oréal, for whom it has developed a new shampoo composed of flower petals. Lessonia is present in 75 countries. Agrimer - Bretagne Cosmétique Marins is a key player in the algae sector, in which it claims to be the only firm to cover the entire production chain (from the collection of algae to the finished product). 75% of its sales come from export. According to the group's president André Prigent, Agrimer has the capacity to produce 10,000 tonnes of algae per year. As well as the market leader Yves Rocher and the more established brands, there is also space for smaller companies to break into the market. 50% of the firms in the region employ less than ten people (a figure which is closer to 60% in Finistère). These companies generate on average some EUR 650,000 in revenues. They invest on average 14 to 15% of their sales in R&D. One such small company is Plouineau-based Formaderm, which was founded in 2002 and deals in phytotherapy (gels with plant-based extracts) and aromatherapy (essential oils). It employs ten people and generates EUR 850,000 in revenues. Quimper based Yslab, which was founded in 2000 and has 13 employees, offers finished products based on marine biotechnology. Among its offering is a toothpaste made with algae extract. Yslab is present in Russia, China, the Middle East and Europe. 90% of its revenues comes from export. ""The marine cosmetics sector has truly evolved,"" comments André Prigent, President of Agrimer-Bretagne Cosmétiques Marins. ""Twenty years ago, not many people were interested in cosmetic biotechnology. Today it's become central. At the last in-cosmetics trade show it was one of the areas at the heart of the innovations,"" adds Roland Conanec of CBB Capbiotek. With a combination of small and medium-sized companies anchoring themselves on Brittany's marine cosmetic map, it seems clear that this landscape is no longer just about Yves Rocher."
"""Brazilian consumers are a strategic source of inspiration for L'Oréal,"" Delphine Allard, L'Oréal Brasil","Premium Beauty News - How is this innovation centre positioned within the L'Oréal Group? Delphine Allard - It is part of the global network of L'Oréal innovation centres across the world, which comprises five other hubs in Japan, China, India, the United States, and South Africa. They all work hand in hand with our research centres in France. Last year, we inaugurated a new generation building on the Bom Jesus island close to Rio, but the R&I activity already existed in Brazil since 2009, on four different sites. The new site helped us gather all our teams and gain efficiency. Premium Beauty News - What is this investment aimed to? Delphine Allard - Brazil is the world's 4th beauty market, so it has a strategic importance. But if the L'Oréal group chose to invest that much, it is also due to the diversity you can find there. Brazil is the only country where you can easily find the eight hair types in our classification, from the straightest to the curliest. In addition, out of the 66 skin tones in the classification system set up by L'Oréal, 55 can be found in Brazil. It is a very important source of inspiration for us. Meeting the needs of this great diversity is almost like meeting the needs of the whole world's diversity. Also, beauty is important for Brazilian women. They are among the most demanding and expert women in the world. It was crucial for us to get as close as possible to this strategic source of inspiration, in order to understand their routines and meet their needs. In this centre, we have the installations and equipment to welcome and understand them. Premium Beauty News - Does L'Oréal Brasil Research have any specificities? Delphine Allard - The main mission of our R&I centre is to develop products based on local consumers' needs, but with a global potential. Due to climate conditions, aggressive treatments, and specific hair types, Brazilian women use five hair care products a day on average as part of their routines, compared to three on average for American or European women. Therefore, hair care is definitely the top priority category on which we have been focusing the most. Last year, we launched our first leave-on treatment adapted to Brazilian women's damaged hair: Elsève Cicatri Renov. Then, this product conquered the American market, and more recently Europe, where it is available under the name Cica Crème. It is a perfect example of an innovation developed in Brazil, but with a global potential. Premium Beauty News - Have you been working on other categories? Delphine Allard - Our second flagship category is sun care, in particular face sunscreens. The high UV indices and the humid climate in Brazil lead us to meet very specific needs, i.e. a very high, long-lasting protection and a mattifying skin feel, the 'toque seco' effect for oily skins. Our laboratory was able to meet these needs, in particular by drawing inspiration from a technology initially intended for skincare and developed by the international L'Oréal Research network. This AIRlicium technology is endowed with an extremely strong humidity and sebum absorption power. Based on this innovation, we launched a specific range, Anthelios AIRlicium by La Roche-Posay, with a very high protection up to an SPF70. Women here can use a sun protection factor of 70 on a daily basis: so it sets even higher standards in terms of product sensoriality and long wear. Initially launched with white and tinted versions, the Anthelios AIRlicium range got wider this year, with three new shades to meet the diversity of skin colours in the whole country. Today, this range helps us remain leaders in the category of tinted sun care, which shows a high growth rate and represents 45% of the sun care market. Due to its specificities, this product is only dedicated to the Brazilian market for now, but we have been evaluating its potential and working on a better-adapted version on the global level. Premium Beauty News - To what extent is this L'Oréal Brasil R&I centre a model of the genre within the L'Oréal network? Delphine Allard - Our installations are definitely up-to-date, with a unique Flex laboratory within the L'Oréal Group. It is not segmented according to categories, but to activities (weighing, control, manufacturing…). Beyond the advantage of improving flows and capitalizing on the equipment, it helps us favour cross fertilization between the various categories. A technician can be developing a hair treatment formula next to someone working on sun care and exchange about textures, protocols… It generates ideas and it is a more efficient collaborative and creative workspace. That is why we are unique and are becoming a model for other centres. Also, we have an exemplary assessment area, with all the installations needed to work, again, as close as possible to consumers, whether it be for the design, with co-creations, or for product assessment, from the prototype phase to the final validation. This co-creation concept is very interesting: for example, last year, we were able to launch a special range for curly hair designed with Brazilian consumers for local brand Niely. These women were consulted right from the beginning of the project until the final name choice. Premium Beauty News - Is the outstanding potential of Brazilian diversity an additional form of inspiration for L'Oréal Research? Delphine Allard - Apart from product development, we have an Advanced Research team whose main role is to discover, work, and put forward the ingredients derived from the Brazilian biodiversity on the global level. In Brazil, we are lucky enough to have access to inspiring ingredients with unique performances. To this aim, we work with local suppliers or directly in partnership with local communities as part of our Sharing Beauty With All programme. It has already resulted in a number of projects on ingredients identified as inspiring and highly efficient, like kamu kamu for Vichy, murumuru, cupuaçu, and pracaxi. Premium Beauty News - Do Brazilian women prefer cosmetics containing Brazilian ingredients? Delphine Allard - What matters to them are natural ingredients in general. The naturalness trend is important to many of them. However, they never compromise on performance for the sake of naturalness."
Alkos aims for industrial excellence with freshly inaugurated plant in France,"Premium Beauty News - You have just achieved a major project! Philippe Pavageau - Indeed! The challenge was to reposition Inter Cosmétiques as a major and unavoidable industrial player in the sector of personal care and make-up contract manufacturing, by providing the Company with an industrial tool that would allow producing in optimum conditions the innovative formulas devised by our Marketing teams and developed by our R&D teams. Led by Franck Dechatre, the site Director, the complete project spanned over two years (2016/2017). The logistics activity moved first in December 2017 and the complete transfer of our two sites in Angers (UP1 and UP2) to the new facility was completed by the end of March 2018. The new site has a bigger manufacturing capacity (1,400 m²) and a very large surface area dedicated to the packaging workshop (3,000 m²). Brand new equipment was also installed, including a new Atex 6 ton-tank for the cold processing of liquids, a next-generation lipstick filling machine equipped with metal and silicone pans with automatic feeding (labelling, mechanical nominal output of 60 pcs / min on average). These new investments enable Inter Cosmétiques to increase its production and manufacturing capacity by about 40%. This also allowed the Group to have a manufacturing workshop with the highest international standards, to gain competitiveness and consolidate the quality of the service offered to customers. Premium Beauty News - An awesome result that helps to see the future with optimism? Philippe Pavageau - We are of course, like our staff, whose working conditions have improved considerably, very satisfied with the result and I want to take this opportunity to once again thank Franck and his teams for the tremendous work accomplished in ensuring the continuity of operations including during the transfer of activities from the former site to the new one. However, a modern industrial site is not a sufficient condition for achieving the industrial excellence we are targeting, but it is a necessary condition, which we fulfil today. Our task is not completed and we are now tackling the huge challenge of industrial excellence. It is important to underline that we are also committed to a very active corporate social responsibility policy, which is part of our values and meets the expectations of all our key accounts. As such, we are proud to have recently been granted the Ecovadis Gold certification for the Inter Cosmétiques and Alkos sites. We are forging on with our existential goal: the satisfaction of our clients, because it is with their trust and their new projects that we can progress and support their development. Our investment programme in terms of industrial tools will provide us with the necessary levers to carry out this mission. A new milestone in the development of the Alkos Group The Company has gone a long way since December 1986 when Jean Pierre Sandrin created the Laboratoires Inter Cosmétiques and started operating in the suburbs of Angers, in the West of France. At the time, lipstick was manually or semi-manually poured into 40-cavity metal moulds. The bulk was heated in vessels or in a saucepan, the temperature of moulds was controlled by simply passing the hand over them, then the bulk was cooled in the fridge and after the required time, moulds were opened and one by one the grapes were hand-picked and placed in the mechanisms. After having extended its activity to filling and manual decoration, in the early 1990s Mr Sandrin pioneered the development of the first airless filling machine in cooperation with the Valois Company, a major innovation which attracted new customers. Because of this success, the historical site became too small and the Company had to move in October 1992 in the UP1 factory, at 8 rue de la Claie with a staff of about 80 people; a location where the company will stay for 25 years until the end of 2017. In the meantime, with the development of activities a second site in Beaucouzé, called UP2 opened in July 1999 in parallel with the acquisition of SAGAL to the Guerlain/Dior/Chanel EIG (Economic Interest Grouping), a Company based near Chartres, specialized in the manufacture of high end soaps and scented deodorants. The activity will continue to flourish in the 1990s with the outsourcing of logistics and storage operations to an operator in the neighbouring industrial zone In 2008, Gérard Gieux bought the Inter Cosmetiques and SAGAL companies to create the Alkos Group, which was then gathering Cosmogen, a supplier of cosmetic accessories and packaging, and Alkos Cosmétiques, a French-based manufacturer of cosmetic pencils. After the severe economic crisis in the late 2000s, and under the leadership of Dominique Vautier, its President, the activity took a new boost with the arrival of Florence Lefeuvre to head the Sales and Marketing. An industrial master plan will quickly demonstrate, early 2014, that the two UP1 and UP2 sites would no longer be able to sustain the expected growth. Several options were therefore considered: - An expansion on the existing UP1 site. – The transfer of the make-up activity on the site of Alkos Cosmétiques in Boulogne sur Mer. – The construction of a new site or the rehabilitation of an existing industrial site available for sale. Two sites were available in the suburbs of Angers and the one previously occupied by Valéo was eventually selected. The new plant project was definitively adopted in September 2015, with the financial support of local administrations."
"""It is critical to take into account the complete change in consumer habits over the past few years,"" Jean François Harpes, IL Cosmetics","It's no secret that the nail polish sector has been experiencing a global decline over the past four years. In such a context, leveraging consumer insight and market analysis to understand the expectations of end users and to tailor product development is a key axis of Luxembourg-based group IL Cosmetics' strategy. The group recently commissioned a market research company to conduct a study on its most important European markets; namely Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy, across the nail polish and nail cosmetics spectrum. The aim was to find out ""why the nail polish market, which used to be around 6 billion units, has dropped to under three,"" Harpes explains. ""We believe it's absolutely critical to take into account the complete change in consumer habits over the past few years."" Users are moving beyond traditional nail polish, and semi-permanent is one area that is seeing significant growth. ""Semi-permanent, which about four years ago had a market share in the U.S. and Europe of about five to ten percent, gained very large market shares,"" Harpes explains. ""It is between 25 and 40 percent depending on the market, and has an even stronger penetration rate of about 40 percent in some markets such as Ukraine and Russia."" With more nail polish users looking to semi-permanent formulas, this sub-segment is predicted to grow further still in the future. Natural formulas are a small but growing trend. While consumers are looking for eco-friendly formulas, the market has been slow to respond to consumer demand, mainly due to technical constraints. ""It is big in the idea but small in the sales, except in China where alternative water-based formulas account already for at least 1/3 of the market,"" Harpes says. ""This is because brands haven't found suitable formulas that pushed them to move away from normal nail polish."" While such formulas don't necessarily have to be water-based, says Harpes, they need to be more natural, safer and chemical free. Hybrid formulas, which currently only claim a three to five percent market share, could have a real future, says Harpes, provided that the category brings something more than what is already on the market. ""Hybrid will have a future if it is really a category in between [conventional] nail polish and semi-permanent,"" he states. He explains: ""That means, if you can apply with the brush, if it dries reasonably fast, if the performance is better than nail polish, if it's long-lasting and if you can remove it easily."" Harpes claims that, with nothing on the market that currently fits this bill, hybrid polishes are ripe for innovation. IL Cosmetics seems well-positioned to tackle the tough market, having made significant investments since the second quarter of 2017 to allow it to offer products across the entire nail cosmetics spectrum: conventional nail polishes and alternative formulas (water-based, odour-free, naturally sourced ingredient formulas), as well as hybrid and semi-permanent. The company now has independent teams working across the different segments (more than 20% of its employees work in R&D and innovation), which enables multiple, parallel product innovations - said to be key to the group's flexibility. In the middle of last year, for example, IL Cosmetics began looking to the growing segment of soak-off gel polish, and will present its formulations in this area at the upcoming MakeUp in Paris trade show, which will take place on 21 and 22 June at the Carrousel du Louvre in the French capital. While conventional nail polish remains the group's core business, Harpes says that understanding the technicalities of the semi-permanent category will help guide further developments in the intermediate hybrid category. Given the difficult market, IL Cosmetics is not one to rest on its laurels. The group says it continually strives to outsmart its own developments by improving and updating formulas, with all of its new launches validated upstream by consumer panels. Beyond the nail category, the company is also looking to develop by entering new categories through its lips and eye makeup division Luxcos. Luxcos currently manufactures mascaras, liquid eyeliners and lip glosses. ""We're looking to other lip products and we're looking to foundations… this is probably still six months to a year ahead,"" reveals Harpes. ""We believe that the basis for this diversification is setting up the internal structures which allow us to be active in many new segments. All these diversification plans are supported and will be followed by a reinforcement of the marketing teams."" To this end, an acquisition could be on the cards. ""As well as internal growth, we are also still looking into possibilities of external growth,"" said Harpes, adding that this is likely to be for other makeup products in the lip area, or perhaps foundations. Watch this space."
Fiabila enters the Brazilian nail polish market,"The opening of this new, twelfth production site just shows how strong the Brazilian market's potential is. Considered as the first global market in volume for nail polish, Brazil boasts exponential dynamics. ""Brazil should soon be ranked first in value, as the nail polish unit price is very low there,"" declares Pierre Miasnik, the group's President. This future situation goes with consumers' search for more qualitative products. ""The market is not mature in terms of offering and marketing, so there is a strong potential for a restructured, more qualitative, diversified, and technical offering,"" adds General Manager Alexandre Miasnik. As the only one global producer in this field to have a production unit in Brazil, Fiabila appears as a choice partner for major Brazilian players and global cosmetics brands as they enter a market devoid of any tailor-made packaging expert in nail polish. In addition, this opportunity helps the manufacturer highlight his unique know-how and technologies. The latest change in Sun Prodigy showcased at Cosmoprof 2018 perfectly exemplifies this. A pioneer in hybrid formulas, Fiabila has been working for several years on improving their performances to reach levels close to permanent nail polish gels, only without the drawbacks. The Sun Prodigy patented solution is derived from this technology. Based on the development of an innovative oligomer, the formula polymerizes in the presence of natural UV rays, those of the day light, for a long wear, shiny result that can last over seven days. It is a three-step application: the base for the adhesion, the coloured layer, and the overlayer sensitive to the sun rays. Each of these three specific products can also be used separately. ""The Brazilian market is very specific. Women often go to beauty salons, where the application is definitely affordable, but home routines are increasingly popular. In addition, they are not turned to semi-permanent polish at all, whereas customer expectations tend to be focused on long wear and shininess, as well as quality, to prevent any allergic reactions, which are frequent with local products. So, our solution has it all to convince them,"" comments Alexandre Miasnik. The new production site spreads across 15,000 m2, including 8,000 m2 of buildings, for a manufacturing capacity of 20 tonnes of base per day and eight filling and packaging lines, three of which are already working. Two additional ones will be operational this summer, and three others are scheduled in the short term. The plant comprises an R&D laboratory to control raw materials and finished products and offers customers very high-level service and flexibility. ""Fiabila can supply all market segments, whatever the price positioning, but always with a better quality offering. The price range is very large here, it can range from 3 to more than 20 Reais, and the formulas are not always that safe,"" explains Alexandre Miasnik. ""Our offering is also much diversified for players whose demand can range from simple colourless bases to turnkey finished products. Our flexibility is an advantage,"" he adds. At the end of their first year of activity, the two Directors draw positive conclusions from the significant investments made. ""We are already working with high-profile players in Brazil, and more widely across Latin America. The globalization of local brands plays a positive role: we can provide them with a qualified product which can be distributed all around the world without any risks,"" asserts the group's President."
Beauty full service: Marvinpac acquires a stake in the capital of Strand Cosmetics Europe,"Premium Beauty News - Marvinpac and Strand Cosmetics Europe already know each other well?! Éric Bouvier - Indeed, Strand Cosmetics and Marvinpac have been working together for more than three years as part of MS Swiss Cosmetics, a joint venture dedicated to the development, manufacturing and packaging of Swiss made skincare and make-up products. We realized very quickly that other synergies were possible, beyond the ""Made in Switzerland"", especially through the use of the Marvinpac site in the Czech Republic. This collaboration has already enabled us to win new interesting tenders. In addition, building on these early successes, we started to give wider consideration to an even closer partnership and laid out hard data. We defined a strategic plan, with, as a first step, Marvinpac taking a minority but yet significant stake in Strand Cosmetics Europe. Ludovic Hericher - Beyond the strategic aspects, there is also a human adventure behind this. As soon as we started working together on the MS Swiss Cosmetics project the contribution from our teams, was already very strong, which encouraged us to go one step further. Premium Beauty News - What are the objectives of this merger? Éric Bouvier - This will allow us to significantly broaden our offer. Depending on our customers' needs, we will be able to offer made in France, made in Switzerland, or European products. Ludovic Hericher - Brands that trust us can now rely on three industrial tools complying with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) standards, some of which are specific to the production of OTC products. This will help us better meet the growing expectations of brands in terms of production capacity, responsiveness and competitiveness. Bulk is always produced in France or Switzerland to respect the designation of origin dear to our customers. Some filling operations can also be carried out in the Czech Republic to offer our customers very competitive costs. Through our three sites, we can therefore guarantee a continuity of production (Business continuity plan or BCP), an increasingly important parameter for brands. Premium Beauty News - With some investments on top of it? Éric Bouvier - Of course! Mainly in order to further strengthen our production capacities, in both Switzerland and France. At Strand Cosmetics Europe's site, near Lyon, where many things have already been done, we will continue to increase our bulk production and filling capacity. Ludovic Hericher - New investments are also planned in Switzerland and we will boost our production capacity in the Czech Republic where are performed filling operations for jars, vials, BB cream-type compacts, and tubes in a certified high hygiene environment audited by leading brands. Several million pieces are already filled and conditioned. The aim is to further strengthen these capacities and expand further our portfolios with new product lines. Premium Beauty News - Will this merger lead to a specialization of your production sites? Ludovic Hericher - This is not on the agenda, but we will continue to work to strengthen synergies where they really make sense. The MS Swiss Cosmetics experience has demonstrated that with an efficient staff, we are already capable of achieving substantial revenues and are ready to record a fine growth with the premium brands trusting us. We rely on the infrastructure of our respective companies, particularly in terms of R & D, regulatory affairs, marketing and sales, industrialization and supply chain. Today, to support brands in their new needs, agility in a fast track mode is required to be ready willing and able to respond to their important growth driven needs. For this, working in close connection with our customers and a rigorous follow-up are the key. It is therefore important that each of our entities remain relatively autonomous while benefiting from the Group's synergies. Éric Bouvier - Let us also specify that all entities will keep their own identity. Premium Beauty News - There is a growing concentration of players in the cosmetics subcontracting area. The accelerating of pace of launches and the increasing demands of brands on their distributors seem to generate increasing pressure? Éric Bouvier - Undeniably pressure is increasing in terms of prices and deadlines. We must support the growth of brands by offering as much flexibility as possible. The supply chain becomes a strategic element of the offer and this calls for significant resources requirements, both human and industrial. We just hired a Supply Chain Director coming from a large group in the medical device industry. Ludovic Hericher - Full service has always been part of Marvinpac's DNA. At a time when demand from brands is becoming stronger and more complex, the rapprochement with Strand Cosmetics Europe is the guarantee to offer our customers a one-stop window offering R & D, bulk manufacturing, filling operations and even the preparation of shipments, not to mention regulatory issues. We can also offer our specific knowledge for co-packing, the manufacturing of assembled boxes and kitting in our site in the Czech Republic. In short, as you can see, we are more than ever in working order! PremiumBeautynews - What are the next steps? Éric Bouvier, Ludovic Hericher - We are launching a series of meetings bringing together our teams to build a joint marketing and sales strategy in cosmetics, with offers that integrate the specificity, expertise and identity of our sites."
"""Cosmetica Italia should be recognized as the national reference entity in the cosmetics industry"", Renato Ancorotti","Premium Beauty News - You are succeeding Fabio Rossello, who has worked a lot on promoting the Italian perfume & cosmetics industry since 2011. How important is this industry today? Renato Ancorotti - In 2017, the Italian cosmetics industry achieved a total turnover of 11 billion euros (+4.3%), even 15.7 billion euros if you count the whole chain, from the ingredients to the finished products, including the machines and the packaging. Export remains one of the key growth drivers of this branch in Italy, since, for the same year 2017, it rose by 8%, compared to the previous year, reaching 4.7 billion euros. Premium Beauty News - What are your programme's top priorities? Renato Ancorotti – First, my mission will obviously be to do everything I can to make sure this sector develops according to ethical and responsible values. I will do everything needed to offer as many internal services as possible for our members. I consider my mission as a means to promote the values of the industry abroad and to protect the interests of our branch. The only vision needed for the Association is, above all, to be the only reference point for all cosmetics companies. I have planned to quickly organize a large meeting to redefine our strategic priorities and better understand how we should govern the association. In addition, I intend to appoint what I call a ""coordinator"", who will be in charge of regularly visiting members in their premises, so that they are better-informed about the services the association can offer them. He/she will listen to their ideas and needs, which will then be shared and evaluated. Actually, I think the presence of a Board member that belongs to the same group as the company visited would contribute to strengthening the relationships between the Association and its members. Premium Beauty News - What are your views on governance? Renato Ancorotti - I think it is important to reinforce the role of our Board of Directors, by creating more operational positions. It will be essential to collaborate with the other organizations representative of the industry and with key people, as well as with the authorities, for example as regards training. We need to be able to share more about our industrial and commercial experiences. We will need to organize more meetings with each other. To me, it is important to make the association more flexible, to build a real structured network with the participation of new entrepreneurs guided by some of our own members who would act as ""tutors"". And of course, all this should be done with perfect loyalty. Premium Beauty News - Will there be working groups? Renato Ancorotti - Of course there will be! They are very important. It is crucial to set up an accurate programme, and probably to increase these groups' budgets. Each of them will need to be representative of the member sectors. Of course, we also need to invest in environmental protection, and we should not forget about better representing major companies. Premium Beauty News - Is the global level a priority for you? Renato Ancorotti - It is essential! We will most likely need to be more present in exhibitions and fairs. We will also need to develop more things with foreign countries' local authorities. And of course, we should create a service to help companies export their products. It is very important for Cosmetica Italia to be recognized as a national reference entity by the main global players. Premium Beauty News - Services, services, more and more services! Renato Ancorotti - Of course! But we need to make them more and more profitable, interesting, and better-adapted to our members, by increasing our revenue, and then reinvesting them in the association's activities. Premium Beauty News - Communication and marketing are essentials today… Renato Ancorotti - That's true! Hence our analysis and search for potential partners to help us better know and analyze our customers' needs. In addition, to better communicate, we should optimize our database. I also intend to strengthen our internal and external communication campaigns. Premium Beauty News - It seems you also want to redefine the scope of a few sectors within the association… Renato Ancorotti - Indeed! That of packaging in particular should be included, so that we can represent our branch more efficiently. Cosmetics represent a field of excellence for the ""Made in Italy"" mark, but we will need to better focus our communications on it, so we can keep improving the trust in and reputation of our industry. We need to reinforce relationships with business stakeholders and ensure we take part in new economic and institutional initiatives. Premium Beauty News - What are your plans as regards technical and legislative activities? Renato Ancorotti - It is an essential aspect for any association worthy of its name! We should pay particular attention to the most relevant and emerging issues (for example, the next cosmetics regulation review, the common criteria, e-commerce/selective distribution). We need to help the industry work and efficiently innovate and guarantee regulatory stability. We should take part in the debates and get involved to overcome the technical/regulatory obstacles related to international trade in order to protect and develop export. Premium Beauty News - Last major issue: research and environment… Renato Ancorotti - Again, we will need to promote the collaboration of our study centre with external bodies as well as the creation of training courses in cosmetics. Lastly, I would like to emphasize my commitment as regards ethics and sustainable development. We should encourage all members to commit to environmental strategies, for example by adopting the ISO certification on environmental management, and raise their awareness of corporate social responsibility. In addition, we intend to renew our support to the La Forza e il Sorriso programme, which is meant to help women cope with the visible side effects of the treatments of all cancer types, thanks to free beauty workshops."
Texen completes its reorganization and launches 4.0 transformation,"""Like many successful companies that have become leaders in their market, Texen has grown internationally, relying in particular on a series of acquisitions, starting with Mar-Lee in the United States, followed by C+N Packaging in 2014 and Topline the following year,"" explains Ludovic Anceau, CEO of Texen and President of the Luxury Goods and Beauty Business Unit of PSB Industries. Indeed, Texen's history looks like a success story. Strongly anchored in the French ""Plastics Valley"", Europe's biggest cluster of plastic converters, the company has a strong industrial culture. As part of the PSB Industries group, it can also rely on a stable family shareholding, firmly committed to its development. ""Thanks to significant investments that have allowed a very high level of automation, Texen is one of the packaging suppliers that have managed to maintain most their activities in France,"" stresses Ludovic Anceau. A real asset when the time of relocation has come, under the pressure of requests for agility and speed to market. The arrival of Ludovic Anceau at the head of the company coincided with the integration of Topline. ""In a context of changing demands from our customers, it was the right moment to combine industrial and trading capabilities. The acceleration of launches, the reduction of development times, the mushrooming of small series and the lower visibility in the medium and long term, meant a more agile and more responsive organization adapted to a variety of brand needs."" With eleven industrial sites around the world and four sales offices (Paris, New York, Sao Paulo, Shanghai), the PSB Industries Group's Luxury Goods and Beauty Business Unit is now based on three pillars: Texen Industries, Texen Beauty Partners and Texen Innovation. With its strong technological expertise, the industrial base of the pole was renamed Texen Industries. It is dedicated to exclusive and personalized packaging, developed around the world as close as possible to customers through an industrial network spreading over three continents. The Mayet (mascara, lipgloss) and CMSI (closures, perfumes, skincare and selective boxes) French sites are the spearheads of Texen Industries. Each of these factories is linked to two other sites of the group for a bigger capacity. This new organization will make it possible to rationalize and mutualize investments, in particular to continue the transformation of production sites towards Industry 4.0 with a view to greater flexibility and agility. ""Several sites of the beauty pole are already very advanced on this subject. CMSI, for instance, operates highly automated lines and Mayet is installing its first 4.0 line for a multi decoration mascara and multi formats project. This experience will serve as a basis for a complete 4.0 industrialization of the plant,"" explains Ludovic Anceau. By divesting from its Food and Retail Business Unit (CGL Pack), PSB Industries has given itself the financial means to initiate its transformation while giving itself the possibility to make new acquisitions in the luxury and beauty sector. ""We remain in an industrial logic to strengthen the group through complementary acquisitions where it will be useful, either in geographic terms or product and technological terms."" The sourcing and full-service base, dubbed Texen Beauty Partners, is designed to meet the needs of customers who do not necessarily invest in individual moulds but are in need of innovation and speed to market. Organized around the group's trading entities in Europe, the United States and a sourcing hub in China, Texen Beauty Partners relies on a strong network of partners, particularly in Asia, and enables the co-development of global solutions, from formulation to accessories, in addition to the industrial offer. For Ludovic Anceau: ""What is important in full service is to master the logistics of products and the chain of services at local and global levels. This allows to quickly be able to address a request and respond precisely to specific customer demands."" Finally, Texen Innovation must allow the Luxury and Beauty business unit to better analyse the markets and better target innovations and investments. Texen Innovation brings together the marketing, communication and innovation functions of the pole at the global level. Besides the marketing team, the development team was strengthened. ""More than an organizational change, it is a structural transformation. We are moving from the juxtaposition of independent SMEs to the collaboration of complementary poles and skills,"" insists Ludovic Anceau. Simultaneously, Texen is strengthening its CSR policy. A manager has been recruited to meet the expectations of customers in this field, and anticipate them. Texen is also investing heavily in human resources with the creation of a ""Texen School"", in training and in the search for new profiles to meet the challenges of the digital revolution. ""Today, we must be ready to react to all scenarios and be moving on all positions, according to the needs of the customers. This requires agile factories, reliable partners and robust skills across different product categories,"" concludes Ludovic Anceau."
The Granado Group continues to grow in Brazil and in Europe,"Premium Beauty News - You purchased Granado in 1994, as the historic brand was in need of modernization. Twenty years later, it embodies – again – the dynamism of Brazilian cosmetics with many points of sale and the beginnings of its global development. Christopher Freeman - Granado is the oldest cosmetics brand in Brazil. Mr Granado, the founder's grandson, sold it as they were facing difficulties. We repositioned it based on its beautiful heritage associated with its apothecary origins. The first wholly-owned store opened ten years ago, and there are now 62 of them all over the country. We are also present in a concept store in Portugal, in France, and more widely in Europe, through the on and offline Sephora network, where our products have been available for a few weeks. Premium Beauty News - Is France Granado's other favourite country? Sissi Freeman - It is, the brand has received a warm welcome there. We arrived in France thanks to the Bon Marché department store five years ago. Our products very quickly found their public, which encouraged us to open a store on Bonaparte Street. We have been considering the opportunity of opening a second point of sale in the Marais quarter, where we are actually represented from May 25 to June 17 in the Paris de Janeiro pop-up store. And we also have an e-shop. Premium Beauty News - Are you considering developing in other countries or continents? Christopher Freeman - It is important to do this step by step. The fact that we recently got access to the Sephora network helps us be present in 230 points of sale in Europe. We are going to open a wholly-owned store in Lisbon, and then maybe in England or Germany, why not? Premium Beauty News - Today, you are putting Phebo forward by opening three stores in Brazil by August. Sissi Freeman - We wanted to give this brand more space, because it does not get as much as it deserves in Granado stores. Phebo is a brand from Belém known of all Brazilians for several generations for its soaps and fragrances. It really embodies Brazil, and that is what customers will find in store, with a modern decoration focused on local ingredients and materials like wood and plants in a very colourful setting. The experience is different from Granado's pharmaceutical culture. Phebo stores will highlight ingredients and customization. For example, customers will be able to have their perfume bottles engraved in store. The first Perfumaria Phebo will open in June in the Leblon quarter of Rio, and then another will be inaugurated in July in Curitiba, and a third in August in São Paulo. Premium Beauty News - What has changed since the Puig group acquired shares in the company in 2016? Christopher Freeman - The support Puig provided is a precious help for us, with new technologies, in particular in the field of perfumery. It also helps us strengthen our investments. It is a family group, we work with the same spirit. It was a very good decision. Premium Beauty News - Are all Granado/Phebo products made in Brazil? Christopher Freeman - We make almost everything – formulas, packaging, and finished products - in our brand new plant located one hour from Rio, and for which we have just invested 150 million reais. Only makeup products and specific packaging are outsourced. Premium Beauty News - How is the market doing given the economic and political situation in Brazil? Christopher Freeman - The cosmetics market maintained itself during the crisis, and it started growing again in 2017. As regards Granado, we have always done much better than the market. Our sales rose by 15% in the first quarter, compared to 2017. But for now, the overall situation is still unclear and should remain so until 2019."
Nippon Shikizai: Japanese innovation boosting European mascara,"Mascara is one of the most used makeup products among Asian women. It is the everyday beauty gesture: in front of the mirror, while commuting to work, in the office before an important meeting... Creating the perfect mascara formula therefore became Nippon Shikizai's priority. In fact, it is a real challenge that was taken up by the Japanese leader because, according to experts, eyelashes of Asian women are stiff, short, ""fan shaped"" and pointing downwards! The tests and research conducted by the Company have finally enabled Nippon Shikizai's formulators to formulate THE mascara with a ""doe-eye"" effect (the one worn by Natalie Portman and Bella Hadid). ""Bringing to life the dreams of Asian women was not easy,"" explained one of Nippon Shikizai's formulators, Mai Akimoto. ""I also have typical Asian eyelashes. To find myself beautiful, I feel the need to give length, curve and volume to my lashes."" In general, Japanese women are very meticulous and follow, as for so many other things, a set ritual during their makeup routine. Perfection is a prerequisite for the Japanese, Chinese or Korean consumer, which involves applying the right product, with the right brush and with a precise gesture. We mustn't forget the unfavourable environment, knowing that climate in Asian countries is often hot and humid and you will have a complete snapshot of the issues related to the development of a mascara for the Japanese market. Mascara must indeed be water resistant. Ultimate issue: Asian women don't like waterproof mascaras, which are too difficult to remove. From this observation, Nippon Shikizai developed an ultra-innovative formula called the ""Warm Water Washable Mascara"". To date, more than 100 million mascaras based on Nippon Shikizai's top-formula have already been sold in Asia. ""Now our goal is to make this innovation available for European brands and consumers. European lashes being very different from Asian lashes, we needed to find a European partner capable of designing a brush perfectly compatible with our formula and with the morphology of European lashes, to sublimate the beauty of Western women. We worked with the Albéa Group, the leading designer of mascara packs and brushes in order to combine our expertise and co-develop an optimal make-up solution,"" explained Tsuyoshi Hasuo, President of Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics and Nippon Shikizai France, the European subsidiaries of the Nippon Shikizai Group. ""The Albéa industrial facility in Bottanuco near Milan was used as a meeting point for Albéa's Tips Studio teams and Nippon Shikizai's formulation team. We tested all possible combinations on European lashes to come up with the perfect brush/formula compatibility. The result of the collaboration is a success. Nippon Shikizai can now offer European customers an innovative formula, which has already won over millions of Asian consumers with a combination of pack + bush + formulation perfectly adapted to their type of lashes,"" he added. At the end of the month, on its stand at the MakeUp in Paris trade show, Nippon Shikizai will again demonstrate its formidable capacity for innovation by presenting its new collection on the theme of ""J-Beauty"", and will give pride of place to the mascara originating from its collaboration with Albéa."
Aircos is moving up a gear,"The Aircos company actually holds a long track record, which begun in 1952 with the creation of the Airsec company and a patent granted for a desiccating process and which later lead to the creation of Aircos. Four important milestones will have marked the company's development. In 1989 with the construction of a second production plant in Ardon, France, to support the other French plant in Romorantin who will later specialize in makeup. Then 2000 sees the creation of a R&D Formulation Laboratory in Paris, at the Group's headquarters, specialized in the formulation of powders. In 2012, Aircos developed its brand new in-house Back Injection, IPM process. And finally, in 2015, the Company decides to focus on the development of its export sales. Needless to say, the IPM process was clearly a very smart idea!? ""With this back-injection process developed six years ago,"" explains Sirot. ""We can really put forward our mastery of the container/content compatibility. This technology which stems from our expertise as formulation and injection specialists was fully developed in-house. And most of all, our process allows highlighting all the properties of the ingredients (in particular pigments and nacres) and resulting in astonishing softness, brightness and payoff. We have also clearly benefited from the craze for products with a metal effect, where our IPM process delivers unmatched performances."" This technology is so successful that Aircos today has no trouble feeding its ten IPM machines running in Romorantin. ""IPM is undeniably one of our key assets,"" underlines Sirot, ""this is why we continue building on the potential of our R & D laboratories to keep on innovating."" ""Our export sales have jumped from 5% four years ago to almost 50% today!"" says Thomas Sirot. ""In recent years, we haven't stopped proposing very innovative and truly differentiating formulas in all the areas of the products we manufacture with the industrial guarantee of complying with GMP standards. We have also invested a great deal commercially, particularly on the two Coasts the United States, but also in the Middle East. Proposing and producing our own packaging is undeniably a very important asset in times when demand for Full Service is so high."" It must be said that Aircos' Ardon plant is home to some 35 injection and bi-injection machines ranging from 25 tons to 330 tons. Production lines which are dedicated to makeup cases, intermediate size packagings or samples, without forgetting printing and assembling machines. Total industrial investments, including the extension of the Romorantin makeup site, amounted for the two sites in 2017 and 2018, to EUR 4.5 million. A figure to compare to the 10 million achieved in 2014! Quite a track record for this family-run French SME of 170 people which integrated in December 2017 another family owned Group, Anjac Health & Beauty, posting EUR 190 million. in sales and with very complementary activities in terms of formulation, manufacture and packaging of health, beauty, medical devices and hygiene products. The acquisition of Aircos is part of Anjac's ambition to build a group of companies with high added value. The expertise of the SME in the area of makeup enables the Company to strengthen its field of expertise and therefore to diversify its offer. The integration of Aircos is also in line with the commitment of the Anjac Group for promoting French industrial excellence, an asset already recognized for the six other Group companies: Sicaf, Chemineau, Eurowipes, Shadeline, LPEV and more recently Pascual."
Le Jardin Retrouvé survey community for next fragrance,"As a perfumer for Roure Bertrand (now known as Givaudan) as from 1935, Yuri Gutsatz created many fragrances for Carven, Dior, or Estée Lauder. In the 1970s, the cutting edge artist claimed a third path in perfumery. ""With his writings and firm stance, he really theorized this concept of parallel perfumery. He defended perfumers' freedom to create without being subject to marketing constraints and, above all, to choose the raw materials themselves, in all palettes,"" Clara Feder emphasized. Revived by son Michel with the support of young perfumer Maxence Moutte, the brand now counts seven fragrances re-released exactly as they were in accordance with the current IFRA standards. This return was made possible thanks to the creator's iconoclastic vision, this large freedom of choice as regards the ingredients and their sourcing, an eco-responsible approach, and a unique refillable bottle. As far as communication is concerned, the brand puts an emphasis on the interpersonal relationships with customers and enthusiasts on social media. The brand chose to nurture this close relationship by making their community take part in the whole process, including the choice of the next perfume. Out of the 2,000 formulas making up Yuri Gutsatz's professional heritage, an invaluable olfactory testament representing a whole career, four were selected for their exclusive qualities and modernity. Today, the final choice is made by the customers, the influencers, and the brand's lovers. ""We deeply believe that giving the power to our customers – some of them have been loyal to the brand for decades – and perfume lovers all over the world is the most beautiful tribute we could pay to my humanist and cosmopolitan father, a creator of perfumes,"" Michel Gutsatz explains. It has actually been possible for a month -and until June 15 - to submit a request on the dedicated website www.perfumeparty.paris in order to receive samples of the four perfumes selected. Four 3 ml mini-sprays identified with a colour are then sent to the participants, who can express their colour choice on the website. ""People actually make determined choices for one fragrance or the other. They make a blind choice, red or yellow or black, always with much passion,"" comments Clara Feder. The consultation relayed by bloggers and influencers is available in 34 countries in the five continents, and over 300 tests have already been ordered. The winning perfume will be unveiled on June 24, and then offered in limited edition and numbered by hand in bottles that had been chosen by Yuri Gutsatz for the preferential rate of 100 euros for 50 ml."
Novacap asserts its ambitions and invests in blockchain technology,"Today established as the worldwide leader for salicylic acid, Novacap [1] has also an excellent position in other essential ingredients, such as methyl salicylate and sodium bicarbonate. The company now intends to leverage on its global leadership positions in pharmaceuticals to conquer the cosmetic market. For the last three years, Novacap has significantly broaden its cosmetic portfolio via several key acquisitions: Uetikon, in 2015, a German company specializing in tailor made synthesis of complex molecules for pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, Chemoxy in 2017, a British company, specialized in custom processing, solvent recovery, environmentally friendly solvents, and specialty personal care ingredients such as emollient, preservative booster esters, and in 2017 too, ID bio, a French company specialized in classical or biotechnological extraction and purification of botanical substances, and PCAS, a company specializing in the development and manufacturing of complex molecules for life science industries.

""The first ambition is to guaranty the traceability of organic active ingredients, in compliance with Ecocert/Cosmos label, from raw material purchase to finished product shipment,"" the company highlights."
"Wide Society, the new eco-responsible brand by The Different Company","Wide Society packaging materials are recyclable (glass, aluminium, linen, cotton) and/or made of certified recycled materials (cardboard). Only the pumps, which can be unscrewed, are based on plastic. This way, the new brand successfully rides on the sustainable wave of daily perfumes, with convenient travel-size packs to be refilled over and over again.

"Beauty Success Group launches a ""neo-perfumery"" concept","Within the context of a receding selective market, Beauty Success Group set itself broader objectives focused on beauty services to seize growth opportunities. ""We believe there is a territory to conquer, which highlights both selective and niche brands and meets new consumer expectations involving highly-personalized, tailor-made advice,"" Stéphanie Chalard asserts. One may think about a return to the codes of the perfumery trade, but Stéphanie Chalard prefers to talk about neo-perfumery with a very modern approach. Their points of sale will lay out an offering combining niche and selective products and featuring a high-end salon. ""We consider there is a population that wants to have access to a selection of the two types of products, but with a highly specialized service. It is all based on the customer relationship. This service will involve sustained training for our advisors about the art of welcoming customers and getting to know them, not only through their purchases, but also through their own personality,"" she adds. The group has also been working on this approach with its partner brands. ""It is a very popular concept among brands, because they think we revive and build up an identity for the selective network."" Today, the family group counts five brand networks, the flagship channel being the Beauty Success selective stores – 320 perfume stores/salons mainly settled in small and medium-sized cities – completed with 170 Esthetic Center salons. The three other brands are making progress: Beauty Full Days, a new generation of beauty salons, the Parapharmacie Tanguy network and Beauty Sisters for Millennials. This new concept, whose name will be unveiled when the first store opens in June in Périgueux, completes the cluster of existing brands, but it will not depend on the Beauty Success brand. A second opening should be scheduled for early 2019 to set up a national network mainly settled in big cities in the long run."
Parfums Berdoues to enrich their offering,"Initially based on transmission, innovation, and creativity values, the Berdoues group is now present in 40 countries with about ten brands – an exemplary development for this family SME that managed to revitalize their market generation after generation. Henri Berdoues's iconic 1930s creations, like Colognes by the 1902 brand, or Violette de Toulouse, were followed by an opening to supermarket channels with Blondépil and Petits Plaisirs by Pierre Berdoues in the 1960s. In the 2000s, his daughter Sophie initiated the purchase of the ELLES and IKKS licences, as well as of Molyneux perfumes, very popular for export. Iconic and historical brand 1902 has just been enriched with a range of body skincare products based on natural ingredients perfumed with the Mille Fleurs Berdoues olfactory signature. The 1967 Pierre Berdoues mille fleurs, a container intended for collecting the results of unsuccessful tests performed by perfumers during olfactory sessions, led to the creation of a unique olfactory concentrate. Today, this floral formula, which was preciously preserved for 50 years, is associated with the range's formulas composed of 90% to 98% natural ingredients. Each of the eight skincare products (scrub, milk, shower gel, soap, water, hand cream…) has its own complex comprising two to five plant-derived actives. The range has been available in pharmacies and parapharmacies since late February. Since it was launched, the Collection Grands Crus has known a real success in alternative perfumery, in particular in the United States and Europe, thanks to its complex associations and raw materials carefully selected all around the world. At the very beginning, the collection was based on the olfactory interpretation of a world region by a master perfumer. The range has now been enriched with a new Peng Lai fragrance by Sébastien Martin to pay tribute to a Chinese legend. This fruity, floral fragrance unveils an alliance between Osmanthus, a Chinese precious material, Laotian benzoin, and Brazilian tonka bean. The new 100 ml version has been available since late February for 80 euros."
TechnicoFlor continues its international expansion with the opening of a creative centre in Dubai,"With a total surface area of approximately 300m2, TechnicoFlor Dubai facility will feature a sampling laboratory and an olfactory and aromatic creative centre. By the end of 2018, the new structure should have ten employees (the subsidiary manager, an evaluator, a creative perfumer, a sales person, and the marketing department ...). The group's goal is to better meet the needs of its customers in the Gulf countries and the Middle East, including the United Arab Emirates, Iran and Pakistan, which are big consumers of perfumes. ""These markets have unique and well-differentiated olfactory preferences, and it was important for TechnicoFlor to dedicate a specific centre for them,"" explained François-Patrick Sabater, the TechnicoFlor Group's CEO. As a preview of the opening of the new centre, TechnicoFlor will unveil a series of new olfactory creations at the Beauty World Middle East show, to be held on 8-10 May 2018 in Dubai. Designed by the group's perfumers - Bertrand Duchaufour and Pierre Flores - the launches will include amber, oud, woody, floral, rosé and iridescent scents. The company will also showcase 10 mukhallats, ""pure perfumes, very popular in the Middle East, with musk, sensual, animal, leather, spicy and smoky notes."" Since its creation in 1982, TechnicoFlor has tapped into international markets. The group, which today has 200 employees including a team of 8 perfume creators, sells its products in more than 60 countries including the Middle East, Asia, Western and Central Europe. The group generates more than 70% of its turnover (almost 60 million euros in 2017) from exports, particularly in Asian markets. ""With production centres in China, France, Miami and Jakarta, creative centres in Marseille, Paris, Dubai and an office in Singapore, we are able to create olfactory and aromatic compositions that meet all types of expectations for a wide array of markets and to supply our customers all over the world,"" said François-Patrick Sabater. The group aims to continue its international expansion with the upcoming opening of another creative office in New York and further aims to enter the Brazilian and Indian markets. However, TechnicoFlor is also striving to consolidate its position in the French market. The group recently started a EUR 12 million investment for the construction of new production facilities in Marseille. The two environment-friendly new units will open their doors during the summer 2019. Featuring a total surface area of more than 5000 m2, they will allow the company to double its production capacity. ""Our customers are looking for our creativity and our range of natural raw materials developed over the last 10 years, including our own patchouli supply chain in Indonesia. They appreciate our responsiveness, and especially our ability to deliver small batches, which greatly interest famous perfume, cosmetic or household product companies when they develop new ranges,"" concluded the group president."
Amorepacific Group gives a boost to global expansion,"Amorepacific is giving a boost to its international development. The group has just announced the launch of Hera - it's luxury beauty brand - in Singapore this coming May. A new challenge for the Korean brand, which was launched successfully in China in 2016. ""With a high demand in global brands and great interest in trends, Singapore strategically is a very important market for Amorepacific. Even before its launch, consumers showed much interest in the trend leading brand Hera. On May 10, Hera will be opening its first store in Takashimaya Department Store located in Singapore's main shopping street. Hera will also be opening a boutique store within the first half of 2018,"" announced the group in a release. Amos Professional - Korea's number one hair professional brand - will also make its first step into the global market by launching in Singapore. Mamonde entered US' biggest beauty retailer Ulta in the past March, and innisfree recently made its debut in Japan. The group is also actively paving its way to previously untouched markets. Amorepacific established new corporate offices in Dubai, UAE, and in Melbourne, Australia. The entry into the Middle East started with the launch of Etude House, the company's makeup brand dedicated to millennials, last month, in partnership with the with Alshaya Group, the largest retailer in the region. The first Etude House store in the Middle East opened on March 17 in the Dubai Mall, the country's biggest shopping mall. A second store opened on March 22 in The Avenues Mall, Kuwait's largest shopping mall. The brand will expand its business to neighbouring countries with another store scheduled to open in Saudi Arabia within the first half of this year. Eventually, the group recently announced its entry in Australia with the launch of Laneige, its global premium brand, at Sephora on March 14. The company plans to launch Amorepacific, its luxury flagship brand of the same name, and Innisfree, its global natural and eco-friendly beauty brand later this year. Amorepacific is well known for having launched and sold millions of cushion compacts globally. The company intends to take advantage of global interest in the K-beauty to become one of the world's beauty giants. To achieve this goal the group needs to consolidate its market shares in Asia, in particular by addressing competition from Japanese brands, while diversifying its global reach."
"Jacques Fath perfumes, a limitless renewal","The Maison had been asleep for several decades, leaving Green Water and Iris Gris lovers with their own memories. When Rania Naïm revived Jacques Fath, she aimed to give these fragrances their rightful place back, while creating a world faithful to the avant-gardist, modern personality of their creator, a contemporary of Christian Dior. ""I wanted to convey his spirit through perfumes,"" she explains. She immediately thought about Cécile Zarokian, an independent perfumer who designed many alternative perfumery creations. ""I was very honoured, but also much impressed, because Jacques Fath perfumes are great references in perfumery"", Cécile Zarokian reveals. The first Fath's Essentials collection was born in 2016, inspired from the world of travel and colours. It featured three free creations, but most of all, the re-edition of the famous Green Water. ""Working on such a monument was a real challenge for me. This perfume has its own enthusiasts, so they had expectations and I could not disappoint them,"" explains Cécile Zarokian. To get as close as possible to the 1947 original version by perfumer Vincent Roubert, she worked with her nose only, without any formula, based on the original fragrance stored at the Osmothèque, the world's perfume archive based in Versailles, France. Just like in the fashion designer's era, when the price of the concentrate did not matter and the creation quality prevailed, Rania Naïm let the creator work with much freedom of choice, in particular in terms of raw material quantities. ""There is no such thing as a briefing for these perfumes, I let creators work and I do not impose any budget limit, but the raw materials need to be beautiful,"" the artistic director confirms. For example, to revive its original trail, Green Water required 5% of Néroli essence. ""It is huge, but it is essential, because other than its Hesperidia and aromatic aspects, Néroli is really one of the key ingredients in this perfume,"" adds Cécile Zarokian, who is delighted with the freedom of action she also enjoyed for the composition of the three other juices in the collection: Curaçao Bay, Vers le Sud, and sensual Bel Ambre. In 2017, a second collection composed by Italian perfumer Luca Maffei enriched the brand's world with four new fragrances directly inspired from the creator's work. The two perfumers will be gathered for a new collection in 2019. Two years after this rebirth, Jacques Fath perfumes are now focusing on the other major reference of the Maison, Iris Gris. The re-edition, called Iris de Fath, has just been showcased at the Milan Esxence show. The creation constraints were the same as for Green Water. Without any existing formula, there was no choice but to recompose the fragrance using the nose, which required a whole year of development. Concerned about being as faithful as possible to the mythical original version, Rania Naïm felt the need to collaborate with a jury of great perfumers: she opened the challenge to different creators. ""It was so important that we could not be the only ones to decide. I contacted the best noses for all our different proposals,"" she explains. After a blind test, the jury unanimously chose the version of young perfumer Patrice Revillard, of independent perfume laboratory Maelström. The high quantities of Iris concrete and absolute make it the most expensive concentrate in the world. As such, only 150 bottles of perfume will be edited every year, for about 1,500 euros for 30 ml. The bottle design is identical to the original and completed with a few more sophisticated touches. The Iris Gris rebirth is announced as one of the milestones of the year in the world of high perfumery."

"""Cross-border e-commerce is well-adapted to the Chinese beauty market"", Joël Palix, Feelunique","""Feelunique achieves a turnover of more than 100 million pounds, mainly online, by offering 550 cosmetics brands to distribute their products all around the world overnight,"" the CEO explains. Based on a cross-border e-commerce model, the British platform founded in 2004 only settled in China in October 2015. Then, they contacted Azoya, a Shenzhen-based company, which developed the Chinese version of the Feelunique website and manages merchandising, marketing, and customer service on the local level. ""Right now, we are distributing 350 brands and 20% of our global sales are made in China,"" explains Joël Palix. To him, this success is due to the fact that Chinese people shop a lot online (the beauty market in China represents 12% of global sales, but 30% of online sales on the global level), and are extremely well-informed. ""Chinese consumers spend hours trying to get information on brands that are not available in China on platforms specifically created to this end, like Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book). That is why the cross-border model is real relevant."" Local e-commerce is only a limited part of the market, ""because Chinese people do not trust local platforms, which can sell potentially harmful counterfeits when it comes to cosmetics. So, they prefer to turn to Western websites,"" says Joël Palix. The latter also offer less expensive products, because there are fewer taxes: Chinese buyers are sensitive to this advantage. For foreign brands, the cross-border model is a means to penetrate the Chinese market faster, ""otherwise it takes 6 to 18 months to register products on the local level,"" Joël Palix warns. ""Then, the products need to be approved by Chinese authorities, who impose animal testing, and many brands consider it unethical."" The cross-border model is absolutely legal in China. As a result, companies can get rid of burdensome constraints and test the market without much investment. All this does not mean you will be successful, no matter what, since the key for brands is to attract people's attention and create a community, whether online or in real life. ""Today, Chinese consumers want more than a product, they want to interact with the brand and feel like they belong to a community, a specific lifestyle,"" Joël Palix reiterates. ""The platform you use is actually less important than the quality of your content and how you adapt to the Chinese calendar, how you build up your relationship with consumers, even outside China, through KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) or the Chinese diaspora abroad – they can spread the word to their families and friends in China."" Right now, WeChat remains the essential platform if you want to reach the Chinese public. ""It is our main driver today. It is crucial to develop a strategy specific to WeChat, with an exclusively Chinese content,"" emphasizes Joël Palix, explaining that Feelunique is not present on major platforms like Tmall and JD.com. ""That made people rather sceptical when we launched our brand in China."" ""However, we are now open to other platforms, including Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), and we do everything to make sure our model is the right one in this fast-changing Chinese environment."" To Joël Palix, Feelunique has gained efficacy in terms of global functioning since the company entered China, because ""this country leads the way in the field of online beauty sales."""
"After five acquisitions in three years, KDC is targeting another twofold increase in sales!","Indeed the KDC Group (Knowlton Development Corporation) has quite a track record! It all started in 2002 with the creation of the Emballages Knowlton Company, employing 300 people, with sales of $80 million. In 2003, the investment fund Novacap took control of the Company. The first acquisitions took place in 2007 with the Tri Tech Laboratories and Body Blue Inc Companies. But it is in 2014 that things really started accelerating, with the launch of the Novacap Industries IV fund, which gave the Group the financial tools to fulling their expansionist strategy. In January 2015, KDC acquired the ChemAid Laboratories, a formulator and manufacturer of skincare, hair care and bath and body products with a plant in Saddle Brook, New Jersey. On October 14 and 21 of the same year, KDC acquired the companies of Kolmar Laboratories and Acupac Packaging from the Kolmar Labs Group, a New-York-based custom formulator and manufacturer of color cosmetics, personal care and skincare products, and of Cosmetic Technologies, a California-based cosmetics and personal care products contract manufacturer. The latter acquisition allowed the Canadian Group to extend its scope to the West Coast. The conquest of the West continued with the takeover on 16 November 2016 of Thibiant International, a formulator and manufacturer of personal and skincare products based in Chatsworth, California. ""We found particularly attractive Thibiant's innovation-driven business model, its high-tech facilities and equipment, its exceptional client base,"" emphasized Nicholas Whitley. On November 9, 2017, the KDC Group took over the Aromair Fine Fragrance Company, a full-service manufacturer and supplier specializing in home and air care categories based in New Albany, Ohio. One month later, on December 12, KDC officials announced the acquisition of Northern Labs, a full-service liquid product contract manufacturer serving the personal and home care markets. Located in Wisconsin, the company is specialising in liquid, gel, lotion, and paste products. For Nicholas Whitley, the adventure is far from over. After this impressive series of acquisitions, KDC Group started the structuring of their offer as a global leader in beauty innovation. At the MakeUp in Los Angeles tradeshow in February, KDC launched their newly branded image, ""kdc/one"" to the industry. ""One"" network of reputable, best-in-class custom formulators and manufacturers that collectively deliver high-touch innovation, operational excellence, and speed to market to established and emerging beauty, personal care and home care companies. To further send the message that kdc/one is committed to being the leader and destination for true innovation, the network is gearing up to open the doors to their state-of-the-art Innovation Lab this summer in Saddle Brook, NJ. What's next for kdc/one? ""The goal of one billion dollar turnover is now within sight and the next growth stages could very well be in Europe and Asia. Kdc/one is a force to be reckoned with and we are excited to build on this momentum to provide the highest level of quality, service and innovation to our brand partners,"" said Nicholas Whitley."
"""We are diversifying our development and aiming for a EUR100 million turnover"", Laurent Mercier, CEO Eurofragance","Premium Beauty News - You joined the group four years ago. Laurent Mercier - Four beautiful years. Eurofragance is the wonderful story of a family company founded 27 years ago. At that time, visionary Santiago Sabatés successfully developed his company in the Middle East. When I joined the group in 2013, 90% of our turnover was achieved with exports, including 80% in the Gulf. This Catalan firm is little-known in certain regions, and yet Eurofragance is the leader in oriental perfumery: it is ahead of the biggest global players in fine perfumery there, including Firmenich, Givaudan, and IFF. Today, we aim to open new markets and new categories, so the idea when I came here in 2013 was for me to diversify activities, while preserving our leadership in Fine Fragrance in the Middle East. Premium Beauty News - Has the change of direction been initiated? Laurent Mercier - We opened a development centre in Dubai in autumn 2015 with 25 people, two perfumers, laboratories, an analysis team, and a sales force. The development phase used to be managed from Spain. In June 2016, we inaugurated a second, 1,100 m2 centre in Singapore, and then a plant last year, still in Singapore. All this involves our production for Asia. The first subsidiary of the group was created in 2009 in Mexico City, where we have more than 40 employees and a plant mainly dedicated to the Central American market. Ultimately, last December, we bought Atlanta-based Fragrance Design in the United States, to make it easier for us to penetrate this huge market at the right time. In Europe, we have put back our Turkish subsidiary on the rails. It completes our centre and plant in Barcelona. Turkey is both an interesting and competitive market. So, today, we count five development centres, in Spain, Mexico, Dubai, Singapore, and Atlanta, as well as four production plants. In terms of infrastructure, we have everything we need. To me, it was essential not to centralize it all. The Sales Director is in Dubai, the perfumer manager is in Singapore, and so is the Development Director. The idea is to create a real global group, a Fragrance House boutique with 13 perfumers and as many evaluators. Today, Eurofragance represents 300 people, 60% in Spain and 40% elsewhere. Premium Beauty News - What markets have you been scrutinizing the most? Laurent Mercier - South-East Asia, because there are several major perfume fortresses like Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia… Thanks to our unique history, we have the advantage of being really familiar with Muslim markets, which makes it easier to penetrate them. There are olfactory bonds that can be worked on in Indonesia and Malaysia. From our Dubai centre, we are taking serious interest in India. It is an economically very dynamic continent country that boasts a real perfume culture. Iran also deserves attention, because you need to be there today to be ready tomorrow. The same goes for Africa. In Europe, we aim to reach niche brands. We are not very demanding in terms of volume, compared to major perfume houses. The complexity of creation even motivates us at a small scale. And we have all the skills needed to succeed in the field of Home Fragrance. Lastly, following recent groupings and acquisitions, the American market has known a concentration that, to us, creates the opportunity to serve small to medium-sized brands. Premium Beauty News - What are your ambitions? Laurent Mercier - For the year 2017, we ended with 72 million euros, i.e. +7.5% compared to 2016, but with a very slow growth in the Gulf region, where it is quite complicated right now due to the different conflicts going on (Yemen, Libya, Syria, Iraq…). We aim to become part of the club that achieves 100 million euro turnovers within the next three to four years, and to stabilize the Gulf region at 50% of our turnover. Eurofragance belongs to a family that is much attached to the industry. Today, there is no discussion about eventually selling the group. Premium Beauty News - What seduced you in this project? Laurent Mercier - Our new President Santiago Sabatés is a real entrepreneur, meaning he embodies everything the term involves. He knows how to take risks and work things through. I have a more standard manager profile and a global experience, so we complete each other quite well."

"""We're aiming a 10% market share within two years in France,"" Simon Duffy, Bulldog","Premium Beauty News - What's so special about Bulldog? Simon Duffy - Bulldog is a different brand with a unique offering for men. The male market is very specific. The idea for Bulldog was born when we noticed that there were no straightforward skincare options for men who wanted products packed with natural ingredients. Bulldog is the first men's skincare line based on natural ingredients. The products are also free from a wide list of what we consider as ""unwanted"" ingredients such as parabens, SLS, artificial colours, synthetic fragrances or ingredients from animal sources. We're also doing our best with regard to sustainability. We're now using sugarcane based plastics from Brazil's Braskem for our packaging. That's a big way for us to stand out from competition! The big difference of course is that we mainly target men. We wanted to create a very male company. Bulldog is man's best and smarter companion! Premium Beauty News - You're now launching in France, which has the reputation to be a difficult market for indie cosmetic brands? Simon Duffy - We're very excited to be in France. It is the right time as we're now feeling more comfortable as a company. Big brands, such as L'Oréal and Nivea, clearly dominate in the French market but now we think we now have the possibility to face the competition here and to address skincare needs of male's consumers in France with a different offering. As far as cosmetic products are concerned, people want results. However, they are also increasingly interested in the brands' values and the way they run their businesses. It's getting harder and harder to hide as a company, it is therefore very essential to present good stories and to be authentic. Premium Beauty News - What are your main goals in France? Simon Duffy - We're launching in France with a selection of 6 products (out of a full line of 40 products) at Carrefour and Carrefour Market, and online at Amazon and beauteprivee.fr For the short-term, we want our products to be available everywhere our competitors are. This is why we're launching in the mass retail channel here, while we're in department stores or speciality retails in other countries. We do not have massive budgets but our brand is very distinctive, our packaging and the way we formulate our products make a huge difference. We're aiming a 10% market share within two years in France. Premium Beauty News - What are the next steps for Bulldog? Simon Duffy - We're looking for new market opening such as Japan. We're currently available in 24 countries, including Korea, the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Thailand. Export sales represent about 50% of our annual turnover and in the next years we expect them to reach the 70% mark. We want to grow and we are investing in our first TV campaigns and we're also working on big innovation launches..."
"""IL Cosmetics Group is leveraging its expertise in all areas of make-up,"" Jean-François Harpes, CEO","Premium Beauty News - What is the position of the IL Cosmetics Group today in the make-up market? Jean-François Harpes - We are the European leader for the manufacture of nail polish, serving brands worldwide. For over 34 years, we have been developing premium nail polish formulas, tailored to the needs of each market. Expectations vary from one continent to the other and even countries, so it is essential to have a perfect knowledge of each of them. We are specialised in all types of nail polish formulas from fast-drying to long lasting. Today we are the largest provider of full-service solutions in Europe and we are behind 80% of all major launches planned in Europe for 2018. While the IL Cosmetics Group is widely recognized for its expertise in nail polish, it has also made use of its know-how in other make-up categories. Premium Beauty News - You are diversifying your activity? Jean-François Harpes - The term diversification could mean no longer focusing on our core business, which remains nail polish. But in fact the Group created several ""expert poles"" for the development of the different types of products. Each of them operates by using the same rigorous testing and development processes that characterize the nail polish pole. Luxcos, our make-up division, boasts more than 15 years of expertise and is enjoying double-digit growth (+ 20% in 2017). We produce mascaras - which already have a strong positioning in the European market - but also lipgloss and liquid eyeliners. We are also working on other products categories. Some of our client have won awards with our mascara formulas. To date, we are less known in the lipgloss category, but we have nonetheless already received positive feedbacks from the market with products fitting exactly the needs of consumers. Our goal is to develop a ""one-stop-shop"" for all eyes, lips, face and nails cosmetic products. We plan to expand in other cosmetic categories in the coming years, which will certainly contribute to the development of our Group. Premium Beauty News - On what growth drivers does IL Cosmetics rely? Jean-François Harpes - Our growth and the development of our expertise relies on two approaches: Cosmetic Intelligence and Leading Innovation. Based on science, the Leading Innovation approach enables to produce formulas that exceed market performances and are proven by consumer perception panel. The Cosmetic Intelligence approach combines our knowledge of the market with our know-how and our ability to offer complete, ready-to-use turnkey solutions adapted to the needs of our clients. With these drivers, we were able to develop different expert poles, which enable the Group to have a multi-product offer: mascaras, lipgloss, liquid eyeliners mainly. Premium Beauty News - Are you ready in terms of infrastructure? Jean-François Harpes - In our preparation we have neglected no aspect. Not only in terms of R&D resources and investments, but also concerning our production capacity, which today offers great flexibility for the production and filling of many different products. IL Cosmetics had already boosted its industrial development with a 40 million-euro investment plan over the 2013-2018 period. In Poland, the packing unit, which was recently expanded, now enjoys a filling capacity of 240 million units. A second multi-product packing unit of 10,000 m2 will ensure our capability and flexibility to absorb new multi-product developments, whatever the category."
"""We are building a real Hub of Innovation"", Fabrizio Buscaini, Chromavis CEO","Premium Beauty News - How do you address this new challenge? Fabrizio Buscaini - The challenge is to instil in Chromavis a new mentality and a new product vision totally based on a motivated, ""hungry"" and proud team, as well as an outstanding Industrial Plan at its basis. The goal for the Company is to create and produce products with extraordinary quality that change and adapt themselves to the market mutations. Currently, Chromavis is focused on its internal reorganization that will be based on speed and flexible solutions, thought specifically for both clients and market needs. Chromavis has proudly created products that have become true and real ""distinctive categories"", but it has also the awareness that is not enough to have a complete ""product portfolio"", it always has the necessary courage to reinvent itself, to try new ways to think, produce and create. Premium Beauty News - A brand new plant in 2020! Fabrizio Buscaini - Chromavis is changing its way of seeing and thinking, furthermore, it's also planning to relocate in brand new headquarters that will unify all three existing Italian sites in just one area, in order to support the ambitious growth to double the turnover in 2020. It is also necessary to build a new corporate culture, and to generate a new business model for Chromavis. Clients expect smart solutions and these cannot be linked only to bulk production. The goal is to create products with a value and, why not, uniqueness. If we look to the future, the most important development perspective for Chromavis is linked to the construction of its new headquarters (an area of 100,000 m²) that, as announced, will be ready by 2020. The project foresees the construction of a real Hub of Innovation, a place to be proud to be part of, with wide green areas, interiors illuminated with natural lights and pleasant and stimulating common working areas. Premium Beauty News - What is your insight concerning these major changes in you sector? Fabrizio Buscaini - Mapping our sector is increasingly difficult; the on-line business dynamics have changed the rules. The market is very fast, consumers are well-informed thanks to the online selling platforms and social networking. Their requests are extremely demanding and clear: high performances, new concepts and products delivering promises which are immediately perceivable by the end consumer. All this at the speed of light in terms of logistics and products offering. On this base, Chromavis is building up its future by redefining its strategy, organization and culture, investing in a new Headquarter that will represent a ""New Era"" for Chromavis, with an outstanding futuristic project like never seen before in the colour cosmetic manufacturing sector."
Sillages Paris redefines perfume codes to seduce Millennials,"Maxime Garcia-Janin wants to create perfumes of our times. After a marketing experience at Giorgio Armani's (L'Oréal) and Dior's (LVMH), this young 27-year-old entrepreneur built his own project based on the sad discovery that people were disenchanted with perfumes, in particular young people. ""In only five years, 1.4 million people stopped buying perfume through the selective channel and the market became standardized. People feel less pleasure when they buy perfumes now, and neither advice nor experience provide any added value anymore. The digital revolution is a real opportunity to reach people again, in particular young people, who have no problem with online shopping, as can be seen with makeup or fashion… Why not with perfume?"" asks Maxime Garcia-Janin. Sillages Paris stands out with a novel, high-end perfume personalization offering online. ""I wanted everyone to be able to create a perfume that would best suit and correspond to them, and which would contain the beautiful, natural, sustainable ingredients of high perfumery,"" he adds. The principle is simple and quick. Thanks to an algorithm, the user selects six ingredients from a suggested list, which leads them to the formulas developed by four ""new generation"" perfumer-creators: Amélie Jacquin (Givaudan), Alex Lee (Mane), Mylène Alran (Robertet) and Sébastien Plan. The algorithm only suggests combinations validated by these perfumers. ""It is a highly fast and playful solution that can be used in micro-moments, like when you queuing at the supermarket. At the same time, the emphasis on ingredients educates people to perfumery,"" explains Maxime Garcia-Janin. Once the women's, men's, or unisex fragrance has been determined, several choices are suggested: you order either the bottle delivered with its testing sample, or the three-sample box containing the perfume selected and two similar ones. Both choices are affordable: EUR12 for the sample box, EUR83 for the 50 ml bottle. Shipping and returns are free and 100% reimbursed if consumers are not satisfied. ""There is absolutely nothing that prevents returns, that is important,"" the creator adds. Sillages Paris will launch a new travel-size, 15 ml bottle in March for EUR27. The perfumes are handmade on request in the brand's Parisian workshops. Drawn by designer Pierre Katz, the bottle is featured in an original plant-derived polystyrene case manufactured by a company specialized in recycling. Launched last November and exclusively promoted on Instagram, in particular by influencers, the brand seems to be reaching its public. ""After only two months, we got more than 500 customers and 4,500 followers on Instagram. The buzz has started, even with older people, despite our off-beat tone,"" Maxime Garcia-Janin comments. Of course, Maxime Garcia-Janin has further ambitions. New formulas will soon be added to the algorithm. ""The idea is to regularly release new compositions to offer more choices,"" he adds. The brand was meant to get global from the very beginning. They should also focus on the American market, the land of Instagram!"
Sephora rolls out its new generation of connected stores,"Implemented in France and in some European countries since the beginning of 2017, the ""New Sephora Experience"" concept, based on services and connected beauty, is no available in Paris at the Saint-Lazare railway station. With an area of 840m2, this new specially designed store proposes all the services associated with this concept and takes the experience one step further with new in-store areas. In times of e-shopping and social networks, Sephora is banking on the complementarity between e-commerce and brick and mortar stores. An approach that required the introduction of new digital and physical services, often 100% personalized. The Beauty Hub is undoubtedly the most telling example of this renewal.
