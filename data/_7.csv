Lush champions transgender rights with a new campaign (and a bath melt),"Shoppers can support the cause by purchasing the brand's new limited-edition bath melt ""Inner Truth"", which will have 100% of its sales directed to organizations that support the trans community in North America. Containing fair trade organic cocoa butter and uplifting orange oil, the melt promises to soften and moisturize skin when added to a hot bath. Throughout the duration of the campaign, the brand's North American store windows will be stripped free of products and decorated with screens showing quotes from its own transgender and non-binary staff members. It has also launched an online platform full of resources for the trans community and anyone else to learn about how to be a good ""ally."" The move is the latest indication that the beauty and fashion industries are waking up to the need for greater diversification when it comes to transgender representatives. Major brands such as L'Oréal Paris, which included transgender model and trans rights activist Hari Nef in its ""Your Skin, Your Story"" campaign last January and later briefly hired transgender model Munroe Bergdorf to star in its #allworthit campaign, has made an effort to be a part of the conversation. The relationship with Bergdorf was ill-fated, but she was later snapped up by rival brand Illamasqua to front a seasonal campaign. Meanwhile, last December saw the launch of unisex makeup brand Jecca, which was designed with transgender women in mind, while Valentina Sampaio became the first transgender model to land a French magazine cover when she posed for Vogue Paris's March issue.

"""Our wish is to continue investing in France"" Edouard Macquart-Moulin, Natura Brasil","Premium Beauty News - Have your objectives changed for the French market? Edouard Macquart-Moulin - They haven't changed. The objectives of Natura Brasil are based on three pillars: economic development and societal and environmental commitments. Whatever the distribution channel, direct sales, own stores or through partnerships, the important thing for us is to be profitable and to express our values in terms of sustainable and societal development. Premium Beauty News - Why did you put an end to your direct sales operation in the country? Edouard Macquart-Moulin - With more than 1000 beauty consultants loyal to the brand, believe me, it was not with a light heart that we made the decision in December 2016. This is an important channel for Natura Brasil but the market did not enable us to balance the economic pillar. However, the wish of our founders and shareholders is to stay in France and continue to invest. Premium Beauty News - What will be your new strategy? Edouard Macquart-Moulin - Our strategy is to develop a network of own stores. We already have a store in the Marais, and we also inaugurated last December a second store in the 4 Temps shopping centre in Paris - La Défense. On February 9th we will open a third store in the Vélizy 2 shopping centre in the south of Paris. In the course of the year we will continue to study opportunities for the opening of additional stores, in the Paris region or in French provinces. A lot of consumers who have known Natura Brasil through their beauty consultants are now waiting to find a store next to their home. Meanwhile, we are developing partnerships with French retailers such as Monoprix, Le Printemps and Birchbox, through on- and off-line sales. Premium Beauty News - You kept your e-store? Edouard Macquart-Moulin - Yes, it is still very successful. We are focusing on an integrated channel approach. Nowadays, every consumer is recognized, whether in a point of sales or on the internet. Premium Beauty News - Hence, these new stores will be the windows of Natura Brasil, how do you describe them? Edouard Macquart-Moulin - They are an invitation to discover Brazil in a 40 to 50 m² concept, which allows the customer to feel the warmth of the country and all the values of Natura Brasil, with a lot of natural raw materials, wood, plants, ingredients, a sensory experience. As for products, we have a portfolio of a hundred references for the body, hair and face and babies. Premium Beauty News - Your Group recently acquired the retail brand The Body Shop, will you develop a common strategy? Edouard Macquart-Moulin - We obviously share the same vision, which is of working and participating in creating a better world. But like what was done with AESOP, the two brands will continue to operate separately from a marketing and sales point of view to preserve their own identities. On the other hand, even if it is a bit too early to talk about it, there is obviously an industrial strategy of optimization. Thanks to this partnership, The Body Shop will be able to access, for example, to the sourcing of raw materials from South America, Amazonia. There will be synergies wherever possible in terms of infrastructure and logistics. Premium Beauty News - Are you looking to expand your foothold in Europe? Edouard Macquart-Moulin - At the international level, the Group aims to be present in 70 countries in the next ten years with its own stores and direct sales for certain locations. We will take advantage of the global presence of The Body Shop to establish ourselves in some cities. Today, we are present in most South American countries, in Mexico and we have two stores in New York, which represents twenty countries to date. In Europe, in addition to French speaking countries, we are looking primarily at Germany and the UK. A partnership has already been established with the online sales site Feelunique, which distributes our products in the UK with very encouraging first results."

"Scent O2, a new player in Europe in the alternative perfume circuit","Born from a common passion for authenticity and quality in alternative perfumery, the Scent O2 Company brings together the expertise of Johann Vitrey, who is the founding Manager of Sesame by JV, a distributor of niche perfume brands for the Middle East and Africa, and Anne Claire Kraft, won over by the emotional world of perfumes after a corporate career. ""I'm madly in love with perfumes. They reinforce the beauty of a breath and transform it from a physical necessity to pure aestheticism. They remind us that we are alive,"" she commented. The five dioxygen molecules in the Company logo illustrate the five activities roll out in five territories. Scent O2 will thus manage distribution, consulting, training, retail and management activities of own brands in five European areas: – Benelux, – Germany, – Austria and Switzerland, – Italy, Spain & Portugal, France, – and UK. Alongside the own brand of candles Promenade à Auvers, it already groups a dozen promising names in niche perfumery, all of them with a complementary story and positioning, among which, Sous Le Manteau, launched in February 2017. ""It's a true conceptual brand that reconnects to the very essence of the fragrance, sensuality, seduction, with no compromise and with a 'brand' signature that goes beyond juices. Fragrances are inspired by nineteenth century aphrodisiac elixirs with their mysterious, spicy and animal notes,"" detailed Anne Claire Kraft. The portfolio also includes a heritage brand still kept secret, and the private collection of the Spanish Master Perfumer Rosendo Mateu, and a brand with an oriental positioning."
Online Sales: Beauté Privée exceeds forecasts,"""We indeed had expected strong growth but the increase was much higher than what we had imagined, especially in the last quarter. Our order volume has increased by 100% compared to the previous year,"" commented Xavier Chauvin, CEO and co-founder of the site. The Head of the Company sees in this fine performance a real shift in consumption habits, stimulated by the increasing use of digital technologies, the ease of use of devices and the search for new brands and beauty trends. ""Which places us as the first pure player in Beauty,"" he added. A leading edge, which was reached thanks to identified levers that proved to be highly efficient. The site has maintained its momentum with new alternative brands. They now represent 30% of the offer, estimated to 1300 brand partners, including 300 newcomers in 2017. ""Expectations are really high for these new brands that we are promoting in an interesting way on social networks,"" detailed Xavier Chauvin. The second growth impetus comes from mobile phones (tablets excluded), which currently accounted for 80% of total traffic, thus representing a 150% sales increase. ""In the sphere of mobile applications alone, our growth is of 300%. Which means these behaviours are now fully adopted,"" added the CEO. For the year alone, more than 1.5 million new members were recruited by the site, which currently has about 4 million members. This is a result of the innovative work achieved in terms of communication, especially on the key notion of 'real time'. ""Along with sending the appropriate personalized message, we added timely sending: when the user is active and captive, using his app, and this whatever the media. This enables us new transformation performances"", explained Xavier Chauvin. To complement this positive picture, the rapprochement with the online site Showroom privé, early 2017, has enabled us to increase the volume of devices available, propose comprehensive solutions to brands (sales, media device, piggy back inserts, customer knowledge...), in short, to structure our growth. ""Being backed by Showroomprivé enables us to share best practices and to have a more trouble-free ramp up"" confirmed Xavier Chauvin."
Nuxe elects Tmall to set up in China,"Allowing foreign brands to sell products in China without bearing the burden of costs and administrative duties of a physical location, cross border BtoC e-commerce has experienced significant growth over the past few years in China, which should count 74 million of cross border shoppers in 2018, according to iiMediaresearch. Supported by Chinese authorities which see e-commerce as a tool to foster national consumption at the expense of purchases made by Chinese tourists abroad, the procedure is yet highly regulated. For instance, Alibaba requires brands to resort to a TP or ""Tmall Partner"" based in China to make the link with the platform. Nuxe has thus partnered with NextBeauty, a company founded by Grégoire Grandchamp comprising a team of Chinese experts formerly employed by L'Oréal China and Alibaba. ""Don't go thinking that platforms will do the job for brands"", he asserts. ""Our role is to understand how to collaborate with brands and to develop a sales and marketing strategy to make them succeed on Tmall"". To attract the largest possible number of Chinese internet users, the TP encourages brands to make good use of the Tmall agenda which revolves around 6 major promotional events, notably Singles' Day on November 11th or ""11/11"", an online 24-hour shopping day launched in 2009 by Alibaba. In 2017, the Chinese giant announced a sales record of US$25.3 billion, a 39% increase over 2016, made at 90% through the mobile app – but also claims another victory, i.e. a move upmarket and a strong improvement of its brand image compared to the promotional sales events from its early beginning. The main innovation of the Tmall platform lies in the opening of a Luxury Pavillon dedicated to luxury brands, where Guerlain managed to sell a perfume at the price of 500.000 yuans (EUR65.000). Cosmetics brands did not skimp on resources. Lancôme invited six Chinese celebrities to introduce its products from different perspectives. SKII designed a limited edition presented in a joyful and playful way. MAC made 200 models parade at the ""See Now Buy Now"" show organised by Tmall. Estée Lauder, L'Oréal and Shisheido installed pop-up stores during the time of the event… ""11/11 gains momentum through the integration of new codes such as premiumisation, customization, gaming and entertainment"", recaps Julie Bonnet. ""11/11 is no longer a mere promotional event, but has become a major opportunity to bring together various brands, thus allowing us to combine branding and business."" Nuxe chose to feature three ranges of products - l'Huile prodigieuse, Rêve de miel and the Crème fraîche de beauté. ""Preparation is what matters most"", insists Grégoire Grandchamp, who urges the need to begin planning six months ahead of the 11/11 event. Nuxe mainly focused on influencers, calling for a nationally-recognised KOL (Key Opinion Leader) expert in the field of cosmetics, Wu Miao (吴淼), as well as four regional celebrities coming from areas around Beijing, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Shanghai, ""with the aim of attracting 2 million followers."" ""Influencers play a critical role in today's cosmetics"", asserts Grégoire Grandchamp. ""Even brands which were originally little known in China like Leonor Greyl, whom we cooperate with, is currently expanding quite rapidly with the help of some KOLs."" However, he insists on the need to ensure that the influencers selected have a good knowledge of the brand and appreciate its products, ""as a good influencer is someone who maintains a private and genuine relationship with the brand, who is a real fan. It is also important to establish long-lasting relationships with them, in order to avoid attracting fake followers."" For Julie Bonnet, influencers even ""dominate the media landscape in China"". ""Yet, there is one critical aspect that you must consider, especially as a French brand. Indeed, you must give influencers free rein if you want to succeed in China. You must let KOLs get insight-driven."" The outcome of 11/11 was ""in line with Nuxe's expectations, with 50 % of the sales turnover achieved for this first year which was rather short."" Brands usually achieve 35-40% over a normal year, indicates Grégoire Grandchamp, who assures that NextBeauty offers a long-term, balanced partnership between turnover and branding. ""We give brands access to Alibaba's data in English, to offer them a more targeted outreach in terms of customers profile and purchase trend"", he explains, adding that despite Tmall, NextBeauty regularly works with six or seven other platforms. To resort to cross-border e-commerce, brands are not obliged to go through Tmall. Other platforms exist, such as JD.com, which achieved a sales record of US$ 19.2 billion this year at 11/11 (a 50% increase in comparison with 2016), Xiaohongshu.com or even the leader Kaola.com (member of the Chinese group NetEase), less popular in Europe. ""The landscape becomes more heterogeneous, more prolific and more complex"", indicates Laure de Carayon, organizer of China Connect. ""These are interesting opportunities for those who are willing to look deeper into it."""
"""We want to become the mass market leader for natural cosmetics"", Éric Renard, La Phocéenne de Cosmétique","Premium Beauty News - In 2016, on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of Le Petit Olivier, you had announced your intention to double your turnover by 2020, particularly by means of external growth. Here you are! Éric Renard - The Lovéa brand achieved EUR 11.5 million in sales, i.e., roughly half of the turnover of our brand Le Petit Olivier (EUR 22 million in 2016). This was quite a huge operation for a company our size. Our goal is to reach an overall turnover of EUR 50 million by 2020, thanks in particular to an increase in export sales. We are convinced that some significant synergies exist in this area between Lovéa and Le Petit Olivier. For 2018, we are targeting a turnover of EUR 35 to 38 million, which would make us the first French SME in the cosmetics sector operating in mass markets. On the other hand, we will remain focused on product development and marketing. The Laboratoires Biocos will continue to produce the Lovéa ranges in their dedicated production facilities, while diversifying their subcontracting activity for other customers. Premium Beauty News - What are the main synergies between Le Petit Olivier and Lovéa? Éric Renard - Both brands have a very complementary positioning. Le Petit Olivier is a brand with a traditional natural signature, deeply rooted in the Provençal universe. Lovéa is a young and exotic brand with an organic certification. It is the pioneering brand in supermarkets for organic certified sun care products, which enabled the Company to become the third market leader in this segment in France. The brand boasts exceptional expertise and legitimacy in sun care products, which is a major asset that we intend to fully preserve. But we believe that it also enjoys a strong legitimacy in other categories. We are going to start working on the development of other ranges, particularly shower gels and maybe deodorants, to be launched next year. The other exciting synergy concerns export sales. Lovéa achieves about 25% of its turnover abroad, vs. 28 to 29% for Le Petit Olivier. Our goal for the Group is to reach 33% in 2020. Le Petit Olivier is present in 64 countries against 38 for Lovéa. We have a very strong presence in some countries, like Russia, where the Lovéa brand is not present. We have also set foot in new markets in South America and Central America (Ecuador, Chile, Colombia) where the Lovéa brand is not active. Conversely, Lovéa has a strong foothold in the Netherlands and the Middle East (United Arab Emirates, Lebanon) where the brand Le Petit Olivier is not too present. In addition, we operate in similar distribution channels. Generally in supermarkets, drugstores and sometimes pharmacies. This will allow us to fully rely on our respective sales and distribution forces. Premium Beauty News - What are your strategic priorities? Éric Renard - We want Lovéa to become an exotic natural brand of reference in mass distribution, first by strengthening its presence in the sun care segment and then by consolidating and developing its positions in other categories. Furthermore, we want to build on the existing synergies between the two brands to develop sales in France, Europe (Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland), in Russia on the Mediterranean rim and more particularly Morocco and Tunisia. To this end, we are banking on the French know-how in cosmetics and on the recognition of Made in France products across the world. All our products are made in France, even if some raw materials like argan or monoï oil are obviously sourced abroad."
Certina Packaging France is born!,"Premium Beauty News - The common point to all these companies: the transformation of plastic materials by means of extrusion blow moulding, injection blow moulding and injection, to make all kinds of containers: bottles, jars, closures, etc. And, a speciality: cosmetics! Stéphane Perrollier - This is indeed the DNA of each company part of the Group with an extremely clear ""market positioning"": that of providing quality packagings, specific or standard, in quantities suiting every request and with maximum flexibility. The Rebhan, Herman Koch and Qualiform Companies are in this area, particularly complementary and the three of them enable to cater for the three segments in which they operate. This provides the market with a specialized group offering great agility. Premium Beauty News - And the dynamism of each of these companies cannot be denied! Stéphane Perrollier - This is certainly due to the enthusiasm driving the management and all the people who work for the group. All of them are highly invested today in this ""new adventure"". Each of the group's entities understand the opportunity they are given to work alongside and share the same vision with clearly stated goals. Serving cosmetic and personal care brands for over 100 years, Hermann Koch offers its clients a wide selection of single- and thick-wall standard jars, sticks, roll-ons. All these made in Germany products can be combined with many different closures. From elegant standard components to luxurious customized works of art, Qualiform provides international beauty brands, packaging solutions that are designed in France and in the US, with a dedication to material innovation and performance. As a producer of cosmetic packaging solutions, Rebhan is the undisputed leader in the manufacture of Polymer Glass containers with also a wide selection of standard bottles and accessories. Premium Beauty News - In your case, you were more particularly in charge of Qualiform but you also recently created Certina Packaging France... Stéphane Perrollier - This is right. And in this context, I entrusted the management of Certina Packaging France to Vincent Gilbert, Group VP Sales for France. This new entity will allow us to roll out our strategy on the French cosmetics market. As for Qualiform, it is one of the most prestigious manufacturers of plastic bottles for the premium markets. Each year we produce millions of bottles for many international brands thanks to the commitment and enthusiasm of our teams based in Oyonnax, France. Premium Beauty News - A company that deserved to be expertly run! Stéphane Perrollier - Exactly! Our goal is to increase the investments, of course, not only in equipment, but also in women and men. On the industrial front, the previous group in charge had very cleverly invested in a raw materials autonomous management platform and in blow moulding. For our part, we have decided this year to dedicate a significant share of our turnover (12%) in industrial investments with, in particular, the installation of control cameras on our five screen printing lines. This technological shift is obviously very positive for the teams who previously were in charge of performing these controls and who now are entrusted with a new role in the management of the line. Note that we have also invested in a new eight-cavity extrusion blow moulding machine to better meet the needs of our customers during key product launches. Premium Beauty News - Is the environment a strong axis? Stéphane Perrollier - Yes, very strong and, as you can see with this raw materials management platform, we have an edge. Our commitment towards environment is also part of our DNA. We are convinced that the best way to respect the environment is to be vigilant and proactive by constantly seeking opportunities for improvements in our processes and by instilling in our teams a respectful and responsible attitude towards the planet. With this aim in mind, we have audits carried out to control our CO2 emissions. When they ask for it, we can provide our customers with a detailed summary for each of the projects we are working on. Hence, our customers can clearly visualize the efforts made to reduce CO2 emissions and thus contribute to the sustainability of their bottles. Each bottle design on which we work, must meet our quality control requirements, and must also undergo a series of tests directly related to their environmental impact and sustainability. In this context, we offer our customers the possibility of using eco-friendly plastic materials. We are convinced that environment protection is also a state of mind. Our premises have been optimized to be more energy efficient. As a company, we have agreed to invest almost exclusively in the appropriate equipment and infrastructures to reduce the environmental impact (fully electric production machines, LED lighting, optimized heating/cooling systems in offices). Premium Beauty News - In terms of market segments, you are positioned in skincare but also in make-up and scented derivatives... Stéphane Perrollier - We are indeed very present in these markets. Make-up is a segment to which we are paying a lot of attention. We are currently developing a new highly innovative project whose launch will take place in 2018. We also have a development policy for our range of standard product, a field in which Rebhan is particularly successful. You could check out their novel range, ""New Square"", made of Polymer Glass on our site www.certinapackaging.com"
Feelunique reports record Christmas sales,"Feelunique recorded strong trading in both the UK and internationally, and the company announced to on-track to reach approximately £100 million (about EUR 112,7 million) in retail sales for the 2017 calendar year. This announcement comes in the wake of the strong trading Feelunique experienced during the Black Friday promotion period. In the UK, retail sales were up 19% year-on-year to £7.4 million; while Christmas trading period retail sales in both China and France doubled. Feelunique's performance was up against all KPIs, with average order values growing by 12 per cent, and nearly 1 million products shipped to 88 countries in the Christmas trading period. According to the retailer, the 12 Days of Beauty' Christmas calendar was a best-seller, with eye shadow palettes also featuring strongly this year. UK best sellers included: Urban Decay Naked Heat Eyeshadow Palette; the GHD IV styler; Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair and Victor & Rolf Flowerbomb perfume. Top selling brands included Charlotte Tilbury, Chanel, Anastasia Beverley Hills, Urban Decay, Bare Minerals, YSL and Benefit, with Charlotte Tilbury's Matte Revolution Walk of Shame lipstick being the best-selling product globally. ""I am delighted with our record-breaking performance over the Christmas period, which further evidences our ability to capitalise on the consumer shift in the beauty market to online purchasing. We also remain on-track to reach £100 million in retail sales for the calendar year, which is a significant milestone for the business. Looking ahead to 2018, we will continue to grow market share in existing markets, with the scope to add further territories to our offering as a truly cross-border retailer. We will also be announcing the additions of several exciting new brands to the site early in the new year, solidifying Feelunique's position as Europe's leading online beauty retailer,"" said Joel Palix, CEO of Feelunique. Founded in 2005, Feelunique is a cross-border online beauty retailer, shipping to over 120 countries and with dedicated websites in the UK, France, the EU, Germany, Norway, China and the US. The company offers a choice of more than 30,000 products and 500 brands across makeup, skincare, haircare, fragrance and electricals. Feelunique claims over 130,000 site visits and more than 15,000 products sold every day, with 65% of sales coming from customers under the age of 35. It remains to be seen if the Boxing Days promotion period will be as profitable for Feelunique, but there is no reason for the trend to reverse."
Personalised products and bespoke services: The new luxury according to L'Oréal,"While the luxury cosmetics market is growing fast, it is also undergoing deepseated changes. ""Boosted by digital, the arrival of new generations of customers and Chinese consumption, the luxury market is growing faster than ever. At the same time, it is forcing brands to reinvent themselves constantly"", says Nicolas Hieronimus, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of L'Oréal. According to Hieronimus, two new luxury markets are in the process of emerging. First, a market for affordable, accessible luxury whose swift growth is being driven by Gen Yers and Gen Zers around the world. The second market offers a high-premium, more experiential form of luxury reserved for connoisseurs, which crystallizes especially around ultra-premium skincare and niche perfumery. In this setting, L'Oréal Luxury has two priorities: ""We've got to digitalise and diversify to meet consumers' new expectations."" For L'Oréal Luxury, digital is both a great way to know consumers better and a fast-growing distribution channel. ""By harnessing data, social media, CRM and precision marketing, we can reach out to consumers in a pretty targeted way,"" explains Nicolas Hieronimus. Through these precision marketing efforts, the Luxury Division gathers key data on consumers, which it uses to identify specific expectations. Diversification-wise, L'Oréal Luxury is broadening and strengthening its brand portfolio to meet the many and varied needs of new consumer populations with perennial brands such as Lancôme, designer brands such as YSL and Giorgio Armani, and alternative brands like Kiehl's and Atelier Cologne, or Urban Decay and It Cosmetics in the makeup category. As Nicolas Hieronimus sees it, the critical challenge for high-end brands is to offer consumers unforgettable experiences. To achieve this goal, the Luxury Division is counting on personalisation. A growing number of L'Oréal Luxury brands are now offering bespoke products, such as Yves Saint Laurent, which lets clients customise their lipstick by picking a colour, cap or by having a message engraved, to make it a unique object that can be offered as a gift or kept. Lancôme, meanwhile, recently began offering Le Teint Particulier, a new custom-made foundation that can be tailored to any skin type. ""In store, a beauty advisor scans and analyses the customer's skin. The customer can then watch as a unique formula is prepared specifically for her."" A technological innovation designed to forge strong ties to the brand, but also ""a huge operational challenge for the Group"", explains Thierry Cheval, head of Retail at L'Oréal. ""We're talking about setting up micro-factories in public places, where they will be in contact with thousands of consumers. We can't leave anything to chance."" Accordingly, two rounds of testing are conducted, comprising a first set of laboratory tests to verify the machines' accuracy, performance and safety, and a second set at the sales outlets themselves to see whether the systems work properly in real-life conditions and over the long run. Thus, for the launch of Lancôme's Teint Particulier in the USA, L'Oréal trialled the system at two stores on the West Coast before rolling it out at nine other US sales locations in the space of a year. ""Encouraged by our US success, we just launched this new service in France and now have 24 stores selling Le Teint Particulier on both sides of the Atlantic,"" adds Thierry Cheval. The next step will be to roll out these services worldwide while developing new ones to make the customer experience even more special and memorable. ""In the luxury market, it is crucial to give customers experiences. That is how we will continue to grow our online and in-store presence,"" concludes Nicolas Hieronimus."
Intercos: What a year!,"Premium Beauty News - Your Group has certainly lived one of its most prosperous and, to say the least, eventful period, starting with its financial strengthening. Dario Ferrari - As you say in France, the planets are indeed well aligned for us! The equity participation of the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board, which has joined our other US financial partner, L Catterton Partners, enhances even more our potential to ensure our international development. Our first goal in the coming months is to successfully introduce the Group (IPO) on the Stock Market. Bearing in mind that, and this is important, the Company's family background and control will remain unchanged. Premium Beauty News - Two major operations took place a few months apart: the joint venture with the Korean Group Shinsegae International Co. (SIC), and the takeover of Cosmint! Dario Ferrari - I must say I am particularly pleased to have been able to successfully achieve these two operations. They are of great importance for the development of our Group across all Beauty sectors in the world. The Italian company Cosmint, which was founded some 20 years ago and whose historic factory is located in Olgiate Comasco near Come, also has a cutting edge plant in Poland. This acquisition will enable us to strengthen ourselves considerably in the skincare, hair-care and body-care segments. But mostly, it will give us the possibility to increase our production areas by completely unclogging and reorganizing our current sites in Italy and specialise them by niche markets. With Cosmint's additional turnover of 145 million euros, the Group's turnover has now reached the 700 million euro mark. Note that the Masu family, the former owner, will continue, of course, to manage the company while M. Decio Masu will also be part of the Group's Board of Directors. And, as a result, we are also setting foot in the perfume market, an also dynamic and very interesting sector to explore. Premium Beauty News - The second significant move was the completion last year, of the joint venture with the Korean Group Shinsegae International Co with the opening this year, of a production plant! Dario Ferrari - I must say that this was a great opportunity to seize. I always thought that an essential step in our conquest of the Asian market, and more particularly of the Chinese market, was to have a plant in South Korea. Innovation and quality, often associated with Korean productions in the area of beauty products, are indeed a vector of success. The search for novelty and perfection is really in the DNA of this people. No wonder why they are often called ""the Italians of Asia"". This can only bring us closer, right?! Don't forget that we had already set up a R&D laboratory in this country. Knowing that the idea came from Mrs Chung Yoo-Kyung, President of the Cosmetics Department of the Shinsegae Group, the opportunity offered to bring to life in 2016 this joint venture with the Shinsegae Group was not to be missed. A joint venture which, as you know, is taking shape today with both the commissioning of a plant and of a Research Centre in Osan, in the Gyeonggi Province. A brand new factory, representing a 30 million dollar investment, built in just six months that covers an area of 15,000 m² and which is home to a hundred employees for the moment. Production, which has just started will focus on skincare and complexion products. Of course the whole team is Korean, with heading it, a man of experience, Mr. Jay Kim. Our goal for this unit is to reach 85 million dollars in sales by 2020. Premium Beauty News - Your foothold in Asia is therefore significantly strengthened! Dario Ferrari - All the more since we are also very satisfied with our industrial tool in China. To sum up, we have four factories, one of 50,000 m² and three others of 20,000 m2 each, not to mention a high-performance Innovation Centre. This year, our sales in this country will have increased twofold. Premium Beauty News - A word about the United States? Dario Ferrari - As you know, we already have a strong foothold there. But acquiring another company is still in the back of our minds."
"Gellé Frères, historic perfumes 2.0","In 1826, Jean-Baptiste and Augustin Gellé purchased a perfume store that belonged to Jean-Louis Gargeon, Marie-Antoinette's perfumer in Versailles. Their perfumes and cosmetics were those of aristocrat and upper-middle class women in the 19th century, and then of icons in the early 20th. In 1945, the brand left the group of the Gellé heirs to turn towards more confidential herbal medicine and open a salon on Boulevard Haussmann. As he believed in the potential of this historic heritage, Simon Ménard took over the brand to put it back in tune with its time. ""We started back from scratch and worked with historian Elisabeth de Feydeau to make the heritage DNA emerge,"" explains the Director. Three great values emerged from this DNA and were brought up-to-date. Gellé Frères is the brand of queens – from Marie-Antoinette to entertainment queens Mistinguett and La Belle Otero, the first beauty icons. Now, Gellé Frères intend to target today's queen, the hyper-connected ""girl next door"", with a global digital approach. The Queen Index digital test ""What queen are you?"" to be filled in store or online offers to help every queen choose the best-suited perfume for them. The products have always been designed around flowers, and this world actually persists in the fragrance compositions. Every new perfume was developed by a perfumer and an olfacto-therapist to choose the flowers for their emotional benefits. ""The idea is to make perfume become an emotional treatment,"" says Simon Ménard. ""To explain this emotion in store, we have associated it with music, by designing every one of the five fragrances listening to music. So, you can listen to your perfume."" Lastly, this brand has an innovation-oriented culture. The Gellé brothers were the first to use the hydro-distillation technique in the first steam plant located in Levallois, just west of Paris. Gellé Frères also innovated by adding glycerine to cosmetics for the first time. Today, innovation invites itself with a concept based on alcohol-free perfumes showcased in opaque bottles and formulated with the micro-encapsulation technique by Laboratoire TechnicoFlor. This more ""natural"" concept is especially popular in Asia, where the brand has high ambitions and was awarded the Organic Prize at the last Cosmoprof Asia show in Hong Kong. Already present in China with six 40m2 points of sale, they aim to develop in Japan and Korea with the support of their Chinese shareholders. France already counts a store on Avenue de L'Opéra, but the brand could soon inaugurate stands in department stores. ""It took two years for the brand to develop until the store opened in March 2017, 19 Avenue de L'Opéra in Paris, just a short walking distance from where the Gellé brothers had opened their first store a century earlier. It is a global 4 to 5-million-euro project,"" Simon Ménard reveals. The development of Gellé Frères is topped with an extension of product lines, mainly based on five fragrances and associated body care products. About sixty references will be added to the thirty existing ones. As for digital technologies, new experiences will soon be unveiled: customers coming to the store will be able to smell their perfume, while having a walk in mythical Parisian spots like Jardin du Luxembourg, thanks to a virtual helmet."
Oxygen Development acquires the Korean company Eyesome,"Oxygen Development, created some fifteen years ago continues to forge ahead. After moving into a state-of-the-art headquarters five years ago offering cutting edge equipment for R&D, formulation, manufacturing and filling of cosmetic products, the company closed its acquisition of 12-year-old Eyesome in November. ""Eyesome along with our new skin care facility will allow us to bring Korean beauty and technology to our customers in a far more efficient manner than is available to them today. Beyond this we expect the transaction to greatly enhance our R&D capabilities given Eyesome's alliances with Korean universities and focus on raw material development."" Scheduled to open in Q1 2018, Oxygen's 140,000 square foot (13,000 sqm) new Florida-based skin care manufacturing will be equipped with the most modern Korean manufacturing equipment. ""Oxygen is a global company today. We have people from 38 different countries who work at Oxygen. We will embrace these differences in cultures and perspectives, taking all the best practices from different regions of the world and encompass them into everything we do."" With the acquisition, last month, of the Korean Company Eyesome and by investing significantly in a new plant in South Florida, leaders at Oxygen Development are clearly demonstrating their strong will to be present in both the makeup and skincare niche. ""Today, we already produce seven to eight million pieces in the skincare segment per year,"" added officials. The integration of Eyesome and the new 140,000 square-foot (13,000 sqm) plant in Florida will put a boost to this strategy."
Makeup: The Japanese group Nippon Shikizai in working order,"Premium Beauty News - A few words fist about your Group, its origin, its specialties and its development... Tsuyoshi Hasuo - Nippon Shikizai began operating in the 1930s as a manufacturer of pigments for facial cosmetics and we are today one of Japan's most innovative cosmetic and pharmaceutical suppliers in terms of R&D and manufacturing techniques. In addition to across-the-board manufacturing capabilities, overall quality control and an unparalleled commitment to research and development, we bring together under one roof, a unique group of specialists dedicated to providing cosmetic companies, worldwide, a complete business solution. Premium Beauty News - Your interest for France is not new? Tsuyoshi Hasuo - France is certainly one of the leading countries in the cosmetic field across the world where many cosmetic brands and world-renowned manufacturers have emerged from. The acquisition in 2000 of Thépenier Pharma Industrie (which was renamed Thépenier Pharma & cosmetics) was an excellent base enabling us to roll-out our strategy in Europe in the area of make-up. By taking over Thépenier, we were guaranteed to acquire a cutting edge production tool in terms of quality production and of compliance to standards at the best possible level. Requirements which are necessary in terms of pharmaceutical production enable us to develop ourselves with total serenity in the cosmetics sector. But we are also keeping an eye on the United States where this year nearly 20% of our turnover was achieved. Premium Beauty News - Seventeen years later, you have reached your goals! And you added a string to your bow by taking over Orléans Cosmetics! Tsuyoshi Hasuo - That's right! You understood that we were patient. This acquisition of Orléans Cosmetics is also supported by major investments in Japan and, of course, in France. As for Japan, we are continuing to invest in our three factories and, more particularly, in the most recent one in Tsukuba, with a three-year investment programme of more than $ 25 million. This factory, which was commissioned in 2015, is capable of producing some 7 million units a year of cushion foundations and more than 10 million mascaras. We have invested a lot in hot filling. As you know we own a total of three factories in our country and a very large research laboratory where more than fifty people work. Over the last two years, our turnover in Japan has increased by more than 35%, the turnover of Thépenier Pharma by more than 45%. and that of Orléans Cosmetics, which we have just acquired, by more than 40%. The market is extremely dynamic. Premium Beauty News - What are the main assets of your Group in the current competitive environment? Tsuyoshi Hasuo - What our President, Kouji Okumura, had said in your columns in 2013 is still very actual: Our strategy is still based on four pillars: – We rely on creativity and technical expertise to provide exceptional products that can proudly bear the names of those who trust us. – Our unwavering commitment to quality and our flexibility are the pillars of our business success. – We strive to be a major global player and the most innovative and respected cosmetics contract manufacturer. – We seek to improve people's lives with formulas that offer maximum sensory delight. One of our strengths is undoubtedly our ability to innovate. Premium Beauty News - The takeover of Orléans Cosmetics also gives you additional advantages? Tsuyoshi Hasuo - Indeed, beyond the historical activity of liquid and pasty products manufactured by Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics, this operation will enables Nippon Shikizai in France to extend its offer in the field of make-up. Like it already does on Asian and North American markets, with products made in Japan, it will now be able to offer cosmetic industry players operating in Europe, a full range of products and services designed and manufactured in France: Skincare (emulsions, lotions, gels), sunscreens, cosmetic powders, hot-poured products, high tech make-up pallets and scented derivatives. Finally, this merger will also benefit the optimization of our industrial organization in Europe, by enabling each site to refocus on its key know-how and to continuously develop the quality and originality of products offered by reinforcing and sectorizing the R&D teams of each structure. Thus, emulsions will be produced in Mortagne at Thépenier, while Orléans Cosmetics will be in charge of ""powders"" and hot poured products. Premium Beauty News - You also want to emphasize, rightly, on the benefits of this ""Franco-Japanese"" axis that makes your specificity today! Tsuyoshi Hasuo - Indeed I must insist on the fact that Nippon Shikizai is the only Asian subcontractor with production sites in Europe. This allows us to propose Asian market trends and innovations with a remarkable time-to-market, and what's more, with the ""Made in France"" label! And that's not all, our factory in Mortagne is FDA certified, it is one of the few in France, if not the only one, to be able to offer OTC products in the United States... this too, helps to make of Nippon Shikizaï a global player, up to the requirements of major international brands!"
Granado opens first store in Paris,"Opening their own store helped historic brand Granado - in association with Phebo, another historic Brazilian brand belonging to the same group - reassert their presence in Brazil starting from 2005 to highlight their heritage. ""Few brands can boast the same story, it is important to have a store to put forward our origins. The brand's identity depends on this,"" explains Nazish Munchenbach, Marketing Director of Granado/Phebo. And the strategy proves successful, since the reborn brand now counts over 60 stores across Brazil. Supported by the Puig group, who took an equity stake a year ago, the Granado group has been enriching their lines, the latest being intended for babies' sensitive skins, and has kept growing outside Brazil. As part of their global development, they confirm their affinity with the French public by inaugurating a flagship store Rue Bonaparte, in Paris, at the end of the year. ""We came to Paris first thanks to the Bon Marché department store. It is here we get most recognition, there is a real emotional and cultural affinity between the two countries. It was actually logical and meaningful to really settle here before going elsewhere,"" ensures Nazish Munchenbach. As a complement to the Bon Marché, with which specific and exclusive actions will be taken, the store will be decorated with the furniture found in Brazilian stores and spread across 70 m2 to offer most of the ranges signed by the two brands. The address chosen is located in the heart of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, and it benefits both from tourist and Parisian customers: according to the Director, it will help them test the brand's consumer perception, apart from the department store. ""This time, we will be in direct contact with French consumers, and that will help us understand their expectations and narrow our offering for them."" This new step towards Europe is completed with the opening of an e-shop, which has been accessible for a month, and other store projects are under study, in particular in Portugal. ""Just like we did in Brazil, we will take time to consolidate and understand consumers' interests. You can very quickly use and reuse a successful formula, but first, you need to find it. We actually have a very long-term project in mind,"" Nazish Munchenbach promises. Granado Pharmácias 21 Rue Bonaparte 75006 Paris"
Italy: the Polo Cosmesi is in full swing,"This 2017 edition was characterized by the intervention of the President of the Polo of Cosmetics Matteo Moretti, determined to carry out what is now an aggregation of companies towards the birth of an extraterritorial cluster open to international markets. Objective shared with Lombardy Regional government and Municipality of Crema, the interlocutors present and with whom Moretti met on stage. ""Bond together to be competitive"" was the leitmotif of the day. Formal engagement has come from the institutions. During the day, moments of entertainment alternated with training sessions, conferences and B2B meetings in a sparkling and informal atmosphere that promotes meetings between the various players in the industry such as suppliers of raw materials, robotic systems and intelligent sensors, strategic consultants, formulators and end users. The Polo Technologico della Cosmesi of Crema brings together 50 companies throughout the make-up production chain from formulation to packaging, from machinery to packing and filling industries (around Crema -just south-east of Milan- and which claims to produce more than 60% of the global selling of make-up), with 64 companies with more than 3,000 employees and a turnover of EUR 600 million to provide all the expertise needed to make the best make-up collections. Matteo Moretti, President of the Cosmetics Polo, has it all mapped out: ""This year we have doubled the Innovation Day numbers and therefore, given the success and the results achieved, I can now anticipate that Innovation Day will come back next year."""
"Claus Porto: revival through a new fragrance, Le Parfum","Over the 20th century, the Claus Porto family house gradually became part of Portugal's cultural and historic heritage, thanks to their perfumes, but mostly their luxurious soaps carefully wrapped by hand in printed, coloured papers that left a strong impression and are still found all over the world. In 2015, the brand started afresh when the Brito family, who had directed the Ach Brito company for over a century (they also owned Ach.Brito and Confiança Lisboa, two brands specialized in toiletries and shaving products), sold the majority of the capital to an investment and risk capital company, Menlo Capital. A new team was put in place, led, among others, by artistic director Anne Margreet Honing and perfumer Lyn Harris, who creates the Miller Harris perfumes. Together, they endeavour to draw inspiration from the brand's heritage to open it up to new horizons. ""It is a great honour and responsibility to manage a company with such a history. Our job consists in making this heritage take on a new dimension and creating a new era for the brand,"" reveals CEO Francisco Neto. To celebrate this adventure, the brand has launched a new fragrance for their 130th anniversary. ""We are revisiting the brand through its exceptional DNA, and Le Parfum illustrates this approach with an exclusive strategy,"" adds Francisco Neto. Claus Porto Le Parfum is an edition limited to 1,887 copies (1887 is the year the House was founded), and the series number is engraved by hand on every bottle. Through this exclusive approach, Claus Porto intends to reinforce their niche, lifestyle-oriented brand reputation. The juice was born between Lisbon and Porto. Anne Margreet Honing and Lyn Harris wished to convey the trip's scents, emotions and encounters with citrus fruit, fig, and cedar wood notes. ""This perfume evokes a break across Portugal, the discovery of its treasures,"" explains Lyn Harris. Famous for their soap packaging, Claus Porto wanted a bottle that would live up to their fame. The artistic director plunged into the House's archives and found inspiration in a bottle that dates back from the 1930s: they reinterpreted it by creating a smart, uncluttered bottle with curved, prominent lines, topped by a white cap, and featured in a white marble box. ""Those that already know the brand will discover something new, and those that do not will discover a very delicate, unique fragrance,"" claims Francisco Neto. Distributed overseas in independent perfume stores and department stores – Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman in New York, Liberty and Harrods in London, barber shops and concept stores – Claus Porto is also available in Paris, mainly at the Bon Marché department store, but also at Marie Antoinette's, a perfume store in the Marais Quarter in central Paris. After opening wholly-owned stores in Lisbon and Porto, the brand is considering doing the same in big capitals like New York, Paris, Tokyo and London. ""We like highlighting our luxury niche brand status. It is conveyed in packaging, raw materials, materials, prices, points of sale…,"" the CEO concludes."
Strand Cosmetics Europe takes on a new dimension,"Decidedly, 2017 was a big year for Strand Cosmetics Europe! Last February, the French company specialising in custom formulation manufacturing and filling of high-end skincare and make-up products opened an office in Brooklyn, New York City. This Autumn, the company is completing the expansion works of its 12,800 m2 industrial site, which required an investment of 7 million euros and two years of work. ""Strand Cosmetics Europe is stepping up the challenge to become a leading manufacturer in its sector,"" said Éric Bouvier, General Manager, at the inauguration of the new site on October 26th. ""Our project has been ambitious since the beginning. Our goal is to become a major player among the key subcontractors of international cosmetic brands and to provide our customers with an excellence-level service."" Strand Cosmetics Europe has chosen to transform its production site while maintaining the activity. The expansion of the facility allowed to improve the staff's comfort and safety while implementing Good Manufacturing Practices similar to those of the pharmaceutical industry. The 4200 m2 additional space allowed the company to increase its production capacity but also to offer new services expected by its customers. ""Two years ago, with the exception of lipsticks, the company mainly supplied bulk to its customers. Today, our filling and packing business, including secondary packing, has expanded considerably. There is a strong demand for full service from customers,"" explains Éric Bouvier. Strand Cometics Europe now has 25 filling and packaging lines for tubes, jars, bottles and compacts and sheet masks, including a dozen lines which are fully automated. Innovation remains at the heart of the company's DNA. The company employs around 30 staffs in R&D, of which 20 are in formulation and about ten in quality control. Each year, Strand Cosmetics Europe spends 5% of its turnover in innovation and has set up an advanced research unit to explore cutting-edge issues and new technologies and support projects with start-ups ... The skincare laboratory produces more than 200 new formulas per year, in response to requests from marketing or customers. About 20% of the time is allotted to the free creation of new textures and to meet and exchange with ingredients suppliers. ""Successful companies are those which, such as Strand, have the ability to constantly renew themselves and which are led by energetic and passionate teams. It is thanks to them that the cosmetics sector is France's second net exporter,"" concluded Patrice O'Quin, President of the French federation of cosmetics manufacturers (FEBEA)."
Gotha Cosmetics: A brand new factory!,"Premium Beauty News - Gotha Cosmetics has made considerable investments and your appointment coincides with the forthcoming relocation on a brand new site. Martin Breuer - That's right! In exactly 16 weeks, the entire administrative team and production equipment and staff of Gotha Cosmetics will be relocated in this new site. A relocation that everyone has been waiting for a long time. We couldn't stay any longer on the current site, which had become too small. This new location will of course enable us to be more efficient in all aspects and, more particularly, at the production level with a capacity increase of 100 %. In addition, we will have a dedicated OTC area, which will allow us to grow in this market segment, dedicated customer areas and a new showroom. Premium Beauty News - You just took office. A few words about yourself and your personal path. Martin Breuer - I have been in the beauty sector for the last sevn years. Prior to joining Gotha Cosmetics, I covered the role of CEO of Intercos Asia Pacific, before I was CFO of the Intercos Group. Premium Beauty News - Could you please recall the story of Gotha Cosmetics. Martin Breuer - Gotha Cosmetics Srl was founded in 2005 as a private label cosmetics manufacturing company. The Company is located in the province of Bergamo, near Milan, the capital of Italian fashion. Its story began 20 years ago as a high-end skincare company, and then, in 2005, it transitioned into cosmetics with a vision of becoming a global point of reference in colour. Being a worldwide company, Gotha has three different locations to offer to its clients: its headquarters, located in Italy, are fully operational and this is where it produces all of its finest quality and highly innovative products. Gotha also has two different locations in the United States which provide points of reference for all East and West Coast clients. These locations are used to conduct private and personalized presentations as well as showcase new product collections. Premium Beauty News - How would you characterize the product positioning of Gotha Cosmetics? Martin Breuer - Striving to incorporate the benefits of skin care products in cosmetics, Gotha has pioneered a new concept which is known today as ""colorceuticals"" or ""cosmeceauticals."" This has enabled Gotha to create high end technology emulsions giving it the reputation it has today: a standard and trend setter in emulsions from quality to innovation, performance and appeal. As time passed Gotha began to grow in all categories, mastering the art of creating primers, lipsticks, lip glosses, powders, hot pours and mascaras, while always keeping its skin care technology at the forefront. Colours are our inspiration: now as well as the future, we continue to be inspired by pure creativity imaging to be cutting edge and will weave the possible and impossible through ongoing research. Realizing that a make-up product is more than a mix of thousand different ingredients, Gotha strives to combine long standing knowledge, sincere passion, tireless dedication and not a little fantasy, to transform your cosmetics dream into real life! As the fingertip is unique to the person, we hope our customers will find their signature style in all Gotha creations. We serve customers that require bulk-only, semi-turnkey, and full turnkey orders. Whether the product is prestige, specialty, mass or OTC, we take products from initial inspiration to final execution. Premium Beauty News - Your vision? Martin Breuer - The next important steps ahead will be to further globalize the Company. Thanks to the teams' work, we currently have a leading position in the US market, especially among the Indie brands. Today, they represent an important portion of our business. This is normal, as we offered them the quantities and the proximity service they were expecting, not to mention quality of course, which remains a core element of our offer. Moreover, we are quite proud of being the suppliers of very big blockbuster in the United States. Now it is time to increase further our influence also in the rest of the world, with main focus on Europe and Asia."
LVMH combines luxury and sustainable commitment with Cha Ling,"The idea came to Guerlain's President & CEO Laurent Boillot five years ago, when he travelled to the Chinese province of Yunnan, tea's original birthplace. Moved by the beauty and richness of the biodiversity of the Xishuangbanna forest, an ecosystem threatened by deforestation, he decided to engage with biologist Josef Margraf and his wife Minguo-Li to save this ancient heritage sheltering highly venerated Pu'Er tea. To this aim, he chose to create a brand based on this precious ingredient endowed with a strong antioxidant power, and to use part of the revenues to reforest the place as it was originally, with a diversified ecosystem. Just like wine, Pu'Er tea has the specificity of improving with time. It peacefully matures in a cellar for decades, which makes its phytochemical profile gradually change. Beyond its strong antioxidant power, as it ages, it develops complementary molecules with an anti-aging action. Starting with these elements, the LVMH laboratories worked for three years to select the trees to harvest and develop formulas containing two types of tea – fresh tea harvested every year and tea that is at least four years old. ""The products were developed following sustainable development principles, with a strict formulation charter, no parabens, no sulphates, and no silicones, although there is a strong sensorial level,"" Élodie Sebag asserts. The formulas are composed of 85% to 99% green ingredients, the weight and volume of glass packs are reduced by 25%, and there is no external packaging: instead, there is a solution inspired from Furoshiki, a traditional Japanese technique for cloth packaging. Creams, and soon fluids will also be featured in ceramic containers made by hand in Limoges, France, for a refillable version. ""We have sponsored the Tea Garden project in Yunnan, and we have already replanted more than 100,000 tea trees so far,"" Élodie Sebag adds. Although all products are made in the Guerlain plant in St Jean de Braye, France, Cha Ling was intended to be globally positioned as a French-Chinese brand. ""Very early on, we expressed the will, and that was important, to fully integrate the Chinese culture as soon as the development phase, and not just use the ingredient,"" explains the CEO. The range integrates both skincare and rituals derived from traditional Chinese medicine for the application gesture, and of course, there is a whole environment around the ceremony of organic-certified Pu'Er tea (mugs, ceramic teapot). Launched in January 2016 simultaneously in France, at the Bon Marché department store, in Hong Kong, with a wholly-owned store, and on an e-shop, Cha Ling was then established in Shanghai in July, with a new store. Little by little, the brand gains fame with a targeted digital strategy (Instagram, platforms, Birchbox…), as well as a programme supported by micro-influencers in the beauty and lifestyle industry. ""After a year and a half, we have achieved over 20% repurchases in the three countries,"" Élodie Sebag. ""Cha Ling is at the crossroads of different trends: wellness, the return of traditional medicines, in particular the Chinese medicine, and of course, the green movement. It seduces different customer profiles with different arguments – the overall Chinese tradition spirit in France, and the 'made in France' know-how in China. Lastly, it offers the LVMH efficacy for a meaningful purchase,"" she concludes."
Omnicos banks on the future with a brand-new production facility,"It only took a ""small"" year for this new tool to be operational. A real ""tour de force"" on the part of contractors and of the designer, Beppe Riboli, who was so far more specialised in buildings designed for trend clubs. As a result, the visitor entering the place is immediately struck by this very sleek structure with original and pure lines, surrounded by greenery and covered by 7,700 butterflies. The feeling is even stronger once the first glass doors are passed. The building and the terrace embrace the secret garden hosting the unique 400 years old olive tree. Luminosity, sheer whiteness... there is undoubtedly a feeling of serenity in the atmosphere. It is going to become a ""delightful place"" in which to work! The 700 m2 of laboratories are made entirely of glass windows overlooking on the outside. Production workshops for the processing of powders or liquids are divided into self-operating boxes (with an over-pressurized air system to avoid contamination), a few steps away from a fully automated storage hall built by Toyota and which delivers the exact quantity of raw material in one of the 2,000 individual pallet boxes, the 100% plastic ""Omnibox"". Everything has been carefully devised so that the 140 people who work there every day feel comfortable and happy: just like their own home. Cafeteria, fitness room, auditorium, the ""osteria"" for the clients and the private parking for the employees… The 8,700 m2 of buildings, including the production halls, are completely self-sufficient in terms of electricity consumption thanks to a geothermic system and 260KW photovoltaic panels placed on the roof. ""Opening the doors of our 'new home' is our way of thanking every employee and co-worker, but also our clients and suppliers who have trusted us along all these years, allowing us to grow and evolve through the work we have always done, and keep on doing with great passion and enthusiasm,"" explains Manuela Guerrini, Commercial Director. ""Welcoming you inside our company is also a sign of transparency and integrity: that results in two open-style laboratories, the 'Diamante' and the 'Kepleroom', the new advanced research lab, but also a clear and conscious attention to Sustainable Development and the search for zero impact, in every area of the facility (i.e., led lights, geothermal system, a photovoltaic unit and antibacterial resin and paint), as well as a commitment to reducing production waste,"" she adds. Founded in 1998, the Italian firm whose turnover will exceed this year 25 million euros (compared to the 5 million achieved six years earlier!), 90% of which is exported. It specializes in the formulation and production of make-up products. ""Over the years,"" details Manuela Guerrini, ""Omnicos went from simple product supplier to product influencer and is today ready to take a further step by investing more and more in R&D, making of innovation a master word and obtaining recognition from industry players: this is the way to go! Innovation is not about ideas. It's about making ideas happen. To innovate doesn't simply mean to create something new. Innovating means to think and realize something, which was inexistent until then and which meets the clients' needs. This implies the ability to fully understand their demands and, above all, to anticipate."" On the commercial side, the Italian firm, which already has a strong foothold in Europe, has decided to intensify its efforts on the North American continent with the aim of increasing twofold its activity. To this end, a new commercial agent was appointed in the person of Odette Bohan. Odette will be based on the West Coast, but she will also ensure a commercial presence on the entire territory. ""As for Asia,"" added Manuela Guerrini, ""it will be on the agenda in two years!"" Another immediate - industrial - objective: invest in the production of pencils with the arrival this year of three additional machines."
NYX targets makeup artists and 'makeup addicts' in L'Oréal's new venture in Brazil,"Created in 1999 in the U.S. by South Korean entrepreneur Toni Ko, NYX Professional Makeup has emerged as an alternative between premium and mass-market makeup brands, claiming to offer professional-standard products to suit every budget. Available in 70 countries around the world, the brand first landed in Brazil in 2007 and has recently been relaunched by the L'Oréal Group after its acquisition three years ago. ""L'Oréal's mission is to offer beauty for all. In order to turn this concept into reality, it is crucial that we make high quality products widely available, including makeup, a category that has grown rapidly in Brazil in recent years,"" says Bianca Pi, director of NYX in Brazil. Accounting for 26.4% of L'Oréal's current turnover, the makeup category - which already has brand Maybelline in its consumer products division – has become one of the beauty giant's strategic priorities for the next years. As part of the NYX's restructuring plan, L'Oréal closed the kiosks that were still in operation in Brazil, which totaled 30 points of sale at the peak of operations, and collected the products. In this new phase, the brand will operate only through its own stores, offering more than 1500 products out of the 3000 items available in NYX's portfolio – all of which will be imported into Brazil. The brand's first store opened its doors in July in Rio. ""It's hard to work with such a wide product mix within the limited space of a kiosk. The stores will follow standards that include size and window display, aiming to create an inspiring environment for customers,"" says Pi. The new stores – which Pi compares to candy shops – will have at least 80m2, seven meters of shop windows, plenty of mirrors and makeup available for testing. ""We want customers to feel free to express themselves through makeup,"" says Pi. According to Bianca Pi, NYX has two main target audiences in Brazil: professional makeup artists and what she calls 'makeup junkies' – teenagers and young women who describe themselves as 'addicted to makeup'. A survey conducted by Nielson found that despite the unfavorable economic scenario in Brazil, this cosmetic category actually gained more than 2 million new consumers in the last year. More than 60% of them are women between the ages of 19 and 25. Product prices range from from R$ 20 (lip liners) to R$ 150 (eye shadow palettes). ""We know how costly it can be for a professional makeup artist to build their own makeup kit. That's why we offer a wide range of prices to suit every budget, from students ready to build their first kit to experienced makeup artists, who will find a wide choice of textures, colors, tools and finishings to add to their kits,"" says Pi. With the professional market in mind, NYX sponsored the 8th International Makeup Congress, held in São Paulo in September during the latest edition of Beauty Fair. In addition to having a stand at the event, the brand held discussions about makeup trends among its team members and guests, including drag queen Nina Codorna, winner of the 1st Face Awards Brazil, organized by NYX. By the end of this year, more of the brand's stores will be opened in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. NYX also plans to launch its e-commerce platform, which is currently under research and will take into account the most sought-after products locally. ""We're confident that NYX will be a hit in Brazil,"" concludes Bianca Pi."
"Toly, set to invest strongly in 2018 to address the rise of subcontracting needs","Premium Beauty News - ""Who does not take a step forward, takes a step backwards! A saying that you follow to the letter! Andy Gatesy - What other choice do we have? Everything is going so quickly today in the Beauty sector. Just look at what is happening, in particular, in the make-up niche. Dozens of new brands emerge every year... You can hardly believe the sales figures of these new brands posting millions of pieces, most of them unknown a few months ago, and that take the marketplace by storm. Subcontracting needs continue to grow... You must accompany and even anticipate the market and its trends. Demand for innovation is increasing more and more. We spend more than 300,000 euros in patent filings every year. Our development strategy in ""Cushion"" compacts, although started late, is exceeding our expectations with a level of orders never reached before. Success is the same in Asia with our packagings equipped with a dropper. New businesses are emerging everywhere in the world, like recently in Colombia. Premium Beauty News - Clearly, your former business of ""mere"" packaging manufacturer is changing at great speed! Andy Gatesy - To say the least! And we adapt ourselves as quickly as possible. Every day, I can only be satisfied with my decision of having set up a top-level Innovation Centre in Malta, which was the result of many years of research in new packagings and new applicators for the perfume and cosmetic industry. Clients can access some 800 models on display, try them, test them, and compare them. But that's not all! We also hired a MakeUp Artist two years ago and a Beauty Blogger three years ago. Each month a real ""Trend Team"" works with our development, innovation and design teams. We have managed to dramatically shorten the creation and production lead-times: in some cases, we jumped from seven months to three weeks! 'We started by being an engineering company - Building moulds and converting plastics and when I became CEO 26 years ago we became a packaging supplier and now we are a Beauty Solutions provider."
Tecnocosmesi: A new plant and already ten months of production in Canada,"Premium Beauty News - A few words on your Company... Francesco Fausti - As you know, we are based near Milan in the town of Massalengo. I created the Company in 1979 and we are specialized in the manufacture of cosmetic products for the make-up and skincare sector with a specialisation for ""OTC products,"" which has contributed a lot to our reputation. And we work for the biggest international groups in the area. Premium Beauty News -This new plant in Canada is a ""first"" in more ways than one! Why Canada? Francesco Fausti - Yes, it's true! This is the first time we will be producing out of Italy. But let me remind you that we also have an antenna in New York since 2014. Why Canada? The reason is simple. This country of course very close to the United States, which remains the largest market for cosmetics in North America. Canada, where European culture is strong, offers all guarantees of economic stability, both financial and socially. Connections between Montreal and Genoa, a port city an hour's drive from Massalengo, are extremely frequent and simple. Canada has all the necessary skills in terms of specialized and qualified personnel. The city of Laval, which we chose to settle, is also twenty minutes from the Montreal airport. Finally, it is much easier to enter the U.S. market coming from Canada as part of the trade agreements that exist between the two countries than it would be coming from Europe. Premium Beauty News - A dew figures? Francesco Fausti - The new 6,000 m2 factory is built on a 20,000 m² of land and the first production phase began last November. A second phase related to an increase in capacity is planned for early 2019, followed by a third phase within five years. The objective in five years, ensure that the Group's total turnover is equally divided between Europe and the United States. Premium Beauty News - What is the amount of the investment? How many people work there today and do they do? Francesco Fausti - In total, the envelope amounts to more than 13 million euros, this includes the construction of the plant itself and the equipments and machines. We currently employ a dozen people, but this figure should quickly jump to about fifty in the coming months. Actually our project has proved its worth since presently, that is to say halfway our current fiscal year (March to April), we are producing twice has more as what was expected. As for the products, they currently only concern pressed powders and assembled products but in the medium and long term we will offer the whole range of Tecnocosmesi products. Premium Beauty News - A few words on your historic plant in Italy... Francesco Fausti - Our growth is still as strong and we are continuing to increase our capacity. And don't forget that we are certified ISO 22716:2007 (Good Manufacturing Practices - GMP) and that last year we obtained the ISO 14001 certification. Our reputation stands in a few words: ""Quality, Experience and Creativity"", but also ""Innovation and Research"", which allows us to always aim ""higher"" in terms of colour ranges and texture performances. Finally, I insist on this desire to offer products ""Made in Italy"" products."
Euromonitor on Natura's acquisition of The Body Shop,"""Natura Cosmeticos acquiring The Body Shop makes sense in the context of Natura's existing portfolio and its shared values,"" comments Hannah Symons, beauty and personal care analyst at Euromonitor. For several years, Natura has been experimenting retail strategy through its small high-end brand Aesop. ""Upon purchasing Aesop in 2012, Natura has facilitated the sustained growth of the brand's best-in-class, mono-brand retail strategy,"" said Hannah Symons. Building on this experience, Natura opened its first own physical store in Sao Paulo in 2016, a radical move considering that direct-selling has historically strongly underpinned the company's DNA. ""This was a clear signal of a change in retail tack for the company, which is why the acquisition does not come as a surprise,"" added Symons. In parallel, after having entered the Brazilian market in October 2013 with the acquisition of 51% of Emporio Body Store, The Body Shop had initiated an ambitious retail plan in Brazil. However, with an e-commerce presence and 130 shops in Brazil, the actual situation of The Body Shop in the country remained far below its initial goals. According to Euromonitor, The Body Shop being a pioneer of ethical sourcing and social responsibility in the beauty and personal care industry, makes it a perfect match for Natura's green approach to production and plant-based heritage. ""These shared values will help nurture the defining integrity of The Body Shop on an even greater global stage. This comes at a crucial time when many consumers are redefining their priorities and ethical consumption is topping agendas,"" commented Hannah Symons. While sharing common ethical values, the two companies are very different in their geographical presence. ""Whilst the majority of The Body Shop's 2016 sales came from developed markets, Natura's strength lies in the emerging regions, account for 98% of its value in 2016. Undoubtedly this exposure will provide a necessary springboard for The Body Shop to expand further into valuable emerging territories to help revive growth. In this case the acquisition would be a happy marriage; reducing Natura's reliance on Brazil, whilst mitigating The Body Shop's risk in stagnating developed regions,"" concludes Symons."
L'Occitane lets the sunshine in with new store design,"L'Occitane is rethinking the design of its stores in France and abroad by testing a new concept named ""Sunshine"". More than 40 boutiques in Europe, the United States, the Middle East, Asia and Russia will be fully renovated to comply with the new design. In France, the first Sunshine boutique opened its doors on September 4, avenue des Ternes, in the 17th arrondissement in Paris. ""In a globalized world where the role of technologies is getting increasingly predominant, the L'Occitane cosmetics group has chosen to bet on more authenticity and a solid grounding in reality,"" explains the company in a statement. The new concept resolutely opts for vivid colours and a warm lighting. The brand's iconic yellow is now massively colouring the shop's inner and outer walls, sublimated by a warm lighting coming down from the ceiling and from backlit furniture. The new colour code modernizes the brand's image, while retaining the essential references to its Provençal origins. When entering into the shop, the visitor's eye is not attracted by flat screens but by a large round washbasin, the so-called ""Ice Breaker"" zone, which is intended as a facilitator between customers and shop-assistants. This is very symbolic of L'Occitane's choice to limit the visible footprint of digital technologies in its stores. The company wants to put digital technologies ""at the service of the sensory experience and not the opposite"". Various dedicated areas (face skincare, men's products, fragrances, gifts, etc.) invite customers to test the products within a calm and friendly environment, with the help of shop assistants who will use the tablets available in the boutiques only for specific requests. Nevertheless, the new shops are far from being cut off from the digital world. Actually, digitalis everywhere in the back office as well as in the organization of a click-and-collect service called ""Pick in Store"": customers can order online before withdrawing their product in the shop of their choice, three hours later. Other ""Sunshine"" shops are expected to open in the coming months in France and the concept is also being tested since August in China and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region."
"""Just because you are demanding, does not mean you cannot be caring,"" Isabelle Guyomarch, CCI Productions","Isabelle Guyomarch purchased CCI Productions in 2008. She managed to give new impetus to the company to preserve its future. Her business is focused on perfumes and cosmetics manufacturing for third parties, from the development to the packaging phase. Then, four years ago, she had to fight an aggressive breast cancer: that is when she realized how difficult it is to manage both an activity and a disease. ""As a company director, I just could not stop working, and yet I was sick,"" she explains. Through her career, she happened to meet many women like her, who also felt desperate because of their diseases and distressed to lose their jobs or not be able to get back to it. ""After this hardship, I needed to make sense of something that was, well, nonsense. I felt like creating a different model in my company,"" she claims. The day she met Anne-Sophie Tuszinsky - who has founded the company association Cancer@work - was decisive. Isabelle Guyomarch decided to set up an original CSR policy [1] within her own company. She created a training workshop in January 2017 to help people stay at work or make them get back to it after a long disease through flexible hours and work pace, as well as a considerate management. ""When you are off for a long time, it is very stressful to get back to work – you are tired, things go fast, and it is hard to make contact with the others. This workshop helps gradually readapt to the world of work and reconnect with your social life and life as well,"" she says. The project is intended for every profile and all sources of exclusion due to illness, and not just cancer. It has already showed positive results on the whole company. The overall absenteeism rate has declined. ""It does not mean sick people work more, but their will and courage are seen as models by others,"" explains Isabelle Guyomarch, who also observed a caring social climate in turn, as well as a certain pride of the employees in their company – 80% are women. These aspects corroborate the Director's vision on her approach: make this societal project a positive, profitable element for the company. ""I wanted to make it a strength, an opportunity, not a cost item full of constraints like most other companies do. You can earn money and still do good to your environment and measure the benefits of your actions,"" she asserts. To her, wellness at work, the positive effects the company's activity creates on her internal and external environment represent a management solution. The human parameter is at the core of the industrial group's culture. ""Beyond this experience, my strategy is also aimed to break taboos on cancer at work and breast cancer in particular. 50% of women lose their jobs three years after the disease. The less skilled can very quickly find themselves in a precarious situation,"" adds Isabelle Guyomarch, who insists on the notion of societal project. She will share this message and others with CCI Productions customers at the official presentation of her action next October 19 – she will also announce her decision to sponsor the Cancer&Travail ""Allo Alex"" hotline. ""Our relationship with our customers goes much beyond the quality of our products. These brands are also committed, and they really want the company with which they work to take care of their employees. Just because you are demanding, does not mean you cannot be caring – it is the combination of the two aspects that is innovative,"" concludes Isabelle Guyomarch."
Beauty full service: The ambitions of the Swiss company Marvinpac!,"A few figures first... In 2016, Marvinpac had sales of 45 million Euros for a workforce of 250 people, 23 million co-packed units and 11 million co-manufactured units. Premium Beauty News - From where does Marvinpac originate? Vincent Isselin - At the start, this Swiss company, created in 1999, was specialized in cardboard processing. As part of a proactive and supportive approach to our clients, we expanded our areas of expertise to offer more and more services over the years. From contract packing to conditioning including the creation of packagings and the development of accessories, the Company gained momentum naturally. Historically, with customers operating mainly in the food sector (including the largest, the Nestlé Group and its flagship product Nespresso. Then new markets gradually opened up, with the Pharmacy and, of course, the Beauty sector in the broad sense and more particularly skincare. Thus in addition to the opportunity offered by this joint venture in 2016 with the Strand Cosmetics Europe Group, Marvinpac decided to step up a notch its development strategy across the cosmetic spectrum, including make-up. The creation of the French subsidiary is aimed at accompanying Beauty brands with our global solution dedicated to custom packaging. A trade in which we stand as key player in Europe. From custom packaging to design, manufacturing and management of accessories, to the production of rigid boxes, we are able to offer a turnkey service and premium quality throughout the value chain. Premium Beauty News - What does your offer consist of? Vincent Isselin - This is a high value-added service offering, with quality turnkey solutions, and an increasingly optimized ""time to market"". It is by relying on our purchasing organization, our project development department, our established partnerships with suppliers and our two industrial sites that we have been able, for years, to provide a service of excellence, ranging from pure co-packing operation to real full-service. In addition, all services are carried out in full compliance with the most stringent international standards in terms of quality, traceability and safety, thanks to a product quality supervised and guaranteed by a dedicated team in charge of the application of protocols and compatibility studies on behalf of its customers. By establishing ourselves in France, the world's cradle for high-end and luxury products, we aim to accelerate our development on the cosmetics market, among others and get closer to international brands. As I said above, in the continuation of the development of our cosmetic activities initiated 5 years ago, strengthened by the creation of MS Swiss Cosmetics in 2016, France appears today as a natural destination for us. Premium Beauty News - You have a specific organization? Vincent Isselin - We rely on an integrated creative studio to design prototypes, packagings and carry out a certain number of tests inherent to the pack. We also have two purchase offices, one in Europe and the other in China, to qualify the best suppliers and the relevant raw materials in accordance with international standards. We also rely on our project managers, in charge of the entire development process, from the sourcing of components to the delivery of the finished product. Finally, we have two production sites, one in Switzerland and one in Czech Republic, to condition and pack products. Certified sites equipped with white rooms for the conditioning of skincare and make-up products. Finally, our ""in and out"" logistics platform guaranteeing optimal traceability, allows a delivery to markets thanks to internalisation, like for example ""customs and duties"" expertise."
BCM Cosmétique: as trendy as it gets,"For this 2017/2018 collection, BCM has identified three major trends that have inspired their latest innovations and launches for all cosmetic product categories. ""Conversely, every BCM category expert also provided food for thought for the trend we had predefined, thanks to their product expertise, and we had a very fulfilling, multicultural discussion,"" explains Marie-Christine Clerc, Sales & Marketing Director for the Face category. In addition, to assert the expression of their message, BCM developed an olfactory signature for every family, in collaboration with a perfume composition house. The first trend for this collection is named Do It . It expresses strength and determination, girl power and self-confidence – a sort of can-do attitude, adds Marie-Christine Clerc. It corresponds to textures that hold their promises, are reassuring and long-lasting for high-performance products, and combine with vitality and energy notes, like tangerine, bergamot orange, and ginger. In the three makeup categories – Lips, Face, and Eyes – the Power Lips 2-in-1 provides a plumper effect on the lips and lip contour. Test results have shown this serum and lip makeup product guarantees a 50% enhanced hydration performance. Also, the vitamin-enriched Mini Outdoor Lipstick can withstand any sports activities. Anti-wrinkle makeup base Ready, Aim, Primer! removes both pores and fine lines. Power Blush, a long-lasting compact powder, contains pigments that can last even after the texture has disappeared. Ultimately, also long-lasting, the Eyebrow Pomade can play with the climate, while offering a very natural makeup result on the brows. Be it is the second family. It embodies diversity in benevolence, identity, ethics, tribe spirit… ""It is intended for more committed women asserting their lifestyle,"" Marie-Christine Clerc comments. Be It creations boast a fragrance profile that evokes indulgence with green fig and pepper notes. BCM completed the Be It trend with Enchanted Lipsticks, mauve, green, yellow, and blue lipsticks which provide the lips with a highly personalized, pinkish colour when they come in contact with the skin's pH. Also following this trend, there is the astonishing Peel & Reveal Lip Mask, a moisturizing, coloured peel-off mask for the lips which, once the film removed, leaves the mouth naturally tinted and material-free for two hours. For the complexion, the Vegan Complexion Equalizer excludes all products of animal origin and, with the accuracy of a dropper or clic pen, adds and mixes a drop of colour-concentrated emulsion with a day cream or sun cream. ""For consumers, the message in line with the trend is clearly: I am myself with my usual products and I do not need multiple creams,"" explains Marie-Christine Clerc. BCM has also designed a Mineral Powder Foundation with mineral pigments, a natural powder which turns into cream on the skin for a radiant result. Here is another example, this time following the multi-mask micro-trend: BCM has developed a line composed of three masks based on natural ingredients to be used individually or combined with each other for a complete ritual – SOS Soothing Face Mask for sensitive and dehydrated skins, SOS Detox Face Mask for a purifying action with charcoal powder, and the leave-on 3 Minute Eraser Mask, with a fresh texture. Lastly, the Feel It trend embodies the holistic quest for wellness, nature preservation, and the right balance between the body and mind. ""This movement has been trendy for quite long, and it keeps changing,"" Marie-Christine Clerc asserts. The range offers products with sensorial textures for a clean finish. The olfactory notes convey oriental glamour, sensuality, and relief, thanks to tangerine, pepper, and lavender. These are contained in Overnight Sleep In Hair Oil, a silicone-free oil for hair ends, and Lip Nectar, an anti-aging lip treatment based on essential oils and vitamins. This was just an overview: this collection rich in texture and formulation innovations should get even broader at the next Luxe Pack Monaco show."
Walgreens Boots Alliance sells BCM to the Fareva Group,"Under the terms of the agreement, Fareva will take ownership of BCM, Walgreens Boots Alliance's contract manufacturing business in the personal care sector. Simultaneously, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Fareva have agreed on a 10-year global partnership for the manufacture and supply of Walgreens Boots Alliance own beauty brands and private label products, including products for sale in the USA. BCM, the contract manufacturing business of Walgreens Boots Alliance, is one of the largest health and beauty contract manufacturers in Western Europe. The company operates factories in Nottingham in the UK, Vitré in France and Frankfurt in Germany. For its part, Fareva is a leading global subcontractor for the beauty and health markets. The group manufactures in 11 countries, including the USA, and has significant research and development capabilities. ""The proposed agreement will create a partnership to provide Walgreens Boots Alliance with a core multinational manufacturing and development resource, enabling the company to accelerate its global product strategy,"" explains Walgreens Boots Alliance in a release. With the sale of its beauty manufacturing wing, Walgreens Boots Alliance intends to focus on in its international retail development (Walgreens, Duane Reade, Boots and Alliance Healthcare) and the marketing of its own beauty brands (No7, Botanics, Liz Earle and Soap & Glory). The proposed agreement, which is subject to Works Council consultation and regulatory approval, is expected to be completed by the end of calendar year 2017."
"""Augmented reality is a great tool to create desire and we'll soon extend it to skin care"", Alice Chang, Perfect Corp","Premium Beauty News - The applications of the YouCam suite [1] are now among the most popular augmented reality apps for smartphones. How did this idea emerge? Alice Chang - I used to work for CyberLink, our parent company, which is specialised in augmented reality and facial recognition technologies. A few years ago, I realized that these technologies could be adapted in order to be used on smartphones which are a much more dynamic market than personal computers. As smartphones were becoming more performant, we understood they would soon play a key role in everyone's daily life. However, while smartphone had good cameras, the existing image editing tools were not adapted to the skyrocketing selfie trend. When edited, selfies looked fake. We wanted to improve the quality of selfies and to enable every woman to enhance her natural beauty, exactly what makeup is doing. This is why we launched YouCam Perfect, which was a huge success. The development of YouCam Makeup was the second step. It was a natural development in order to help women to improve the quality of the pictures they send to their friends or publish on social media. This second app was much more difficult to develop than the first one because we had to apply the makeup very precisely, with nice and accurate colours. We therefore developed a colour blending technology so as the application be as realistic as possible. Thanks to this tool, the colour which is virtually applied will merge with the user's skin tone and will look different on different faces… Furthermore, makeup application had to be accurate even if the user was moving its head. Eventually, the success of this second app went well beyond our expectations. Premium Beauty News - Did you immediately understand you were changing the way consumers are testing products and thus disrupting the beauty industry? Alice Chang - It was exactly what we wanted to do. However, at that very moment we had no idea of what would be the business model. From the beginning, we decided that the two apps would be free for users, because in the new economy you first have to grow your size and get the biggest share of the market. But we had no idea of what would be our income sources. We just had the intuition that augmented reality had a huge potential on smartphones! As the YouCam Makeup app became increasingly popular among millennials, we started to make links with beauty brands and retailers. And we had impressive results. The more consumers try beauty products, the more interested they are in buying them. Trying through the app is very similar than trying the real product, that's the main asset of YouCam Makeup: it is realistic and there is no risk no constraints in trying a wide array of products and colours! We also developed tools so as users can try colour cosmetics in stores. Trying makeup products has always been difficult in stores, because of cost and sanitary issues. Now we provide a convenient and realistic solution. The beauty industry is now very familiar with augmented reality technologies and we strongly contributed to that. We are now discussing with a lot of brands and we recently signed a global contract with the L'Oréal Group. It's a win-win deal for brands or retailers, for users and for us. We have only two years but we developed very fast! Premium Beauty News - So far, augmented reality testing is focused on colour cosmetics, including nail colours. Do you think that new categories could be added? Alice Chang - In the wake of our agreement with L'Oréal we are working on new developments to enlarge the range of product categories that can be tested through our apps. For instance, we'll soon allow our users to test skin care products! The skin analytic care tool we'll be added into the YouCam Makeup app and will be launched globally within a few weeks. It will identify skin imperfections, targeting five issues: skin tone, spot control, wrinkle resilience, texture refinement, dark circles. The aim is to allow people to visualize how their skin is changing and improving with the use of skin care products, and also to provide them with advices. Furthermore, we are continuously improving the app. We'll soon launch a new 3D simulation which will allow to be get even more realistic effects with makeup which will follow the face movements. We'll also add new features such as the possibility to try a large variety of accessories. Recently we launched live shows in North America including Mexico. This tool aims vloggers, bloggers and brand ambassadors to promote their preferred products and viewers can shop simultaneously. We continue to develop new tools, to innovate and to move forward. Augmented reality is a great tool to create desire for products and to help people understand what products could bring to them. Furthermore, the importance of mobile devices will continue to grow in our daily lives with a lot of new apps, including ours."
"""We have every reason to be optimistic"", Loïc Armand, Cosmetics Europe President","Premium Beauty News - What is your vision of the cosmetics market evolution? Loïc Armand - I have an extremely optimistic vision of it. The cosmetics market is the only one to have gone through the crisis without batting an eyelid. We meet basic needs, while offering affordable products. On the global level, our industry is driven by the rise in middle classes' purchasing power: there is already a significant growth potential in Latin America, India, and South Asia. And in the future, we foresee a very strong growth in the demand for our products in Africa, which is definitely the new frontier for our industry. It is on this continent that future markets are developing. As for Europe, the tendency is positive, despite cyclical changes. It remains the first global market by far. In 2016, the cosmetics industry's growth apart from the UK was evaluated at 1.2%, even if the turmoil in the currency markets following the Brexit vote compelled us to reduce it to +0.8%. Premium Beauty News - Talking about this, how will Brexit impact the European industry? Loïc Armand - The European industry cannot remain indifferent to the questions that emerged about Europe's future. But if Brexit is an important issue that will need to be dealt with, it is not a major challenge for us. The real problem would have been Frexit, if France had got out of the European Union or euro area. From this standpoint, the French election result has made us much more optimistic. The French have elected the most Europhilic executive power and Parliament the country has ever had. The fact that Europe has recovered a dynamic economic growth should help meet citizens' job expectations. In addition, the EU should make sure it provides satisfactory answers to security needs. Premium Beauty News – Is the UK still about to free itself from part of the European regulations? Loïc Armand - We will see what they actually decide to do. Right now, it is good form to criticize European regulations. Of course, they are not flawless, but we do think they are the most protective for consumers and the environment, and they still allow for companies to innovate. Since the first European Directive regulated our business in 1976, our industry has exchanged a lot with the authorities on these issues. European cosmetics regulations have become a reference point for many countries. As for us, we endeavour to support global convergence on their main principles: responsibility of the person that places products on the market, risk assessment, distinction between risk and hazard, etc. We have recently won several battles. That is how the Chinese government has taken over most of the principles of the best regulatory practices for their new regulations… It is the fruit of six years of exchanges and dialogue with local authorities. India is another example of this: recently, they were still one of the rare countries not to recognize the notion of inevitable traces of heavy metals. This anomaly was resolved by modifying the Indian Federal Law in December 2016, taking over the European regulations principles. Premium Beauty News - And yet, recently, European consumer associations were still criticizing the presence of allergens and suspected endocrine disruptors in cosmetics available on the European market. Loïc Armand - There is still a lot of misunderstanding as regards these issues. Consumer associations are not opponents, we need to exchange with them. But the difference between hazard and risk is still misunderstood. It is a real challenge for us."
Parfums de Marly enters the new Printemps de la Beauté department store with a redesigned concept,"No more off-beat Neo-Baroque atmosphere or allusions to the reign of King Louis XV! The niche perfume brand founded in 2009 by Julien Sprecher has redesigned their retail concept for a more classic, Haussmanian-inspired decoration created by designer Hubert de Malherbe. References to King Louis XV and his passion for horses will not disappear though – they will only get more sober. ""We are creating a brand identity that is less marked and more accessible,"" emphasizes Julien Sausset, CEO of Parfums de Marly. First, the new concept will be deployed in the brand's future shop-in-shop (15m2) in Printemps Haussmann's brand new Scent Room in Paris (opening planned on July 17, 2017), and then in the new 42m2 store to be inaugurated in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in February 2018, in the Dubai Mall Luxury extension. ""The fact that we are entering the world's largest concept store dedicated to the beauty experience is a step further in our development and visibility,"" explains Julien Sausset about the brand's entering the new Printemps Haussmann beauty section. In France, the brand already has a wholly-owned store in Paris, on Cambon Street, and it is also available in Cannes, at Taizo's, and in Paris 8 Monaco high perfumery section. On the global level, Parfums de Marly is available in 48 countries and about 450 points of sale: at Harrods' and Selfridges' in London, in the United States, with a wholly-owned store opened in January 2016 in New York's Meatpacking District, and at Bloomingdale's, but also at Nordstrom's in about fifty points of sale, and in Asia, in specialized multi-brand shops in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. To widen the audience, the brand will also develop the women's offering. So far, Parfums de Marly offered a 22-juice collection (16 for men, 6 for women), and achieved over 60% of their sales with men's/mixed perfumes. The brand has just launched a 23rd fragrance for women, Delina, with a floral note dominated by Turkish rose, but also lily of the valley and peony scents. ""It had a dazzling success from the very beginning, as 80 items were marketed in the first weekend at Selfridges' in London, and as many at Beymen's in Istanbul, over the same period,"" Julien Sausset rejoices. As sales have risen by 48% in Europe and more than 60% in the United States over the past twelve months, Parfums de Marly aims to keep expanding at the same pace to reach the Top 10 of niche perfume brands. Among others, they will focus on developing sales in Asia and reinforcing their digital presence with a new website and e-shop. Lastly, the current offering of perfumes and candles will be completed with a bath range to be launched during the first semester 2018."
"Historical heritage: Kumano, from calligraphy to make-up brushes","Squirrel, goat, horse or badger hair, Tesshu Takemori makes the difference in an instant before detailing the properties of each animal hair for making makeup brushes. ""Size, shape, suppleness, hardness, everything counts and decides the nature of the brush, its use (powder, foundation …). If the tip of a hair is damaged, it is damn. And this know-how is transmitted from father to son,"" says the Japanese artisan. Mr. Takemori is the heir of the brush workshop created in 1952 by his father Kazuo, president of Chikuho-Do, one of the iconic brush companies of Kumano, a city located about 20 kilometers from Hiroshima. Chikuho-Do is also the creator of brushes for famous Japanese cosmetic brands such as Shiseido, RMK or Kanebo. Brushes are the recognized emblem of Kumano and the community even dedicates some religious ceremonies to the tool. Approximately 80% of the Japan-made brushes for fine-arts, calligraphy and make-up are produced in this urban area of 24,000 inhabitants. About 1,500 employees of family-owned businesses work in this sector, including 20 ""masters"" such as Tesshu Takemori. ""The tradition of handcrafted writing brushes already existed in other parts of Japan, such as Nara or Harima, but about 180 years ago people in the Kumano area thought they could produce cheaper items and sucessfully grew the business,"" says Mr. Takemori during a tour of his company, which is lodged between beautiful traditional homes at the foot of the mountains. At the time ""quality was not exceptional"". Today, at Chikuho-Do, about a hundred staff, mostly women, are working to make thousands of brushes, using their hands and eyes as the main tools … but neither scissors nor computer! ""The secret is to keep the tip of the hairs, not to cut it, because it is where their essential function is and that's what differentiates our brushes from many foreign models,"" insists the artisan. ""The first step is to distribute the hairs that come from China, Russia, or other countries in the form of balls in layers. This is the only place where a machine is involved,"" said Mr. Takemori. ""This hand work is impossible to automate,"" he says. Furthermore, all required tools have to be produced specially, such as the ""koma"", a kind of wooden mould used to shape each brush, adds Tesshu's grandson, Yutaro Takemori. Throughout the process, ""rebellious and mischievous hairs are removed one by one with a sort of metallic blade which, coupled to the index finger, acts as a clamp. This sorting technique differs from those used anywhere else in the world,"" says Tesshu Takenori. These small trade secrets, called ""waza"", make the difference. ""Of course, we know there are protest movements against the use of natural hair, but we do not kill animals specifically to make brushes,"" insists the young Yutaro. According to him, the use of synthetic hairs is not necessarily a solution more environmental-friendly solution, given the required use of chemicals. ""The creation of the nylon tips is now possible but it remains impossible to reproduce the cuticles of natural hairs,"" adds his grandfather Tesshu. ""International make-up artists working with most famous actresses and models, especially those of Paris fashion shows, do really appreciate Kumano's brushes,"" explains Yoko Miyake, who supports local artisans in their development abroad.

The quantum leap of Artcosmetics!,"Premium Beauty News - Artcosmetics was created in 1990! Hence, you will be celebrating its 27th anniversary! Pierfranco Accardo - Indeed our progression was fast, but it mostly increased in the early 2000s. From 2002 onwards, a targeted commercial policy enabled Artcosmetics to become a recognized manufacturer and a new benchmark in the Italian market. Artcosmetics is growing at an amazing pace. Our Company, a third-party make-up manufacturer posted a turnover of 45 million euros in 2015, up 25% over 2014, + 55% in 2016 reaching 70 million - we expect to close the fiscal year with 80 million euros. Tangible growth, thanks also to the expansion of the production capacity: over the years Artcosmetics has opened new sites and today it can rely on 11 production sites in Italy, a sales office in New York and an office in Seoul. Among major projects, the opening of a new factory in order to improve production capacity; a new factory, which will bring the total production area from the current 16,000 m2 square meters to more than 32,000 m2. As for this new factory that will be up and running in 2018, it will allow us to double production, nothing less! The Company's name, Artcosmetics, draws on the primary values of Art, namely, vision, creativity and the ""look beyond"". Premium Beauty News - You owe much of your progression to your R&D Department...

Regarding this latter point, I'd like to highlight Artcosmetics' solid relations with raw materials suppliers. These relationships are indispensable to create cutting edge formulas with quality ingredients. In the same way, true partnerships are established with packaging suppliers, with whom it is possible to materialize ideas for creating new gestures and new delivery systems. No less important is our collaboration with high-level designers for the development of cutting-edge mechanical technologies.

We actually recently opened an office in Seoul, South Korea."
"Asia, an unwavering appetite for conquest","To say the least, this small island, often subjected to clouds and rain, is still directly or indirectly in control of the Asian subcontracting industry. Everyone knows that its inhabitants have shaped and continue to shape the Asian packaging industry and are now increasingly involved in Full Service. The biggest players in mainland China are often Taiwanese natives. For the past several months, a number of Taiwanese manufacturers operating in the sector have also had a tendency to relocate on their island, ""less risky"", they claim. Anyhow, big or small businesses alike, industrial investments are continuing apace. This is the case with Capicolor, a small family owned business with a staff of 80 people created in 1972 and specialized in the manufacturing of eyeliners (5 million per year) but also eyebrow pencils (3 million per year), and for the past two years of eyeshadows. All products considered, the Company sells about 200 million units per year. Main customers: China, followed by Dubai Japan, India and other South-eastern Asian countries, not forgetting Britain and Sweden. The concept of Full Service continues to prevail in Taiwan like elsewhere. As a proof, the exponential growth of the firm Time Source, at first, twenty years ago, a packaging manufacturer for the beauty industry and who progressively but resolutely shifted to a Full Service offer. Fifty people, twenty injection moulding machines, five million dollars in sales, the Taiwanese Company which manufactures make-up compacts but also mascaras, will post this year a 25% growth in sales thanks in particular to its Full Service offer that it intends to further expand by offering more options. The commitment towards investment is the same at Cosmeti (16 million dollars in sales, 70% generated by the U.S. market and the remainder by Europe), another family owned business, specialized in the manufacture of make-up compacts, which employs 70 people and which is about to acquire a second brand new plant (operational by the end of next year) representing a total investment of 3 million dollars, with on top of it, a population of injection machines that will jump from 20 to 35 units. Note that moulds are all manufactured in-house. China, precisely, that will keep on making the headlines in the next few months with its dynamism and the fast creation of news brands accelerating by the week. Among the latest examples to date, the Beukay Group, both a subcontractor and owner of several brands, was created in 1997 by a brother and his sister, Gary Cui and Masa Cui, behind the creation, among others, of the brand Marie Dalgar, a big hit not only in China but also in the whole Asian continent, and which aims to conquer the rest of the world. A brand whose growth has been close to 60% over three years. A brand specialized in make-up products with a development based on traditional circuits but also (and thoroughly) on e-commerce with a team of nearly a hundred people fully dedicated daily to the job. A well-oiled sales and marketing strategy that leaves nothing to chance, combining both a presence on the ground, one-day promotional actions in malls, and trendy events. The main strike force of the Beukay Group both a subcontractor and brand creator: its three production sites spread over more than 25,000 m² of buildings and employing more than an thousand people, three R&D centres based in Shanghai, Tokyo and Paris. Main assets of the Group, its two leaders, Gary Cui and more particularly Masa Cui. ""Coming from a non cosmetic background, reads the Company's presentation folder, there were many ups and down in the beginning of Masa. But her dedication towards the brands development, unique sense of vision, and her passion towards beauty make Marie Dalgar what it is today. Through constant innovation, artistic concept and the integration of inspiration, she has committed to build the brand into a top-notch artistic make-up brand in China"". Japan: the pioneering spirit of Nippon Shikizai The news had made the headlines a few weeks ago: The Japanese Group Nippon Shikizai announced the acquisition of the French Company Orleans Cosmetics, specializing mainly in the production of make-up powders. A Japanese Group created in 1957, with a staff of more than 750 people, whose turnover increased by 60% in three years and who had already bought in France, in 2000 the Thepenier Pharma Industrie Company. A group that can boast today an annual production capacity of more than 3,600 tonnes of liquid formulas, over 2,000 tonnes of pasty products, 350 tonnes of powders and 30 tonnes of hot-poured products. The Group is showing its commitment to growth in Europe but also in the United States and China."
"Dominique, a Maison de Beauté with real French inspirations in Brazil","Olivia Camplez used to work in Paris in the field of e-commerce (Apple, Pixmania), but four years ago, her dreams of remote places randomly drove her to São Paulo, Brazil. She decided to settle there, even though she did not speak Portuguese. She quickly met with local start-ups and gradually got used to her new Paulista life. But one thing was missing: a choice of high-end, niche cosmetics and skincare products. In just a few days, she got the idea of opening a concept store dedicated to this world: her own Maison de Beauté. Once she had set up her business plan, found funding sources, chosen the brands and products she wanted to be referenced, as well as the store location, moved in, and taken care of customs barrier administrative issues, among others, Dominique - Maison de Beauté opened at last, on a late November day in 2016. Designed by the Centdegrés agency as a Parisian Haussmanian flat, the place is welcoming and unusual. Dermatologist Joëlle Ciocco provides professional treatments in the beauty salon area, and about twenty brands are offered in the store area: they were all chosen with great care according to ethical criteria, and with a holistic rather than exclusively cosmetic vision of beauty and wellness. Treatments for the face (By Terry, Diptyque, Joëlle Ciocco), body (Uka), and hair (Christophe Robin, Rahua), makeup products (Ilia, RMS Beauty), and perfumes (Terry de Ginsburg) complete the offering of candles (Cire Trudon, Diptyque), pillows, accessories, and tea (Kusmi Tea). ""I wanted a concept that would embody beauty's paradise, a place where customers would feel at home and warmly welcomed and advised to find everything that would contribute to their own wellness. I wanted to develop the notion of shopping experience,"" Olivia explains. The concept has no equivalent in Brazil, which makes it attractive: it became a success in just a few months. ""In Brazil, women love novelty and originality. In addition, even in times of crisis, they actually find refuge in beauty,"" the creator has observed. ""There is also quite a new phenomenon. In this country fond of plastic surgery, skincare lags behind other segments. And yet, today's women, our 30 to 60-year-old customers, most of whom regularly travel, are increasingly more receptive to naturalness, organic products, and ethics. They no longer need to get immediate results, they act consciously, and they have this notion of time and product and use quality,"" she adds. Given the first results and thanks to her main investor Galeries Lafayette, Olivia intends to keep growing. She will organize several pop-up stores before the end of the year in Brasilia and Rio and also plans to open other shops in Mexico and Colombia. As for products, new brands from all continents will soon be referenced, in particular perfume brands. The idea is to launch six new ones per year, and maybe a private label as well."
Pascual Cosmétiques: a thriving subcontractor,"Simon Pascual, the company's General Manager, has invested 12 million euros in the acquisition and fitting-out of a 20,000 m2 plant, including 5,000 m2 dedicated to the Pascual Cosmétiques activity (compared to 1,900 m2 for the former site), with a much larger R&D laboratory, a production area well-proportioned to integrate several new lines, and a storage area with a total capacity of 1,800 palettes. The 15,000 m2 remaining are rented to other companies. As soon as late August 2017, the subcontractor will inaugurate a new lipstick line with flexible moulds on this site, for a new production capacity of 1.8 million items per month, compared to 1 million right now. In the course of the year, a filling line for flexible tubes will complete the production tool. Pascual Cosmétiques mainly develops, manufactures and conditions makeup products – lipsticks, blushes, eye shadows, blushers, nail varnish, and creams in jars – except for powders and pencils. The company works for many major French and global brands. Their turnover has increased threefold over the past three years (4.8 million euros in 2016, compared to 1.6 million in 2014), and the management has banked on a 25 to 35% growth in 2017. To keep up with this growth, beyond their investments in new premises and equipment, Pascual Cosmétiques is about to proceed to new recruitments, both for production and technical positions, in particular in R&D, or reps functions. In the long run, the company does not exclude carrying out an external growth operation, in France or abroad, preferably with a player equipped with a powder division. In addition, the company will showcase their latest innovations at the MakeUp in Paris show, which will be held at the Carrousel du Louvre in Paris on June 22-23, 2017. It will be an opportunity to discover Cream to Powder Lips, a lipstick whose creamy texture when it is applied on the skin instantaneously turns into a silky powder to lay down a light coloured touch on the lips, without any material sensation. In fact, this innovation was selected by the MakeUp in Paris innovation jury to be part of the Innovation Tree, where the best innovations developed by the show's exhibitors are showcased every year. Also on the agenda, Color Illusion Lipstick, a range with ultra-modern colours that slide on the lips to create a soft, satin-like film with clearly wiser colours, from tender pink to intense plum. Now, that is a company to keep an eye on!"
Natura aims to become a global cosmetics leader,"Acquired by L'Oréal in 2006, The Body Shop is a British brand of nature-inspired cosmetic products. Founded in 1976 by Anita Roddick in Brighton, England, The Body Shop has expanded into a global leader in natural beauty, with the deep-rooted belief that business can be ethical and sustainable. The Body Shop is now present in more than 60 countries around the world, through various distribution channels including more than 3,000 point of sales (130 in Brazil) and e-commerce. In 2016, it generated retail sales of around 1.5 billion euros and net sales of 921 million euros. ""Natura is the best new owner we could imagine to nurture the brand DNA around naturality and ethics,"" said Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman & CEO of L'Oréal. Indeed, the values of Natura Cosméticos - which offers products made from natural ingredients, in particular Amazonian nuts or berries sustainable and ethically sourced from communities - are very close to those of The Body Shop. ""Natura and The Body Shop have always followed parallel paths that are now converging,"" said Guilherme Leal, co-chairman of Natura Cosméticos' board of directors of. However, as far as their geographical presence and distribution channels are concerned, the two companies are very different. The Body Shop is present in more than 60 countries around the world, mainly in Europe, Asia, North America and the Middle East, but its footprint in South America (Brazil and Chile) is quite smaller (2% of the global turnover). The Natura brand, on the other hand, is mainly present in Brazil and in South America. The Brazilian company, which initiated its international development in 2013 with the acquisition of Aesop, finds in the acquisition of The Body Shop the opportunity to dramatically accelerate its global growth. Furthermore, the acquisition of The Body Shop will help Natura to accelerate the diversification of its distribution channels while offering the opportunity to expand the presence of the British brand in Brazil through its network of 1.3 million consultants. The proposed transaction will be submitted to L'Oréal's employee representative body and is subject to regulatory approval notably in Brazil and in the United States. According to L'Oréal, the proposed transaction is expected to close during 2017."
Ancorotti Cosmetics: Targeting 100 million euros in 2017,"The production of mascaras remains the main propeller of the company's development, while leaving room for other emerging makeup products as well. The Italian firm is now present in all the niches of the makeup sector. ""Our emphasis is now on foundations, lipsticks and extruded powders. Several machines were purchased for this"" announces Mr Ancorotti. The company has further increased its fleet of back injection machines by bringing it to 23 units. ""We are undoubtedly the first in the world to own so many machines of this type"" he claims. In the meantime, the company has carried out the purchase of an industrial unit next to the already owned buildings. This site truly represents industrial archaeology: it was created in 1969 by the well-known architect Zanuso, with the collaboration of Renzo Piano, for Olivetti, the famous typewriter manufacturer. Ancorotti Cosmetics has decided to renovate these 30000 sqm building to restore its prestige and image. The works will last for about a year and a half. Moreover, the figures concerning employment are indicative of Ancorotti Cosmetics' continuous growth: 372 people are employed, with a majority of women. Women represent 65% of the employees. In 2016, 90 temporary contracts were confirmed and, this year, another 40 people have been employed. These numbers speak for themselves. ""Moreover, the company is very young: the average age is 36 and the employees come from 15 different countries, with the objective of becoming an even younger and more culturally and ethnically diverse company,"" Mr Ancorotti says. The export business represents more than 80% of the total sales volume. Ancorotti Cosmetics' focus for 2017 will be on the US market, which will continue to grow in 2018 and be a driving force in the beauty industry, in particular thanks to the engaging social media communication of US colour cosmetic brands. In this context, Ancorotti Cosmetics' main goal is to continue to provide fresh and innovative ideas, inspiring major companies and offering creative products. The company will thus present its latest innovations at the Make Up in Paris event (June 22-23, 2017). ""The whole company works on the preparation of this participation. The makeup trends deepened for this 2017 edition are a tale of two extremes: classy and elegant colours (porcelain skin, flushed cheeks and striking eyes plus full, outstanding lips) or high amounts of glitters, metallic hues and shine, with textures reminding of desert sand and broken glass. All this, with a great attention to the vegan concept and to the quality of the ingredients used."""
"The Germany make-up industry, more than ever at the top!","A dynamism embodied by one of the jewels of the German industry, Schwan Cosmetics (3,200 employees) whose sales have increased significantly in the 2015/2016 fiscal year, rising by 14.3% to 364.3 million euros including more than 174 million for sharpenable pencils, more than 112 million for mechanical pencils, 62 millions for liquid liners and more than 17 million for mascaras and other products. Investments amounted to more than 30 million euros and were made predominantly in the development of new products and in increasing capacity in Germany and abroad. ""More than half a billion consumers require an enormous product range, particularly as their requirements are becoming more and more individual. Our aim is to create the perfect products for every woman in the world,"" said the Managing Director Dr. Jörg Karas. Schwan Cosmetics is represented by ten subsidiaries across four continents (Germany, Czech Republic, China, Indonesia, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and the United States). A year after opening the Centre of Excellence in Murfreesboro, Tennessee (USA), Schwan Cosmetics can see positive first results: Production has got off to a good start and the integration of the new employees has been completed. The strategy of opening local production sites in the markets is also paying off in Central and South America. After expanding their Mexico site, the Colombia site was in turn expanded. As for the current year, digital will be the hallmark of the year for the German company. Bernd Preuschoff, Schwan Cosmetics' new Vice President Digital Transformation, will launch discussions in a keynote at the round table on Beauty in the Digital era, at the next MakeUp in Paris. For Bernd Preuschoff, ""digital change is on the way. For companies, it is essential to identify these changes and seize new opportunities for innovation."" Recently, Schwan Cosmetics also launched the ""Schwan Digital Studio"": This unit is central to all themes related to digital transformation in the company; its role will be to collect new ideas, test them and bring them to market quickly. To deliver a quality digital experience, according to Bernd Preuschoff, digital technology must not only inspire the user, it must most of all satisfy its needs and solve its problems while generating a ""wow effect"". At the MakeUp in Paris trade show, Bernd Preuschoff will explain why the use of digital, to inspire the consumer in the field of beauty, is not going far enough. Indeed, other industries that have been considerably ""shaken"" by the digital wave have had to acknowledge that users expect most of all, solutions meeting their needs. Hence if cosmetic companies focus not only on inspiration but on the user's experience, they will also have to prepare themselves to deal with ""digital perturbations"". Mascara, the ""flagship"" product! The Rusi company another player based in the Nuremberg region is just as dynamic; the Company employs 180 people with EUR20 million in sales, i.e., an increase of more than 8% in 2016 compared to the previous year. Its owner and CEO, Klaus Sindel, has every reason of being satisfied. Specialized in the manufacture of mascaras but also lipgloss and eyeliners, the Company after having invested half a million euros in 2016 in its production tool, plans to buy five more injection machines in the twelve months to come, that is an increase in production of about 20%... ""Being fully autonomous and integrated at the manufacturing level is indeed a strong commitment of the company,"" saidKlaus Sindel. A few kilometres from there, at Geka, which belongs since last year to the Swiss Group, Sulzer, the finding is the same! The factory in Bechhofen will soon be too small. ""This merger will result in the creation of a major player in the field of precision plastic injection,"" stated a few months ago its CEO, Amaury de Mentière. ""We must now finalize our integration within the APS Division and make use of industrial and development synergies. Mixpac which is also part of the APS Division is known for its mastery in the management of fluids and mixers. We could certainly use this expertise in the area of make-up and other cosmetics. We are working on it. We also plan to expand our Bechoffen plant and works are expected to begin later this year."" In addition, Geka has further expanded its Brazil plant and could successfully launch the first local products. Geka has introduced a number of new products such as the pureSENSATION 2K brush, the softSECRET Sandwich brush or the LASH STAR Supernova Mascara with the patented multi-benefit brush, just to name a few... Upper north, between Bonn and Cologne, in the small town of Niederkassel next to the Rhine River, the 100% family owned Company, United Brands Marketing GmbH (UBM). The classic German family Company headed by David J. Kohen (CEO USA) and his wife Ivonne K. Kohen (CEO Europe), remains a model of its kind. With its 60 people from 28 different nations and nearly EUR12 million in sales expected in 2017 - mainly specialized in the manufacturing of liquid eyeliner ink pens and dip liners – including all the plastic parts manufactured in house -, time is more than ever for expansion, investments and diversification. Over the past few months, UBM have invested the hefty amount of 3.2 million euros only in their headquarters in Germany in the acquisition of eight injection machines, six fully automatic pen assembly machines and six hot stamp printing machines – and the first robotic fully automatic subunit packing machine. The company also set up its United States subsidiary United Brands Manufacturing Inc. beginning of 2016. A new show room will be opened around June 2017 in New York Manhattan because of the massive growing number of US clients and multinationals. The first US factory with 2.000 m² production space is planned for the year 2019 in the State of New Jersey – exactly the same products but Made in USA. ""We are certainly the only manufacturer in the world offering so many models, designs and different sizes of Liquid Ink Liner Pens in every major market segment – mass, middle and luxury premium. We offer pens in 4 different diameters (8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm and 16 mm), jumbo size; all products are available also with PBT brush nibs,"" explained David J. Kohen, owner and CEO. And there is more to come! The firm, which already launched in March 2017 the new Dip Liner product line, is now about to launch in the fourth quarter of 2017 a new range of mechanical / retractable wax lead pencils. The next planned step end in 2018 is to enter the niche of mascaras. ""We are fortunate to own over 45.000 m² of land for further expansion around our existing 3 factory buildings,"" said David J. Kohen. As a consequence, he has already planned the construction of a new 10.800 m² new modern GMP building on two levels for the end of 2018 next to the existing factories. As for the number of new products and innovations that regularly emerge from the Company's Product Development Department, they are galore... As for Faber Castell Cosmetics, at the headquarters of the German group in Stein near Nuremberg, smiles are on all faces. Out of a total staff of over 7,500 people worldwide, nearly 800 of them are part of the Cosmetic business unit. A Division that posted excellent results last year with double-digit sales growth. ""Step by step,"" recently explained the Managing Director Christina Zech, ""we adjust our textures to be able to produce them similarly on all our production sites, thus providing us and our customers a high level of flexibility. On the whole, we strive to increase our global reach and to be closer to our customers. In addition, we are working on an extension of our packaging offer, with innovative formulas specially developed for each format; this is as you know, one of our key competences. Our international customers can be sure to find at a 'one-stop shop': high quality products, convenience and safety where we stand behind with our reputation."" Concerning products, the company highlights its Slim Plastic line MAGNETIC, ""the perfect pencil for super long-lasting eye- and lip-formulations."" It can easily be customized in any colour and is now available with shiny, matte, pearly and metallic finish. ""We developed extraordinary formulations and a striking colour range that varies from classic to electric, matte to metallic. Its gel-like consistency makes it glide-on like a dream then sets to a super lasting finish,"" she adds. During MakeUp in Paris this year, Faber Castell Cosmetics is going to showcase ""an extraordinary full colour, wet shine lipstick texture that is super creamy and buttery and thanks to our Jumbo-sized pencil a mess-free and controlled application is a breeze."" Eventually, for Faber Castell Cosmetics, liquid eyeliners are one of the main drivers in the cosmetics world. ""We offer Slim and Chubby Liquid liners with a variety of different tips for different styles. At Cosmopack Bologna we presented two new tips: PEEK-A-BOO eye styler has a paddle tip with integrated peek that provides a double-flow passage around the central opening ensuring a continuous, extraordinary saturated line. And, CANDY BEAD lip tint has a bubble-shaped tip with cushion feel. It glides on easily with a smooth touch and provides a soft and saturated line. We presented it with a 10h lasting liptint but of course, you can also have it in an eyeliner format."""
MS swiss cosmetics gains momentum,"One year after its arrival on the market and after the kick-start of its first production batches in October 2016, the new-comer continues to consolidate its assets to seduce the ultra-premium cosmetics brands. The company already operates brand-new and state-of-the-art and OTCs-compliant production facilities. For instance, MS swiss cosmetics has ""clean rooms"" to produce cosmetic cares in optimal hygiene and safety conditions and in total match with the European, Asian and American regulations. As soon as they are delivered, the raw materials are checked in a dedicated space, that is equipped with a laminar flow. A WHM (Ware House Management) system manages 6,000 pallet locations in FIFO / FEFO mode. The whole facility has been conceived to control the flows - air, materials - and to avoid any risk of cross contamination. Within the installations, the manufacturing rooms have the latest generation equipment according to the type of formulas to be manufactured: emulsions, lotions, etc. In particular, MS swiss cosmetics is equipped with full airless production tanks, a process that allows to ensure a better preservation of the final product as well as the highest emulsion quality, free from air bubbles. A specific equipment is dedicated to the filling of flexible tubes, bottles and jars, airless & full-airless bottles, and the manufacturing of single use masks. MS swiss cosmetics carries out bulk production and filling services, as well as quality checks and certifications in compliance with regulatory prescriptions and customers requirements. MS has embedded the ISO 9001, ISO 22716, OHSAS 18001-2007 standards in its Quality Management System. An integrated organoleptic and physic-chemical analysis laboratory facilitates the control operations throughout the production process. Microbiological analyses are outsourced to an ISO 17025 accredited laboratory. The Swiss-quality of the products is also linked to the quality of the water used in the production site. ""The products benefit from the exceptional location of the facility, which is dominated by the Dent de Lys, where the Veveyse-de-Châtel river takes its origin. As a major component of cosmetics care, the water that is supplied to the plant is of a very high quality level at the very outset. It is then purified by reverse osmosis system before being distributed in the clean rooms,"" claims MS swiss cosmetics. Starting in the summer of 2017, MS will run an in-house R & D laboratory. The formulas, which were previously developed by Strand Cosmetics Europe in Lyon, will be designed in the Swiss facility. Thanks to MS swiss cosmetics production and R&D capabilities, customers can benefit from the 'Swiss made' label, the of which requirements were made tougher at the beginning of January 2017 [1]. Besides designing, manufacturing and packaging of formulas, MS swiss cosmetics offers complementary services for the design and manufacture of rigid boxes and of co-packing. Indeed, the company benefits from its proximity with Marvinpac, whose operations of design and manufacture of rigid boxes and co-packing are historically dedicated to a prestigious brand, extends now to the whole world of luxury. Concern for quality finds its parallel in a marked concern for the environment. The building has been designed to limit its environmental footprint: the rooftop is covered by solar panels, temperature controlled via 18 geothermal probes, 80% recycled air, waste management, etc. With this wide range of assets, MS swiss cosmetics has the ambition to become the reference of Swiss cosmetic formulation serving national and international premium cosmetics brands."

Unique, quality events, unlike no others, that focus on efficient contacts and business opportunities within a very short period of time, by offering professionals all inclusive services to allow them to only concentrate on what matters most: their products, clients and suppliers. The whole of it, with an optimal budgetary envelope. Allow me to recall some figures concerning the shows: Luxe Pack Monaco hosts 480 exhibitors and is attended by 8,600 visitors, at Luxe Pack New York, there are 250 exhibitors and 3,700 visitors, while at Luxe Pack Shanghai there are 200 exhibitors and 4,000 visitors. As for the MakeUp In trade shows they bring together more than 500 exhibitors and more than 10,000 visitors each year. Figures speak for themselves! Premium Beauty News - You mean complementarity and synergy while respecting the personalities of each partner? This is the case in Europe and on the east coast of the United States... Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Absolutely! It makes no doubt that MakeUp in Paris, which takes place every year in June at the Carrousel du Louvre, has become a must, just like Luxe Pack in Monaco in October. A perfect geographic, strategic and temporal complementarity. MakeUp in New York, which takes place each year in September and Luxe Pack New York in May, have the same positioning; both of them have succeeded in making a name for themselves in the United States by offering exactly what U.S. professionals are looking for. But the world of make-up and luxury packaging is not confined to the European continent and the U.S. east coast. The success met by the first two editions of MakeUp in Los Angeles is the best proof. There are indeed two countries in the United States that complement one another. Similarly, the successes of MakeUp in Asia in Seoul and of Luxe Pack in Shanghai perfectly demonstrate the economic and cultural variety of a region with fast changing demographics. Premium Beauty News - Rumours circulating were correct, you can now confirm for 2018, the creation of the first Luxe Pack Los Angeles concomitantly to MakeUp in Los Angeles and of the first MakeUp in Action in Shanghai alongside Luxe Pack Shanghai? Nathalie Grosdidier - Actually our strategy in Asia is quite simple! MakeUp in Asia in Seoul, which was literally acclaimed this year by visitors and exhibitors, proved its efficiency and popularity and will remain in Seoul next end of April 2018. And to meet the needs of many companies wishing to extend the ""MakeUp In"" concept to China, they will also be delighted with the first edition of a MakeUp in Action in Shanghai alongside Luxe Pack Shanghai, early April. As for the United States, the winning momentum generated by MakeUp in Los Angeles will fully serve the first edition of Luxe Pack Los Angeles at the beginning of next year. In both cases, be it in Asia or in the United States, exhibitors in the luxury and beauty industry will take advantage of the efficiency, complementarity and richness of contacts. Premium Beauty News - MakeUp in Paris will open its doors in a few days. How are the prospects looking? Sandra Maguarian - They are excellent, of course! About 160 exhibitors and some 3,000 visitors expect... A new edition more than ever dedicated to innovation and digital. The unavoidable appointment of the global make-up and skincare industry. Premium Beauty News - And Luxe Pack Monaco next fall? Nathalie Grosdidier - More than ever unique! This global showcase of creative packaging has many surprises in store for visitors with many launches and innovations to discover at the stands. Like last year, a specific programme will be dedicated to digital with again the C2L-Connect to Luxury, a show within the show. There will also be a focus on arts and crafts related to packaging, sustainable development of course,with the Luxe Pack in green award and many more highlights that help put forward the tremendous innovation potential of the entire industry and seize emerging trends. Without forgetting conviviality as always, especially since we will be celebrating the 30th edition. Premium Beauty News - A few words on this new edition of Luxe Pack New York that just closed its doors... Nathalie Grosdidier - This fifteenth edition was marked by interactivity and a lot of visitors appreciated the various animations offered such as the Turbo Talks, the Creativity Workshop, the Innovations Wall, and the Seminars. Not to mention the conference programme that brought together more than 1,000 people over the 2 days. A new record!"
Scentys targets the general public with two new innovations,"Premium Beauty News - You created Scentys 13 years ago, based on an innovative concept: the principle of capsules containing small pearls of pure perfume concentrate placed in front of an air flow. This way, the perfume diffuses thanks to the evaporation of the concentrate for a natural, absolutely faithful olfactory reproduction. How have you managed to develop, since then? David Suissa - Scentys is actually an expert in the air diffusion of very high quality perfume now. We have become experts in technical solutions and optimum safety of use. Today, we are among the best as regards this technology, and we have always been firmly established on the fine fragrance segment. Our first customers were perfume brands, creation houses like Givaudan or IFF, or distributors, but we gradually managed to reach several other industries, in particular transport, like the car industry. Over the past six months, we have worked in collaboration with Peugeot and Valeo, so that all 3008 and 5008 standard models are now fitted with our capsules to perfume car passenger cells. Premium Beauty News - What are your latest innovations? David Suissa - We have just launched a new solution to make people discover perfumes in points of sale: Fine Touch. It is a system based on our perfume pearl technology, which is placed in the particular configuration of an elegant object. It combines several advantages, like reducing the constraints related to spray testers, offering a new, original gesture to consumers, and providing a faithful, qualitative perfume experience without the 'alcohol' effect. Premium Beauty News - Does that mean the general public will experience the Scentys technology for the first time? David Suissa - Some of them have already done so. A year ago, we developed a home diffuser called Prysme. It was initially designed for professionals, but we received many requests from private individuals, so it is now available in Darty stores and on Amazon. It is a first step for us in terms of home perfume diffusion. There will be others, but we are really happy with the feedback we got for this product. Talking about the general public, we are launching a new product designed for car passenger cells: Capsy. The idea is to provide an absolutely safe solution to a rising demand for cars, with good quality perfumes stable over time. The object in which the solid perfume capsule is introduced is clipped on the ventilation grid of the vehicle. The device may be opened or closed with a protective cover, so users can enjoy a perfume function upon request. It costs 19.90 euros. Two perfume capsules developed by creation houses are available for now, for 12 euros, and they both last about 50 hours. Premium Beauty News - What are your results and prospects? David Suissa - We are a 100% French company with about twenty employees, and we grew by 41% in 2016, compared to 2015. 2017 should be just as successful. As regards our products, our prospects clearly involve working on innovations to pave the way for new perfume applications. Now, as far as business is concerned, our export turnover for Asia, South America, and Europe represents 30%. So, we aim to find new sources of growth abroad to further strengthen our global presence."
Birchbox bases its growth strategy on data,"Birchbox, which operates in six countries (United States, France, Belgium, UK, Ireland and Spain), has opened its first brick-and-mortar boutique in France, the second in the world after New York, opened in 2014. The first consequence of the opening of this new point of sale is the entry of prestige beauty brands with distribution contracts requiring at least one brick-and-mortar shop for the distribution of their products. Thus, leading beauty brands such as Clarins, Clinique, Bobbi Brown and Bumble & Bumble have joined the Birchbox catalogue in France. However, according to Philippe Pinatel, President and COO at Birchbox, the first goal of this new store is to strengthen ties with customers. ""Our goal is not to boost customer recruitment but to increase the engagement of our community,"" he said. ""That's why we opened a studio upstairs the store and which will allow us to organize events for our members."" Logically, the next development step will be the opening of a first brick-and-mortar shop in the UK rather than the opening of another point-of-sale in France. In-depth consumer knowledge and optimal customization of the offer are a corner-stone of the company's growth strategy. ""For a brick-and-mortar retailer, in-store traffic is the most important figure, but it is a very impersonal data. On the contrary, e-retailers gather a lot of data. We even developed several algorithms to exploit that and to better meet the expectations of our customers,"" adds Philippe Pinatel. Actually, Birchbox must manage 50 different boxes in France and 150 in the United States, and must be careful not to put twice the same product in a box. The company thus developed a series of interpretation models to better anticipate the expectations of its clients and to customize the visit of its e-shop. "" Algorithms are at the heart of our business. In this context, the brick-and-mortar shop allows us to diversify the data we collect."""
"""Virtual makeup is also a tool for detecting emerging trends,"" Sylvain Delteil, Perfect Corp.","Premium Beauty News - The world of virtual reality make-up apps is increasingly concentrated around a limited number of players. Sylvain Delteil - Indeed, the time when each brand was considering the opportunity to develop its own application is over. On the one hand, no one can download a different app for each brand on its smartphone and, on the other hand, brands aim to address as many consumers as possible, not only their fans. Today, only a few applications have been successful to aggregate a significant number of users worldwide. YouCam apps have passed the 400 million downloads mark worldwide, thus becoming one of market leaders with Meitu, which is very strong in China but has little presence outside of this market. Premium Beauty News - How do you explain the success of YouCam apps? Sylvain Delteil - The main reason is the quality of the results achieved through our virtual reality makeup technology and the variety of options available in the apps. We are constantly working to improve the virtual make-up quality. Furthermore, our suite of applications (YouCam Makeup, YouCam Perfect, YouCam Fun, YouCam Nails and Beauty Circle) is very consistent. It is a very complete ecosystem designed to allow a comprehensive journey in the beauty world, from discovery to purchase, through sharing and exchange ... Our CEO, Alice H. Chang, has a true vision of women's needs. She puts technology at the service of these needs rather than trying to push technologies... YouCam apps are not just an engineering creation, but a consistent set designed to fit the needs of users. That is why, for example, the app offers monthly looks corresponding to astral signs. This service generates a considerable number of connections to the app! Premium Beauty News - What types of partnerships do you offer to brands? Sylvain Delteil - It's custom made. Each brand has its own very specific needs and expectations. Furthermore, these needs may vary from one country to another, depending on whether the brand operates its own e-shop or not. We offer brands the opportunity to put their products forward. Eventually, the users can be directed to an online boutique. We record high visitation rates of e-shops linked to the app, even without ads. However, we do not calculate conversion rates because we do not have our own shop. Premium Beauty News - How do you make money? Sylvain Delteil - We charge the brands according to the number of products they make available to users on the apps. This is also a good means to avoid that unnecessary products be uploaded in our databases. Interested brands can also invest in advertising, to give even more visibility to their products. Premium Beauty News - Do you also work with retailers? Sylvain Delteil - Retailers are showing a growing interest in our services. Initially, some of them were suspicious that our applications could be their competitors. Now, everybody agrees apps and brick-and-mortar shops are all very complementary. Applications can be used to attract consumers in shops for personalized and one-to-one counselling, promotional campaigns, and more. Also, there are mixed cases of brand-distributor partnerships. Some brands do not refer to their own e-shop but to a retailer. Tablets that only offer products of a given brand can be made available to users inside a retail outlet. It is an effective way for engaging a conversation with the consumer. And we can do a lot of testing, which is impossible with just one product. Premium Beauty News - It's also a huge source of information. Data collection is at the heart of your model. Sylvain Delteil - Analytical feedbacks are very much appreciated by our partners. We own a tremendous amount of information available. For a country like Italy, for instance, there are several tens of thousands of uses per day for a brand. And there are more and more comments on the products. The brands on the app have access to a portal providing real time information, and for the last six months, on how users use the products available on the application. We can see which products are tested, which ones are used to create a look, and which ones have been saved. It is a dynamic interface that makes it possible to produce statistical representations by product types and by colours. Brands can also ask us to search for specific data (deep dive). Premium Beauty News - A huge amount of data is available through your apps, but are they really illustrative of the market? Sylvain Delteil - It all depends on the brands and their customers. Indeed, 80% of our audience is under 34 years of age. However, the data we collect are based on large volumes, even if they are very focused on millennials ... Many brands consider that our data allow to identify trends, as well as weak signals from emerging trends... And this will allow them to make decisions almost instantaneously without having to wait for the quarterly figures. Premium Beauty News - What are your next development prospects? Sylvain Delteil - We continue to develop the functionalities of our applications. We recently launched live cast sessions in the United States, which allowed us to offer online live events, such as tutorials, events with brand ambassadors, makeup artists, etc. We also strive to refine our offer by working on skin textures, beyond skin tone, in order to be able to suggest skin treatments. It is more complex than makeup but it is a major development avenue..."
Kiko Milano celebrates 20 years and adds Brazil to its global expansion strategy,"Known internationally for its masstige approach to makeup products, the fast-fashion beauty brand unveils a portfolio of over than 1,200 items, mostly manufactured in Europe. In an exclusive interview with Premium Beauty News, Kiko Milano's brand director in Brazil, Isabel de Almeida, talks about the brand's plans and the operational challenges it has faced to establish itself in such a vast and diverse country. Premium Beauty News - What is Kiko Milano's total investment in Brazil and what is the strategic importance of the country to fuel the brand's global expansion? Isabel de Almeida - Kiko Milano will invest a total of € 5 million in the opening of the seven stores in São Paulo. Brazil has been the brand's target since its founding two decades ago, when CEO Stefano Percassi was charmed by the country. As part of our global expansion, we have entered strategic markets, such as the UAE, India, Qatar and Russia. Brazil is the largest economy in Latin America and, therefore, is of critical importance in the development of the brand. Premium Beauty News - What were the challenges in establishing the company in Brazil? Isabel de Almeida - Our original plan was to launch in Brazil in 2016, but we had some legal setbacks during the import process, which eventually delayed the project by a year. At the moment, our greatest challenge is to develop the brand in such a vast country with so many unique features. This has urged the company to reorganize itself locally in order to reach its goals. Premium Beauty News - How does the brand plan to deal with Brazil's huge diversity? Will the stores follow the same style and layout? Isabel de Almeida – The brand's global concept and vision will remain consistent, but we will need to adapt the layout of the stores to the local processes and inventory. We decided to use São Paulo as a starting point so we can accommodate to local market demands before we move on to other states. Premium Beauty News - Who is Kiko Milano's target audience in Brazil? Isabel de Almeida - The brand caters to all age groups, but there is greater demand from women aged 15 to 35. Generally speaking, our target consumers are urban, fashion-oriented and on top of the latest trends. Premium Beauty News - Will the Brazilian operation have its own marketing and communication strategies? Does Kiko have plans to launch an eCommerce platform in Brazil in the near future? Isabel de Almeida - Our strategy will be adapted to the local reality without compromising the global identity. This differentiation will become more evident in the medium term as the Brazilian market evolves and presents specific demands. The online channel will not be launched immediately, but it is in our future plans. Premium Beauty News - What competitive advantages does Kiko Milano offer to tackle competition from other Brazilian players? Isabel de Almeida - We are releasing most of our existing product ranges in Brazil, including 35 different shades of foundation. We expect to launch seven collections per year and introduce new products monthly. Premium Beauty News - What global makeup trends are likely to have a good response from Brazilian consumers? Isabel de Almeida - Dark lipstick shades, including blue and black, are a worldwide trend and are also popular in Brazil. Brazilian shoppers keep up with the latest trends, do their research before buying and are open to product recommendations. Premium Beauty News - Kiko has a list of ingredients that are no longer used in its formulations. Are there any other raw materials that will be banned in Brazil? Isabel de Almeida – All Kiko products adhere to the strictest security protocols both in the short and long run. In addition, we have created a list of ingredients that are prohibited for use in our formulations. Despite being permitted by local regulations in some countries, they are not considered acceptable by the brand. As an example, our products have been formulated without the use of parabens since 2014. Premium Beauty News - Kiko is known for its affordable prices. What allows you to offer and maintain the current price point? Isabel de Almeida - Some product ranges are very price-competitive, but most products will be positioned as medium-priced as they are subject to import duties. Although the margins applied are lower than those in Europe, the tax burden will have an impact on pricing."
Digital tools are transforming Marionnaud's business,"Since July 2015, all Marionnaud France stores have been equipped with one or more tablets. This deployment is part of the different digital transformation initiated by the retailer a few years ago. Yet, the launch of the ""Code Beauté"" [1] in April 2015 enabled the brand to be among the first beauty retailers to place data at the heart of its customer relationship. Since the launch, more than 700,000 ""Codes Beauté"" have been produced and have served to feed the company's databases. Aggregated to information coming from the company's website and online shop, or collected during purchases, and to the analysis of e-mails behaviours, and to the information linked to loyalty cards, these data helped to build a more targeted offer, with products tailored to each store's clientele, and personalized to each customer's profile. At the global level, A.S. Watson is also investing in new tools that would allow an ever more integrated management of these data. Today, a customer entering a Marionnaud store and taken in charge by a shop assistant with her tablet can be instantly identified with her loyalty card. Thus, personalized treatment can then be offered to her throughout her visit, including the mobile payment of purchases. For clients less interested in advices from store consultants and looking for a more independent purchasing experience, the retailer has strengthened digital in-store services: free broadband wifi in all its stores, free Click & Collect servie, skin diagnosis, etc. Besides customer relationship, digitization also concerns the company's entire operations, for instance for stock management. In the event of stock shortage, tablets provide store consultants with information on the nearest store where the stock is available. Marionnaud France - along with other retail chains from the A.S. Watson group, such as ICI Paris XL in the Netherlands and The Perfume Shop in the UK - selected the digital merchandising solution developed by JDA Software. Once again, digital tools allowed an increased customisation of the offer in order to better fit with the particularities of each point of sale including customer expectations and physical constraints and merchandising agreements negotiated with brands. Each time a new perfume or skincare reference is launched, store managers receive updated plans. Eventually, the new merchandising tool led to a better store presentation, improved conformity scores, and significant efficiency gains in product handling. It also allowed the retailer and the brands to get access to more factual data."
Tradeshows: MakeUp in and Luxe Pack announce partnership,"""This merger with the Infopro Digital Group offers a synergy between the Luxe Pack and MakeUp In trade shows, which will enable to extend the footprint of these events internationally in several countries wishing to host them,"" explain Sandra Maguarian and Jean-Yves Bourgeois, who co-founded Beauteam in 2008, together with Vincent Gallon. This acquisition enables Infopro Digital to expand its events portfolio in the cosmetics sector while it will help Beauteam to consolidate the past pace development of MakeUp in events in outside Europe, in particular in Asia and Brazil. The ""MakeUp in"" events gather suppliers and subcontractors of the makeup and skincare industry, including packaging and application tools makers, formulators and raw material companies. Every two months, the shows welcome between 2,000 and 3,000 professional visitors from the main makeup and beauty brands around the world. Infopro Digital has developed several BtoB trade shows in the luxury and packaging sectors, such as Luxe Pack Monaco, Luxe Pack New York, Luxe Pack Shanghai and Pack & Gift. The two companies say they share common values, which brought them together: ""quality and passion for beauty and luxury along with the desire to organize high quality events where leaders and decision makers from Marketing, R&D and Purchasing Departments meet with a desire to put business first."" ""We are delighted with this merger,"" said Christophe Czajka, Executive Chairman and founder of Digital Infopro, ""synergies between the teams will further increase our power of action in these trades and the sector. They will enable to offer professionals the best in terms of expertise, and this, whatever the country."" Beauteam management and employees will join the Infopro Digital team in its offices in Antony in the southern outskirts of Paris. Sandra Maguarian has spent her entire career organizing trade shows. She successively worked as Show Manager of the International Leather Show in France and as co-manager of trade shows in the same sector in Asia and the United States. Later, she created a fashion fair in the south of France before joining the Cosmoprof's office in Paris. In 2008, she co-created Beauteam. Jean-Yves Bourgeois devoted its entire career to trade media, successively as a journalist, a publisher and a consultant with a specialization in the packaging and beauty sectors. He was also one of the co-founders of Luxe Pack Monaco in 1988 and founder of the magazine Formes de Luxe, which now owned by the Infopro Digital group. He will continue to oversee the development of the MakeUp in tradeshows as a consultant for Infopro Digital. It should also be noted that, although initially integrated into Beauteam, PremiumBeautyNews.com, which was created in 2008 by Jean-Yves Bourgeois, Sandra Maguarian and Vincent Gallon, was sold to Premium Beauty Media and Vincent Gallon in 2012. The site is not concerned by this transaction and remains fully independent. The next ""MakeUp in"" tradeshow will be held in Seoul on 5 and 6 April 2017. Recently renamed MakeUp in Asia, it should become itinerant in 2018 and move to Shanghai or Tokyo."
YouCam Apps strengthen their positions in the digital beauty revolution,"The suite of beauty apps [1] developed by Perfect Corporation has been downloaded more than 400 million times globally. Perfect Corp.'s YouCam App platform is powered by an augmented reality facial detection technology. In the flagship app YouCam Makeup alone, users try on over 730 million virtual makeup looks each month.

Airless Cushion Compacts: Skinlys' new offer,"Premium Beauty News - Tell us more about Skinlys. Carine Foucault - Skinlys is the skincare & make-up contract-manufacturing division of Sollice Biotech.

The compactness of the Cushion pack requires developing and offering our customers a range of effective multifunctional textures, at the cross-roads between skincare and make-up.

Cosmopolitan supports the development of rare perfumes in Brazil,"It is a long-term job that is starting to bear fruit. Launched in 2012, Cristiane Vilar's project, which aims to make Brazilian consumers discover rare perfumes, had first materialized in the opening of a showroom store in the federal capital in June 2015. ""Our store in Brazilia is much more than a point of sale,"" explains Cristiane Vilar, founder and manager of Cosmopolitan do Brasil. ""It is a place dedicated to training and discovery. We train retailers and introduce them to brands and products."" It should be said that if Brazilians are major perfume consumers, niche perfumery was almost completely unknown on this market before Cosmopolitan was created. ""We had to put a lot of effort into communication, education, and explanations at first,"" Cristiane Vilar emphasizes. ""But we soon noticed there was a real interest. We got a lot of coverage in the press, and several distributors approached us. Just like in any country, distributors look for new products."" Cosmopolitan can also rely on the transformation of the perfumes and cosmetics distribution network in Brazil. With Sephora entering the market in 2012 and multibrand chain The Beauty Box created by the Boticário group, the market situation changed, as consumers' purchase habits got transformed. ""In all big Brazilian cities, there are small selective distribution networks trying to differentiate themselves from Sephora and The Beauty Box, but also online stores, a few of which are fed by smuggling networks,"" Cristiane Vilar explains. As a matter of fact, the company identified about 500 perfume stores likely to distribute this type of products, before making a first selection, depending on the quality of the points of sale. ""Owners have really warmly welcomed us. There was a genuine curiosity for the products we offer, but very limited, even inexistent knowledge in niche perfumery. We had to train them a lot."" As regards this aspect, in Brazil and elsewhere, brands' storytelling is a key factor of success. In addition to its showroom store in Brasilia and online store, today Cosmopolitan has about ten clients all around Brazil, including in the north-east of the country, which is still little explored by major distributors. ""I strongly believe in the potential of Nordeste, which consumes three times more perfumes per person than the southern part of the country. But they are really used to light hesperidia perfumes,"" Cristiane Vilar specifies. However, according to Cosmopolitan's creator, consumers are really open to new products. ""They like being surprised and enjoy originality. They will know how to make a difference between a precious, particular perfume intended for special occasions, and a perfume worn on a daily basis."" If the Brazilian market is very promising, it is important to be aware of its limits and difficulties. Beyond educating consumers, registration procedures and costs, duties, and various other taxes result in delays and significant extra costs. According to Cristiane Vilar, nationalization costs lead to a rise in products' final selling price of 30 to 40%. ""It can take time to get sales results, which is why we only select brands that have enough financial strength."" For the moment, Cosmopolitan do Brasil has chosen to work only with French brands, by offering an olfactory journey between perfumery from the region of Provence (Au Pays de la Fleur d'Oranger, Molinard), and historic and contemporaneous Parisian perfumery (Frapin, E. Coudray, Téo Cabanel, Institut Très Bien, Berdoues Grands Crus, etc.). We will be there to follow their adventure!"
"""2017 also promises a great speed-up for us"" - Xavier Chauvin, Co-founder and CEO of Beauteprivee","""We have never ceased growing, but it is true things have been speeding up for two years, due to the addition of convergent factors,"" explains Xavier Chauvin, who has identified three main levers. A favourable market environment Most women consumers want new, innovative, and/or foreign brands. And yet, if these expectations are largely relayed by social networks, they are relatively absent from traditional channels, which makes them turn to online stores. ""Brands' communication channels have tremendously changed, and some of the least visible through the usual media channels actually show very strong records on our website,"" the manager comments. Beauteprivee plays a role in identifying these eagerly awaited brands, by offering them to a base of more than three million subscribers open to new launches. ""To us, the predefinition of the typology of brands associated with a network is not necessarily relevant, given what our customers expect,"" he adds. The rise of mobile devices Consumption habits are changing. Shopping on mobile devices is now fully integrated to simplified environments. As a matter of fact, in 2016, the traffic on the mobile version of Beauteprivee outperformed that of the desktop version, and the volume of business rose by 160% on this medium. ""We have been working on this aspect since 2011, whether in terms of application or mobile-dedicated environment. It is this experience that is helping us grow so fast and strong today,"" Xavier Chauvin explains. The accuracy of the media system implemented Lastly, there is a third key element, according to Xavier Chauvin: measuring the performance of the communication campaigns launched. ""It helps us be quite incisive and relevant as regards our choices, both online and offline, and adjust shrewd arbitrations on the environments on which we intend to be present,"" he explains. Present in France and Spain with a base of over 3 million subscribers, Beauteprivee now intends to build on their success, by pursuing their initial strategy. ""We keep working on our ability to attract new brands for women in search of wonderful beauty stories. There will also be most significant changes in how we do our job, regarding issues like mobile devices, product recommendation, personalization, and customer knowledge. We have endless opportunities now, but also major challenges ahead for players like us,"" Xavier Chauvin concludes."
From trends analysis to full implementation of the concept: IL Cosmetics' 360° approach,"Premium Beauty News - Obviously, you want to anticipate the rebound that seems to be shaping up in the nail polish industry. Jean-François Harpes - That's right! All indicators are gradually going green... As you know, the nail polish market is subject to regular cycles. The ""boom"", which started with the current decade, gradually slowed down, but under the influence of a sharp come back of colour and with the new, more sophisticated, attractive and fun nail polish ranges, recovery seems to be around the corner. So we must be prepared to meet this demand. Our historical industrial site in Luxembourg was modernized and its capacity increased during the past three years. A new R & D centre was built. We also decided to further increase our filling capacity by doubling our Polish factory with the opening a new production site in Bulgaria. This site will also offer a oversized logistics platform. This new unit will be operational next year and will condition twice as much nail polish but also all other products in our make-up range, especially mascara and lipgloss. Premium Beauty News - A market strategy that is consistent with this strong trend towards more full service? Jean-François Harpes - Clearly, Full service is nothing less than a tidal wave. Full Service or Turnkey now represents 80% of our turnover, while 10 years ago it only accounted for 35-40%. It's obviously the path to follow in the future. The market today demands innovation and quality, timeliness and competitiveness. Moreover, and always at the request of Brands, subcontractors - we are part of - have become real product designers. We must be able to analyse cycles and trends, predict future best sellers, develop new products, control formulation and colours, to supply and sometimes develop in coordination with manufacturers innovative packs, to assist in the creation of the required displays, to condition and to take care of project management and logistics. All this in the shortest possible deadline and with a high-quality level. The concept of ""time to market"" is a key element for success. When you simply imagine that in many cases, delays are reduced to two months for products and concepts developed by us. It is therefore necessary to implement important means in R&D (which we did!), have an efficient industrial process allowing us to quickly produce with an uncompromising level of quality with a very competitive cost offer. And in addition, our customers also ask us more and more to do the final packaging in presentation boxes, and even design for them the presentation displays. Premium Beauty News - This is explained by the development of small and medium brands, of distributors and Internet brands? Jean-François Harpes - Yes of course! These new players are looking for suppliers who have an overall ability to manage projects from A to Z. By directly relying on the subcontracting producer in full service, they reduce intermediaries and maximize their chance of success. These new customers submit us new projects every day. And this is of course one of the reasons why we decided to increase our capacity, because we also believe in a strong recovery of nail polish consumption in the coming months."
Cosmetic Valley wants to expand its influence in France and around the world,"The strategic plan presented by both Directors is divided into ten main points: – Restructuring the cluster to reach a critical mass. The number of members of the Cosmetic Valley increased tenfold in ten years, to reach 460 contributing companies in late 2016. These companies represent a large share of the turnover generated by all the industry's players (26 billion euros out of an estimated 30 billion). However, Marc-Antoine Jamet considers the potential is not exploited everywhere, as 1,500 to 2,000 companies may still be tempted to join. As a result, he plans to get rid of the initial regional boundaries, and restructure the organization by adopting new statutes, so that any company, wherever it is based, may become a member. – Getting the network global. The process was initiated in 2016, with the launch of the Cosmetics Cluster International Network, which gathers 17 international clusters today, and will enter its operational phase in 2017. The network aims to pool both services and information and help companies develop on the global level. In addition, the Cosmétopée project for the preservation of plants and traditional know-how initiated by Jean-Luc Ansel is now integrated to the ""Sud Expert Plantes"" programme, which gathers 22 countries. – Establishing a plural Made in France movement. The idea is to keep going with the implementation of DESTs (fields of territorial strategic excellence) on the new areas of competence of the regions, to better highlight the values of the Marque France (performance, safety, environmental protection). In practical terms, the aim is to initiate research projects in these territories, like the Open Lab Cosmetomics in Cergy Pontoise, in the suburbs of Paris, the Certesens research and studies centre on sensorial technologies in the city of Tours, or Cosmetolab in Evreux. – Supporting research dynamics. By pursuing the Cosmetosciences programme, the Cosmetic Valley] aims to place science and universities at the core of the exchanges with the private sector. The objective is to pool synergies. Among others, scientific workshops will be organized every three months with a university. The first will be held soon at the Parisian university of Jussieu – the theme is yet to be defined. – Making companies commit to an innovation process. The cluster intends to enhance innovation in SMEs/microbusinesses by providing individual, regular support, and facilitating exchanges via the Cosmetup platform. Since it was founded two years ago, 50 SME and entrepreneur projects have been supported. – Organizing multiple events. As a desire to share knowledge and provide professionals with training programmes, the annual schedule of congresses, colloquia, and debates was enriched to reach seven events this year. – Becoming a supervisor… by making the Regulatory Congress, a major annual event in Chartres, south-west of Paris, designed to favour both control and knowledge of national and global regulations, an instrument to produce standards. – Supporting SMEs at major international shows. The major international shows at which the Cosmetic Valley supports French companies constitute another example of events essential to the development of the industry. The association will be a special guest at the China Beauty Expo 2017 and will take part in In-Cosmetics Global in London, Beauty World Middle East in Dubai, and Cosmoprof Asia in Hong Kong. Until now, the cluster shared this mission with BUSINESSFRANCE, but now they would like to take care of it themselves, by signing an agreement. – Encouraging digital development and Beauty Tech. Determined to encourage research projects in the digital field, the cluster will accelerate the Beautytech programme in September 2017 to help the industry's start-ups develop abroad and lay the foundations of a Cosmetics Big Data Hub. – Boosting innovation with the Cosmetic 360 show. As a major player in the industry re-emerging on the international scale, the Cosmetic Valley intends to make Cosmetic 360 a weighty event on the global level. As a showcase for innovation, the key theme of the show since it was created in 2015, it will be reinforced in 2017 with more diverse exhibitors, by adding innovative solutions from other business areas like the food or digital industries. On top of that, this year, an 800m2 area will be dedicated to the creativity of start-ups."

"Aptar, Verescence, DuPont Corian: manufacturers in the wake of the Grand Musée du Parfum","A great perfume cannot go without its glass bottle. Both share a common history: how is it possible not to feature the case with the juice? Originally, the project managers of the Grand Musée du Parfum contacted Verescence, global leader of glass bottle manufacturing for perfumes and cosmetics, whose directors immediately showed their enthusiasm to get involved as a partner. ""This initiative was obviously an excellent opportunity for us, as it perfectly corresponded to our will to share our glassmaking know-how with as many people possible, and in such a prestigious venue,"" explains Astrid Dulau-Vuillet, International Marketing Manager of Verescence. Now, Verescence demonstrates their expertise with creations exhibited on all floors, as well as visuals and videos on bottle manufacturing. Almost 500 bottles are showcased in different settings, including those made in premium Xtra Blanc glass, reflecting the manufacturer's innovation skills. ""This partnership involves much effort. We have worked hand in hand with the museum's teams, who put a lot into the project to offer a new way to present perfumery,"" Astrid Dulau-Vuillet adds. ""We are very proud of the result, as it conveys our passion for our trade, which embodies French excellence."" Perfumery also involves a gesture, a ritual. To deal with the act of wearing perfume, the Museum approached Aptar, a supplier packaging and dispensing solution for cosmetics and perfumes. They did not hesitate a second to get involved. ""This type of project is completely new for us as a BtoB company, but it suited our vision of the perfumery industry. There is much to do in terms of passing on our knowledge,"" explains Sabine Bouillet Lubot, Strategic Marketing Manager Fragrance of the group. ""The sensorial, interactive approach, the experience and ambition of the Museum to raise people's awareness of the world of perfumes really convinced us. It is important to educate and develop the passion this theme creates in people,"" she adds. Like all partners, the company has agreed to provide financial support over a period of five years. The objective is to illustrate their know-how in several ways, in line with their creed: ""one fragrance, one gesture"". On the one hand, Aptar got involved in the artistic project of the room dedicated to the art of wearing perfume: a video and photo creation made by three artists and inspired from the quotations of renowned perfume creator Jean-Claude Ellena about ""gestes des odeurs"" (smell gestures), as well as data and observations Aptar was able to take from his studies conducted all around the world. On the other hand, the manufacturer made its dispensing systems available to the museum, including the new ""La Petite"" spray, which can be found on the 60 bottles featured on the large stairs, as well as the ""Eternelle Couture"" bulb atomizers, chosen to activate a digital content. ""Thanks to this partnership, we have the opportunity to give more value to the gesture of perfuming, which has become quite banal,"" emphasizes Sabine Bouillet Lubot. As part of their perfume-oriented activity, the Aptar group has developed a range of diffusion systems which, given its diversity and sophisticated sensoriality, helps choose the most appropriate gesture, depending on the perfume concept, whether it be a spray or an alternative gesture like a bulb or the new Note product, which revives the gesture of a direct skin application. ""There are thousands of ways to wear perfume. They depend on many things, the perfume, but also the region of the world, the culture, the climate… We would like to convince our customers it is important to think about the perfume gesture they will associate with their new concept, right at the beginning,"" Sabine Bouillet Lubot ensures. DuPont did not hesitate either when they were asked to become a partner of the Jardin des Senteurs (Garden of Scents) of the Museum. Designed by the Projectiles agency as a field of flowers, this area stimulates the smell with an immersion in the middle of organic creations made with Corian resin. ""The way our material is used is very innovative. Already recognized by creators and the general public for its sensual touch and aesthetics, here, it is associated with scents,"" comments Alessandra Sabatey, Communication Officer of Corian. With the collaboration of transformer Créa Diffusion, DuPont Corian took on the technical challenge this creation represented with a meticulous, original transformation of their panels. ""As a manufacturer, we are not used to this kind of experience. But here, highlighted as a museum work of art, Corian has gone out of their comfort zone to show themselves in a different way likely to seduce the world of perfume,"" Alessandra Sabatey asserts. Alongside industrials, different perfume brands also committed to financially support the museum, like The Different Company: ""We are delighted to support the first major initiative on Perfumery in Paris. The Grand Musée du Parfum offers a modern, aesthetic, detailed visit filled with olfactory emotions and creations. It is the place to be!"" guarantees Luc Gabriel, President of the brand, whose Rose Poivrée fragrance composed by Jean-Claude Ellena in 2002 was also selected by the scientific committee to be part of the five roses of perfumer-artists offered to visitors on the Blossom installation, an ""Imaginary Rosebush"" created by Violette Houto, designer."
Seppic enlarges its portfolio of natural active ingredients with the acquisition of Serdex,"Building on the 2013 acquisition of BiotechMarine, a company based on France's west coast and specializing in natural substances from marine resources for cosmetics manufacturers, the acquisition of Serdex adds new natural ingredients to Seppic's portfolio, increasing its offer to meet the expectations of consumers for natural products. According to Seppic, global sales of specialty active ingredients for cosmetics amount to over EUR 900 million, of which natural active ingredients are a fast growing segment. From this point of view, Serdex had many assets to interest Seppic. Specialising in botanical active ingredients for dermo-cosmetics and skin treatment, Serdex achieved a turnover of EUR 8 million in 2015. With its 40 employees, based in Pau, South-West France, Serdex brings to Seppic its expertise in high purity extraction, in sourcing of exotic plants, and its knowledge of Malagasy plants notably. ""With this acquisition, Air Liquide strengthens its position in the market of active ingredients of natural origin, meeting the high and increasing demand of consumers for these ingredients. The complementarity of Serdex and Seppic allows us to widen our know-how to better serve our beauty care customers and continue the development of this eco-responsibly sourced active ingredients activity,"" said François Jackow, member of the Air Liquide group's Executive Committee, supervising the Healthcare activities. Present in over 100 countries through its affiliates and network of distributors, Seppic employs 660 people aroundthe world, including 100 employees dedicated to innovation."
"""L'Occitane au Brésil shows a great potential for export,"" Nicolas Geiger, L'Occitane do Brasil","Premium Beauty News - How are the group's brands doing in Brazil? Nicolas Geiger - Today, L'Occitane en Provence is a well-developed brand that keeps growing: 10% last year, and probably the same this year. That is a good result, bearing in mind that the number of stores is stable. There are already about a hundred of them, and it is hard to open any more, given the number of premium shopping malls in the country. However, L'Occitane au Brésil has changed a lot. We will open about 50 points of sale before the end of December. There will be 180 next March, including 150 kiosks and about 30 stores. Premium Beauty News - How can you explain this performance on a market that is slowing down? Nicolas Geiger - We are one of the three main players on the premium cosmetics market in Brazil, but it should not be forgotten that this market represents 5% of the total beauty market, and it is much less competitive. With 5 to 10% of market share, we are still small, and it is always easier to grow when we are small. Premium Beauty News - A growing network, a retail concept redesigned with the Cent Degrés agency… What part does the boom of L'Occitane au Brésil represent in these results? Nicolas Geiger - L'Occitane au Brésil grows by 100% every year, which is a good pace on a market with less than 5% growth. We feel that the brand is very well-accepted. Actually, we launched L'Occitane au Brésil as a solution not to depend only on imported products, but also to pay tribute to the Brazilian cosmetics culture. Our marketing positioning and offering correspond to the Brazilian profile. If the brand was originally inspired from L'Occitane en Provence concept, today, it has its own identity, and quite an exciting way to talk about Brazil. Now, that is important within a context of political and identity crisis. In addition, it is the ""gringo"", the foreigner, who talks about the beauty, richness, and Brazilian culture with such passion. Brazilians like it, they are proud of that. Premium Beauty News - When will we see L'Occitane au Brésil outside of Brazil? Nicolas Geiger - We sincerely think this brand, and more generally Brazil or the ""made in Brazil"" concept, has a great potential for export. Local players have not managed to meet the challenge of penetrating global markets with quality products. Today, we are able to do it, but before that, we need to be strong at home, meaning in Brazil, and in particular to keep developing our own personality. When the brand finds its balance here, we will go global. It is a project we have been studying from an opportunistic standpoint, but for now, we mainly aim to make it a Brazilian brand that can be autonomous in Brazil. Premium Beauty News - Two years ago, you claimed you wanted to make Brazil the main market of the L'Occitane group. For now, it is still the 7th: do you maintain your objective? Nicolas Geiger - It is still the 7th indeed, but we should take into account the depreciation of the real. In terms of local money, we have grown by 30 or 40%, and with a 20.5% growth in the first semester 2016, from April to October, Brazil represents 55% of the group's global growth. So, indeed, we aim to make it the first market, but we will still need three to five years before it becomes reality. At least, being part of the top 3 is possible, and it can also go very fast if L'Occitane au Brésil keeps growing, or even exporting."
The Alkos Group organizes the continuation of its growth,"Actually, the year 2016 was a busy one for the Alkos Group: its visual identity was redesigned, the construction of a new plant for its subsidiary Inter Cosmétiques was decided, a new General Manager joined the company and, eventually, its shareholding structure was reorganized to support ambitious growth targets. Let's recall the Group's history. In 1998, Gérard Gieux, founder of Cosmogen, a French manufacturer of cosmetic packaging and applicators, acquired Alkos Cosmétiques, a manufacturer of cosmetic pencils, then two other companies in 2008, Intercosmétiques (make-up and skincare products) and Sagal (hygiene products), eventually gathered within the Alkos Group. In 2014, to fund an ambitious investment program, Gérard Gieux had called on equity fund MBO Partneraires, which became the majority shareholder (51%) of a holding company gathering Cosmogen and the Alkos Group. At the end of November 2016, this holding company was reorganized with the separation of the Cosmogen entity, which was fully taken over by MBO Partenaires. The transaction allowed Gérard Gieux to increase its stake in the Alkos Group by taking over the majority of the capital (75%), MBO becoming a minority shareholder. Furthermore, the proceeds from the sale of Cosmogen allowed Alkos Group to repay all of its senior debt and to consider the continuation of its investment program with ease. ""Gérard Gieux, the Group's historic industrial shareholder, thus demonstrates his confidence in the strategy being pursued by the management team. With his experience, he will support key executives and shareholders including Dominique Vautier, CEO, and Philippe Pavageau, the newly arrived GM,"" the company said in a statement. The management team thus has the means to carry out an ambitious organic growth strategy, leveraging on the 40% increase in capacity brought by the construction of the new plant in Angers (an investment of 8.5 million euros), on the development of innovative products and on international growth. The target of the shareholders is thus to increase the group's turnover from 60 million euros to 100 million euros over the next 5 years. ""The group still achieves a large part of its turnover in France, we have a big potential for growth in export markets,"" explains Florence Lefeuvre, Sales, Marketing and Communication Director of the Alkos Group. North America and South America remain priority targets for the Group which has just opened a sales office in New York and will participate for the first time in the MakeUp in Sao Paulo trade show on 7 and 8 December 2016. However, the Group does not exclude the possibility that acquisitions will reinforce this organic strategy, in particular in the event of opportunities to complement its product portfolio or to facilitate the implementation in foreign markets. ""Our customers and long-term partners are encouraging us to enter the powder segment. This could also be part of an international implementation,"" explains Florence Lefeuvre. The group would have already identified potential targets and some options would have been investigated in detail, particularly in North America. To be continued!"
Crystalmoda doubles its turnover,"Dario Moretti, the Head and main shareholder of the Company, has every reason to be satisfied. After deciding in 2013 to divest to the Lumson Group its packaging activity, Modapack to concentrate solely on the development of Crystalmoda, his efforts have paid off. The firm currently employs more than fifty people and expects to achieve net sales of EUR 12 million during the current year. The volume of investments remains strong. ""We are investing in all areas of the Company: the workforce, the laboratory, production equipment and filling lines,"" explains Dario Moretti. In recent months, Crystalmoda has strengthened its offering in terms of lip products and liquid foundations, even if powders remain the main activity. The 5000 m2 plant produces some several million pieces per year of make-up powders. ""Powders are at present still our core business,"" explains Dario Moretti, ""but we have significantly increased our production capacity of lipgloss, mascara and lipstick."" Over the last six months the company invested more than EUR 600 000. As for the Group's international expansion, it can only increase. ""The Canadian Group Crystal Claire Cosmetics recently acquired a stake in our capital,"" says Dario Moretti. ""And we will set up together a development strategy in the coming weeks. To note that we are doing also very well on new Middle East markets."" Main objective for the Italian firm, also strengthen its presence at the level of major European brands."
Tre Effe to invest EUR 3 million in a new plant,"Tre Effe, a company that does not get itself much talked about is led by the Ferracini family, (the father, Gianni and his daughters, Federica and Francesca). The company was created in 1995 and it can boast a steady and consistent growth in the segment of make-up products. With a commercial foothold in Europe but also the United States, the Middle East and Russia, the company will achieve this year a turnover of 7 million euros for a total staff of 30 people. Excellent results that allow the company to invest significantly for 2017, a year during which it will move into a 4000 m2 building located in the same area as the current 1000 m2 plant. Three million euros will have been invested in the operation, part of which also serving to increase the bulk production capacity. ""To note, emphasises Alistair Beavan, General Manager, that Tre Effe produces mainly powders (75% of the production, that is, about 700 kilos per day), including baked powders, but also lipsticks, mascaras and eyeliners (total capacity: 2,500 pcs/h)."""
Intercos: More than ever the originator and world leader of a winning concept,"With a turnover that will near EUR 500 million, with a double digit growth compared to last year, the Italian Group, the world leader in its field, should have every reason to be satisfied of this 2016 year coming to a close. ""In fact, yes and no, admits Dario Ferrari. Indeed while the first six months were up to our expectations, the economic slowdown perceived during the second half of the year surprised us and was more important than what we had then expected. But I must stress on one point, it is not the global market which came to a standstill - because it actually increased - but more the positions of the main players in this market - those who do large volumes - which were totally unsettled. Some of these heavy weight players saw their business drop significantly while small and medium players were progressing very quickly, some of them posting conspicuous growth rates, boosted by internet sales and with the help and influence of bloggers and followers. In the US too, traditional retail channels also saw their sales drop sharply. Speed to market, innovation, quick line turnovers have become key watchwords if you want to stay in the race."" As a consequence, traditional industrial and business models have been undermined. ""Because we must never forget, insists Dario Ferrari, that we're doing a complex job that involves multiple parameters not always compatible in terms of raw materials, industrial processes, equipments implemented, packagings, required levels of quality and short delivery deadlines. Hence we are in a constant race against time, orders have diversified, requirements for innovation and deadlines have increased. You must excel everywhere and quickly, you must anticipate the next turn when you aren't even done with the previous one."" With its 13 factories and 4000 employees around the world, acting as genuine trend ""sensors"", the Italian Group considers itself, with good reasons too, in the best position to anticipate, adapt better and faster to these changes. ""This vision is not a gift of God, explains Dario Ferrari, it is acquired on the ground where things happen and with the players who are already in anticipation of the day after"". Another proof of this anticipative strategy: the brand new 12000 m2 factory of the Italian Group that is being built from the ground up, in South Korea in the outskirts of Seoul and which will be operational next January. A major investment in an expanding area of the world. ""South Korea is the place in Asia where things are happening, insists Dario Ferrari. The market is in China, but excellence and innovation, speed of implementation and flexibility are in South Korea."" Flexibility and reactivity, key words at the close of the year. ""Produce globally, but act locally are essential for a Group like ours, to not only maintain its leadership but, above all, continue to gain market shares,"" he explains. ""You must also keep track of currency fluctuations, to be able to transfer whatever production in the most competitive part of the world. With the dollar in a rising phase again, we did not hesitate to repatriate some productions to Italy. Especially as our home country has both the know-how in terms of staff and that much desired and required flexibility"". The market is demanding more full service, additional skills and more resources, including in the packaging area... That's no problem, the Head of Intercos is convinced that a better integration upstream will be increasingly important. ""The whole question, he wonders, is how to get organised, with whom and where?"" Anticipate future market demands... a true second nature for the Intercos leader. "" Retailer private brands have been gaining ground and this trend is bound to continue, he explains, we have therefore decided to set up a dedicated structure, Intercos Concept, which will be in charge of supporting our customers with 360° marketing skills. A team with the necessary experience to develop concepts and product ranges, but also do merchandising and communication operations, exchange with bloggers, and so on. We recently appointed Renato Semerari [1] to manage the new structure. The objective: define our marketing approach 'on the field' for a more successful development and launch of our new product lines."""
Omnicos: A new factory in 2017,"Over a 8000 m2 area that will see the light in May next. A particularly important investment for this Italian company that relies a lot on 360° technology investments. ""These new buildings will actually be home to all the company sites currently spread over several sites in Romanengo,"" explained Manuela Guerrini, Sales Manager. ""It concerns offices, laboratories and workshops and a fully automated storage area"". A second tranche of 12,000 m2 is scheduled late 2018/early 2019: it will be home to the filling and conditioning workshop. Main products manufactured: foundations, mascaras, lipsticks, lip glosses, eyeliners and, since a few months, automatic pencils and powders. ""We are also going to implement our third production line for automatic pencils,"" underlined Manuela Guerrini. ""90 % of the company's turnover comes from export sales, primarily to France, Germany, but also the Middle East and the United States, a market which is starting to give us a lot of satisfaction,"" explained Manuela Guerrini. Another asset of the company is its ability to create its own filling and automated machines thanks its participation in the partner-Company, IDM Automation located near Milan."
"""Innovation and R&D are key assets in colour cosmetics,"" IL Cosmetics","Premium Beauty News - How is the nail polish market doing? Jean-François Harpes - The nail polish market itself is rather ""flat"" not to say declining. In this context we can observe a ""streamlining"" of the market around two major global players. Indeed, the manufacture of nail polish requires both heavy investments and high expertise. Brands must rely on specialized suppliers. We are delighted to see that IL Cosmetics is gaining market share. Today we are the European market leaders and the number two worldwide in the nail polish segment. We are also taking advantage of our diversification in the make-up category with our Luxcos division, which is one of the leaders in the mascara segment, with also a strong growth in the lip segment, particularly for long wear and liquid lipsticks. In 2016, we expect our turnover in make-up to grow by more than 45%. Premium Beauty News - How do you explain this impressive growth? Jean-François Harpes - Our investments in research and innovation, these past five years, have certainly helped propel IL Cosmetics as the new leader on the European market. Today, we invest 5% of our turnover in R&D. In our labs a total 85 people are dedicated to research, development and quality, with 45 of them exclusively involved in research on nail polish. In practice, our research teams are dedicated to each product category: formulation for nail polishes and make-up, colour, special effects, nail care, new technologies... We have also renewed and extended our collaboration with the LIST (Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology), the leading research institute in Luxembourg. A dedicated team of 10 people works specifically on improving organoleptic parameters such as brightness, staying power and of course stability. Their scientific and highly analytical work has led to many advances. These technology breakthroughs have led to the conclusion of a number of contracts in premium markets, such as France, UK and Korea where our market shares have quadrupled in five years. And our constant growth also results from improvements in our consumer panel techniques, which are mostly performed in-house. This allows us to speed up our time to market approach and to increase the number of formulas and concepts developed simultaneously. This panel is a key tool to continuously improve our formulas sensory parameters, to guarantee a perfect match between our results and those of our customers and to know the purchasing intentions of our different formulas and concepts. Finally, it allows us a more qualitative approach concerning future consumer requirements. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, what do you see as the major upcoming trends in the nail polish market? Jean-François Harpes - According to a consumer study we conducted recently and to forecasts on the fashion sector, the trend is for a return of colour, with colour hold remaining an unavoidable feature along with formulas enabling to stage colours. We are working on new technologies to highlight these key consumer parameters: gloss - thanks to a patented proprietary technology -, brightness, radiance, and a second generation gel texture. Consumers regard the staying power as a key element in assessing quality. Note that in almost all tests related to the staying power, performed by our clients we were well ahead our competitors. This is why it is important to have a perfect mastery of the gel technology, which is also a great source of inspiration to innovate and optimize the traditional nail polish technology. For each season, we will showcase collections in line with these trends. Hence we invite our customers to visit us at the upcoming Cosmoprof Asia trade show that will be held in Hong Kong from 16 to 18 November 2016, to discover our latest innovations. We will exhibit in the Convention & Exhibition Center - hall 3G- stand K2B."
Formulas: The multi ethnic make-up strategy of Necos,"Premium Beauty News - You're not the only one to have embarked on this adventure of ethnic and Halal products in particular? Dario Dall'Oste - True, but we're the only ones to have built a Halal certified factory! And that's what makes the difference! But as the saying goes, ""he who can do more can do less""! It is clear that this brand new plant, which is in the process of being GMP, Halal and ISO 9001 certified and that we have just commissioned in the outskirts of Crema in Italy enables us mostly to have a global market reach where there is a majority of consumers with dark skins or in any case, very coloured skins. Imagine, for example, that in London ""white people"" only represent 40% of the population. Imagine that in thirty years the majority of the U.S. population will no longer consist of white people. Imagine that the 17 ASEAN countries are in the process of implementing a Halal certification, which should see the light in 2018. Don't forget that more than 620 million people live in this area. Finally, imagine that 42% of Colombian women use between nine and twelve cosmetic products daily. Premium Beauty News - Impressive indeed! Quite enough to make the mouths of cosmetic suppliers water. Dario Dall'Oste - Yes, but it is far from simple! Obtaining the Halal certification for a production plant is an obstacle course. You almost need to start with a 'white' sheet of paper (if I can say so!). Everything must be certified. Ingredients and raw materials of course, but also cleaning products for the production equipment, not to mention the staff's whole immediate working environment. The 2500 m2 plant, which started running last July is part of a two-million-euro investment and produces per year about 70 tonnes of mascara, 70 tonnes of foundation, 19 tonnes of lipgloss and lipsticks and 75 tonnes of powders. We can offer a total of 126 certified Halal formulas, also complying with several much demanded marketing claims in ""traditional"" markets for natural and vegetarian products. We already have several agents representing us in our most strategic markets. And by the end of next year, we are planning to build a filling plant in Eastern Europe spanning on a 3000 m2 area. Premium Beauty News - The growing number of mestizos obviously represents a great potential! Dario Dall'Oste - This is why I must stress on the purposefully multiethnic positioning of Necos. The Indian Beauty market is growing by 20% annually and 50% of its population is under 30 years of age. In five years, Iran will be the fourth largest cosmetic market. Iranian women use one mascara every month and a lipstick every month and a half. And any way a carefully devised formula development activity sticking to the needs of existing markets and not just to the ones this inexorable globalisation trend is going to offer us more and more in the future, allows us to have high performance products also for Caucasian skins, which enabled Necos to win its first customers in Italy, UK, Eastern Europe and Australia."
Kanebo Cosmetics turns 80 and launches new brand around the world,"Since its acquisition by the Kao Group in 2006, Kanebo Cosmetics has undergone a real transformation. Product ranges were streamlined, and teams and sites were integrated. Last September, Kao inaugurated the group's new R&D centre in Odawara (Kanagawa Prefecture), one of Kanebo's historical sites. The group's research and development teams are now gathered in these new labs inspired by the principles of kansei engineering. Kanebo, a textile company founded in the late 19th century, launched its first cosmetic product in 1936. It consisted in a soap made of silk fibres and thereafter named Savon de Soie. Ten years later, in 1946, Kanebo launched its first cold cream: it is the first huge success for the group's cosmetics division that will gradually diversify its products to become one of the giants of the Japanese market. In 1966, the group officially opened its Paris office and laboratory. ""At that time, the aim was to build on the French and European know-how to stand out in the Japanese market by offering innovative solutions,"" said Hiroaki Katsukura, the current Director of the Paris office. This initiative quickly proved successful with the launch in Japan of several new products directly inspired by the Parisian laboratory and with some of these launches meeting big commercial success. In 1983, Kanebo felt strong enough to conquer the world and launched Sensai, a premium brand for international markets. Fifty years after its opening, the missions of the Kanebo the French laboratory have slightly shifted towards market and consumer insights. ""We conduct consumer research, mainly in the group's three most important European markets: Germany, Italy and Spain,"" said Ghislaine Suquet, Product Manager at Kanebo Cosmetics Paris. ""From Japan, Europe is sometimes viewed as a single entity, our role is to moderate this vision, to highlight the differences between the markets."" The French office can also manage some new product developments when a specific French know-how is involved, as it was the case forthe launch of Sensai's first fragrance in 2015. Other developments may also be made locally for environmental reasons, in particular for samples or nail varnishes. Both Kanebo and Sensai are now Kao Group brands. Inspired by the principles of ""Chrono-Beauty"", the new Kanebo brand was launched in Japan in September 2016 in about 150 department stores and 200 specialty stores, with products focusing on skin care, makeup and wellness. The new Kanebo brand will be launched in Asia (excluding China) in November, before Europe and Russia where the launch is scheduled for the autumn 2017. Regarding China, the deployment of the brand is not expected before 2020. With this new brand, the Japanese group aims to carve out a solid place in the global high-end cosmetics market.

Feelunique opens first bricks-and-mortar shop in Paris,"The beauty retailer - which debuted in 2005 in the UK - now has its own physical point of sale at 35 avenue Marceau, in Paris 16th district. This new milestone in its development in France will allow the retailer to offer its customers a different shopping experience. Feelunique also opened two other stores in Boulogne-Billancourt and Neuilly-sur-Seine, in the upscale western outskirts of Paris. By the end of the year, the retail will also open another shop in Levallois-Perret. All the four new brick-and-mortar stores are the result of the rebranding of beauty retail chain Rive Droite that Feelunique acquired in November 2015. Thanks to these bricks-and-mortar shop, Feelunique also complies with current regulations regarding selective distribution in the perfumery sector, which should logically facilitate the diversification of its portfolio and references, a key factor of success to attract French consumers who are more loyal than others to leading prestige beauty brands. So far, Feelunique was only operating shops in the Channel Islands, in Jersey and Guernsey. The 100m2 Feeleunique beauty outlet brings together a wide range of iconic perfumery brands including classic and selected niche brands. To help customers during their shopping experience and give them access to the whole Feelunique offering, shop assistants are equipped with iPads. Customers can therefore choose and order products from the 20 000 items and 450 brands already available on the e-shop (fragrance, bath & body, hair skin, makeup, brows, sun & tan, healthy living, electricals, gifts ...). Products can be delivered at home or at the point sale. Twice a month the Avenue Marceau store should also provide the opportunity for meetings between brands creators and consumers. The shop is also equipped with three treatment and massage rooms. Beauticians will advise customers to help them choose products and services fitting their needs, including body and face care products (CellCosmet, Valmont, Annayaké and Carita), hair removal services, manicure and pedicure, etc. Finally, consistent with the offer proposed by Feelunique on their website, a Hair Spa area will also provide styling, cutting and colouring services, as well as a selection of professional brands (Kérastase, L'Oréal Professionnel, Shu Uemura Art of Hair, Redken, Moroccanoil, Philip B, ...). Furthermore, every Thursday evening until 08:30 pm special party hairstyles are proposed ... together with a glass of champagne (for the French Touch!)."
Brazilian company Lipson is investing heavily in make-up,"During the past twenty-four months this 100% leading Brazilian subcontractor in beauty products has significantly accelerated the pace of its industrial investments. At the request of their customers, the company leaders decided to work twice as hard in the make-up area and to ""offer themselves"" what is best in terms of production and filling equipment. As a result, a brand new second production site of 3000 m2 on two floors, the first, dedicated to the production of powders and the second to other products (lipsticks, lipgloss, mascaras etc). Best of all, the installation of a clean room and a third storage building of 5000 m2. One of the company's special features: aside from the latest Korean-conditioning machines recently installed in the factory, the whole engineering was developed ""in-house"". ""We are almost done,"" says Regina Helena R.T. Rodriguez, the Head of the company. ""This new production tool fully dedicated to make-up and which is already partly operational will be up and running early next year."" The entire company will be SAP managed in a few weeks and the historic factory extending over 5000 m2 will continue to be dedicated to the conditioning of perfume and hygiene products. ""A lot of foreign companies are currently calling on us to produce and condition their cosmetics,"" emphasises Regina Helena R.T. Rodriguez. ""This sector is on the rise in Brazil like elsewhere and our former production facilities were no longer sufficient to cope with demand!"""
"B. Kolormakeup & Skincare: 100% natural products, a strong strategic focus","Premium Beauty News - You have focused your strategy a lot on ""naturalness""? Mario de Luigi - It is true and we can only welcome such a move! Because it is undoubtedly a strong market demand. In fact, we have successfully managed to be able to offer our customers all our product ranges in a ""100% natural"" version. Quite a challenge believe me, which was made possible through significant investments in research and development. Don't forget that out of a staff of about two hundred people, more than forty work in our laboratories. We are continuing to ride this so-called natural trend through the development of high performance bio products. A research work, which started ten years ago, and a source of great satisfaction and concrete orders for our company. Premium Beauty News - With ""make-up"" and ""skincare"" you are wearing two hats? Mario de Luigi - We are indeed involved in both areas. Our development and production efforts concern both, but it is true that the ""skincare"" share is significantly increasing. And as you know, the border between the two is quite thin. Premium Beauty News - You only produce in Italy? Mario de Luigi - Yes, because the ""Made in Italy"" is a real plus in our business. We mustn't forget it. Added to the fact that everything we do is designed, produced, packaged in-house in our factories, a characteristic which guarantees a high level of quality and control. Premium Beauty News - You have planned to increase further your production capacity? Mario de Luigi - We have no other choice! Demand continues to grow. And our 15 000 m2 production area is becoming scarce. We are a small company that offers the services and advantages of a larger structure, but with this added flexibility of small businesses that we absolutely want to preserve. We don't want to grow for the sake of growing, we are just seeking to always meet the every need of our customers."
Faber-Castell Cosmetics: A record year,"Premium Beauty News - Can you give us some figures on your Group: How many people do you employ today, what is the turnover of the company and the main investments this year and next year in your plants, in Germany and abroad? Christina Zech - We are 7,500 worldwide, nearly 800 of them work for Faber-Castell Cosmetics. For the Faber-Castell Group as a whole, the fiscal year 2015/16 (year ending 31st March 2016) was the best year in the company's history with group sales of EUR 631 million (+10% year-on-year). And for the Faber-Castell Cosmetics division it was a record year as we accounted for more than 10% of Faber-Castell AG's total business and we ended the year with double-digit sales growth and a good profit. At the moment one of our (main) focuses is to enlarge the capacity of wood cased pencils at our facility in Sao Carlos, Brazil. Since July 2013 this specially designed, modern production site offers vertical integration under one roof and is in particular beneficial for our international key accounts. And of course, a proven, standardized quality assurance system guarantees the strict compliance with all international standards. Premium Beauty News - What is today your strategy in terms of product development? Christina Zech - Step by step we are adjusting our textures to equally produce them on all our global production sites thus providing a high flexibility for us and our customers. Premium Beauty News - What are the new products? Christina Zech - At Make-Up in NewYork we presented smart solutions to create a fresh, dewy skin with a gorgeous lit-from-within-glow and stunning colours that last the whole day. And not to forget 3 new packagings, where we are especially excited about our airtight Slim Plastic Pencil. This in-house developed and produced packaging can be easily customized from ""top to toe"" in any colour. Our revolution in pencil shape allows a new generation of formulas. At New York we presented it with the gel-like MAGNETIC texture which glides on like a dream and the feed-back in New York was amazing. Premium Beauty News - Concerning your future plans, what are the next steps? Christina Zech - On the whole, we strive to increase our global reach and to be closer to our customers. Furthermore, we are working on an extension of our packaging portfolio with innovative formulations which have to be especially developed for each format and as you know, this is one of our key competences. Our customers can be sure to get a ""one-stop shop"": High quality products, convenience and safety where we stand behind with our reputation."
Fiabila to launch an exclusive nail polish offering on the Brazilian market,"Premium Beauty News - Over the past five years, Fiabila made considerable investments to improve its production tool and enhance its capacities, in particular by opening a plant in Brazil. What are your objectives in this country? Alexandre Miasnik - Indeed, for the past twenty years, Fiabila has implemented a growth strategy focused on investments and on a presence on key markets, including Brazil. Today, most of our offering in this country is produced locally under conditions which, from a qualitative and regulatory standpoint, do not meet the requirements we are used to in Europe and the United States, for example. Fiabila's objective is very clear: making radically different products available on this market and becoming the main local supplier. Premium Beauty News - The plant is now fully operational, both from the industrial and administrative standpoints. What next? Alexandre Miasnik - We are now ready to perform the color mixing and filling processes. By the end of the first semester 2017, we will be manufacturing thixotropic bases locally with extremely modern techniques, following the model used in France today and spreading across the USA. Therefore, in the short term, we will be able to offer our customers the service and flexibility resulting from our presence at the core of the Brazilian market, but also the same products and quality level as in France. Premium Beauty News - Brazil is one of the largest nail polish consumers. From a health and aesthetic point of view, your high quality product offering is quite unique on this market, which is said to be very sensitive to prices. How do you think you will convince local brands? Alexandre Miasnik - The Brazilian market's dynamism is closely related to the low price level, which makes it possible for all social classes to buy this product. However, we have been observing a price increase in loss leaders as well as a strong growth of middle-end products. In addition, Brazil has recently strengthened their cosmetic regulation, which is getting more and more similar to what we have in Europe. This means that for all categories, the selection of raw materials and the production conditions must be adapted without any significant impact on prices. To this day, only Fiabila can answer to these constraints, while demonstrating a strong creative power. Premium Beauty News - The Brazilian economy has experienced difficulties over the past few years. Even if the beauty market is resilient, the euphoria of the early decade has disappeared. What is your perception of the market today? Alexandre Miasnik - Obviously, the market is less euphoric now, but it is still remarkably dynamic, in particular in terms of sales volumes, despite a product offering that is often limited, with a segmentation almost exclusively based on color. Today, Fiabila can make much more varied, efficient, and innovative products for Brazil, and that is key for growth."
"Absolution: The organic, chic, niche, and flourishing beauty brand steps up its development","Premium Beauty News - How would describe Absolution's basic concept? Isabelle Carron - Offering a skincare range that can restore and maintain an optimum skin ecosystem with highly organic, unisex products boosted by the mix&match method. Premium Beauty News - Strengthened by this principle, the brand has become a reference in the world of organic cosmetics. What is the situation right now? Isabelle Carron - We are present in about 350 points of sale in 27 countries, mainly in Europe, but also in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Russia… and we have projects in Indonesia, Korea… We have worked a lot on our development in France, which represents 40% of our turnover. That is partly due to our efficient collaboration with Mama Shelter hotels for three years. Absolution has created an exclusive line of organic amenities for all their hotels, a rare achievement in the hotel business. We are gaining fame through word of mouth, although Absolution is a brand based on advice that is both appealing and destabilizing. And yet, a customer that tries is a seduced customer. As for our products, today we have 30 references, mainly in skincare, but also body care. We have also recently focused a bit on makeup, with a line of matte lipsticks created in collaboration with makeup artist Christophe Danchaud. Premium Beauty News - Talking about your makeup line, you have used crowdfunding to launch it. Why choose this approach? Isabelle Carron - Exactly. The operation was intended to launch the Sweet & Safe Kiss line in December 2014. I wanted to minimize the financial risks and test the market demand… and the public did follow us. We have exceeded our objective of EUR 30,000, which is just exceptional for the beauty sector. It helped us finance part of the production phase, and it is also an efficient communication operation, as donors become the brand and products' ambassadors. Premium Beauty News - Are you going to keep developing your makeup offering? Isabelle Carron - Definitely, and still with Christophe Danchaud: three new sorbet lipsticks have just been launched, and eye and complexion products are under study. However, the idea is not to multiply our references, but rather to provide the perfect makeup kit for all needs. Women usually use three or four essential colours, rarely more. It is the same with skincare: I try to make beautiful, multifunctional products. Premium Beauty News - To you, is the niche cosmetics segment as dynamic as alternative perfumery? Isabelle Carron - They do not exactly grow at the same pace. The development of skincare is inherently long and tough, it is less in the spotlight, and it generates less profit margin. They do share something though, as the increasing number of launches saturates the market. Organic cosmetics are driven by the more and more popular food market, but it still has a low impact for now. In France, the problem lies in distribution. We are present in department stores, beauty salons, independent perfume stores, and through the Mademoiselle Bio network. Apart from the latter, the other organic specialized distribution networks have no high-end offering. I would like the food model to be copied in cosmetics, as there is more closeness and small stores. It is still not that easy to find an environment that truly corresponds to our brand. I have many ideas, if anyone is interested in distribution! Premium Beauty News - From a more global standpoint, what are your projects? Isabelle Carron - We launch four new products a year, that is already a fast pace for a small company. But there is still a lot to do, and I have huge ambitions for the brand. I would like to integrate other worlds I am interested in, ingredients, food, the world of preparation. And to develop these projects, we have launched a funding process – that is the right moment for us. We are also going to focus on digital technologies and recruit people: our staff will have doubled by the end of the year, so that we will count eight employees. I wish we could live in an ethical society where people are happy. I am doing my best for it."
"""The emotional dimension is the best hope for survival for perfume stores"", Celso Fadelli, Intertrade Group","Premium Beauty News - Six years ago, as the President of the Intertrade Group, a rare perfume distributor, you decided to create the Avery Perfume Gallery concept, in a context where alternative perfumery was still a niche segment. Why? Celso Fadelli - To me, it is very important to have a direct contact with the person that uses the product and buys the perfume. It gives an opportunity to understand much more. I used to walk a small pedestrian street near Piccadilly Street in London, Avery Row, every day, and there was this small flower shop. Unfortunately, when the crisis occurred, it had to close, so I took over the lease to open our first store. It was just natural to call it Avery. The initial concept was to mark a break with traditional perfumery. The idea was to put our juices right in the heart of the area and forget about secondary packaging, the usual marketing tools. The whole decoration was made of retrieved objects bought from the Portobello market. I did not want the atmosphere to be created by a traditional design agency. Premium Beauty News - And obviously, people showed up. Celso Fadelli - At the beginning, it was tough. No one came in, and those that did walk through the door did not understand the concept. And then, after a year and a half, it started to work well. Today, our turnover for this 20m2 store reaches 450,000 sterling pounds every year. Afterwards, we opened a second store in New Orleans, and the others followed in other cities and countries. If we count shops and corners in department stores, today we have about twenty points of sale all around the world, except in Asia. Our idea to showcase our perfumes with no packaging, marketing or communication has been copied since then by many, in particular the Belle Parfumerie at Printemps Haussmann. Our customers do not care about the brand, they care about the quality of the juice, the story of the perfume: they get to know it in a completely different way, starting with the raw material. Premium Beauty News - To you, how is the niche perfumery market evolving? Celso Fadelli - Today, there is a high demand on many markets, so we have just opened stores in Morocco, Mexico, Colombia, at Harvey Nichols's, Selfridges's, etc. We have a lot of opportunities to develop, because people no longer see perfumery the same way. That is actually the reason why several multinationals have purchased niche brands. Premium Beauty News - What about France? Celso Fadelli - France is a difficult market, but that's normal, it is as if we had decided to sell pasta to Italians. For most French people, perfume is still Christian Dior or Chanel, and it will remain this way for long, but things are changing. We can now feel a different craze, a real legitimacy for resellers to offer alternative perfumes. It is the same with the press, department stores, and independent perfume stores in French regions, which gradually increase their niche perfumery offerings when they notice an added value. For some of them, this segment can account for 60% of their turnover. The distribution network evolves according to the market demand. The fact that a department store like Printemps dedicated such an important part of their new space to alternative perfumery is an important signal. Premium Beauty News - What is the key to Avery Perfume Gallery's success? Celso Fadelli - In each point of sale, we mix very different brands, because that is how we can gather as many consumers as possible. These really varied worlds intertwine harmoniously in the same space, and that is the key to Avery's success: we know how to target different publics with young brands, more classic brands, or brands that will reach different sensitivities. We also help people discover a style, an emotion, and corresponding brands. The emotional dimension is the best hope for survival for our stores. Distribution is going to change for concepts that nourish the experience more deeply."
Chalhoub Group launches its own oriental fragrance line,"According to the Chaloub Group, Saudi consumers spend an average of US$ 700 per month in oriental fragrances. Such massive purchases, combined with a growing interest from tourists visiting the UAE, form an important market with huge prospects for the future. However, existing local brands and stores often lack of quality and fail to meet contemporary expectations, said the group. ""Many brands either have a very limited assortment or in sometimes not very qualitative formulations. It is rare to find a brand offer in the market that fulfills all of the consumers fragrance layering needs. In this category, younger consumers need to experience something more contemporary. They want to experience a new offering that fits their modern lifestyles however while remaining grounded in their heritage and culture,"" Patricia Khoury, Head of Marketing at Ghawali, Chalhoub Group. In the Persian and Arabic cultures, layering is a key element of the art of perfume. It consists in the application of multiple layers of oils, or attars (such as musk, oud, rose or jasmine) that will be used to infuse clothing and hair. ""In the Arabic culture, fragrance is more than just a scent; it is linked to traditions, values, status and heritage, hence strong emotional bonds with the brand are essential,"" said Patrick Chalhoub, co-CEO of the Chalhoub Group. Featuring a total of 90 products, the Ghawali collection of scented products has been designed to facilitate the layering ritual. The range spans from perfumes, oils, Bokhour, and precious Oud to bath and body products such as shower gel, hair and body oil and body cream to complete the ritual. Through this new venture, which combines a line of oriental fragrances and the corresponding stores, the Chalhoub Group aims to develop a differentiated offering which recaptures the ritual aspect, through a modernised, structured and luxurious retail concept while remaining rooted in heritage and culture. ""We created Ghawali with the aim of being closer to our customers, to create memorable shopping journeys and offer a unique and personalised service within luxurious surroundings. Ghawali means something precious, something dear and this is how we feel about our Guests,"" adds Patrick Chalhoub. The first Ghawali store (with a surface of about 170 sqm) opened its doors in Dubai Festival City on 26th of August followed by a second store of 132 sqm in City Walk in September. Three Ghawali stores also opened in Saudi Arabia, in Riyadh on the 31st of August (170 sqm) and in Jeddah at the Noujoud Centre (165 sqm) and at Sea Mall (186 sqm) on the 2nd the 9th of September, respectively. This is only the beginning as the Chalhoub Group plans on expanding Ghawali to the entire region within the next five years."
iTiT Cosmetics celebrates its fifth anniversary,"Premium Beauty News - This year can be considered a milestone for iTiT Cosmetics! Mirko Panico - It is indeed a special year. Five years ago iTiT Cosmetics was founded with the aim to create a new company specialized in the design, study and manufacturing of high profile cosmetics. iTiT Cosmetics is the result of an idea and an entrepreneurial partnership between me and Raquel Melgarejo Antequera. We had a vision: ""Global Cosmetics Designer"". A unique and innovative concept in the field of cosmetics, which proposes ideas, concepts and unique products.

Berdoues bets on the growth of niche perfumery in Brazil,"Launched in 2015, it took only a few months for this premium line to conquer more than 25 markets, in Europe, the USA, the Middle East, and even in Asia. ""Founded in 1902 by Guillaume Berdoues, the company presents a real beautiful story of perfume creation and manufacturing, and we entirely make our fragrances ourselves. So, given our strong culture, Sophie Berdoues, the group's current President, decided to support the niche perfumery wave and develop a luxury line of beautiful perfumes,"" explains Alain Bastoul, the group's Export Director. Similarly to exceptional wines, delicate materials and care are what made the collection immediately popular. It is in this context that the group entered the market with eight references, in partnership with Cristiane Vilar, the only distributor dedicated to niche perfumery in Brazil, and the founder of the Cosmopolitan do Brasil store in Brasilia. Available in Brazil for the equivalent price of EUR 120, which includes the extra cost associated with the entry taxes, the Grands Crus perfumes are sold in four points of sale at this stage, including Cosmopolitan do Brasil. ""We are hoping to open about twenty doors in the long run, by choosing exactly which retailers love beautiful perfumery,"" asserts Alain Bastoul. In this country, where perfume is king, the most famous brands also remain the most popular among Brazilian consumers, who are keen on well-known classics. Nevertheless, under the influence of initiatives like Cosmopolitan do Brasil and of the American model, Brazil is gradually opening to alternative perfumes. ""It has a great potential, as Brazilians travel a lot and can see what is going on elsewhere. The demand is going to rise,"" Alain Bastoul declares, before concluding that ""alternative perfumery is likely to make up 10% of market shares for the three years to come."""
The COSON phenomenon,"A total staff of 320, three factories, including one in China, USD 650 million in sales, the COSON Company, (short for ""COSmetic champiON"") is undeniably the up-and-coming company in the sphere of world sub-contractors serving the make-up industry. A rather original story, that of the company, which started in 2000 with the creation of one and then several skincare brands. Products developed are good, not to say excellent, and in no time the company enjoys a meteoric rise propelling it among the leading companies in South Korea. In 2014, the Head of the company decides to complement its activity by becoming a subcontractor and to extend its scope of action from skincare to make-up. The right move obviously, since this year the firm can boast a total turnover of USD 650 million, including USD 150 million from make-up, on par with the turnover achieved by skincare. And demand is so high, the three existing production units, in Korea and China, are no longer sufficient. A new factory covering an area of 9,000 sqm will be built from the ground up, in Korea next year, next to the 6,400 sqm current site. Fifty-five people work full time at the R & D department and no one can deny that at each trade show to which the firm takes part, in particular the ""MakeUp In"" events, the COSON stand is busy all day long. Best of all, the company has also positioned itself as an ""incubator"" of new brands by creating a division called ""OBM"" that currently manages 30 brands. A dynamic and visionary man, Mr. Lee...! Quite enough in any case, to seriously challenge major current market subcontractors, especially since the reputation in terms of innovation of COSON is not over done. As a proof, the recent and amazing formulas developed by the Korean company showing sceptics that it is still possible to innovate in this sector. To note finally, that the company has decided to partner with the Hunan Yujiahui Cosmetics Company, a leader in the Chinese sheet masks market, to secure the ever-growing market for its cosmetics. Hunan Yujiahui Cosmetics will start with COSON's sheet masks and in the future will develop products through original development manufacturing (ODM), the company explained. COSON already has a strategic partnership with Yujiahui to supply ODM products to its four brands, including Yunifang, which has topped the Chinese sheet mask market."
Schwan-Stabilo Cosmetics is celebrating the first year of existence of its us plant in Murfreesboro,"Premium Beauty News - Can you take stock of this first year in Murfreesboro and maybe tell us more about your plans for the future? Thomas Krasser - It's been a great journey and we are very happy with the results so far. Production is in full swing, and we are just in the process of extending the local product portfolio with custom-made, innovative formulas and new products. In addition to product development and manufacturing, the focus is also on turnkey solutions and supply chain services that are geared towards the individual needs of our customers and are thus meeting the dynamics of the market. Premium Beauty News - The American market has always been important for Schwan Cosmetics. But this year is special for your company, isn't it? And you are returning to MakeUp in New York ! Thomas Krasser - Yes, definitely. It is exactly one year since we took the very important step of opening our Competence Centre in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. With our state-of-the-art plant and the label Made in the USA we offer our American customers exclusive added value and have taken the importance and the needs of the US consumer market even more into account. In Murfreesboro we develop and manufacture a large variety of cosmetic products exclusively offered on the US market – this clearly reflects how focused we are on American consumers and their specific needs. With this year's MakeUp in New York, we've now come full circle, and are happy to again be part of this important beauty industry platform. This is also the perfect occasion for thanking our customers who have accompanied us on last year's journey. Premium Beauty News - Which product novelties and innovations will you present this year? Thomas Krasser - This year's Zeitgeist & Colour Trend presentation is all about change. The three trend topics – Emancipating, Transforming, Awakening - represent different types of women, symbolic for an ever-changing world. In keeping with this vision, we will show a wide selection of innovative products for different skin types and applications. Especially for the American market, our R&D Team in Murfreesboro developed a new, highly nurturing lip butter generation, which will be shown in a Limited Edition Collection. Another focal point is the launch of unique applications for Liquid Liners. Visitors can look forward to an extended range of our popular pen-type products plus a new Liquid Liner Tool that allows several line widths (such as cat eyes) and – thanks to its 24h durability - is also suitable for body tattooing."
Fiabila: More than EUR 65 million invested in five years!,"With the regularity of a metronome, Fiabila is unfolding its impressive modernization and development strategy. The motto of the Miasnik family, ""Be the best and stay the best"" could not be truer year after year. In five years and a half, the French firm spent more than 66.5 million euros to stay at the top. ""There is no other choice,"" insists Pierre Miasnik. ""Regulatory requirements and our customers' needs don't allow us any respite. Since our inception in 1977, the quality and performance of our formulas have always been our primary commitments. Our French plant in Eure et Loir is a proof of this and, as was done on a smaller scale in Brazil, we are duplicating the process in the U.S., with in addition the aim to invest in conditioning activities and to open an office in Los Angeles. The total investment in the U.S. will thus amount to USD 20 million."" It may be recalled that the new facilities of the French plant are home to 16 tanks for the storage of raw materials, 4 kilometres of pipelines to convey them separately with no risk of cross-contamination, not to mention the fact that the computerization and security of processes were stepped up at each production stages. Good environmental practices and working conditions are also key components of this industrial combination. Hence the trapping and reprocessing of volatile compounds and the recycling of washing solvents enables to reduce our carbon footprint. The delivery of bulk raw material with dedicated tanker lorries, allows saving several thousand metal barrels per year. Finally, as a consequence, the increased automation contributes both to enhance the safety of the employees and improve the working conditions. ""With this industrial tool and these new processes, insists Pierre Miasnik, we really pushed the limits to a level never reached before!"" A 2016 year that looks very promising for the Group with a turnover expected to post a double digit growth rate. ""And this, explains Pierre Miasnik, in spite of relative market stagnation in the U.S. and Europe, although South America is progressing. We are constantly winning over new market shares, which tends to show the level of confidence market players, large or small, have in us. A loyalty that did not happen by chance. We have the product lines the market is looking for. Our customers know that they will find with us quality not to say consistent quality"". Whether in Europe, Brazil, the U.S., Japan, Mexico, India, China... the Group will keep up the pace in its industrial investments strategy. ""We also invest a lot in research and creativity,"" underlines Pierre Miasnik. ""It is essential because market players are more and more in demand for new products!"" To note that the company was granted its final operating license for Brazil, namely the Anvisa, meaning that its production site can now start running, both from an operational and regulatory point of view."
The digital revolution is central in L'Oréal's recent US acquisitions,"The acquisition of IT Cosmetics is the biggest for L'Oréal, since the acquisition of Yves Saint Laurent Beauté in 2008 for 1.15 billion US dollars. The total amount paid by the French cosmetics group is almost 7 times higher that IT Cosmetics net sales over the last12 months (US$ 182 million at the end of June), which may seem quite expensive. However, IT Cosmetics is growing strongly (+ 56% year on year to end June), thanks to an efficient multichannel distribution network combining TV shopping and online sales with a presence in major beauty retails such as Sephora and Ulta. ""Another example of a great beauty player grabbing a small innovative, original and successful brand,"" commented analysts at Société Générale. Last week, for instance, Unilever took over Dollar Shave Club, another US start-up leading US online sales of male shaving products, for a price representing about seven times the company's annual sales. The digital revolution has ""completely transformed barriers to entry such as marketing and distribution"" and the consequence is that the beauty market is getting increasingly ""uberized"", said Thomas Owadenko, CEO of start-up Octoly, which specialises in partnerships between beauty brands and digital. Most of these influencers are passionate consumers of beauty products, mostly young women, such as their followers, mostly digital natives. To attract the youngest generations of consumers, major cosmetics groups began by forging promotional partnerships with social networks celebrities. L'Oreal, for instance, partnered with American YouTuber Michelle Phan or French Enjoy Phoenix. Estée Lauder partnered with Instagramer Kendall Jenner. As far as US beauty niche brands like Tarte, Too Faced, E.L.F. Cosmetics, Anastasia Beverly Hills or IT Cosmetics are concerned, they have focused on less famous but increasingly popular influencers. They were also closer to their target audience. Brands offered them recently new products for free so as they can test and - maybe - make public comments. This inexpensive marketing strategy proved very lucrative. ""New American beauty brands are really hacking the market. They divert codes, they show unbridled creativity, can quickly catch the latest trends and have very good knowledge of alternative retail channels and social networks,"" Leila Rochet-Podvin, founder and manager of consulting firm Cosmetics Inspiration and Creation, told AFP. Conversely, stay at the forefront of trends is ""a true challenge to traditional brands"" as beauty influencers ""are eager to find original and unique products,"" added Leila. To meet this challenge, L'Oréal took over successful US makeup brand NYX at the end of 2014 with the aims to learn more from its marketing model and to develop the brand globally. ""We're like a small start-up within the L'Oréal group,"" said Elise Ducret, head of NYX France, in an interview with AFP. The brand's expert knowledge of communication on social networks has been a key factor of its success. ""Highlighting the brand's influencers and consumers,"" has been the main promotion and communication tool. In France, for instance, a network of about 30 web influencers was carefully selected. However, NYX does not pay them, states Elise Ducret. ""Actually, they do not want to contract with a brand, to maintain credibity,"" in the eyes of online communities. However, paid partnerships between brands and influencers are not uncommon. Bloggers, YouTubers and other Instagramers have gained such a huge influence that several of them have been able to professionalize their business. The quality of their articles, photos or videos is often the demonstration that this is now a serious job. Many beauty brands or retailers do rely on their skills to boost their presence in social media and may be ready to pay influencers. Taking inspiration from the affiliation programs of online retailers such as Sephora or Amazon, US brand Sigma Beauty, for instance, has chosen to pay web influencers directly on the basis of the sales they generate."
Marionnaud invests to enrich digital experience in beauty stores,"All consumer studies unanimously emphasize the vital importance of the web and social networks in today's purchasing behaviours in the beauty and personal care segments. Consumers get online to find information, compare products and prices, and the buy in store or - increasingly – online. Marionnaud therefore intends to facilitate the purchase experience of its consumers by adding new digital services in its stores. The European beauty retailer now offers free broadband WiFi access in all its beauty stores and salons. Customers can now more easily share their shopping experience, their favourite product or their ""Beauty Code"" on social networks (Facebook, Instragram, etc.). Moreover, watching videos or listening to music will be made easier and more confortable during salon treatments. In order to help customers to have an easy and permanent access to the web and social media, Marionnaud has equipped 77 stores and salons, including the Champs-Elysées flagship store, with new connected smartphone charging boxes named ""bubbles"". This news service will be extended to all Marionnaud stores by the end of 2016. Eventually, Marionnaud now offers the possibility to pay directly to a shop assistant with a new mobile point of sale credit card reader on iPads. This service, which is available in a selection of stores, should accelerate the purchasing process by accelerating the checkout step. ""Digital services reinforce the expertise of our beauty consultants and enrich in store shopping experience. We intend to offer each customer a high variety of connected services and we will continue to innovate digitally in the coming months and years,"" said Eileen Yeo, Managing Director of Marionnaud France. In 2014, Marionnaud was a pioneer among selective beauty retail chains with the launch of a free Click & Collect service. In 2015, all the retailer's stores were equipped with iPads, with several proprietary applications including ""Beauty Code"", a new customized digital service aiming at reinforcing the expertise of beauty consultants and their relationship with customers. Furthermore, since 2015, all Marionnaud stores also offer exclusive and free skin diagnosis in partnership with Ioma, a young brand that pioneered connected and personalized beauty. As far as the A.S. Watson Group, Marionnaud's parent company, is concerned, significant investments in e-commerce, including the launch of several mobile applications, were announced recently, with the aim to strengthen relations with customers online and to enhance online shopping experience. In particular, A.S. Watson explained that its e-commerce business increased by 47% in 2015 in Europe."
"""We are considering our international development with ambition but with no rush,"" Rocco Pacchioni, Puressentiel","Premium Beauty News - How would you describe Puressentiel in a few words? Rocco Pacchioni - Puressentiel is an environmentally responsible brand specialised in aromatherapy products and organic and natural cosmetics, which solely relies on essential oils and pure natural ingredients with proven efficacy. The brand offers some 180 products divided in 25 lines to naturally address the daily health, of the whole family (purifying of ambient air, muscle and joint relief, allergies, respiratory well-being, sleep, slimming...). Efficacy and safety are at the heart of our DNA: 191 scientific studies confirm the efficacy and tolerability of our ranges that can boast a record satisfaction rate of 99.33% from users. Our Supply Chain and Quality Department implemented several charters including the ""Puressentiel Product Quality Charter"" and the ""Puressentiel Raw Materials Quality Charter"" to guarantee quality, eco-friendly raw materials and 100% pure, natural and effective active ingredients. Premium Beauty News - The brand experienced an impressive development in just ten years? Rocco Pacchioni - Puressentiel took advantage of the growing public interest for aromatherapy and natural solutions, while simplifying and broadening its use. Our products are ready for use, and we have carefully prepared our essential oils with well-formulated blends to guarantee optimal efficiency and safe use. At the brand's inception we were able to build on the diversity of the pharmacy network in France to create new markets. The Puressentiel Purifying Air Spray with 41 essential oils, is the brand's best-seller and the very first natural air freshener launched on the marketplace. It is now number 1 in the aromatherapy market with an 8.5% market share in France and a 4.3% growth in 2014. Premium Beauty News - How do you consider your international development? Rocco Pacchioni - With a lot of ambition and no rush! We are already present in 68 countries and more than 25% of our turnover is generated from export sales. For the past three years our ambition has been to open a new subsidiary abroad and to set foot each year in ten new countries with the support of distributors. We are mainly present in Western Europe and Africa. We are ramping up our development in Central and Eastern Europe by entering the Polish market and with some launches planned in September in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. But the really big challenges ahead for us are Asia and North America. We launched our brand in Quebec last year and we will enter English Canada in September. Canada of course is a gateway to the United States where we aim to launch Puressentiel at the end of 2017 or early 2018. We were lucky enough to attract the attention of all the major drugstore networks and we are learning to work with them. And for that, we can leverage our experience in UK with Boots and Superdrugs. It's a big challenge, because the natural market is very fragmented, each country has its own consumption and distribution patterns and its own players. There are few international brands in this sector; we are usually faced with very local competitors. Premium Beauty News - Innovation is at the heart of your success. What are the next steps? Rocco Pacchioni - We have changed the market landscape by inventing new product categories. We have also revolutionized the market of snap-on pumps with large tanks, with our new patented pump PES600. The result of two years of work, this pump with a 600 micron microdispersion, propellant-free - the winner of the 8th edition of the Aerosol & Dispensing Forum (ADF) Awards - allows optimum diffusion using the micro-dispersion of essential oils with no use of propellant gas. We regularly launch new products in all categories where we operate: OTC, medical devices and cosmetics. We will complement our existing ranges at a steady pace: nearly 200 products are under development!"
Italcosmetici: A promising new start,"Premium Beauty News - A year ago, almost to the day, you were taking over Italcosmetici. Quite a challenge with already some satisfactions. Giuseppe Campanella - Yes, indeed, we can only be satisfied! The strategy, which consisted during the first year, in participating to other exhibitions abroad, particularly MakeUp in Paris, enabled to estimate the strong points of the company and its notoriety: more than eighty contacts in Paris, out of which, one third from French companies and the rest from foreign companies including Australia. So, we are very confident for the coming months. So much so that we are seriously considering relocating in new industrial premises by the end of next year. Premium Beauty News - A long standing company, a wide range of products and an excellent image! Giuseppe Campanella - Absolutely! For the past 35 years Italcosmetici has been producing a wide range of face products like foundations ( liquid, semi-fluid or creamy, compact, with SPF protection, cream to powder, moisturizing, matt or shimmer ), stick foundations ( long lasting, covering and pan stick ), concealers (stick, creamy ), powders ( compact, loose, mosaic, powder balls, mineral ), blushes ( compact, loose, stick, creamy ), make up primer and highlighter, mascaras ( classic, volume, long lash, all in one, water proof ), fortifying bases, eyeshadows ( compact, creamy, loose, mineral ), eyebrow fixers (compact, creamy), eyeliners (fluid, creamy, gel, compact), Lipsticks ( different textures, from mat to extra pearled ), No transfer pens, Liquid lipsticks, Lip-glosses ( stick, creamy, poured ), Lip balms, Sun sticks. We design and produce highly innovative top quality products with security standards, high regard and respect for the environment. We offer a tailored service for clients to identify and place new products on the market, laying the bases and supporting them in the pursuit of their success. From research to production to the realization and launching of the product we are able to guarantee a full service. We develop high quality formulas increasingly oriented towards respecting the environment, integrating natural products with active ingredients and processes informed by sustainability. Premium Beauty News - In recent months, you even increase the staff? Giuseppe Campanella - Three new people have joined us in the R & D department, bringing the workforce to 35 people, including 23 women. Women hold the responsibility of 3 out of 6 departments. The company's average seniority is 10 years. 6 graduates and 15 high school graduates. In the past 5 years our employees have attended +100 hours of training on technical, commercial, security and quality matters. Our employees have, globally, over 400 man/years of specific experience in the production of cosmetics! The company's know how is widespread and about half of the employees participating in weekly meetings of planning and activity control. Security and safety is an absolute priority and in 35 years there have been only five incidents, none of them with serious consequences. There have been no cases of illness originated from the working environment. We have a proud history of loyalty within the company. Seven people are in charge of research, development and control activities. The average age is 40 years old, while the company's average seniority is 12 years. Three are graduates, while two are technical high school graduates. The laboratory is equipped with the most advanced machineries available on today's market (centrifuges, viscometers, colorimeters, conductivity meters, agitators, penetrometer, turbo-emulsifier.) and allows us to engage in the full formulation cycle, from formula to pilot production. The laboratory carries directly or outsources at least 10 standard analyses on production. When developing new products, all the analyses on the chemical-physical features, microbiological analyses, search for heavy metals and duration tests, are assigned to external laboratories in order to obtain independent certifications. In 35 years of activity, the company's R&D has produced around 150 texture bases in over 3.000 shades. In recent years we have been more assertive in finding solutions increasingly based on natural raw materials as well as on active ingredients. The lab is able to develop new formulas according to the client's needs, as well as reproducing solutions already on the market. Every year we manage several projects, based on clients' requests. Despite the recent dimensional growth and the increase in volumes of activity, the technical expertise andcreativity, we have maintained the ability to develop personalized solutions for each of our clients. Premium Beauty News - A few words about the production tool… Giuseppe Campanella - Production is articulated in three departments: emulsions, powders and filling/packing. The emulsions department makes use, among other things, of 17 fusers with mixer (5-150 kg), 3 fusers with turbine (12-100 kg) and 4 turbo-emulsifiers (8-150 kg). The powders department employs 1 rod mill (over 300kg of productive capacity per day), 13 powder mixers, 2 moist powder mixers, 4 coating pans and 3 ovens with a daily productive capacity of over 200kg per day of powder balls or 80/100 kg per day of powders. The packing department uses several filling machines (6.000 pieces per day), as well as one automatic machine for lipsticks (2.000 lipstick per hour), and 8 semi-automatic compactors. The productive activity undergoes constant quality controls that employ 3 people full time. In 2015, Italcosmetici have managed almost 500 orders from 40 clients located in 24 different countries. Logistic activity has transferred 120 tons of merchandise in over 300 international deliveries. Despite the recent dimensional growth and the increase in volumes of activity, the productive and logistical capacity of Italcosmetici maintains the ability to develop personalized solutions for each one of its clients. We also offer to our clients the possibility to buy the following products in bulk (Lipstick paste, MOQ 10 kg, Mascara, MOQ 50 kg black 30 kg coloured, Eyeliner, MOQ 30 kg, Eyeshadows, MOQ 10 kg, Blush, powders and bronzers, MOQ 25 kg, Powder balls, MOQ 30 kg mono-coloured 100 kg multi-coloured cocktail, Foundation, MOQ 50 kg, Cream concealer, MOQ 30 kg, Lipgloss, MOQ 10, 25 or 30 kg, Liquid lipstick, MOQ 10, 20 or 30 kg. The lipstick paste is packaged in blocks weighing 10 kg each. Mascara is packaged in plastic barrels weighing 20 to 25 kg each. Powders are packaged in plastic bags and placed in cardboard boxes weighing 8 to 13 kg. The delivery of the product generally takes place at our plant. Premium Beauty News - You also have a Full service offer? Giuseppe Campanella - Yes, we can offer our clients a full service of design and supply of single products or complete lines. The full service activity starts with the identification of the technical and marketing features of the product or line. At this stage, the client interacts with the lab and our commercial staff. Once the textures, the colours and all the technical characteristics that are able to support the desired commercial claim shave been defined, the lab starts the R&D process that leads to the choice of the formulas. We then proceed to the development of the prototype and the verification of the client's proposals. At the end of this stage, we move on to more complex testing activities that also include the contextual redaction of technical-scientific documentation required by European legislation. The primary and secondary packaging is supplied by Italcosmetici. Generally, the minimum quantity required by single order is lower than the minimum purchasing order for packaging. In this case, for full service's customers, Italcosmetici guarantees a stock service in its warehouse. Depending on the type of order, Italcosmetici can request advance payment for the minimum purchasing order of packaging. The delivery of the product generally takes place at our plant. Despite the recent dimensional growth and the increase in volumes of activity, the productive and logistical capacity of Italcosmetici maintains the ability to develop personalized solutions for each one of its clients. Premium Beauty News - You rely obviously a lot on export sales! Giuseppe Campanella - Historically our company has always had a big influence in Italy and throughout the Middle East. But we plan to expand to other countries in the world."
"""The cosmetics industry is facing many challenges,"" John Chave, Cosmetics Europe","Premium Beauty News - Market data recently published by Cosmetics Europe are rather positive for the European personal care market, despite important disparities between the European states. John Chave - The disparities broadly reflect those of the economic situation in Europe. But the good news is that the market returned to a more robust growth in 2015, despite trying economic circumstances. The European cosmetics and toiletries market grew by +3.1% in 2015, compared to 2.1% in 2014. It is also a demonstration that our industry is constantly adapting to meet the needs of a changing world. A combination of factors such as globalisation, digitalisation and the need for greater sustainability are reshaping consumer behaviour with regard to cosmetics and personal care products. Premium Beauty News - One of the main topics at the Cosmetics Europe Week was the contribution of the cosmetics industry to the European economy and society. John Chave - Actually, when you talk to regulators or legislators about cosmetics, the main topic is usually risk, risk and risk. Sometimes, we can also talk about risk assessment! But we never talk about benefits, which is very different from other industries! Thus, it was very important to stress the benefits of cosmetics in daily lives. Briefly speaking, the cosmetics industry is a big contributor to the competitiveness of the European economy, and to research and innovation in Europe. According to the report prepared by Risk & Policy Analysts Ltd. (RPA) on behalf of Cosmetics Europe, at least 2 million jobs are supported across the European value chain of the cosmetics industry. In 2015, the European cosmetics market was valued at 77 billion euros, making Europe the largest market for cosmetic products in the world. Over 17 billion euros of cosmetic products were exported from the European Union in 2015. Furthermore, the European cosmetics industry is still a very much SME-based industry. There were 4,605 SMEs in the cosmetics industry in Europe in 2015, and the number is growing. Cosmetic products are also an important part of people's everyday life and bring important functional and emotional benefits. Premium Beauty News - What are the key challenges the cosmetics industry is currently facing? John Chave - There are many! First of all, I would mention the move to a more risk-based approach for the assessment of ingredients and products, rather than a hazard-based approach. Another key challenge is product preservation. There are very few new preservatives allowed in the market. We need to defend existing ones and to adopt a more holistic approach of product preservation. Eventually, I also have to mention the ban on animal testing, which is once again before the EU Court of Justice. The outcome might be a more restrictive interpretation of the ban, which would prohibit cosmetics makers to any substance tested on animal for the purpose of other legislations. This would not be consistent with the interpretation of the EU Commission. Premium Beauty News - What about the British vote to leave the EU? What could be the impact on the cosmetics industry? John Chave - Despite Brexit, the UK will remain a very large cosmetics market in Europe. There is also likely to be strong regulatory alignment between the UK and the EU, either because the UK stays in the European Economic Area (in which case the Cosmetics regulation will apply in the UK) or because there will be strong pressure from UK companies to ensure regulatory alignment. Nonetheless, as for all industries, Brexit is a source of damaging instability and uncertainty."
"""L'Oréal knows how to welcome a brand with a strong DNA"", Christophe Cervasel, Atelier Cologne","Premium Beauty News - What are the terms of the purchase? Christophe Cervasel - The whole company was purchased, but Sylvie Ganter and I are still entrepreneurs fully involved in the brand's future management and development. Premium Beauty News - Will this result in a few changes in terms of development? Christophe Cervasel - We have not planned any specific changes. At L'Oréal, they like what we do, and our objective is to do it even better with them. So, we are going to go on with our development strategy around wholly-owned stores, shop-in-shops, and Sephora. We already went very fast with this distribution strategy, which also includes e-commerce, since the brand has known a 100% growth per year since its creation. The idea is to continue along the same exponential lines, thanks to the group's strength, which will help us go faster, and to make the brand grow in the points of sale where we are present today, with new customers. Premium Beauty News - What about the global level? Christophe Cervasel - Atelier Cologne is already present in 40 countries, but we have the ambition to open several stores in the world's largest cities. We have planned to launch Atelier Cologne in Brazil by the end of the year, which we will be able to do even better now, and perhaps we will open a wholly-owned store shortly after we have entered this market. As for Travel Retail, after Paris, London, and Frankfurt, we have other ongoing projects for personalized duty free areas. Premium Beauty News - How were you convinced to join the L'Oréal Group? Christophe Cervasel - L'Oréal managed to seduce us thanks to its capacity to integrate a brand with a highly strong DNA and make it become a global brand, while allowing it to keep its identity, as was done with Kiehl's. They did something extraordinary when they used the group's strength to serve the brand's spirit. What we want is to reproduce this success in perfumery. With the support of a group, there is more strength, more means, more negotiation margin, and in certain trades, more expertise, in particular in retail. L'Oréal are fond of our identity, and we would love to go very far with them!"
Brazilian retailer The Beauty Box plans further expansion in 2016,"Premium Beauty News - How many stores does The Beauty Box currently have in Brazil? Breno Salek - We have 37 stores in five Brazilian states: São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Paraná, Distrito Federal and Minas Gerais. Premium Beauty News - What is more lucrative for the company in terms of sales - physical stores or online retail? Breno Salek - Brands these days have to connect to customers through every available channel, be it physical or digital. Both are profitable and e-commerce shows a lot of potential; it has been continuously gaining traction in our business. Premium Beauty News - What are the top-selling brands in your network? Breno Salek - The international blockbusters are Carolina Herrera, Dior, Paco Rabanne and Lancôme. Semi-exclusive labels like French brand Nuxe, Lee Stafford from the UK and US-based The Balm are also very popular, as well as our own brand, which is increasingly gathering new fans. Premium Beauty News - What is your brand's strategy right now, considering that in the last few years there has been a high penetration of international brands in the Brazilian market and taking into account the shift of domestic brands towards lower-income consumers? Breno Salek - We have a high-low portfolio strategy to supply customers from A to Z. To ensure our marketing mix matches with this wide audience, we gather intelligence on the customers visiting the shopping malls where we operate and on the purchase power in each region. In my experience, people have so much access to information these days that certain brands and products are sought after despite their social class. What changes is the payment method [1] and the impact on the consumer's budget. Premium Beauty News - What is The Beauty Box's demographics? Breno Salek - We have a very wide audience, with women in different age groups, as well as a sizeable male audience that seeks out to our men's grooming and male fragrances sections.

Premium Beauty News - Which category is more popular - fragrances, hair care or makeup? Breno Salek - Perfumes are undoubtedly the workhorse of the business. Makeup is growing nonetheless, in part due to the constant innovation brands bring to the table and the fact that it's a segment closely connected to the fashion world. Premium Beauty News - What sales strategies have been giving out the best results for The Beauty Box? Breno Salek - We're always offering new experiences to the point of sale, bringing the brand's universe closer to consumers by offering trials, exclusive gifts and attractive deals. We also invest heavily in visual merchandising, with information that puts the products into context, and offer a beauty curatorship to customers, with recommendations for their daily beauty routine. Premium Beauty News - What's next for The Beauty Box? Breno Salek - We're opening 15 new points of sale in 2016, opening way for new markets in the Northeast and South of Brazil. We're also investing heavily on our e-commerce platform, which is vital to our omnichannel approach."
Comptoir Sud Pacifique opens a first store in Paris,"Built around the idea of travelling and quality ingredients, the French brand has enjoyed a new boom since it was purchased. The opening of its wholly-owned store mirrors its growth strategy and will to demonstrate the diversity of its new range. ""Since 2011, we have taken the time to work on our products, enrich our line, and consolidate our distribution network"", explains Valérie Pianelli-Guichard. And since then, the company has doubled its turnover and developed its export presence. Already available at Beauty Success, Passion Beauté, and from independent perfume stores in France, Comptoir Sud Pacifique will now be able to express the breadth of its concept. Located Rue Saint Roch, near Place Vendôme and Rue St Honoré, a quarter dear to alternative perfumery, the turquoise and white-coloured 25m2 area showcases all references, including those reserved to export. ""We have been historically related to this quarter, since the brand used to have a store near the Opera, Rue de la Paix. It is a nice environment for niche perfumes,"" comments the Director. Right in the heart of the area, an olfaction table stages the six main olfactory families (floral, oriental, citrus, woody, marine, sweet) using raw materials presented under lids. There are two approaches available for each family to guide visitors in their discovery experience. ""I wanted something simple and educational to let people choose their own olfactory environment and find the perfume that best suits them more easily among the 35 we showcase"", adds Valérie Pianelli-Guichard. Just like in a concept store, ranges of ethnic-chic-inspired accessories, bags, scarves, and jewels mingle with perfumes and cosmetics. The atmosphere conveys the brand's lifestyle with summer colours and travelling and escapism inspirations. Strongly attached to her own independence, Valérie Pianelli-Guichard intends to make the brand develop at its own pace: ""From an intellectual standpoint, that is what I am interested in, and I have not achieved everything I wish to yet,"" she adds. Among her priorities, she aims to open other wholly-owned stores, mainly in the countries where the brand is already well-established, like Italy."

Olfactive Studio calls on crowdfunders to finance their new bottle,"Premium Beauty News - Why choose this type of solution? Céline Verleure - I had already thought about crowdfunding five years ago, when I created the brand, but there was no funding platform dedicated to this kind of operations then. However, we had actually got consumers involved by launching a Facebook group named Blog du parfum qui n'existe pas (encore) – A blog for a perfume that does not exist (yet) – which invited people to interact with the artistic direction by giving their opinions and ideas, or just reacting. This collaborative project helped design and develop the first fragrances. It is interesting to make people participate, because it creates a relationship and, from a financial standpoint, it can help reach new levels. Premium Beauty News - So, today, crowdfunding can actually help you create a new bottle? Céline Verleure - It can! Until now, the Olfactive Studio bottles were standard. This operation will help us finance the mould of our new exclusive bottle. It represents a huge investment and a real financial constraint, since we are in a transitional year and we have been suffering from the slowdown of certain markets like Russia. The sum was fixed at 25,000 dollars, which makes 22,000 euros over an extendable period of one month. In compensation, and depending on the donations, people get perfumes of the line, samples, candles, and other prizes. It is also a way to discover our fragrances. This bottle will be used for our next perfume named Close Up, a wild amber scent to be released in September, and which donators will be able to discover as a preview. Premium Beauty News - You have chosen the Indiegogo site: why an American platform? Céline Verleure - It is the biggest international platform to accept foreign companies, and the objective is flexible. Americans are also more used to this approach and really attracted to niche brands. But the operation is open to everyone and relayed via social networks, Facebook, and bloggers from different countries. Right now, the project has gathered 66 donators and reached 22% of the objective. The progression towards the goal is updated in real time here."
"Pennelli Faro: More than ever ""Made in Italy""!","Premium Beauty News - Finally your development, these past years, is a proof that manufacturing in Europe under the ""Made in Italy"" seal remains a significant asset in the face of Asian competitors? Sara Zanafredi - Yes, we have the headquarters and the entire production process in Italy, located in the historic and traditional brush manufacturing district of the Cremona area, producing some of the finest brushes on the market since 1971. A dedicated team of technicians and our investments in the research and development of new equipment, together with the constant research of new materials and manufacturing processes, keep us definitely ahead in our field. Our range of brushes covers presently the following areas: Cosmetic, Fine Art, Cake Design, Fashion Applications and Industry. We manufacture each brush with craftsmanship: highest quality materials, attention for the details, natural sense of beauty and true passion for what we do. Premium Beauty News - From standard to specific products? Sara Zanafredi - We have a wide range of brushes in our standard collections to choose from but, on top of that, we offer the possibility to create fully customized and tailor-made products. Our reliable experience and attentive customer care allow us to meet the requirements and needs of all our clients. Details are small but affect tremendously the whole result. We take great care in every aspect of production and we consider very attentively to the inputs from customers, striving to get the magical details that transform a product into something more unique.

Different types of packaging solutions and POS materials that help to enhance the product's value. We understand how important it is for our clients to respect timing schedules and to have the products delivered on time. They can always count on our sharing the same priorities and putting a great emphasis on that! Premium Beauty News - What new products have you launched on the market recently? Sara Zanafredi - We launched the TIP&BLEND™ brush collection, an innovative range of brushes created to apply both liquid and compact foundation as well as make-up bases. It was created after months of development and design research carried out by Pennelli Faro Research and Development team. This make-up brush is therefore the result of in-house innovation and, for its high-performance and cutting-edge qualities in make-up industry, Pennelli Faro decided to have it protected by an international patent. The TIP&BLEND™ line of brushes is made with a special synthetic fibre, dermatologically tested, hypoallergenic and obviously cruelty free, called DERMOCURA®, which has been developed internally by our Research and Development team. The central tip is the heart of the product, it is used to apply makeup precisely and specifically, to various areas of the face, creating those chiaroscuro effects used especially in contouring. The lip brush, the most recently developed one, is particularly suitable for defining very precisely the lips line and then apply lipstick on the lips. We are also having a remarkable success with our SOFT&FULL range of brushes. As the name says, it is made with a particular type of fibre, synthetic and dermatologically tested, which gives the brushes' head a feeling of softness and at the same time a of fullness very pleasant on the skin."
Alexandre. J: Niche perfumes that are just different,"Amélie Jabban, Project Manager, needed belief and perseverance to launch her family brand. ""At first, we got turned down by several French distributors, but we also had a mixed reception from the press,"" she recalls. But where did that relative scorn come from? The brand actually highlighted its own difference! As it adopted almost none of the niche perfumery codes, Alexandre. J did not fit in any category and remained on the fringe of the selective and niche perfume segments. The concept developed by Alexandre. J – named after the brand's creator and founder – is based on the combination of radical decisions and preferences. On the one hand, the brand has a very assertive visual identity expressed by sophisticated packaging with a strong added value: the coloured, decorated bottles are designed by Alexandre J. himself, ornamented with noble materials like mother-of-pearl, glass paste, or pearls, and presented in a hand-designed leather box well-adapted to gifts. On the other hand, it offers olfactory creations with a strong personality, designed with the help of the new generation of perfumers, like the Flair workshop. ""It is essential for us to work with young independent perfumers. There is a crucial close relationship that helps create juices at the core of the creation process. They are good listeners and do not try to develop a commercial relationship between us,"" Amélie Jabban emphasizes. Formulated with no compromise on the quality and choice of ingredients, the compositions are all eaux de parfum and express the main note first. ""Our specificity is to bank on the top note so that consumers understand the perfume at once. The first impression is the right one, the one that remains even if the perfume changes,"" she adds. This olfactory path makes the least-informed consumers more daring, and these luxury perfumes are more easily accessible than most in this category: the low-end products of the Collector collection are available for 95 euros for a 100ml bottle. So, the advantage for Alexandre. J seems to be to help niche perfumery reach a broader public. And despite estimations, the brand actually seems to be finding its own place and public. The brand is distributed in 37 countries and 1,000 points of sale, including about ten in France, where the concept is getting more popular. ""Things work very well in most points of sale in Paris and across France. Forty-five items were sold at Jovoy's last month. We are part of a flow, that of democratized niche perfumery, and we target all types of customers with all budgets,"" Amélie Jabban comments. The Black Musks bestseller is the same on all markets, but the Project Manager explains she listens to every country's desires and specificities, and spends time in-store on all continents to understand customers, their expectations, and the words they want to hear. ""Customers often do not know what they want, they buy because it is well-known, or they had a favourite fragrance from the beginning, or they want something different. We must help and support them with simple, accessible, catchy words. The negative estimations we had at the beginning actually reflect a lack of knowledge of French consumers,"" Amélie Jabban concludes."

SIMP invests in a new production site in France,"Injected cosmetic applicator creator SIMP has managed to completely transform itself: after doubling its turnover in five years, it is now getting ready to keep up its fast growth for the next few years! Since the former subcontracting SME was taken over in 2011 by Alain Blondel and Éric de Bardonnèche, it has become a reference in design and innovation for mascara applicators and elastomer wipers, and is now positioned as one of the main world leaders. Every year, the company provides its customers with new exclusive models or models available in its standard collections. The company is banking on new capacity means to strategically and efficiently keep up with this development. Since last June, its subsidiary in Mexico has had another 1,700 m2 plant with a capacity of 35 million units. Located in Aguascalientes, the plant is dedicated to the production of rubber parts for the cosmetics industry, in particular mascara wipers, to subcontracting on plastic and rubber local markets, and to assembly operations. In France, SIMP has decided to invest in the construction of a new production site just south of Paris, in Tigery, to replace the Draveil plant in 2017: ""The site selected is close to the current plant, so that the whole staff can be easily moved there, which is crucial to preserve the expertise accumulated. It is also at the core of an interesting logistics hub for production flows,"" the company managers explain. The building operations will be launched in autumn 2016 for the transfer to take place in summer 2017. SIMP plans to increase its production area twofold (6,500 m2 on a 14,000 m2 area), with premises that will meet the most rigorous safety, environmental, and cosmetic standards. The new plant will still comprise two production workshops for plastic and rubber to maintain all flows and integrate state-of-the-art machines. In a fast-moving competitive context, it is aimed to help the manufacturer remain at the cutting edge of innovation and give him new advantages in terms of capacity, agility, and time-to-market. ""It is a major step in SIMP's history that will help it develop even further and comfort its global leader position on the mascara brush market,"" emphasizes Alain Blondel, CEO."
Natura invests in new sales channels to rekindle growth,"After over four decades offering its products exclusively through direct selling, Natura took an important step toward its goal of regaining leadership in the Brazilian market with the opening of its first store in Morumbi Shopping, in São Paulo's southern suburbs. Natura hopes the convenience and experimentation offered by the physical stores will drive sales, and the synergy among the different channels will increase consumer awareness. Shareholders received the news with relief after a season of bleak announcements. Natura closed Q1 with a R$ 69.1 million loss, adding up to a 40% revenue gap that has been growing since 2012. The company has been facing fierce competition from rivals such as O Boticário, which went from a speck in the rearview mirror to a worthy adversary since its brand revamp five years ago. Premium Beauty News - Natura is a benchmark in direct selling in Brazil. What is driving the company to diversify its sales channels? João Paulo Ferreira - Direct selling will still be our main sales channel, while the stores will take a complementary role. We believe in a synergetic effect taking place between them because our customers are always striving for convenience and now will be able to get our products through different means. The brick-and-mortar stores will enable them to try out new products and further discover our brand, which benefits all sales channels. Premium Beauty News - So the idea is for both channels to coexist? How will this decision impact the work of Natura's sales representatives? João Paulo Ferreira - We see complete synergy between the two channels. Our vision is that by increasing the supply for our customers, everybody wins. Opening up a new channel generates new opportunities as well as an increase in sales potential for our representatives with a boost in brand awareness. Opening stores advances our plans of becoming a multichannel company. We had already taken important steps down this path such as the distribution of the SOU range in drugstore chains. At the same time, we strongly believe direct selling takes a center role in serving our customers, so much so that we invested in new payment options and digital tools for our sales representatives. Premium Beauty News - The idea is to segment the product range into different sales channels? João Paulo Ferreira - We have a very large product offer, with lines that are more suitable for this or that channel. At the stores, for instance, we are focusing in makeup and fragrances, which benefit greatly from customers trying them out on the spot. On the other hand, the SOU daily care line is better suited for drugstore shelves. Premium Beauty News - Natura had a concept store at Rua Oscar Freire in 2015, but the decision now is to open stores in shopping malls. What are the reasons behind this decision? João Paulo Ferreira - The concept store was part of our learning process to put into practice a carefully structured plan to open our own stores. Our retail strategy, at this point, prioritizes retail stores in busy shopping centers. Premium Beauty News - Is the brand looking into a franchise model or is it sticking to direct ownership for now? João Paulo Ferreira - We are focusing on having our own stores for now, and it is crucial that we follow them up closely to ensure the stores reflect our core values and beliefs. The franchise model is a possibility for expansion in the future. Premium Beauty News - How are Natura's plans to expand internationally? João Paulo Ferreira - Our international operations are becoming more and more relevant for our business. We will continue to invest in globalizing our brand, and this is the centerpiece of our expansion strategy. Natura is now present in six LatAm countries - Argentina, Peru, Chile, Mexico, Colombia and Bolivia - as well as France. The Aesop brand has 135 stores in 18 countries."

L'Oréal Brazil deploys digital tools to attract and retain customers,"Digital innovation has become a priority for L'Oréal Brasil to remain at the forefront of the highly competitive beauty and personal care market. All around the world, the cosmetics giant has been investing in new technologies to smooth its internal procedures, reduce costs and relocate time and money to other areas. This strategy also aims to offer a wider and more varied consumer experience to its target market. ""L'Oréal has made considerable investments in new systems and tools such as mobile apps, CRM, social media monitoring and e-commerce. We view these efforts as part of a greater digital acceleration, which is a high priority for the group on a global scale"", says Paula Costa, chief marketing officer at L'Oréal Brazil. An example was the deployment of the first edition of Beautyhack in March in São Paulo, a hackathon where competing startups developed apps that could potentially improve the company's strategic projects. Beautyhack's challenges included integrating the Dermaclub rewards program into consumers' daily lives; informing and engaging beauty salon professionals on L'Oréal Professionnel, Kerástase, Redken, Matrix and Essie brands; developing an assisted shopping interface for Maybelline products on mobile, tablet and desktop devices; and leveraging luxury products of the L'Oréal Group on special occasions. Out of the 120 startups that took part in the competition, four projects were selected and their winners scored a trip to visit Silicon Valley's iconic headquarters of Google and Facebook. The winning company, NeoMode, received a R$ 100,000 backing to effectively develop its project dubbed Maybeonlline, which integrates online and offline points of sale on a single platform. According to Costa, L'Oréal Brasil is also overhauling its own technology-reliant processes. ""We're revisiting support systems for sales and promotion teams, data managing within the company and media investments. There are several fronts where technology is being used to assure our teams have real time access to vital information,"" she says. L'Oréal is trailing a similar path in Europe by deploying the augmented reality app Makeup Genius, developed in-house at the French headquarters. The app uses a face-tracking feature to allow consumers to try out different looks by applying virtual layers of make-up using their mobiles' front-facing cameras and screens. Users can then share their virtual looks before deciding on a purchase. But L'Oréal's tech revamp doesn't stop at marketing efforts and management tools. The Brazilian branch is also interested in using technology to strengthen ties with its consumers. ""Our digital push encompasses the entire consumer journey, from first contact to purchase, usage and repurchase,"" stresses Costa. ""L'Oréal Brasil's audience is very diverse, which is reflected in our wide range of brands aimed at varied consumer profiles. But digital engagement is something that bridges demographic gaps,"" she says. Costa is quick to remind that their well-ventured innovation experiments have not exhausted the challenges that a dynamic consumer profile poses for the company. ""Our goal is to keep innovation coming by training our marketing professionals in developing impactful ways of engaging the consumer beyond the traditional channels. There's also a need to translate our performance metrics into simple terms, assuring our ROI is worthwhile, and keeping our internal systems aligned with the dynamic and ever-shifting lives of our customers."""
Aircos: Objectives exceeded!,"Premium Beauty News - 2015 was focused on investments? Thomas Sirot - Indeed, we significantly increased our industrial investments, particularly in packaging and in automatic assembly and finishing lines. As you know, we have our own injection machine park at the Ardon site near Orléans (France), which is home to 35 machines. This makes us a fully integrated company, from the packaging to the end product, including the manufacturing of our formulas and filling operations. In terms of formulation, our main development focus remains powders. Our mastery in the different powder formulation and production technologies is one of our featured activities. This allows us also to play a leading role in the field of ""complexion"" but also in the one of eyeshadows, loose powders, body powders, etc. Hence, out of the EUR 900,000 invested industrially over the past two years, 70% benefited to our second production site in Romorantin (France), which has a production and packaging capacity exceeding 100 million units per year. We therefore can boast having a perfect mastery of the case/powder ""couple"" and our image as a Full service provider is not over done. Premium Beauty News - In addition to industrial investments, you also worked on expanding your customer portfolio. Thomas Sirot - This portfolio indeed needed to be broadened. A commercial work, which is really starting to bear fruit not only in France but also overseas. From 10% of our turnover achieved on export sales in 2014, we will reach 25-30% by next year, thanks in particular to a strong breakthrough in the U.S., on both the West and East Coasts. Premium Beauty News - Another strong point is your back injection process? Thomas Sirot - It is clearly thanks to this packaging/formulation expertise that that we wanted and were able to develop this new back injection process called IPM, which enables us to boast a mastery of the container/content compatibility. This process makes it possible to avoid ""traumatizing"" ingredients (in particular pigments and nacres), and therefore achieve amazing softness and brightness. This still accounts for 25% of our business! Which does not keep us from investing in multi-compacting and automated high capacity compacting. Premium Beauty News - What are your other goals? Thomas Sirot - We boast a true expertise in the filling of lipsticks, mascaras and lip glosses; however, we are concentrating on what we do best: Powders, with the ambition of becoming the European leader in this field. So ...., we will tell you more next time."

Our workplace culture is structured around strong values that we refer to as ""High Touch"" which are integrated into every aspect of our business, focused on service, teamwork, innovation and passion. This has resulted in some great stories of career journeys in our business - excellent examples of people who have begun their careers as beauty advisors and are now leading our brands at General Manager level. Premium Beauty News - What industry challenges are you seeing ahead of us? Chris Good - There is a general shift of the industry - everything is developing so fast that keeping-up is a skilful juggling game. New technologies mean that anybody can now start a brand and have a global presence overnight. This encourages a lot of new ideas and the industry is more innovative than ever. In terms of packaging and design South Korea is very innovative, and also California with cosmetics and skin care. We have research facilities in South Korea, Japan and California for instance. It's a real global game, and the challenge is to be agile and inventive to stay competitive. Premium Beauty News - In terms of retail, where do you see growth, strength and creativity? Chris Good - The United Kingdom is a very innovative market. I was appointed here to run the business as an ""emerging market"" not as a mature one. We have created a culture that supports and empowers innovation - what we refer to as 'Test and Learn.' We have been trying out different retail concepts. We were present in Box Park last year (a pop-up retail park in East London), also Piccadilly Circus underground station, and the St Pancras train station. We have to take measured risks to grasp opportunities and London is a great territory to do so. The city is a forerunner in retail. Premium Beauty News - Do you see any big future trends? Chris Good - It's difficult to consider one trend only. There is a real polarisation of the market with the fragmentation of product categories. We don't just talk about 'make-up' for instance, but we talk about make-up sub categories: brows, lips, etc. It's more challenging than ever to be global, serving every category of the market. Being innovative, understanding consumers and being in the ""Field"" are the keys to success. Premium Beauty News - Regarding the ""older"" consumers (over 40), which represent a huge portion of the market in terms of numbers and buying power, what is your strategy to address their needs? Chris Good - The UK demographically is becoming an ageing population. We refer to this group as the ageless consumer. They are equally important, if not more so, than the millennial consumer. Our strategy changes across different brands in our portfolio, we have brands that are targeting younger consumers and some than are targeting an older demographic and the ageless consumer is top of mind for us in everything we do. Premium Beauty News - The male grooming sector is growing, what is The Estée Lauder Companies offering to this segment? Chris Good - We have a rich portfolio of men's brands and products including Clinique for Men, the number one prestige brand in the UK market, LAB Series, Aveda Men, Tom Ford for Men and men's fragrances such as Éditions de Parfums Frédéric Malle. The male market continues to evolve and we're seeing more segmentation and new categories as men become more comfortable with grooming. Our pop-up concept in St Pancras station mentioned earlier, The Grooming Station, was launched to help us understand how men engage with our brands and what men value when shopping for grooming products. The learnings from this concept and others - including a grooming destination in John Lewis Oxford Street and distinctive experiences such as the pop-up Aveda barbershop - are helping us to understand how to provide an enhanced and tailored offering to our male customers."

In addition, we switched to two shifts to guarantee our customers with a timely supply in the best conditions."
Birchbox intends to become the online beauty leader,"Premium Beauty News - What is Birchbox's ambition today, both in France and on the global level? Quentin Reygrobellet - Beyond our will to increase the number of our subscribers, we aim, as we always did, to sell cosmetics online and be the first e-merchant in France and around the world. Today, in France, we are part of the Top 3 of e-retailers, right behind the United States in terms of subscribers, and ahead of the United Kingdom, Spain, Belgium, and Ireland. It is to this end that the box concept was originally designed, as it allows women consumers to test products before buying them. We have a unique large-scale logistics system that has also become a precious marketing and communication tool for our 250 partner brands. This premium tool supports online sales, it is our physical footprint. Premium Beauty News - Will your physical footprint also materialize in points of sale, like in the United States? Quentin Reygrobellet - We do have a vision of what Birchbox developed in the United States: the inauguration of a test physical store in Soho. The idea is to make our customers live the same experience as online, as they can discover our products, in particular with ""The Factory"", which makes it possible for them to create their own boxes in-store, and they can buy products by a selection of brands. We have applied the same principle to our project to open a Birchbox store in Paris within the next 6 to 8 months, but for now, we have been launching small pop-up stores offering a similar experience to ""The Factory"". We were very successful at the Bon Marché department store, so we are going to do it again, also in French regions, this time with Galeries Lafayette in Marseille, Toulouse, and Strasbourg. Premium Beauty News - Is this will to be physically present related to your selective distribution agreement with brands? Quentin Reygrobellet - It is true that in France, the brands we work with would like us to have a store to be able to develop online, but that is the main reason why we launched these initiatives. We do think we need to be present both on and offline to sell cosmetics. Premium Beauty News - Is the box market still as dynamic today? Quentin Reygrobellet - The concept remains attractive and the market keeps growing. We wanted our box to be affordable - around EUR13 - to give all women the possibility to test without any risk. In addition, our subscribers benefit from lower prices when they shop online. So, we have actually created a test-to-purchase transformation tool, and the conversion works pretty well: 90% of our partner brands in 2015 prolonged the experience in 2016 for that particular reason. And statistics even show that beyond developing sales on our website, the box concept contributes to increasing brands' sales at other retailers. In France, e-commerce represents 35% of our turnover, and 50% of our box subscribers shop online. Mathilde Lacombe - Indeed, and we are also very efficient at renewing our box, from all standpoints. Every month, we tell a different story with a new design, a new theme, and new partners, to keep surprising our subscribers. This way, they feel as if they were part of an adventure in the long term. And brands use us as distributors, but also as a marketing agency. Premium Beauty News - So with this 'test-to-purchase conversion' system, the role of consumer feedback must be even more essential to you. Quentin Reygrobellet - Thanks to the beauty questionnaire consumers fill in when they subscribe, the feedback questionnaires, 20 to 30% of which are sent back, and visitor tracking, I guess we know our customers and their consumption habits better than anyone. Besides, all this combined to an algorithm helps us personalize and best target the composition of our boxes, but also our customer relationship. Obviously, this advantage has an impact on the conversion into sales, but it also guarantees the satisfaction to live a unique experience. As for the brands that see us as a research firm, their quantitative/qualitative data feedback and the advice we offer them in terms of digital or content strategies are significantly positive. Premium Beauty News - Have you changed the profile of the brands you distribute? Quentin Reygrobellet - We have many niche and foreign brands, and more and more major brands. Our DNA is to make women discover new launches, not only by unknown brands, but also by other more popular ones."
Kid's cosmetics: Toofruit steps up its development,"Already present in nearly 600 outlets in France (one half in pharmacies and the other in beauty institutes, plus a few Biocoop and Mademoiselle Bio stores) but also in Austria, Belgium and Switzerland, and several Asian countries (China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Taiwan...), the cosmetic brand dedicated to childcare is launching new references. Building on a second successful fund-raising operation in the second half of 2015, the Toofruit brand is accelerating its development with the ambition to become the reference on the children's market. ""This is increasingly the case with pharmacists and beauticians in France, even if the general public does not know us very well,"" explains Stéphane Lafond, co-founder and CEO of the Laboratoire Allistère, which develops and markets the brand. To strengthen its position, Toofruit has planned several launches in the first half of 2016. Were already launched: – two shampoos (with apple-almond and pineapple-coconut scents) specially adapted to sensitive skins, – a hair detangler in a spray format with a cherry-strawberry fragrance, to use on wet or dry hair, – and two dermatological ultra rich dermatological bars (pineapple-coconut and raspberry-strawberry scented), hygiene products soft to the skin and currently very popular in Asian markets like Thailand. Very soon, the French brand will also launch its first food supplements with an ""Energie"" formula and an ""Immunité"" formula. ""Studies show a lack of iodine in diets. Yet this element is essential for neuronal growth. Our two new food supplements are made with a bladder wrack extract, a brown algae rich in iodine. Formulas are also complemented with products of the hive (respectively propolis and royal jelly) and acerola, for its vitamin C benefits,"" explains Stéphane Lafond. Products were designed to bring health benefits to kids as part of a 30- day course of treatment, but it does not mean they are not fun and yummy to eat too. Both foot supplements will come in the form of jellies shaped like orange and mandarin slices. Like all the other Toofruit products, these supplements are manufactured in France and are certified organic by ECOCERT. ""However,"" stressed Stéphane Lafond, ""we mostly insist on the fact that our formulas are specially suited to children's skins, which are much drier than those of adults."" The brand is also developing a second deodorant reference, for children aged 9-10 and above. Finally, after having tested in some Club Med spas specific treatment protocols for kids, Toofruit is also launching its Toofruit Academy in partnership with Club Med. This 20 minute animation performed by a beautician explain to children why the skin must be cleansed, and the effects of pollution. The brand will expand these animations beyond the Club Med spas to most beauty institutes where Toofruit is distributed."
"""Whether in Brazil or on other markets, innovation is the key to our success,"" Camille Da Rocha, Technature","Premium Beauty News - What is your strategy for the Brazilian market? Camille Da Rocha - Our strategy in Brazil is the same as for other areas: we endeavour to meet all our customers' needs and we provide a real full-service offering that includes regulatory procedures. Our strength lies in our masks. Just like on the other markets, we highlight our innovations (biocellulose, powders, hydrogel masks). We are the first to have developed Ecocert-certified organic peel-off masks, and we are the first to have developed peel-off masks that do not require the skin to be hydrated beforehand. We also create many new textures. In Brazil and in France, innovation is our main asset to face low-cost production. We opened commercial offices in Brazil in 2013, which is a real advantage, as it is quite hard to deal with this market from afar. There is a lot of employee turnover there, so we need to visit companies very regularly. Brazil is a huge market, but customer expectations are really diverse: apart from well-known giants, there are plenty of small brands expecting simple services and solutions. Premium Beauty News - How do you cope with import barriers? Camille Da Rocha - We have concluded a partnership with a local importer. They hold an import licence issued by the ANVISA, and they take care of all registration procedures and make the whole importation process easier. In addition, we make sure we group our orders together for financial reasons: it makes deadlines longer, but our customers are always notified of this point. However, we do not aim to manufacture products locally because our policy is to guarantee our customers Made in France quality. Very high-end Brazilian brands are very keen on this point, even if consumers are usually more sensitive to quality and innovation than to the origin of their products. Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us about your latest innovations? Camille Da Rocha - At the last In-cosmetics Brasil show, we showcased a natural hydrogel mask we are the only ones to offer as a Made in France product. Hydrogel masks adapt to the shape of the face perfectly well and provide an instantaneous fresh effect. They are based on sulphate D-galactose and carrageenans (polysaccharides that form the cell wall in various red algae). This association creates a film-forming gel to make it easier for the skin to assimilate the actives. They can take different forms: eye patches, facial masks, etc."
Feelunique speeds up their market conquest in France,"Premium Beauty News - What has been implemented since Feelunique France was officially founded last November? Claire Blandin - Our top priority was to settle in our new offices in the Marais quarter and get the teams working on the website and Parfumeries Rive Droite store managers together, as we have just bought this brand. Feelunique was made available to French consumers two years ago, but since the branch was founded, our teams have been working on localizing the website for France, which involves translating its content and fixing prices in euros in line with the French market (until then, they were given in pounds sterling and translated into euros). In addition, we are now confident with our commercial action plan, which defines our special offers and launching schedule. Our newsletters are drafted in our new offices with a specific editorial content. Also, we have raised our free delivery threshold to EUR 50, instead of EUR 15, so we can deliver tracked parcels to prevent any losses and, above all, guarantee our customers a delivery within 3 to 5 working days. Premium Beauty News - What about your network of points of sale? How important is it within your strategy? Claire Blandin - We have four perfume stores located in the cities of Boulogne, Neuilly, Levallois, and Avenue Marceau in Paris, and the last two are being completely revamped. We are actually re-designing them to get closer to the selective segment's traditional codes, highlighting brands through self-service, a makeup corner, and an animation area. The store located 35 Avenue Marceau is meant to become the brand's flagship, and by May 30, all stores will bear the Feelunique name, unless anything unforeseen crops up with the renovation work. Premium Beauty News - What brands will be available in your points of sale? Claire Blandin - Given the size of the stores, it will not be possible to display the 500 brands available online. However, there will be a rich, varied offering with luxury perfumery classics and a selection of new fragrances from the niche segment. Premium Beauty News - Are you planning to open other stores? Claire Blandin - Right now, we are not planning on widening our network, even if it does contribute to meeting our need to get the brand settled. Premium Beauty News - Talking about this, how are you going to gain fame? Claire Blandin - We will be launching an ad campaign in May. It will mainly consist of digital actions to get some notoriety and attract new customers. Premium Beauty News - Why would French consumers choose the Feelunique website? Claire Blandin - We are the only website to offer brands from the traditional selective channel and niche brands, but also emerging brands, spa and salon brands, parapharmacy brands, professional hair care brands, and digital brands developed by bloggers and YouTubers. Besides, we offer as many British brands, some of which are sold exclusively on our website, as French and global brands. Our customers are actually gaining convenience if they buy our products, since they have access to a very wide beauty offering, all segments included, in only one location!"
A.S. Watson invests to enhance mobile shopping experience,"The A.S. Watson Group, the largest international health and beauty retailer in Asia and Europe, has announced the appointment of Mtel - a Hong Kong headquartered provider of digital solution - as its Asia mobile solution partner for the next three years. Mtel has been tasked with delivering nine mobile apps throughout 2016 for A.S. Watson eLab - the retailer's an in-house digital division - in Asia. The nine mobile apps will all have m-commerce function and also allow customer to carry mobile loyalty card. A.S. Watson also recently announced an agreement between its flagship beauty retail brand Watsons and Baidu Waimai, China's fastest-growing online-to-offline (O2O) platform. Thanks to the agreement, Watsons products can be delivered to door within two hours of order confirmation on Baidu Waimai e-commerce website. With these strategic moves, A.S. Watson intends to accelerate the enhancement of mobile engagement with customers. Since 2014, A.S.

E-commerce is one of the strategy focus for the group, which now has over 105 million loyalty members, seven e-stores in Asia and eight e-stores in Europe (including Superdrug and The Perfume Shop in the UK, Kruidvat in the Netherlands, Marionnaud Paris and ICI Paris XL across Europe).

Watson's extended mobile arm will help to accelerate the implementation of the group's digital strategy in Asia. ""In Asia, the Watsons brand in particular is the most trusted health and beauty retailer brand, and our core customer groups across the region are increasingly mobile savvy,"" adds Malina Ngai. A.S. Watson sees e-commerce and m-commerce as key factors of success in the market. The implementation of the digital strategy is driven by the group's eLab division, which currently employs 80 people in Hong Kong, in the United Kingdom and in Milan, Italy.

Study finds personal care products industry major contributor to U.S. economy,"The Personal Care Products Council - the leading trade association representing the personal care industry in the United States - engaged PwC to measure the industry's economic and social impact on the U.S. economy, using the most recent government data. First of all, the study highlights the significant role the personal care products industry plays to drive and strengthen the U.S. economy. In 2013, the industry achieved US $169.3 billion in total sales with 90 per cent in domestic sales and 10 per cent from exports to international markets. Of the $169.3 billion in sales, $54.5 billion was generated by manufacturers, $47.2 billion by distributors, and $67.6 billion by services providers. The personal care industry also contributes to a strong export economy. In 2014, the U.S. personal care industry produced a $ 5.8 billion trade surplus, exporting $16.9 billion worth of products while imports were $11.1 billion, while the overall U.S. manufacturing sector experienced trade deficits. Furthermore, the global reach of the personal care products industry continues to expand at a faster rate than the manufacturing sector overall, averaging a 9.5 per cent increase in exports annually from 1990 to 2014. In 2013, the industry added nearly $237 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), and supported 3.6 million domestic jobs (2.1 million direct and 1.5 million indirect). The personal care products industry has grown significantly over the last 25 years. Between 1990 and 2014, employment in our industry increased 43 per cent, compared to 27 per cent for U.S. nonfarm employment overall. The study also points out that over two-thirds of the total employment in the industry is in small businesses with less than 50 employees and that women, including women with diverse backgrounds, are at the heart of the industry. The share of management positions held by women in the personal care products industry is higher than the U.S. average. Women and those with diverse backgrounds account for nearly 74 per cent of all industry employment and 61 per cent of management positions. Cosmetics manufacturers invest nearly US $3 billion in research and development annually. In fact, 1 in 11 workers in our manufacturing sector are employed in a science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) occupation, accounting for a total of 5,840 jobs. From 2002 to 2011, the industry increased R&D spending at an average rate of 9.7 per cent annually, compared to 6.9 per cent for manufacturing industries overall. ""In addition to the many tangible benefits our companies offer to consumers, the cosmetics and personal care products industry is directly responsible for creating American jobs,"" said Lezlee Westine, President and CEO of the Personal Care Products Council. ""We are proud to support the economy, contribute to social and environmental programs and meet the needs of American families."""
Beauty Success acquires a new dimension,"Beauty Success, the fourth selective perfumery network in France after Sephora, Nocibé, and Marionnaud, is set to reach a new phase of development. After an 18 million euro capital increase in December 2015, the company has just announced it has purchased the Esthetic Center network and will launch a new brand later this month: Beauty Sisters. Straight after entering into partnership with the Tanguy Parapharmacie network, this purchase has transformed Beauty Success into a multi-brand, multi-activity group dedicated to beauty, with three trades represented: perfumery, beauty salons, and parapharmacies. And to make this transition clearer, the company has changed its name for Beauty Success Group. Purchasing the Esthetic Center network - which gathers both beauty salons and nail care corners with the Beauty Full Nails brand - meant launching an ambitious growth strategy for the group's six brands. With a 1.7% growth, Beauty Success Group achieved ""one of the best performances on the French market in 2015"". It now aims to count 385 Beauty Success stores in 2020, compared to 320 today, 15 to 30 Tanguy parapharmacies in 2020, compared to 5 in late 2015, 135 new Beauty Sisters shops, 80 Beauty Success salons, compared to 6 today, and 250 Esthetic Center salons and Beauty Full Nails corners, compared to 170 right now. And to help drive this growth, all Beauty Success Group brands will be represented at the Franchise Expo show to be held next March 20-23, 2016, at the Parc des Expositions de la Porte de Versailles, in the south of Paris. Thanks to the purchase of the Esthetic Center network, Beauty Success can now also reinforce their interest in the beauty salon market, which undoubtedly represents a significant growth opportunity for the company, in particular as perfume and cosmetics selective brands are struggling. With 11,000 beauty salons and few large chain stores, the French beauty care market is actually much less concentrated than perfumery. At the same time, women's expectations in terms of service quality are likely to get stronger. ""One of our objectives is to enhance and homogenize our quality standards in this sector, while diversifying our services,"" explains Philippe Georges, President of Beauty Success Group. But to this end, we will need to review the positioning of the Beauty Success salons, so that they are actually complementary to the Esthetic Center offering. ""Both concepts are already quite different, though,"" Philippe Georges adds. ""Esthetic center is specialized in services without appointment, and their salons look much less like stores than Beauty Success salons."" Another crucial phase of development for the group was the launching of Beauty Sisters, a brand whose first shop will open at the end of March in Bordeaux, France. ""The concept was designed for 25-year-old young women as a blog-store highly connected to social networks and involving many services as well as new products,"" Philippe Georges explains. The offering will be focused on the Beauty Success private brand and enhanced by the company's makeup artist and models. The small stores (the first one to open will spread across 80 m2) will mainly feature makeup, but also skincare products, accessories, and perfumes, while regularly showcasing new launches. Of course, the idea is to meet new consumer expectations, although the group will not be content with simply following the example of the Kiko or Les Bellista concepts: it intends to offer more of a high-end experience. Ultimately, the 2016-2020 development plan also comprises a significant international part. Beauty Success Group seeks to increase the share of its international business up to 10%, compared to 5% today. With the purchase of the Esthetic Center network, Beauty Success Group is now able to settle in Switzerland. In addition, the group will keep developing in Africa, in partnership with CFAO. 21 Beauty Success stores are scheduled to open in West Africa. The very first one, opened in Abidjan in December 2015, has already achieved one of the highest turnovers of the shopping mall managed by CFAO. ""We are also going to suggest our other brands to our partner, CFAO. But nothing has been decided yet, we have no limit, and Africa is not our only international prospect,"" Philippe Georges affirms. Indeed, Beauty Success Group will take part in the Cosmoprof show in Bologna, Italy, to represent the Beauty Sisters brand and promote its own private brand."
Sephora invests in Brazilian women's desire for makeup and expands its retail chain,"Premium Beauty News - How many stores does Sephora have in Brazil? And what are the top selling products in this country? Andrea Orcioli - We currently have 22 physical points of sale in Brazil, of which 17 are retail stores and five are pop-up stores. We also serve the whole of Brazil through our e-commerce channel. Some of the most popular products are the Naked eyeshadow palette (Urban Decay), the POREfessional facial primer (Benefit), the Rouge Cream lipstick (Sephora Collection), the Ultra HD Invisible Cover foundation (Make Up For Ever) and the Eau de Beauté Beauty Elixir (Caudalie). Premium Beauty News - What are the plans for Brazil in 2016? Andrea Orcioli - We opened two stores in São Paulo and three kiosks in Porto Alegre, Curitiba and Campinas at the end of last year. Our aim for 2016 is to continue growing and bringing exclusive brands and products to our customers, as well as being physically present in new places. We began the year by opening a pop up store at Tijuca Shopping Mall, in Rio de Janeiro, and will invest further in this format, which has really taken off. We will continue to expand our store chain and should land in Rio Grande do Sul later this year. Premium Beauty News - What can Sephora already tell about the behaviour of Brazilian consumers? Andrea Orcioli - We find varied consumer profiles in Brazil. For this reason, we train our cast members so they understand how each client wants to be treated. Some customers want to learn how to apply their own makeup and maintain a skin care routine, while others are looking for tips and there are those who visit the store already knowing what they want to find. We offer a complete experience, which includes the ability to try any product before buying it. In overall terms, Brazil is a very rich market for the beauty industry. Brazilian women care a lot about their appearance and are always on top of the latest trends. At the same time, we live in a continental-sized country with great cultural diversity, which broadens individual tastes even further. One interesting point is that the prestige market in Brazil is historically based on fragrances, but since the arrival of Sephora, consumers have been buying a lot more makeup and skin care products. Premium Beauty News - Is the company thinking of developing a concept store in Brazil? Andrea Orcioli - We already have our flagship store at Eldorado Shopping Mall, in São Paulo. As it is a bigger store, it is where we test product launches and carry out large events. Premium Beauty News - What Brazilian brands are currently available in Sephora? Andrea Orcioli - Feito Brasil is available in our stores, with its natural products for bath, skin and body care, as well as the male grooming brand Dr. Jones. Our website also offers products from other companies, including Duda Molinos, Juliana Paes and Marina Smith by 2beauty. Premium Beauty News - How is Sephora's relationship with male consumers in Brazil? Andrea Orcioli - Brazil is the world's largest fragrances market, which is one of Sephora's strongest categories - and a very attractive one to male consumers. Our portfolio includes exclusive brands such as Guerlain and Acqua di Parma, and also skin care products specially designed for men. Male customers are becoming increasingly more concerned about their looks and they feel more and more at ease with this idea. That is why we offer a dedicated space for men in our stores, where they can browse, choose the products that appeal to them and ask questions to our cast members. Premium Beauty News - Is there an estimate on when Color IQ will arrive in Brazil, considering the enormous variety of skin tones among Brazilian women? Andrea Orcioli - We still do not have a set date for that, but our in-store specialists are trained to help customers find a colour that is right for their skin tone."
Différentes Latitudes to strengthen their relationships with brands,"Premium Beauty News - You celebrated the 10th anniversary of Différentes Latitudes in 2015. How much progress has been made? David Frossard - Our company is developing well. We have now reached a 3-million-euro turnover, and it is reinforced by that achieved by cognac brand Frapin: we bought their perfumery licence in 2007. We employ about ten workers, and we distribute the fifteen brands or so in our portfolio in approximately 500 points of sale in about twenty countries throughout Europe and the Middle East, but also in the United States and Russia. All in all, we hold a portfolio of about 300 perfume and perfumed candle references. Premium Beauty News - How do you see the future after spending the past ten years serving rare perfumes? David Frossard - We worked a lot with many brands to help them settle on the market. Now, we intend to favour the brands with which we can build a close, long-lasting relationship. The market changed following the boom of niche brands. Today, we need as much passion as before, but much more professionalism. And to meet this new challenge, we have chosen to limit the number of brands in our portfolio, but to work even more in depth with those that are ready to invest in their image. When you are an agent, you know that when the first brands you got in your portfolio develop well, they will end up standing on their own two feet, so you need to regularly try and discover new gems. However, we no longer want to just act as a business incubator, we actually wish to support brands on a long-term basis and get more stability in terms of development. So, we have been strengthening our ties – in particular our capital ties – with brands. And that is what we have been doing with Liquides Imaginaires: now, they have a turnover of one million euros, and we are trying to raise funds for the second time. Premium Beauty News - What about new projects? David Frossard - Last September, we launched the parfumsdecreateurs.com website, a directory of niche perfumes and alternative perfumery in France, to inform consumers on brands and help them find the nearest points of sale. We have also just created L.A. Bruket in France, a Swedish skincare brand based on natural actives derived from algae, essential oils, and traditional herbs. Besides, in coherence with this will to reinforce our relationships with brands, we are planning to create and launch BAST, a brand that develops very technical skincare products for sportsmen and women. Apart from that, we certainly aim to develop our retail activity. The Liquides perfume bar concept we inaugurated in 2013 is very popular. The shopping experience we managed to design to focus on services and advice works extremely well, and now we intend to give it more visibility. To this aim, we have been looking for the right partner and a well-adapted site. At first, it might well be presented in the form of a shop-in-shop, within a department store."
Roberts Cosmetics + Containers: From packaging to full-service!,"Premium Beauty News - The way the Roberts Company started some 35 years ago is truly amusing! Kristen O'Connell - At that time, Mrs. Roberts noticed a bullet casing that bore a resemblance to a lipstick container. She and Mr. Roberts began purchasing retired ammunition molds and modifying them to create lipstick cases. This kind of ingenuity has come to represent the innovative concepts that Roberts is known for to this day. Premium Beauty News - Today, the company has remained specialized in the makeup industry? Kristen O'Connell - Absolutely! Makeup represents 80% of our activity and innovation is always at the heart of everything we do when it comes to packaging development at Roberts Cosmetics + Containers, I would even be tempted to say ""more than ever"". But we are also increasingly known and recognized for our Full service turnkey offer in the field of makeup. Turnkey services currently represent about 50% of our business. We are proud to say that ""Our creative team knows what's next!"" And that customers just need to contact our teams to enable us to help them with our innovative formulas and packaging concepts. Premium Beauty News - Innovations which are both ""home-made"" but that you also manage to find everywhere in the world. Kristen O'Connell - We actually go where this innovation exists. For example, we opened an office in Seoul more than fifteen years ago and another one in Shanghai five years ago. Everyone knows that Korea is one of the ""spearhead"" countries in terms of makeup and skincare innovation and developments. Much of our Full service offer is based on this thanks to the help of several partners. Premium Beauty News - Your commercial influence extends beyond the West Coast? Kristen O'Connell - The West Coast still accounts for two thirds of our business but our penetration in the rest of the United States and, in particular, on the East coast continues to increase. This is also one of the reasons for our presence at MakeUp in New York each year. And we were very honored last September to have our Powder Lifter and Eye Lifter selected as innovation winners for packaging and featured on the Innovation Tree. We want to thank all those who took the time to stop by our booth and view our latest innovations! Premium Beauty News - Precisely, in terms of innovative products, what are your latest new products and what can you tell us about them? Kristen O'Connell - We recently launched a roller ball doe foot applicator that allows for a very unique application experience for the consumer. Typically doe foot applicators are limited to lip product, but our new applicator is also perfect for serums and eye area care. We also have some very innovative compact concepts that focus on the elimination of a traditional hinge."
Klorane revives its famous camomile shampoo for its 50th anniversary,"Just like in its early stages, the promise of the camomile shampoo is to brighten blonde to chestnut hair with the reference among natural brightening actives: camomile. Klorane laboratories have selected a particular variety of camomile, Matricaria retutita, due to its high concentration in apigenin, a yellow pigment paradoxically contained in the flower's petals that settles in the scales without penetrating the hair, and provides it with the golden and honey glints of blonde hair. Just like all Klorane shampoo formulas, the new one is free from parabens, silicones, and phenoxyethanol, and is enriched in camomile extracts. It now also guarantees high enough paediatric tolerance for it to be used on children aged 3, and a new fragrance enhances the honey and wildflower olfactory evocation. In addition to the shampoo, balm, and rinsing vinegar of the range, which were all reformulated, there is a new camomile and honey brightening sun cream: Soin Soleil Éclaircissant. It contains no discolouring agent and can be used by the whole family for sun-kissed hair easy to untangle all year round. Klorane's new Camomile family will be available in pharmacies in April, and so will the Pomegranate range for coloured hair, also reformulated."
"At forty, The Body Shop wants to reaffirm its position as the world's most ethical company","The beauty brand has unveiled ""Enrich Not Exploit,"" a plan to protect and nurture society and the environment across all areas of its business, from ingredients and packaging to employees and campaigns. The cosmetics giant has set itself a total of 14 measurable targets for 2020, divided into three categories — enriching people, products and the planet. Every part of the company's business are concerned: ingredients, products, packaging, stores, employees, suppliers and campaigns. They include plans to help 40,000 economically vulnerable people access work around the world and to ensure that 100 per cent of the group's natural ingredients are traceable and sustainably sourced, protecting 10,000 hectares of forest and other habitat. The group has also pledged to power its stores with renewable or carbon balanced energy, to reduce the environmental footprint of its products year-on-year and to invest 250,000 hours into enriching the biodiversity of local communities. The Body Shop also wants 70% of its total product packaging to be free from fossil fuels. ""For us, being truly sustainable means shaping our business to work in line with the planet's natural systems so they can replenish and restore themselves,"" says Jeremy Schwartz, Chairman and CEO of The Body Shop. ""We have set ourselves a significant goal to be the world's most ethical and truly sustainable global business."" Founded in 1976 in the UK by Anita Roddick, The Body Shop inspires a loyal following for its ethically and sustainably produced, naturally-inspired skincare, hair care and make-up. It is famous for its iconic products such as its Tea Tree Oil and Vitamin E skincare formulas and rich body butters formulated from shea, hemp, cocoa and mango, among others. ""The Body Shop courageously pioneered new ways of thinking, acting and speaking out as a company. We were the first in beauty to use community trade and we still have the strongest programme in the industry,"" explains Jeremy Schwartz. However, during the 1990s and 2000s many cosmetic brands have followed suit and most major groups have engaged in important corporate social and environmental responsibility strategies. The Body Shop was acquired by L'Oréal in 2006 and counts 3,000 stores in more than 60 countries."
A new milestone for the CEW in France,"Premium Beauty News - Quite a long and compelling story that of the CEW! Françoise Montenay - You are right! compelling is the word... I would be tempted to also add ""exemplary""! The French CEW was created in 1986 on the initiative of Michèle Meyer and quickly focused on active solidarity with the creation in 1992 of the first free Beauty Centre at the hospital Gustave Roussy, South of Paris. Today, 31 beauticians hired, trained and paid by the CEW in the form of fees, provide beauty treatments to male and female patients, in 29 hospitals in Paris and France, and for 21 different pathologies. Through this action the CEW offers patients a relaxing moment, emphatic listening, gestures to sooth, beautify and fight against the harm caused by illness or treatments. In 2015, more than 30,000 cosmetic treatments were offered. As you know we are an non-profit association, affiliated to the CEW Inc., a strong U.S. professional organization founded in 1954 with over 8,000 members and to the CEW U.K. founded in 1992 and with close to 1,000 members. In France, our 500 members hold entry level, mid-level and senior management positions in the Beauty industry upstream or downstream of the chain, i.e., the perfume and cosmetic industry, and aesthetics and hairdressing activities. Our members hold positions in marketing, finance, or as communication consultants, in the industry or distribution sectors. Premium Beauty News - 2016 will be a year of new impetus and your profile and nomination are, in a way, its first expression. Laurence Moulin - Absolutely! This position of Managing Director for France that I have been holding in recent months was created at the request of the Board of Directors and voted by the General Assembly to meet the new challenges facing this network, namely, to strengthen its business dimension and its support to Beauty professionals at every stage of their careers. 2016, represents an important step forward in our development with the opening of the French organisation to men since January 1st (an opening already successful achieved in the U.S. and U.K.) and a strengthening of international exchanges. The CEW as a whole brings together 8,000 Beauty professionals around three associations: CEW U.S.A., CEW U.K. and CEW France. With the beauty industry being global and its actors, international players, we want accelerate rapprochements and synergies between the three CEWs, because giving our members access to a global network is essential today. As our President, Françoise Montenay stated, the CEW is now also open to men with the aim to promote an overall vision of the profession and of those who embody it. To support this development you will soon discover our new website, clearer, more dynamic, more complete, more user friendly. Professionally, I come from the world of Communication. I was Communications Director at the International Event Agency specialised in public relations and in the organization of events. I also served as Communication Director for Interdeco (now Lagardère Publicité) and then of the Figaro Group. Premium Beauty News - This international network you represent is undoubtedly a strong asset! Françoise Montenay - You understood that our aim was to build a stronger, more united and always more active CEW, with a foothold in all trades in the Beauty industry. This programme of course takes into consideration the rapprochement with the two other CEWs in the U.S. and U.K. In fact, we are only going to place more emphasis on what already existed. For example, we launched in June 2012 the first ""Achievers Awards"" Ceremony to honour women who are successful in our trade or who have helped members move forward in the profession (taking example on the Achievers Awards in the U.S. or U.K) . With the aim to make it a strong media event occurring every year. It is very important for the CEW to reflect this entrepreneurial atmosphere and culture that characterizes the beauty sector and to put it in the spotlight. Premium Beauty News - You will need to recruit! Laurence Moulin - A proactive recruitment policy will be launched to further strengthen the representativeness of our network and offer always more to our members. The aim is to contribute to their professional fulfilment by boosting their careers and promoting the enrichment of their network. We offer them opportunities for meetings and discussions with high profile professionals on business and strategic topics with a comprehensive platform of inspiring and rewarding events, but also partnerships with leading and innovative Beauty events like MakeUp in Paris. It is also important to recall that the CEW is a unique network that boasts a dual business and solidarity vocation. A positioning that gives it a very particular spirit of conviviality and sharing. All CEW members are federated around the action of the Beauty Centres (but also of our Olfactory Workshops, another commitment of the CEW France) with this core idea that ""Beauty is not trivial, it can help people live better."""

"Arcade Beauty's ""gem"" Carestia inaugurates a new plant","Founded in 1883 by the Carestia family, the Grasse-based printing plant got known in the 1980s as the creator of the smelling card, intended for consumers to test a perfume on a blotter impregnated with the fragrance. Printed, decorated, cut, or even pre-perfumed, the blotter has become an integral part of brands' olfactory marketing. As a real port of entry to the product's universe, it is designed with incredible creativity to give it an identity. And it is this will to spend a lot of time on research and development and to make high-end products in very large quantities that made Carestia so successful that it eventually became a reference for major groups. The company joined the Arcade Marketing Group in 2013, before it changed its name for Arcade Beauty in 2014. ""Becoming part of the Group made it possible for Carestia to optimize its production tool and unique know-how,"" explains Philippe Ughetto, Arcade Beauty's President EMEA. Neutral blotters (those that are printed, but not perfumed) represent 40% of the company's business, and it also provides the industry with sample single-serving packs, which account for 40% of its turnover. Carestia's production tool is equipped with machines that comprise the latest technologies and guarantee perfect control of all processes: offset, application of selective UV varnish, embossing, stamped gilding, lamination, cutting, folding, finishing, and conditioning. ""Our customers come to us with their own ideas, desires, and worlds to be expressed… then our integrated creation service takes care of transforming these elements into realistic commercial projects that can actually be marketed,"" explains Marie-Hélène Marcelli, Director of Carestia. The remaining 20% of the company's activities are dedicated to the design, development, and production of pre-perfumed promotional objects, mainly on paper or cardboard, but also on textile, leather, ceramic, or wood. The Maison's unique know-how lies in its impregnation technique and high fragrance quality in all circumstances. Tests are performed in a laboratory before production to validate the quality of the olfactory result: top and back notes, preservation over time depending on the choice of material, ink, varnish… And the perfume must not alter the aesthetic of the print. Once the material has been printed and cut, it is impregnated in the perfuming room with an exclusive technique. Carestia has also recently started using a micro-encapsulation process to deliver the fragrance more gradually. Each testing and production phase is controlled and validated by perfumer-creator Isabelle Burdel to guarantee the perfume is identically reproduced. Carestia's industrial strategy is adapted to brands' concerns in terms of presence, differentiation, and marketing. The company's future prospects are positive, as estimations foresee a 20 million euros progress in its turnover. It should soon invest in its machines for more cutting accuracy and to meet a strong demand for blotters with sophisticated shapes and perfumed pop-ups. New perfuming technologies will also be studied in depth."

Alkos Group: a new plant for Intercosmétiques in 2017,"The Alkos Group has reached a new phase in its development: it has announced the construction of a new plant for its Intercosmétiques branch. The work will start at the end of the first semester 2016 to be finished in summer 2017. ""Given the strong growth estimations for the next five years, it had become essential to reorganize and rationalize our premises to be able to keep up with and support the growth of Intercosmétiques's activities,"" the group explains in a press release. Located near Angers, France, Intercosmétiques is a company specialized in the formulation, production, and conditioning of skincare and makeup products. It makes up one of the three units of the Alkos Group, with Sagal, located in Chartres and known for its soaps and perfumed stick deodorants, and Alkos Cosmétiques, a unique makeup pencil producer in France (wood, plastic, and liner pens) settled in Boulogne-sur-Mer. Intercosmétiques employs more than 250 workers and serves the most famous cosmetics brands. It has known a strong growth over the last few years, in particular in 2015, with a turnover increase of 20% to reach more than 31 million euros. Apart from the necessary development of the production capacity and the creation of new manufacturing lines, the Alkos Group adds that building this new plant aims to gather the three current sites, since the cumulative surface area of 11,000 m2 is spread across the whole industrial site right now. This rationalization should help achieve new gains of competitiveness and significantly improve the quality of the environment and the staff's working conditions. The site chosen, the Parc d'activités Angers-Orgemont, a business park, was previously occupied by motor vehicle equipment manufacturer Valeo. The 16,000 m2 area used by only one tenant will be completely redesigned to meet the cosmetics manufacturer's needs. And it has another advantage, as it offers huge extension possibilities that could be exploited in the medium-term. ""Of course, this new configuration will perfectly meet the requirements of the strictest cosmetics standards,"" the group assures. The whole operation represents an 8.5 million euro investment. Intercosmétiques benefits from the support of ALDEV, Angers's agency for the economic development of its urban community."
Toly China celebrates its 10th anniversary,"Almost 10 years ago to the day, Toly China was opened with just five moulding machines, two assembly lines on only two floors of a brand new building. Today, Toly occupies all five floors of the building, with 26 moulding machines, 14 assembly lines housed in a clean-room environment, with in-line decoration and some automated assembly. The highlight of the event was the unveiling of Toly's brand new lacquering and metallizing plant on the top floor of the building. Also on display during the inauguration ceremony were automated assembly lines and all the decorating capabilities that also are available in Toly's European manufacturing centre in Malta. In his speech, Andy Gatesy, Chairman & CEO of the Toly Group, stated that ''Toly China is a European style operation, based upon lean manufacturing principles and a much lower head count than a traditional Chinese factory. With our new internal lacquering and metallizing line, Toly China is now fully integrated and able to support global customers with competitive pricing and strategic launches. With more than 45 years experience from our lead plant in Malta, we are able to transfer technologies and systems to China.'' Since 2007, Toly China has been ISO 9001 certified and is currently working hard to achieve ISO 14001 certification over the next few months. The Toly Group also has two plants in South Korea - one focussed upon airless packaging whilst a brand new one, opened earlier this year, produces complementary packaging for both skin care and make up brands. The Toly Group continues its expansion in the global market and is showing strong growth in 2015, according to the company's management. ""With its new innovation centre in Malta, Toly is leading the industry in terms of creative packaging and the company continues to evolve and adapt to the ever changing market. Innovation is the key to survival but teamwork is the key to success,"" claimed the company."
Groupe Bogart takes to distribution,"Other than the original brand, Jacques Bogart, historically presented with the slogan ""Je ne crée que pour l'homme"" (My creations are only for men), the Groupe Bogart fully owns perfume brands Ted Lapidus and Carven, perfume licenses Chevignon, Lee Cooper, and Naf Naf, and cosmetics brands Méthode Jeanne Piaubert and Stendhal. This eclectic list covers a large part of the selective distribution offering, from the most affordable to the most premium, with Carven Parfums, a brand that was successfully relaunched in 2013. Although the company is open to the possibility of new acquisitions, today Bogart focuses on its development in the distribution sector: the Group has seized the opportunity to purchase several points of sale excluded from the merger between Douglas and Nocibé and has opened about thirty points of sale in France under the brand April, name of the perfumery chain previously acquired in Israel. ""Our products are exclusively developed and made in France. By adding distribution, the Groupe Bogart controls the whole chain, down to retail. We wanted to be able to provide our brands with a showcase,"" explains Fanny Aimetti, Fragrance Marketing Manager. This multi-brand network of points of sale is spread across the whole territory, though mainly outside the Parisian region, and is ""set to develop"", she adds. To date, April owns 37 stores in Israel, 35 in France and 1 in Portugal. The brand Jacques Bogart represents the major part of the Group's turnover, followed by Ted Lapidus, with 24 perfumed lines and a very active presence abroad. Started in 2010, the Carven olfactory journey is the latest of the group. It concurred with the rebirth of the couture house managed by its dynamic Artistic Director, Guillaume Henry, and it now enjoys a strong notoriety in France, though it remains to be developed worldwide. ""We have a very qualitative distribution, but it is centred on Carven Parfums. In terms of development, the brand's objective depends on the growth of this selective distribution,"" Fanny Aimetti comments. The women's range is composed of Carven Le Parfum, launched in 2013 and created by Francis Kurkdjian, the iconic perfumer-creator of the new creative perfumery, Carven L'Eau de Toilette, and now Carven L'Absolu, a new 2015 fragrance. It is completed with redesigned classics of the house, Ma Griffe and Vétiver, and Carven pour Homme for men. A new perfume is being created to be launched in 2017."
"Ingrid Jackel, at the helm of the brand ""Yes To""","Premium Beauty News - A one-of-a-kind adventure for this brand built at first on the combination of beta-carotene and mud from the Dead Sea. Ingrid Jackel - A true success story the US way. To say more ""the American way, but its West Coast version""! Ido Leffler and Lance Kalish were undeniably real visionaries in 2006 when they decided to position the brand on this rather bold combination. And on top of it with a tremendous sense of humor. But soon they realized the value of extending it to ingredients coming from other veggies and fruits. But it's also the brand's outstanding marketing environment that managed through its originality, to break to some extent, the codes of the industry. The starting principle is simple: skin absorbs much of what you put on it, so we believe it's important to care as much about what you put on your body as what you put in it. Our formulas are truly natural, and we're proud to be up front and fully transparent about it! Literally, front and center on all our products you'll find our seal showing each and every product is at least 95 % natural! Our products are also formulated without parabens, phthalates, and SLS, plus packaged in recyclable packaging whenever possible. Our team of skincare experts combine awesome natural ingredients with the latest and greatest formulation recipes to make sure that our products deliver on what you want - whether that's cleansing, moisturizing, or blemish zapping. Depending on product type and intended use, we test a variety of our products for certain areas of concern (irritation, hypoallergenic / sensitivity testing, dermatologist tested, tear free, non-comedogenic, and clinical tests). All of our testing is performed in third party testing laboratories and never tested on animals. Premium Beauty News - In any case, the concept works! Ingrid Jackel - Indeed, yes! ""Yes To"" products make skin feel good while bringing a smile to your face! 95% natural (at least) and 100% positive. From the soothing, spa-like scent of cucumbers to the silky (never greasy) texture of our moisturizers, what better way to start (or finish) each day than doing it with products that feel and smell fantastic? We are pretty proud how many people have fallen in love with ""Yes To"" products, from the lady next to us on the bus to beauty editors. We say ""Yes To"" super-natural beauty products that work, spread smiles, and give back. ""Yes To"" products work because we never compromise. ""Yes To"" makes you smile (read our packaging!) We want to inspire people to take ordinary life moments and make them extraordinary by doing two things: a) smiling more (let's see it!) b) saying ""Yes"" at least once a day! ""Yes To"" believes in giving back. We are therefore committed to giving back a portion of our company profits to the ""Yes To"" Seed Fund, whose goal is to inspire people to lead healthier, more positive lives. Premium Beauty News - Your goals? Ingrid Jackel - Double our sales, nothing else! We already operate on the segments of face care, body care, hair care... after a shower, after exercising, at work and at home, in front of our mirror or in a bathroom ... in short, from head to toe, opportunities are many for Yes To to offer a unique and positive sensory experience, and we won't miss this opportunity, but without taking ourselves too seriously of course!"
Rituals reassured after setting up in France,"It is in 1999, during a seminar at the Chinese Pagoda in Paris, that Dutchman Raymond Cloosterman, who then worked for Unilever, had the idea to create a daily, holistic concept inspired from Asian rituals and combining body and home cosmetics. A range was developed in coherence with the brand's philosophy: transforming each daily gesture into unique relaxing moments. Today, it counts almost 400 products – body and face care, makeup with precious stones, tea, candles, home perfumes. If it took several years for the first store set up in Amsterdam to find its own customers, after seven years, the store is now successful, which made it possible to open more and more points of sale over the past few years, first in the Netherlands, and then in Belgium, throughout Europe, in the Middle East, and in Brazil. Rituals is now present in 25 countries, with more than 400 points of sale and 1,000 stands. The brand also distributes its products through the selective channel, e-commerce, and travel retail – about fifty airports and 4 to 5-star hotels. It has positioned itself as an ""affordable luxury brand"" and reached a turnover of 250 million euros in 2014. Reinforced by an annual 30% growth that confirms the strength of the concept and by the high turnover of its e-store, which already existed in France, Rituals finally decided to try and enter the difficult French market in May 2015, with a first opening on Rue Vieille du Temple, in the Marais quarter of Paris. Two new points of sale were inaugurated at the Italie 2 shopping mall, in the south of the French capital, and in Boulogne, west of Paris. ""We have very positive feedback in France. Our results are much beyond expectations, with a higher turnover than what we had estimated. That is why we have planned to open 12 new wholly-owned stores in Paris and across France in 2016"", Sandrine Mignaux comments. Lyon and Lille are top of the list, and so is the large, 143m2 point of sale under the new canopy of central mall Les Halles, expected for the beginning of April. ""We have been widening our ranges with makeup and home clothes, so we intend to open larger areas. None of our future stores will be less than 70m2. It is important for us that all references are gathered in the same place to give a thorough image of our concept"", Sandrine Mignaux explains. In parallel, the brand is present with a gift offering in all Sephora stores in France, and is negotiating with a department store chain. The purchase experience in store is one of the main levers of the brand, which combines an environment full of noble, warm materials with a very personalized reception: customers are offered a hand massage and tea. ""Empathy and kindness are the main criteria for recruiting our sales force,"" Sandrine Mignaux specifies. Word-of-mouth is enhanced by the customer experience and the qualitative and natural positioning of affordable products, and will be facilitated by several publicity events organized throughout the year."
Atelier Cologne inaugurates a third Parisian store on the Left Bank,"Located in the heart of the Left Bank quarter, this new workshop spreads across 50m2, in a new setting. The Colognes Absolues are displayed on painter cases, and a wall composed of dozens of leather, bright-coloured cases highlights the importance of the art of gifts and personalization to Atelier Cologne. This new area is Atelier Cologne's sixth wholly-owned store in France and around the world, including three in Paris, two in New York City, and a brand new one in Hong Kong. Driven by their young brand's dynamics, the two founders are considering reaching the number of twelve stores within the next two years, mainly abroad, in particular in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Dubai, Moscow, Shanghai, Seoul… This plan does not include any opening in a French region, although the brand is present across the whole territory via the Sephora network. ""Opening a store in the city of Toulouse, for example, requires as much energy as opening one in Seoul, but the return on investment is definitely not the same"", Christophe Cervasel explains. ""France is the most difficult market in the world. In the United States, or Asia, people are culturally open to novelty. In France, we have a culture of tradition. Atelier Cologne is a new French Maison de Parfum, and the weight of the Made in France label has much more impact beyond our borders. I wish the French were aware of this,"" he adds. Thanks to its presence in more than 35 countries, via the travel retail network and on Air France flights, Atelier Cologne will end the year 2015 with a 14 million euro turnover, 85% of which results from international sales. 700,000 bottles have been sold since the Maison was created, and a range of hotel amenities was developed in partnership with Groupe GM. Atelier Cologne: A unique Gift Card From 60 euros of credited value, the gift card is offered in a ""Discovery Kit"", a metal box decorated with an image of the first Atelier Cologne boutique and containing 12 mini-sprays from the brand's bestsellers. Whoever receives the voucher can therefore easily choose his favourite perfume to retrieve it online or in store. V.G."

"Paris Mon Amour, or how to put Paris in a bottle","""Strangely enough, there was no perfume line designed around Paris, although the French capital benefits from a strong image abroad and plays a role that is widely recognized in the perfumery world! So, I decided to represent the French capital's iconic places, those that best evoke the French spirit in the world's imagination, with elegant, very feminine, both qualitative and affordable perfumes,"" explains Carole Rannou, creator of the brand, Paris Mon Amour. In January 2014, after more than 20 years working as the Artistic or Marketing and Creation Director for various French perfume and cosmetics brands, she launched a line of perfumes to take both young and older people for a love walk around Paris. The idea was to offer Parisian and foreign customers high quality, 100% Made in France fragrances at an affordable price. In keeping with the brand's positioning, Paris Mon Amour perfumes are available in outlets located near the most popular tourist areas of the French capital: Galeries Lafayette, the Champs-Élysées, the Eiffel Tower, Parisian airports, and Nocibé perfume stores. On the global scale, they are already available in the United States, Turkey, and Indonesia. ""Obviously, the development of export sales is our top priority,"" Carole Rannou emphasizes. ""The concept is popular, and we are actually negotiating with many distributors. We mainly target European countries, the Middle East, in particular the United Arab Emirates, and Asia."" Right now, the brand has three fragrances available in 50ml bottles with a modern design and decorated with a jewel to be carried and preserved like the memory of a precious moment: – Eiffel Kiss, a sensual perfume with chypre, floral, fruity, and musky notes (bergamot orange, red fruit, and violet leaves as top notes, jasmine sambac, rose, violet, neroli, and iris as middle notes, and sandalwood, patchouli, musk, tonka, and white cedar as back notes) – Place Vendôme in Love, a real floral bouquet (water bloom, blackcurrant, crumpled leaves, citrus fruit, ylang, cyclamen, apple, rose, orange blossom, vanilla, patchouli, sandalwood, musk) – Romantic Montmartre, a glamourous, voluptuous, romantic fragrance with musky notes, white tea, and vanilla The next step will consist in widening the range by launching a new perfume, Chérie Élysées, in January 2016, and then new concepts around body mists and makeup… A beautiful love story that will not end soon…"
"""Our objective is to provide Brazilian consumers with safer nail polish and a broader offering"", Alexandre Miasnik, Fiabila","Premium Beauty News - In 2014, Fiabila announced the purchase of a plant in the suburbs of São Paulo. What about this Brazilian adventure? Alexandre Miasnik - It is an adventure indeed! We initiated very intensive work in this large plant – more than 7,500 m2 – to make it comply both with local standards and our international requirements, which we developed thanks to our long experience. The work that will allow us to start our activities will be over in December, and we are receiving the required licences. Premium Beauty News - How is this plant structured? Alexandre Miasnik - Our activity will start in early 2016 with the tinting of thixotroped bases with colouring solutions mainly imported from France, and with conditioning, which will be performed on two lines fitted with the same equipment as those we use in France. Then we will gradually get to seven lines. In the course of the second semester 2016, our site will be ready for the local manufacturing of thixotroped bases and skincare products. The time period in-between is due to the very high technicity of the production tool, as it is modelled on the one we use in Maintenon, in France, and to the fact that all local raw materials still do not meet Fiabila's quality and price level requirements. Eventually, the objective is to integrate all productions on the local level. As for safety and the environment, whether it be for laboratory control, production in closed circuit to reduce contamination risks to a minimum, or safety, with cutting-edge systems in case of fire or if materials fall over, we have installed in Brazil the exact same equipment we have been using elsewhere. The production tool also helps limit handling and releases into the atmosphere to a minimum. We will treat Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) after we have started our activities and concrete measures have been taken. Premium Beauty News - How important is Brazil for Fiabila's international development strategy? Alexandre Miasnik - Our latest statistics confirm the essential role of the Brazilian nail polish market. That is why Fiabila had to settle in this country with a production tool adapted both to the importance of this market and to the increasing need for quality products. We have been implementing the procedures we apply in France on the local level, and we commit to strictly comply with European and American regulations, among others. Today, Fiabila is the only company to be able to meet these requirements, and we definitely intend to settle firmly in Brazil, just like we did on the other major markets. Premium Beauty News - Brazilian women's taste for nail polish is a widely known fact. Brazil is the first consumer in the world in terms of volume, but the second one for value, behind the United States, with very low prices. Is it moving upmarket, like other categories? Alexandre Miasnik - Most products are sold by a few local brands that sell low-end goods for very low prices. But we have observed a move upmarket for certain ranges for over a year now. In fact, a lot of Brazilian brands suffer from allergies, and an increasing number of them would like to have ""4 or 5-Free"" products, which are free from specific ingredients that are de-listed elsewhere. Besides, the current offering remains limited in terms of colours, effects, and skincare products. Therefore, the move upmarket will depend on safer products, but also a broader offering and, above all, quality goods, which until now could not be much seen on the market. Fiabila does have an essential role to play. Premium Beauty News - The cosmetics market in Brazil has known a slowdown, everyone knows it. But certain segments like makeup are still dynamic. How do you think the market will change? Alexandre Miasnik - Beauty has a very particular resonance for Brazilian women, even the least well-off of them, and the fact that certain products are extremely cheap clearly explains the dynamism of this market. Prospects remain very encouraging, and Fiabila is ready for the challenge."
Millennium Fragrances diversifies their perfume lines for children,"For the end of the year, the Kaloo perfume lines, associated with fluffy toys and designed for babies and children aged 0-6, have been completed with a new premium range presented in an innovative, exclusive bottle: ""Les amis de Kaloo"". Available as a scented water – without alcohol – or an eau de toilette, with a low quantity of alcohol, the bottles are fitted with a diffusing cap made of patented ceramic to spread the fragrance throughout the child's room. And the brand has announced another innovation for March 2016: a new bottle for the Kokeshi Japanese dolls designed by Jeremy Scott, Moschino's designer, who is fond of the kawai world. Created from scratch around the concept of small Japanese dolls, the Kokeshi brand targets teenagers aged 12-18 and regularly renews its partnership with a renowned designer to create the five figurines of the collection. The new line is directly inspired from the Californian designer's textile collections. A doll and a message are associated with each fragrance created in collaboration with Mane and Robertet: Tonka illustrates power, Bambou, friendship, Lotus, beauty, Lichee, love, and Cheery, luck. Exclusively made in France, Millennium Fragrances perfumes are distributed by 1,800 selective perfume shops and 400 stores dedicated to children, in France, but also in ten countries around the world, 300 stores located in airports, and 43 airlines. The group has shown an 8% increase in its turnover this year, compared to 2014."
Feelunique expands into France with the acquisition of Parfumeries Rive Droite,"Eager to develop its French business, Feelunique has announced the acquisition of Parfumeries Rive Droite, a small perfumery chain with four boutiques countrywide including its flagship store in avenue Marceau in Paris. Parfumeries Rive Droite, founded in 1986 is the stockist of leading global brands including Chanel, Clarins, Clinique, Dior, Hermès, Guerlain, Estée Lauder, Lancôme, Paco Rabanne, Thierry Mugler and YSL, as well as niche and exclusive brands including Crème de la Mer, Acqua di Parma, Serge Lutens, La Prairie, Cellcosmet, Annayaké, Valmont, Caron, Atelier Cologne and By Terry. The four retail sites in Paris, Levallois, Boulogne and Neuilly-sur-Seine will be renamed as Feelunique stores and plans are in place to enable the brands instore will also be available online to customers in France and worldwide. ""France is already a key market for Feelunique and one that has huge potential, particularly online. As an acquisition Parfumeries Rive Droite delivers the perfect combination of a small number of stores in primary locations, exclusive French stockist of a strong selection of premium and niche brands, an experienced management team and gives us a real opportunity to further localise our business, servicing our French customers even better,"" said Feelunique CEO Joel Palix. To oversee the integration of Parfumeries Rive Droite and launch the online business, Claire Blandin has been appointed as Managing Director of feelunique in France. Claire was formerly Purchasing Director at Beauté Privée, France's leading online beauty flash sales retailer and Beauty Buyer at Monoprix. ""I have long admired Feelunique as an online beauty retailer and this acquisition really opens up the French market to the business. I am very much looking forward to raising the profile of the brand here in France and creating a market-leader online presence in France,"" she said. In addition, Fabrice Rimbault, currently head of Parfumeries Rive Droite will become Operations Director of Feelunique France. In celebration of the launch of Feelunique France, the company will open a pop up store for Christmas, showcasing a selection of the most established and best new breakthrough British brands. The pop up store will be open from 27th November until 13th December and will feature brands such as Aromatherapy Associates, Balance Me, Cowshed, Fleur De Force, Emma Hardie, Philip Kingsley, Tangle Teezer, TIGI, White Hot and Zoella."
SIMP continues its transformation,"Taken over in July 2011 by Alain Blondel and Eric Bardonecchia, the staff has increased twofold in four years. With 35 employees to date, the company should, according to its leaders, increase its workforce again by the end of next year. SIMP owns 17 granted or pending patents: it creates and designs every year a collection of applicators consisting of 4/5 stock and / or customized new models to its customers, while also expanding its reach overseas with the development of the North and South American markets. To support this industrial globalization, SIMP inaugurated last June in Mexico, in the city of Aguascalientes, a new 1,700 sqm plant dedicated to the production and assembly of components for the cosmetic sector, and more specifically rubber wipers. To support and anticipate this growth, SIMP significantly expanded its R & D department and invested heavily in capacity equipment and disruptive equipment: with a fully automated machine park consisting of 29 plastic injection presses, including two new ones acquired this year, 17 machines for the rubber production and the use of block transfer injection for the high capacity production of extremely precise parts, the company will produce more than 300 million of these plastic and rubber parts this year, that is, a 20% increase over last year! ""Innovation is the lifeblood of our progression,"" emphasises Alain Blondel, ""and in 2016, we will invest even more, and also in the production of bi-material parts."" ""Injected plastic mascara brushes and rubber wipers remain the company's core business (70% of sales),"" explains Alain Blondel, ""but we are increasingly diversifying our activities in the production of other types of applicators for skincare and pharmaceutical products. More than 20% of our products are intended for other sectors than cosmetics."""
Mascara Plus extends its expertise,"The company does 60 per cent of its business with cosmetics companies based in Europe and the U.S.; the remainder is spread throughout the globe. Mascara Plus is located in Inzago on the outskirts of Milan in a new 2,400 sqm building. The facility, which is GMP/ISO certified includes two state of the art fibre brush machines that can produce 150,000 custom brushes per day. The new plant can also generate 2,500 kg of bulk product per day - or 100,000 finished piece - ready to ship. Mascara Plus also organizes focused workshops where customers can come in and see the products first-hand, request design modifications, and get new prototypes in hand within hours. ""Clients really appreciate this,"" says Chant. ""It significantly cuts down on product development time and, as a result, reduces costs. We create the formulations and brushes to the specific needs of customers, and we also provide filling services and develop also customizable, packaging solutions."" The company for example, has developed ""Double Brush"", a new mascara applicator. The brush design includes two distinct elements with different areas of fibre density. A large distance between fibres creates volume in the applied mascara; a small distance gives lengthening and curling. The two areas are oriented at 90-degree intervals, so that users automatically get both effects with a single brush stroke. Similarly, the company's ""Double Play"" mascara includes an innovative double formulation that includes higher viscosity for lengthening as well as softening agents for volumizing. ""That allows the end customer to avoid a trade off between those two factors,"" says Chant. Notably, Mascara Plus is the only contract manufacturer of mascara that produces its own brushes designed and based upon its unique bulk formulations, leading to a perfect synergy between brush and mascara formula. As a recent marketing campaign puts it, ""We make both hardware and software."" Now that the company has established core strengths in mascara - its speciality since the company's beginning - it is now expanding out into other cosmetics, including lip gloss, foundation, and eye shadow. Mascara Plus already has clients for all product lines. Regardless of whether the company is working on mascara, lip gloss, eye shadow, or foundation, Chant says that it will always rely on what it does best—strong product development, technical expertise, and customer service. ""Those things are in our DNA,"" he says. ""They apply no matter what we're producing."""
"""MakeUp in"" trade shows record their 1,000th exhibitor","Premium Beauty News - Fifteen editions of ""MakeUp In"" and 1,000 exhibitors, what an adventure! By the way, what is the figure concerning the number of visitors? Sandra Maguarian - Cumulatively over the six previous years, more than 27,000! Jean-Yves Bourgeois and I, as you can imagine, are very proud of having reached such a level. Like any adventure, it was hard to imagine six years ago that we would reach these figures. A proof if need be that the concept is good. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, why is it good? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - We already had occasion to say, but it's always worth repeating that MakeUp in's are events that are centred on the entire make-up and skincare sector, and nothing else. This means that visitors in a few hours can get a complete overview of what this industry has to offer, from ingredients to accessories including formulation and packaging. What is important is the balance between formulation manufacturers who represent the bulk of our exhibitors and other industrial sectors (ingredients, packagings and accessories). This balance is crucial as it determines the type of visitorship which, in turn, consists mostly of people coming from Marketing departments (almost 60%), followed by Purchasing and Development teams. This ""privileged"" access of exhibitors to Marketing teams, can only be found in our various MakeUp In's across the world. Premium Beauty News - What explains the popularity of your events among brands? Sandra Maguarian - Because with our MakeUp In events they not only find the formulation manufacturers they are looking for, but they also can take advantage of an atmosphere ""of its own"" that we have always worked on and privileged, by creating many make-up animations thanks to the participation, among others, of schools but also of numerous make-up artists. Let's say ""An atmosphere"" that's closer to ""Fashion"" with a capital ""F"" than to an umpteenth traditional Beauty show. Premium Beauty News - Speaking of traditional beauty events, there is indeed no lack of offer! Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Each exhibitor, each visitor at the four MakeUp In's in the world is aware of that, because he actually experienced it himself. This quality and high level of contacts is seen nowhere else. Experience it! You just need to visit one of our shows to get a grasp of the business level at the stands. It's true that there is an increasing number of events taking place across the world. But if new ones are created, it means that the others are not satisfactory. The question on large or multisectorial shows can be raised. But this is not the subject here! Our strategy is clear! The whole make-up and skincare industry, and nothing but the make-up and skincare industry! When you start to cast the net far and wide, you're bound to failure. Every packaging trade show, no matter how successful, remains a packaging trade show with ""packaging"" visitors. And a multisectorial trade show remains a multisectorial trade show. For my part, I have never seen exhibitors express themselves as positively and as spontaneously in writing on these events, as they do with us! And even when everything is not perfect, we do not hesitate to say so! Premium Beauty News - Indeed the recent MakeUp in New York was not perfect! Sandra Maguarian - It's true! But we explained why and drew necessary conclusions from it! Precisely the new venue is magnificent. Not to say exceptional, entirely in the image of what we have always strived to achieve so far and what we will continue to focus on in the future. And Jean-Yves Bourgeois and I know that manufacturers trust us. Because along the years, a sort of particular alchemy has developed between us. This comes from this mutual commitment that brings us together four times a year. A commitment to make this event as successful as possible. Nothing more, nothing less! Premium Beauty News - You have a new event starting in 2016 in Los Angeles! Yet another one? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Don't be mistaken! First, you must know that if we created this new event, it's because we were asked to! It's as simple as that. When we created MakeUp in Paris, we were asked to create MakeUp in New York. Ditto for Seoul and Sao Paulo. For Los Angeles, the picture is different. Demand for an event on the West Coast was very high. But we didn't want to create ""another event"" in North America. So we chose this formula that is closer to high-level networking intended for a highly targeted population in a format where are more privileged meetings, conferences and workshops than the ""exhibition"" side itself. Hence the name ""MakeUp in Action"". And it's going to be successful for sure! Premium Beauty News - Your plans for 2016? Sandra Maguarian - Long live 2016! This will be our seventh year! The age of reason! And I want to thank all the make-up and skincare manufacturers for having accompanied us so far and for continuing to do so next year. And we can only repeat what they already know, ""Together, make each of these events as successful as possible for the greatest benefit of this marvellous industry."""
Lady Green gets in beauty salons and takes interest in boys,"According to the opinions of the 200 young girls consulted on a participatory basis for the development of the brand and its range, teens expected ""efficient and fun organic products"". Playful, girly, dedicated, formulated and made in France, and Ecocert-certified, Lady Green managed to conquer young girls' hearts with a range that now counts about fifteen skincare and makeup products and accessories. Distributed in selective perfume shops, organic stores, parapharmacies, and concept stores, the brand also quickly found itself its own place in beauty salons and abroad. It is present in 12 countries, in particular in Asia, and 60% of its turnover comes from export. However, the brand plans to reinforce its presence in France, especially on the network of beauty salons, spas, and thalassotherapy centres, where demand is growing fast. This channel is eager to differentiate itself with an alternative product and treatment offering that has proven popular among the younger generation. ""There are real expectations for a targeted offering, but also for mother/daughter products sold in pairs, or packages for an afternoon with girlfriends. Our products and price positioning suit this demand perfectly well,"" explains Adrien Vinet, the co-founder of the brand with Virginie Vinet and Operations Director. In the middle of 2014, Lady Green counted about 20 beauty salons working as consignees, and it should have 150 of them by the end of 2015. The brand aims for twice this figure in 2016. A purifying, detoxifying, deliberately short (30 minutes) skincare protocol was developed and will be available as from EUR 25. Beauticians will be able to get products designed for treatments for 15 to 40% less than the selling price, and a book/guidelines will help them provide the treatments and beauty orders. Next year will see many new product launches, including a BB cream and a body range that will be both for sale and available as a treatment, but it will mainly be marked with the boys' version of the Lady Green concept. To Adrien Vinet, the possibility of targeting male teens for whom there is no offering is a real opportunity. ""As is already the case in Asia, today boys are willing to take care of their own skins, and they do not hesitate to enter beauty salons"", he explains. Of course, the range under development was renamed and will comprise adapted formulas. ""Just like for Lady Green, we have adopted a participatory approach and are surveying our future consumers to develop our range, but we already have a name for it. It is a bit harder than for girls, because boys express themselves less easily, but their reactions are promising"", affirms Adrien Vinet."
LF Beauty inaugurates its first 'Creative Days' in Paris,"Premium Beauty News - So you created a 200 square meter journey for each customer that focused on three major themes. What were the themes? François Camilli - Yes. Our staging focused on three themes that we called: ""One Stop Shop"", ""Local Sourcing"" and ""Innovation"". Premium Beauty News - Let's start with the ""One Stop Shop"" theme. Tell us about it. François Camilli - The idea was to present our multi-category offer of products (make-up, skincare, fragrance) and services (formulation, filling, primary and secondary packaging, POS material, instrumental beauty), as a truly comprehensive, one-stop offerboth in terms of packaging and formulation. In addition to our recent partnership with the Korean beauty and R&D company Cosmecca, we have factories in the US, UK, China, Indonesia and Thailand, supported by R&D laboratories in the UK, China and Thailand from which key products and innovative ideas were presented. For example, we presented multi-material and multi-shape face care masks that had various features like moisturizing, relaxing, revitalizing, detox, and so forth. Premium Beauty News - What do you mean by ""Local Sourcing""? François Camilli - It is important to know that we currently offer alternatives to products manufactured in China, and instead work with local partners. This is important to meeting expectations of the European market. We already have a network of manufacturers in France to meet requirements in point of sales (POS) material for pop-up and temporary events, and we recently signed a partnership with a French industrial expert in the design and injection of thermoplastic parts with high added value. Premium Beauty News - And you are also a champion of innovation! François Camilli - ""Champion"" is maybe not the right word. The fact is, we let innovation drive as much of the visitor journey as possible and in many areas such as digital, interactivity, consumer experience, light, product customization and eco-design. We presented novel ideas, concepts and achievements in each category of products and services, and this was applied across all areas. Sarah Romay - One of the highlights for our guests was the ability to see and touch a wall of materials with nearly 20 different innovative textures intended for accessories, packaging or boxes. Premium Beauty News - So the customer journey ended in style? François Camilli - It closed on a creative workshop that enabled us to collect their feedback on the journey, take note of their favourite products, and determine next steps. It's important that we support our customers in their differentiation process, to anticipate their needs and deliver added value. Sarah Romay - This first 'Creative Days' event was a great opportunity to show our customers the different trades and innovations of LF Beauty. Beyond simply proposing a showroom dedicated to each of our activities, we recreated a common space full of inspiration, creation and collaboration called, the Idea Lab. It makes us tap into our five senses and provides us with all the tools necessary to imagine the products and packaging of tomorrow - including a 3D experiment station- while also taking inspiration from bygone packaging. We have to thank the company Musée à la Carte for lending us some magnificent collection pieces: powder compacts, beauty boxes, lipstick and perfume cases of the 30s or 19th Century… and not to mention a beauty spot box and a chatelaine of the 18th Century!"
France Lab to keep developing as part of the Marie Claire Group,"It has no plant, but a marketing and design creation workshop as well as a research and development laboratory near Paris, and customers all around the world: founded in 2007, perfume and cosmetics creation agency France Lab made itself known for its capacity for innovation and product quality. Among the agency's customers can be found distributors seeking a comprehensive service to develop their private labels, brands aspiring to diversification, but also cosmetics manufacturers looking for innovative products, an outside perspective, and insight, or young designers searching for expertise and advice. ""Our originality is based on the fact that we gather both creative (marketing/design) and technical (R&D/packaging engineering/purchase-development/regulations) teams and skills under the same roof, which makes it possible to offer our customers innovative services (product concepts and ideas from the marketing, technology, or packaging perspectives). We can meet all our customers' needs. We design brands and products, and we manage projects from the brand's identity and DNA to formulations and retail communication and image, including design and packaging development. We can even advise customers on distribution and guide them through the marketing phase,"" explains Serge Dantas, Deputy Managing Director. More than a creation studio or a mere formulation laboratory, France Lab endeavours to provide real turnkey solutions including brand strategy, creation, development, and manufacturing, via different industrial partners. ""We view ourselves as true beauty architects. We usually work on long-term projects over several months, or sometimes even years, because we need time to design and successfully establish a brand on such a competitive market as that of perfumes and cosmetics,"" Serge Dantas underlines. Today, the company counts about twenty employees, and it entered into an international development phase one year and a half ago, which materialized with the establishment of a three-employee subsidiary in New York. It also has a representative office in Hong Kong, and is considering founding a subsidiary in China. ""Our portfolio of Asian customers needs France Lab's expertise in the development and formulation of innovative, high-end skincare products. As an example, we have just developed a private label range of about twenty formulas for a high-profile Chinese operator in the hotel business sector."" France Lab's acquisition by the Marie Claire Group should help the agency provide its customers with the extensive know-how and visibility offered by its new parent company, but it should also stimulate its international development, using the luxury and beauty advertisers portfolio managed by the group. Likewise, France Lab does not exclude the possibility of external growth either, as it would help it position itself faster on the local level. As for the Marie Claire Group, they intend to expand their own diversification strategy by strengthening the service offer available to brands via its Beauty Factory, which used to be focused on market research."
Strand Cosmetics Europe to invest one third of net sales,"Quite an enviable track record for this French company, which today employs more than 150 people spread out across its headquarters and production site in Lentilly on the outskirts of Lyon, France. The current year looks very promising too with a turnover up by 10% over last year and the signing of several major contracts with both make-up and skin-care brands. ""We also have excellent prospects in the OTC cosmetic niche,"" emphasizes Éric Bouvier the CEO, ""a segment we decided to invest more thoroughly."" The end of 2015 truly looks like a turning point for Strand Cosmetics Europe, both in terms of industrial investments, with an increased automation of its packaging lines and also on a human level with the appointment of a new Sales and Marketing director, Denis Richard Orliange, a new laboratory manager for make-up applications (Nicolas Verrecchia) and finally of a Pharmacologist in charge of industrialization and packaging techniques (Matthieu Roux). ""These appointments create a real momentum with regards our industrial, commercial and research activities,"" explains Éric Bouvier, ""of which we are already seeing the positive effects, particularly with our portfolio of key accounts."" These ""human investments"" come together with important industrial investments that are already visible, with not only an increased automation of the packaging lines but also a 3,600 sqm extension of the facilities on the Lentilly site planned in 2017. ""These industrial buildings will enable us to comply with the GMP standards and the new premises will house the R&D, Marketing and Regulatory affairs departments,"" concludes Éric Bouvier. ""Our philosophy is clear, he insists, we want to continue to affirm and strengthen our image of quality, seriousness, reliability and competence across all levels of our expertise, especially for technical and regulatory matters, to stand as unavoidable players and always position ourselves as leaders in our field. The validation this year by the FDA of both this expertise and competence is a true sign of recognition that we appreciate to its true value."""
Designer Parfums diversifies its brand stable,"At the end of the 90s, the Mehta family at the head of the Shaleen group decided to shift from perfumery trading to buying brands. They created Designers Parfums in 2002, after having bought the Worth Paris brand. Then came Jean-Louis Scherrer, German fine leather brand Étienne Aigner, which they purchased from Puig, Ghost, the English fragrance brand for young girls, and of course, in 2011, Jean Patou, the iconic French luxury brand that was put on hold for a decade by Procter & Gamble: Designer Parfums purchased the whole brand (perfumery and couture) and managed to revive its perfume department with the famous Joy, 1000 Sublime, and the new editions of the Heritage Collection. Meanwhile, the group completed its stable of licensed selective brands with Porsche Design, which it acquired from Clarins, or Naomi Campbell Perfumes. As for distribution, Designer Parfums associated with local group Lux Brand on the North American market. Together, they chose to purchase brands that were well-established on the territory. That is how Ari by Ariana Grande perfumes and professional hair care brand Fred Fekkai got caught in the group's net. But the first step in the care sector was taken with the purchase of DDF dermatological products. ""We are proud to add these leading beauty brands to our portfolio of French heritage brands,"" Dilesh Mehta explains. Boosted by the successful rebirth of the Patou perfume house, the Designer Parfums group managed to build itself a varied catalogue in only a few years, and is now strategically positioned on the market. ""We hope to diversify our portfolio and be present on all market segments of the beauty industry: middle, prestige, and niche markets,"" the manager concludes. We will keep an eye on their progress as well as on the possible relaunching of the Couture department of Maison Jean Patou."

"Francois Luscan, Albéa: ""We need a long-term vision!""","Premium Beauty News - Is it not a bit tricky to be the Director of a group that weighs sixteen thousand people and still preach for agility? François Luscan - Being agile is both being reactive and flexible. With the turmoil we are experiencing in the world and on the market, it is absolutely essential to always be ready to adapt, and quickly. This is true for service, which must be even more reliable and flexible, for costs, which must be even more competitive everywhere, for the development of new products, which must be both fast and rigorous, for reactivity to our customers' supply and demand, and for the decisions regarding the best adapted production site, depending on both technologies and the deadlines expected. The idea is to implement effective industrial, commercial, and digital organizational structures, among others. Nevertheless, a large group cannot lose its strength and solidity! I am absolutely convinced that size is not incompatible with agility: we need to understand our challenges, be ambitious as regards our targets, and be able to commit both in the short and long terms. This is possible if we have strong teams, an expertise that is really present, and available means. Premium Beauty News - Customers are at the core of your strategy, more than ever. François Luscan - Customers have always been at the centre of Albéa's world! Some of them are international brands present both commercially and industrially all around the world. Almost half our portfolio is composed of regional or local customers. But today, more than ever, all our customers place the emphasis on service and competitiveness – in addition, of course, to the operational performance we always owe them. And none of them has the time to wait for a supplier to adapt to their needs, even if it is their first partner. That is why we endeavour to define the best business model in all our activities in order to meet their changing expectations: which organization, which product portfolio, which planning for our plants, which equipment… Premium Beauty News - Social and environmental responsibility is another important aspect of the missions you have committed to for a long time. François Luscan - Social and environmental responsibility (SER) has been an essential issue for us for more than 10 years, whether for our employees, customers, suppliers, and communities. It is really at the core of Albéa's strategy, and it comprises multiple initiatives and endless projects focused on our men and women, our industrial operations, our products, and of course, our customers, suppliers, communities, and other partners in our ecosystem. But we do believe the approach must be collective, maybe even by working with rivals on standards and regulations, and it is fundamental to have a long-term vision. Premium Beauty News - Another strength: innovation… on all levels! François Luscan - Innovation covers several areas. It must be technical, whether it applies to new products or new industrial processes. It must also be developed in design, and we produce more and more ""standard"" packaging that stick to market trends and are quickly available, at the right price. Ultimately, as far as specific developments are concerned, the idea is to make projects reliable, even those that are extremely complex. And let's not forget about patents: we are proud of being part of the first 50 companies registering patents in France! Innovation represents a large part of our investments. Premium Beauty News - Being both local and present all around the globe… How do you adapt to the economic and monetary turmoil in the world? François Luscan - You are going to be a bit surprised, but I think it is normal to experience turmoil. Some of the countries you are referring to have known a rapid expansion, so it is only natural for them to have a slowdown, and it is a good thing that the standard of living, the salaries, urbanization, and industrialization are improving in these areas. Of course, we must adapt quickly and as best we can, and sometimes it is hard. But just like we have been serving our customers for 50 years, sometimes the very same ones, Albéa's vision goes much farther than six months, one year, or five years ahead! Obviously, once these fluctuations have impacted our customers' supply decisions, they indirectly impact our industrial strategy, in particular our production capacity. Again, it is a matter of being agile and transferring our equipment from one site to another, if possible, adjusting our organizations if needed, investing in some equipment… This cannot be done in only a few days, and it can prove more costly and complex than what our customers expect, and what we hoped for. And yet, again, it is all about agility: we must be able to provide the best offer to all our customers, wherever they are in the world: the product they need, at the best total cost, in the shortest time possible, with the best service and quality. Of course, and this is the strength of a large group like ours, we also provide a real investment capacity, resources in innovation and development, strong industrial processes, an ambitious SER policy, let alone a solid, stable team with people they know and who are trusted by the organization. As I said, these are the fundamentals for sustainable development! Premium Beauty News - Will the companies in your sector keep congregating? François Luscan - To me, it is inevitable! And I am also talking about alliances. Of course, it does not mean the future is only in the hands of large industrial groups: regional, well-performing, and innovative companies will always play a crucial role. But the sector's major brands are also getting together; they are seeking to capture new markets and territories, and they need strong suppliers to support them and invest together with them in buildings, equipment, innovation, industrial processes, technical expertise, or regulatory affairs…"
The American manufacturer Oxygen Development acquires German manufacturer Carefull Colours,"It may be recalled that the Oxygen Development company is a leading private label manufacturer and service provider for colour cosmetics, skin and hair care products, headquartered in Palm Beach, Florida, USA. Starting over 15 years ago, Oxygen presently employs 650 employees in two manufacturing sites.

According to the company's leaders, this success ""is built on a strong technological background, focused on offering first rate product quality, customer service and expedite time to market for new product development."" ""Note, explains Stefano Castelletti, that the range of cosmetic automatic pens and pencils produced by Carefull Colours, currently in high demand for their convenient application and superior performance in the growing segment of lining, require a challenging and specialized technology and they will be certainly an important complement to the portfolio of Oxygen Developments"".

Feelunique.com is scaling up in France,"Premium Beauty News - You became the Director of Feelunique.com in January 2014 to contribute to its development in Europe, and in particular in France. What made you decide to take control of the company? Joël Palix - Feelunique was created in 2005 in Jersey and counts ten million subscribers today. E-commerce represents 4% of the market in France, 8% in the UK, and 10% in Germany. It is estimated to reach 20% in 2020. Feelunique's website is one of the pioneers in this sector, and it has a huge potential. Premium Beauty News - What are the advantages of the site? Joël Palix - The diversity of the brands, the service quality, the fact that different segments are represented – makeup, hair care, perfumery –, our international presence in 100 countries in Europe and the rest of the world… We have approximately 500 brands and over 17,000 products referenced, we cover all European countries, but also the United States, China, and Russia, and we even offer free delivery on orders over €15. In addition, customers can get personal help throughout the process, thanks to our beauty questionnaire or their history records. We will also launch our Try Me application before the end of the year, so they can be reassured when making choices. If they order a new product, they can receive a sample to test it, and then keep it or return it if they do not like it. It is important to be able to try the product, especially perfumes. As for their favourite products, our Subscription offer makes it possible to have them sent on a regular basis depending on the frequency of use, without having to order them. We are very keen to make the purchasing act as simple as possible. Premium Beauty News - What does the French website add to the English version? Joël Palix - The French version has been operational for two years, but right now deliveries are sent from the UK. We are hoping to open a subsidiary in France at the beginning of 2016. For this dedicated version, we have tailored our offering to the market: it does feature French brands, but the very trendy theme of British beauty has also been highlighted, with a selection of 55 So British! niche brands, including Nailsinc, Thisworks, bagsy, Miller Harris, TIGI, Topshop Beauty, Elemis, Sarah Chapman, Cowshed… With a turnover of €100 million expected in 2015, we aim for France to become our second market, after the UK. Premium Beauty News - What is Feelunique.com's target? Joël Palix - We target a generation of hyper-connected women under 30. They usually favour online shopping, as it is faster and it corresponds to their own culture. They often know more about products than sales assistants in stores. Beauty is a topic that is widely discussed online. So of course, we are very present on social networks. As a matter of fact, we have just launched – it is an exclusivity – the makeup brand founded by Fleur de Force, a beauty blogger and YouTuber that is extremely popular in the UK, with 4 million views a month."
"""Demand is strong for expert dermo-cosmetic products,"" Sabrina Ethève-Colson, Alpol Cosmétique","Premium Beauty News - Alpol Cosmétique is mostly involved in skincare? Sabrina Ethève-Colson - Yes, high-quality skincare is our core business, particularly for institutes or in dermo-cosmetics and dermo-aesthetics. We also have a significant expertise in the manufacture of sunscreen products. However, we are diversifying our portfolio with products in between skincare and make-up, in particular tinted suncare products and glosses. Our main expertise remains formulation, with of course particular attention given to ensure regulatory compliance. We can also conduct compatibility and efficiency tests and offer products manufactured in compliance with the most stringent standards. Premium Beauty News - Certification is an important part of your strategy. Sabrina Ethève-Colson - Our ambition has always been to provide our customers with cosmetics complying with the highest production standards. Since 2011, we have an ISO 22716 certification, which means we are compliant with good cosmetic manufacturing practices, and we recently obtained the ISO 13485 certification that relates to the quality management system for the production of medical devices, and we are also ISO 9001 certified. Alpol Cosmétique aims to provide services in line with requests from institutes and selective distribution but also with the expectations of pharmaceutical companies seeking to diversify their product offering with cosmetic, dermo-cosmetic and dermo-aesthetic lines. Premium Beauty News - Can you give us an example of one of these medical devices? Sabrina Ethève-Colson - We offer for example peelings with a high acid concentration. Products with mainly mechanical properties can also be in high demand in terms of medical devices. These treatments are increasingly popular in pharmacies and drugstores, with products being more and more high tech, often sold on an expert's medical advice or a pharmacist. Premium Beauty News - Just like institutes, it is a particularly demanding segment in terms of innovation? Sabrina Ethève-Colson - Absolutely! Dermo-cosmetics is a very demanding segment in terms of innovative actives and advanced delivery technologies. Alpol Cosmétique since June 2014 is also the holder of a patent on an encapsulation technique, which enables to release actives, not through friction during the application but through a chemical reaction with the skin. This allows adapting the release time of the active with the product's function and the customer's desire. Beyond these issues, like for every cosmetic, textures are also essential. As of September our new website will provide customers with a private access, an overview of our entire catalogue with a search engine for textures. Premium Beauty News - And what about investments? Sabrina Ethève-Colson - We expanded our logistics area to offer greater flexibility to our customers. Since the beginning of this year we now have almost 4,000 sqm dedicated to this purpose. We also plan to inaugurate a new laboratory early 2016 with a tripled surface area, always with the aim to consolidate our expertise in research, development and formulation. For our customers, we don't want to stand as a mere subcontractor, we want to be considered a fully fledged partner at the forefront of innovation. New for Fall 2015 At Beyond Beauty Paris 2015, from September 15 to 17, Alpol will showcase its new AGEceutix collection. Composed of 3 complementary products, this new innovative anti-ageing concept is based on a complex of highly efficient active ingredients and acts on all ageing signs for visible, immediate and long-term results. The range is composed of a filler, a cream and a blur serum."
Cosmax: 60 million dollars invested this year!,"""For skincare and make-up only, explains Jay Kim, CEO of Cosmax International, our turnover, which also rose sharply, will exceed US$ 500 million!"" The group, who, in this area, currently relies on five plants, with one in Korea, two in China, one in Indonesia and one in the USA (Ohio), has announced the intensification of its efforts in the area of packaging development (efforts that resulted in recent months in the creation of a Korea Research and Innovation Centre) with the opening of a similar second unit in the New Jersey premises, operational since January 8, and which should employ a hundred people in three years' time. ""In this area, we are working with the biggest brands,"" emphasises Jay Kim. Among recent successes developed by the Cosmax teams, a ""compact cushion"" fully patented by the group and already sold at more than 40 million units to its key customers. And there is more! The group also announced the strengthening of its production tool in China with the launch of two new units in Shanghai. ""As you know the Chinese make-up market is starting to wake up,"" explains Jay Kim. ""Chinese women have started to step up their consumption and it will explode in the coming decade."" Asia, the United States..., but this does not mean the Korean company is disregarding Europe, quite the contrary.... ""We've given ourselves two years to stabilize the things we started in the United States and Asia. Then we intend to invest in Europe and why not in France!"""
Italy's Intercos and Korea's Hana team up,"A strategic merging for both companies. Everyone visibly ""is a winner"" in the deal. The first, Intercos, by strengthening its base in Asia and more specifically in Korea where the Italian company has recently built a Research and Development centre, the second, Hana, who, through this partnership, will certainly have an opportunity to strengthen its expertise in the packaging and dispensing of cosmetic and skincare formulas and whose investments this year amounted to five million dollars, with the objective to purely and simply double its production capacity. Created in 1993 by Sung Il Kang, a former packaging engineer in charge of development at Amore Pacific, Hana can boast having among its most prestigious clients, the brand La Prairie to which it provides since 2010 particularly sophisticated airless systems. The Korean manufacturer owns some 45 injection machines, several automatic and semi-automatic assembly machines for pumps as well as a coating and metallization line. In terms of developed and marketed products, Hana relies not only on the success of its very sophisticated airless packaging line (70% of its turnover), but also on a series of new products, such as a new pump with an automatic closure that preserves the content; an airless packaging with a customizable dual compartment; another airless packaging with a very clever system for mixing two components upon use; a new lipstick tube with an automatic opening; a new mechanical pencil and, most of all, a new airtight and airless compact equipped with one of the smallest pumps in the world (8.5 mm high) with which the Korean company intends to capture a significant portion of the market for liquid foundations and BB Creams. The Intercos Group, which is the only ODM today with an extensive global manufacturing capacity and experiencing a strong growth in Asia mainly with skincare, achieved in 2014 a turnover of 350 million euros, up by more than 7% compared to the year before. And the 2015 provisional turnover is of 410 million euros (+17%). Only one credo at the Group's headquarters in Italy, ""constantly innovate but with an aim to be always the fastest and most competitive."" ""Time to market…, time to market!"" has always insisted Dario Ferrari. 525 people out of the 3500 that Intercos employs work on innovation. Nearly 15% of the workforce. The Group has twelve factories and a production capacity of more than 1.4 billion pieces per year! Colour cosmetics remain the bulk of the activity (60%), followed by pencils (28%), skincare (12%), among others. It is on the prestige market that the Italian company makes most of its business (37%), followed by mass (22%), direct sales (14%) and PLs (27%)"
The Alkos Group to develop its sales in North America,"The Alkos Group, one of the main French subcontractors in the cosmetics industry, is determined to focus on export and achieve an international turnover of 35% in 2015 (compared to 15% in 2011). To this aim, the company has strengthened its teams with two new recruits: Éric Goyer as International Business Development Director and, more recently, Viviane Jaillet as Sales Manager for Europe. As the Alkos Group has made North America a priority, it will feature its latest makeup innovations at the MakeUp in New York show, next September 9-19 at the Penn Plaza Pavilion. It is also getting ready for the forthcoming inauguration of a sales office in New York, and has chosen a large stand (26m2) to highlight its whole offering for North American customers. Meanwhile, to meet the growing demand for Made in France products, the Group has recently invested in a new line for plastic pencils and announced a complete line for wood pencils for 2016. ""Production tends to be relocated to Europe, which mostly has to do with deadlines and reactivity, and we have noticed a considerable rise in the demand for French-manufactured products from our strategic customers,"" explains Florence Lefeuvre, Sales, Marketing and Communication Group Manager. With one purchase every three or four months, mascara is the main product consumed on the makeup market in Europe, and thus represents another growth driver for the Group, which keeps investing in this sector. ""The formulas presented at the last Cosmoprof show in Bologna attracted the interest of brands, but their quality also surprised a few brush suppliers,"" highlighted Florence Lefeuvre. This success encourages Alkos to broaden its offer in this sector by developing new formulas: Curvissime, a mascara with a curling effect, will be showcased as a preview at MakeUp in New York, and a waterproof mascara is being developed for the 2016 edition of the Cosmoprof show. Here are a few of the new launches to be presented in New York: – Eyeliner Liquid Like: this pencil offers matchless intensity from the first application. It glides on flawlessly, provides optimized drying in no time, and lasts longer thanks to a new raw material. – Gel Sensation Lip Liner: this long-wear gel lip pencil provides a ""liquid like"" sensation on the lips, and again, glides on flawlessly and lasts longer, more than 15 hours! – Color Shine BB Lipbalm: this all-in-one, super comfortable, shiny stick formula is both a balm and a lipstick. Enriched with oils and endowed with a high SPF, it leaves the lips well-hydrated and protected. – Oil Infusion: an ultra-light, non-sticky, non-oily moisturizing oil that will coat lips with a different colour, depending on their pH! – Kiss Proof Aqua Lipstain: a fluid, highly-covering formula with a matte tattoo effect, but which only leaves an almost imperceptible, no-transfer film on the lips. – Studio Lipstick Jumbo Pencil & Jumbo Twist: a highly-pigmented formula conditioned as a waterproof pencil or with a Jumbo Twist mechanism, which delivers a no-transfer, velvet-matte colour only with a very small quantity of product on the lips, for ultimate comfort. – Sweet Lipstick Scrub: a lip scrub in the form of a stick, formulated with sugar, grapes pips, and crushed apricot kernels. – Beauty Secret Correcting Cream: a transparent foundation that evens and corrects the complexion without any stain effect. An original, innovative, unique formulation solution for all complexions, with no equivalent on the market. The Alkos Group will also take part in the Cosmetic 360 show organized by the Cosmetic Valley, whose first edition will be held at the Carrousel du Louvre, in Paris, on October 15 and 16, 2015. The French supplier is preparing several skincare and hygiene innovations for this event, in particular via its Sagal subsidiary specialized in the production of high-end perfumed soaps and sticks."
Cosmopolitan makes niche perfumery penetrate the Brazilian market,"Premium Beauty News - How did you get the idea to import niche perfumery brands into Brazil? Cristiane Vilar - Apart from Annick Goutal, Creed, or Bond No.9, Brazilians do not really have access to niche perfumery brands, simply because there are not any here. However, some of them did get to know them when travelling to France or abroad. So, as an importer, I decided to introduce the concept of niche perfumery in Brazil: no brand could ever have made it on its own. I worked in collaboration with a French-based partner, Claude Requena. We started by selecting various brands, and then we took the time to have them registered by ANVISA. It is pretty hard to be a pioneer in Brazil: it took us three years to get through the whole process, but we finally got to open our showroom with eight registered brands, Ann Gérard Parfums Paris, Mark Buxton Perfumes, Frapin & Cie, Comptoir Sud Pacific, E. Coudray, M. Micallef, Teo Cabanel, and Au Pays de la Fleur d'Oranger. Other brands will be showcased before the end of the year: Molinard, Arty Fragrance by Élisabeth de Feydeau, Paul Émilien, Rouge Bunny Rouge, and Les Parfums de Rosine. Premium Beauty News - What is the purpose of this 150m2 area, is it both a showroom and a store? Cristiane Vilar - The idea is not just to introduce new perfumes, but rather to make as many people possible find out about this concept and provide a different shopping experience. We make our customers embark on an olfactory journey to the south of France, Paris, and oriental countries, or on a historical trip with brands like Frapin, Teo Cabanel, and E. Coudray. France is at the core of the journey, as it is always been dear to the hearts of Brazilians, and it is where perfumery was born. We offer our customers an opportunity to discover and buy rare perfumes featured on an exclusive basis in Brazil, while immersing themselves in other worlds. Premium Beauty News - Have you considered extending the concept? Cristiane Vilar - We have, yes, although they are only projects for now. We have contacted other companies to reproduce the concept in São Paulo, Rio, and in the Nordeste. The e-shop is also being finalized. Other than niche perfumes, it will feature men's skincare products by British brand Gentlemen's Tonic, and Alorée organic cosmetics as well, later on. Premium Beauty News - Did your customers react positively to these rare perfumes? Cristiane Vilar - Very positively. Whatever their social class, Brazilians have always loved perfumes. They are also quite keen on the olfactory journey concept, which makes it possible to penetrate different worlds. Our customers are rather wealthy, but they are also curious and very open to novelty. There was a high demand for rarity and newness. Brazilians are willing to discover other scents than citruses, which are common here. They enjoy woody, oriental, and even Oud-based fragrances. Nevertheless, the public still needs to be educated about high perfumery. And that is the reason why I am working on organizing visits for creators in Brazil. I want them to be able to introduce their own brands. The first one, Ann Gérard, spent a few days in Brasília in August to see our showroom, present her collection to both the public and the press, and tell them about her own story and career. We are passionate about beautiful perfumes, so we have been investing our energy into promoting them in Brazil. There are still great things to achieve."
Graine de Pastel to open over 30 franchised stores within the next three years,"The opening of its first store in 2012 in Toulouse, France, was a real turning point for the brand created in 2003 by Nathalie Juin and Carole Garcia. Others quickly followed, both in the South East and the capital: Carcassonne in 2013, the central Marais quarter in Paris in 2014, Albi in 2015, and Paris again the same year, Rue du Dragon, near Saint Germain des Prés. And this September, the brand will inaugurate a 270 m2 spa in a new palace in Toulouse, M Gallery: La cour des Consuls. From the very beginning, the two creators had had in mind to revive a traditional ingredient: pastel oil, which is derived from the seeds and plants of the same name. ""It is a patrimonial plant from the region of Toulouse. Its leaves were traditionally used to make the famous blue pigment, but its oil has been renowned for its medicinal properties since the Ancient times,"" Carole Garcia explains. In order to secure its supply, the company established partnerships with farmers. Approximately 10 hectares will be cultivated in 2016, mainly via integrated farming, but also organic farming. Building on this success, Graine de Pastel is now about to take a new step forward in its development. Its ranges are being redesigned under the supervision of Marketing Director Leïla Veillon, with new packaging to reinforce the character of each line, while sticking to the visual coherence of the brand. But above all, as its concept is now well-established, the brand is banking on franchised stores, with two openings planned for this autumn, in Versailles and Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near Paris. The idea is to open about ten stores in 2016, and do the same in 2017 and 2018. Graine de Pastel also seeks to strongly develop its global sales and aims for 50% of export sales in 2018, compared to 15% right now. The company's products are currently available in Japan, China, Taiwan, and Korea. Several markets are opening up – Australia, the Middle East, the United States, Canada – and in Europe, the brand hopes to be able to rely on master franchise agreements. With its signature ingredient cultivated locally, and a purchasing policy that favours local sourcing from the Midi-Pyrénées region, Graine de Pastel stands out as an iconic brand in a new cosmetic region. It now endeavours to shift towards a more technical positioning, in addition to its patrimonial image: the brand has strengthened its R&D and is working on integrating new ingredients in its formulas. Skincare treatments have been developed for the stores located in Toulouse and Rue du Dragon, in Paris, which have booths available, and with a view to increase sales in spas. ""We pay particular attention to galenics. On the whole, we did not launch so many products in twelve years. And most important of all, we did not kill any,"" Carole Garcia explains. This method has actually proven more than efficient for this young brand, as it is about to play in the big league."
L'Occitane: a pivotal year,"Premium Beauty News - Quite an extraordinary story! Reinold Geiger - You are right! It is amazing! But it is only the result of a great work in common of the 8,000 Group employees and of a distribution network of nearly 3,000 stores across 90 countries. Just like all great stories, it begins with a meeting, that of Olivier Baussan. This meeting took place in 1992. A few decades earlier, Olivier, a 23 years old literature student, was busy distilling essential oils from Provence plants: rosemary, cade, lavender and olives. At the time he used to sell his creations on local markets. In 1976, he partnered with the chemist Yves Millou to create the brand ""L'Occitane"". In 1977, ""Le Relais Occitane"" the first store of the brand opened in Manosque in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence department. In 1981 the first ""L'Occitane"" factory opened in Provence in the town of Volx. Then in 1992 the first Paris store was inaugurated. The same year, the company opened its capital. I first invested in 1994 and then in 1996 in this company who as you may recall was on the verge of bankruptcy. In 1996 and 1997, we opened our first stores in New York, Hong Kong and Tokyo and started to develop the distribution network in France and abroad. Premium Beauty News - What makes L'Occitane so unique from the start? Reinold Geiger - One of the strengths of the brands owned by the Group is their dedication to creating effective cosmetic formulas from naturally derived ingredients. Year after year, the R&D teams share this ambition, while also ensuring that they respect the values of the brand. From the sourcing of botanical ingredients to the extraction and characterization of active molecules and effectiveness tests on the skin, the R&D teams of the Group work together in perfect synergy to offer the very best of plants, and to guarantee optimal quality and traceability (from the harvesting site to the finished product). Pioneers in natural beauty care, our laboratories launched a cosmetogenomics programme in 2009, to demonstrate and validate the effectiveness of active ingredients at the heart of cells. With an innovative development department that is able to create over 400 innovative formulas per year, we are renowned for our skincare expertise. Our team consisting of more than 100 researchers specialized in 20 different scientific disciplines, works on the development of new formulas. Patents for these formulas, demonstrating the effectiveness of the natural active ingredients, are regularly filed. Premium Beauty News - Innovation is at the heart of your strategy... Reinold Geiger - Thus, every year, almost 20 million euros are dedicated to our innovation centre that covers more than 2,500 m2. In recent years our investment in research and development increased at twice the rate of the Group's turnover, thus demonstrating our commitment to research and innovation. The centre is home to ten laboratories: molecular and cellular biology, analytical chemistry, plant extraction, microbiology, sensorial analysis, clinical evaluation, and three formulation laboratories (prospective, skincare and personal care). Across the Group, we have invested industrially speaking more than 120 million euros in the past two years. Premium Beauty News - This year's results are particularly good! Reinold Geiger - We are delighted to report a remarkable growth for the year, backed by our continuous commitment to a balanced focus on revenue growth and investments. We will continue to pursue our corporate strategy of achieving sustainable growth with greater efficiency. L'Occitane's evolving culture and innovative capability allows us to remain adaptive and attractive in the ever-changing global consumer markets. Looking ahead, the global macro-economic outlook may remain challenging, particularly with currency volatility. In order to further enhance the core L'Occitane brand awareness in global markets amidst the uncertain and ever-changing retail environment, we plan to implement a marketing program in the new financial year. We believe that a focused and disciplined approach to build the company for the future, together with the policy to reward management on a basis which is aligned to sustainable long term performance, will drive growth and deliver lasting value in the interest of the shareholders."
LF Beauty presents its new organization,"Premium Beauty News - Can you please first tell me a little bit about Li & Fung? Gerard Raymond - Certainly, Li & Fung is a world leader in the design, development, sourcing and logistics of consumer goods for leading brands and retailers worldwide. Founded in 1906 in southern China, today we are headquartered in Hong Kong and have more than 300 locations in over 40 different markets. Our network includes more than 26,000 employees and 15,000 suppliers around the world. Our customer relationships, supplier network and operations are unrivalled; we are proud to be the supply chain partner-of-choice for brands and retailers worldwide. Our product range includes fashion apparel, children's wear, sportswear, outerwear, handbags and accessories, footwear, beauty, home furniture and décor, home textiles, seasonal products and gifts. Our customer base includes a diverse range of brands and retailers including national brands, specialty stores, department stores, e-commerce, clubs, hypermarkets and off-price retailers. Premium Beauty News - Quite impressive, indeed! What is actually the weight of LF Beauty in the company? Gerard Raymond - LF Beauty is a global team with more than 3,000 people in locations around the world. We are formulators and suppliers of packaging, applicators and accessories, and we also have an expertise in filling and point of sale (POS) solutions. We are gradually moving into a leading position in the field of digital technology. We have factories in the United States, United Kingdom, China, Indonesia and Thailand, all which are supported by R&D labs in the UK, China and Thailand. Premium Beauty News - How is this new organization articulated? Gerard Raymond - The needs of our customers are clear: they demand continuous innovation, and they need a global response to their requirements. To us this means that customers are looking at ways to differentiate their position and add value to their offerings, they are therefore looking for a partner capable of providing this global response in a timely manner (speed to market is very important) and they expect the highest level of quality. Our new organization takes into account all of these requirements. We are fortunate to operate on different continents, and as I said earlier, this allows us to offer a response capacity in terms of formulations, packaging, applicators, accessories and even POS tools, not forgetting our ever-increasing expertise in the field of connected beauty (select visitors were given a chance to see the concrete applications at the last MakeUp in Seoul and MakeUp in Paris BtoB shows). Premium Beauty News - You boast being capable to offer solutions across the entire ""Beauty"" spectrum! Gerard Raymond - We don't boast, we prefer to highlight that we have solutions in the area of perfume, skin care, hair care, oral care, make-up and so on. We cover all of the beauty product categories and to illustrate this we have recently made investments in both formulations as well as manufacturing capabilities for facial masks, one of the fastest growing categories in skin care, these capabilities will come on stream in Quarter 4 of this year. Premium Beauty News - Your partnership arrangement with Korean company Cosmecca also proves your desire to work with top players in the sectors you are targeting! Gerard Raymond - I'm sure that you are aware of the fact that South Korean companies have become the benchmark for innovative skincare products in Asia. We want to give our customers the possibility to access the best of South Korea's formulation and manufacturing sector. Cosmecca is one of the leading beauty suppliers in the country, so it was only natural for us to collaborate with them. Under the terms of the agreement, which was announced in March, we will be able to build on the combined strength of our R&D teams and production capacity in South Korea, China, Thailand, the UK and Indonesia. The two companies will also pool their marketing resources behind new products and existing ranges and maximize the business opportunities among Li & Fung's customers in Europe and the United States. Premium Beauty News - Another topic on which your company is consistently working is that of the development of all the tools enabling you to take a leading position in the field of connected beauty! Gerard Raymond - We see it as the biggest challenge for the beauty industry in the coming years. In the future, with artificial intelligence, it will be possible to go even further and correct our image in real time. As our team demonstrated at MakeUp in Paris in June, it will be possible to integrate a voice speaking application to our tools to listen to both beauty tips and health tips. Bathroom mirrors will conduct diagnosis along with comparisons over time. We will be able to virtually try our wardrobe and our accessories and share our experiments on social media. We will have our 3D holographic clone. While some applications are still some way off, others are just around the corner. We have already designed projects implementing digital related technologies for a number of leading brands. Technology is the first step and we can use it to attract customers' attention, however, what really should come first is to have consumers cooperate with brands, to get them to play, surprise them and most of all, to thoroughly test it before launching a technological solution. Interfaces must be intuitive and quickly capture attention to trigger a purchase. Let me share a specific case study with you. Last year we developed an interactive application in the form of a game for the launch of Estée Lauder's new fragrance MYNY by DKNY. For three weeks, interactive displays with motion detectors were installed at Debenhams on Oxford Street. So when someone walked by the store, the interactive screen would invite them to follow the perfume bottle on the digital display. Picture captures of the passers-by were then given inside the store where they could then share them via social media. It was a really engaging and fun consumer experience."
Keystone completes acquisition of French company Centre 7,"Polychromatic, the nail polish division of the Keystone Industries portfolio of companies, and one of the founders of the gel polish technology, announced they have acquired French company Centre 7 (C7). ""Centre 7 has a distinguished reputation in the masstige and luxury cosmetic market,"" highlights Keystone. When complete, this acquisition will signify pivotal expansion into the global beauty arena for Keystone Industries. ""We're expecting the acquisition of Centre 7 to strengthen the opportunities in the beauty industry not only in the United States market, but also throughout Europe,"" said Cary Robinson, President of Keystone. ""It's a well-respected company that manufactures products of distinction."" Centre 7, located near Paris, in the Cosmetic Valley, has been in business for more than 20 years in the beauty and personal care industry. Centre 7 specializes in the filling and packaging of nail polish and other luxury cosmetic products. ""The dedicated team at Centre 7 is known for their high levels of quality control and customer service, vital characteristics which are the building blocks of Polychromatic's overall mission,"" says Keystone. With anticipated capacity of filling close to 30 million bottles annually, Keystone intends to grow Centre 7 as an ideal vendor for both bulk and packaged cosmetics. There are immediate plans to expand the facility for the full-scale production of nail polish. The acquisition will also give Polychromatic the ""Made in France"" quality advantage, and a closer proximity to larger French and European customers. According to Keystone, the Centre 7 plant has been audited by major cosmetic brands, and is rated to use flammable products, something that is difficult to obtain in Europe. The integration of Centre 7 allows Keystone's existing entities — Keystone Research & Pharmaceutical and Polychromatic – to leverage on a platform to showcase its R&D, technologies and services."
"""Our ambition is to double our sales by 2020,"" Julien Saada, Maesa","Premium Beauty News - Exclusive brands now account for nearly 50% of your activity. Is it a change of direction for Maesa? Julien Saada - It is indeed a strategic course for us, but it is also the natural extension of our private labelling activity. When a retailer decides to launch his own brand, he may feel the need to create a brand which is different from his own retail brand. This is the case with Monoprix in France and the brand Elle, of DM in Germany with P2 Cosmetics or of Walgreens in the United States with Circa Color Cosmetics. The difference between pure private labelling and creating an exclusive brand is that in the second case the brand belongs to us, which means we are the ones who invest in marketing and communication. It's a whole new business model but it does not change our customer model. Each brand has its own unique and exclusive customer. Being able to offer exclusive brands simply enabled us to gain new customers. We are now managing seven exclusive brands and working towards their development. The Elle brand for example, will be launched at Sephora Spain, and we will launch early 2016, at Ulta in the United States, a very professional make-up brand bearing the name of a make-up artist. The other consequence of the rise of exclusive brands in our activity is the growing share of the make-up category, which now represents 45% of our turnover, that is, as much as perfume. The remaining 10% consisting of the bath & body care and home fragrance category. Premium Beauty News - Now that you have this brand management experience, are you not tempted to extend the adventure with a classic brand that you would propose to different retailers? Julien Saada - No, we do not want to have a brand among others to offer our retailers, it isn't our line of business. We strongly believe in a differentiated offer and our mission is to bring exclusivity to our clients, with products that can only be found in their stores. Premium Beauty News - What are your growth prospects? Julien Saada - In 2014 our growth reached 18%, with sharp rises in Europe (Elle, Habitat) and the Middle East, particularly in Dubai with Landmark, a retailer specialized in fashion, where our brand Elle is distributed and with the Kamal Osman Jamjoom Group, specialized in lingerie and beauty with the Nayomi and Mikyajy branded stores. For 2015, our growth will benefit from the acquisition of P2 Cosmetics and we aim by 2020 to increase almost twofold our turnover, that is, an average 15% growth per year. If we first focused our development on Europe and North America, we now plan to take a closer look into Asian markets, especially China. Premium Beauty News - What are the circuits that will best support this ambition? Julien Saada - For us, the most dynamic circuit is undoubtedly the one of drugstores, followed by supermarkets. This is where volumes are the highest. But we also work a lot with textile brands. Premium Beauty News - And exclusive brands will be the main drivers of this growth? Julien Saada - Not exclusively. We expect a balanced growth of our three business segments. Alongside exclusive brands, the private labelling activity represents about 27% of the Group's turnover. It is our historical activity and we have acquired in this sector a know-how, recognized by our customers. We can not only develop products, but also propose the appropriate merchandising and advice to our customers, including for the composition of their ranges. We are also aiming to double our turnover in this sector by 2020. The outsourcing activity, our third segment, is focused on beauty brands. We work with brands that entrust us with the development and production of lines that they do not have the time or inclination to develop internally. This allows them to diversify their activities, at an attractive cost. We will, for example, launch the bath & body line of the brand Artdeco. Premium Beauty News - Given this important growth, do you plan to equip yourself with your own production tools? Julien Saada - Since our inception we have made the choice of being a fabless company. No investment of this type is planned. Given the diversity of our productions we prefer working with a range of very reliable partners on several continents and with whom we have built a long term relationship."
"Au Pays de la Fleur d'Oranger, a brand from the land of high perfumery","Au Pays de la Fleur d'Oranger is meant to be atypical and stand out from the usual codes of luxury perfumery. The name is quite long and can make it pretty hard to export the brand, but Virginie claims it as a real identity. She uses white, partly opaque Saverglass bottles to disentangle the visual from the olfactory and thus avoid trying to influence choices to let the nose express itself. ""I like going against the norm,"" confides Virginie Roux. A flagship raw material, Néroli Blanc or bitter orange tree flower, supports a trilogy of various accords: Neroli Blanc L'Eau de parfum contains accords of Neroli, lemon tree petitgrain, bergamot orange, rose jasmine, and benzoin; Néroli Blanc Intense is stronger, with verbena, bergamot orange, rose jasmine, and cedar accords; Néroli Blanc L'Eau de Cologne is fresher with its accords of grapefruit, bergamot orange, rose, and tea. The new Eau de parfum Néroli Oud completes the collection with a more powerful juice. ""The original, unique note that mixes Neroli and Oud reveals certain aspects of the Oud note that perfectly suit our Western markets. It is a real astonishing, explosive blend,"" Jean-Claude Gigodot explains. The second creation, Eau de Madeleine, celebrates the memory of women that left a mark on our lives with a more powerful scent, where the very high concentration in Encens prevails. The opaque, black bottle surmounted by a wooden cover designed by Pujolasos is decorated with a vintage tin application. Eau de Madeleine introduces the Liberté collection dedicated to free women profiles, which will count four fragrances. With its sophisticated compositions made with natural materials rather than too many synthetic ones, the Au Pays de la Fleur d'Oranger range will delight a well-informed public. The brand is present on the global level, mainly in Europe and the Middle-East, and is available in Paris at Sens Unique."
"""The cosmetics market is changing completely,"" Loïc Armand, Cosmetics Europe","Premium Beauty News - You have announced a slight growth of the cosmetics market in Europe for this year. What are the prospects for the European industry? Loïc Armand - We are extremely positive about the prospects for our industry! We can now say the crisis is over in Europe. The market showed a growth rate of +0.5% in 2014, compared to the -1.4% decline we experienced in 2013. Some countries are still suffering and remain in recession, but on the whole, the European market is picking up again, and even in the countries where this upturn was slower, it is getting better. The cosmetics industry in Europe represents 4,500 companies, including over 4,000 SMEs, and 1.5 million direct jobs, including 25,000 scientific jobs (+5.3% since 2004). The other reason why we are optimistic is that we have been performing well on global markets. The European industry is the largest cosmetics exporter in the world. In the next 15 years, 1.5 billion people in the world will become part of the middle class. This is an extraordinary opportunity for our industry, which is taking action to participate in satisfying the needs of these new consumers. Premium Beauty News - What actions are actually taken? Loïc Armand - First, we have decided to focus on research and innovation. We are foreseeing a real change of paradigm, in particular with a revolution in the customer relationship, and also many environmental challenges. The digital revolution and social networks are transforming both distribution networks and the relationship between consumers and brands. Supply is getting more and more personalized, and brands have entered into a closer dialogue with consumers. Cosmetics are all the more sensitive to this phenomenon since they bear a strong intimate dimension. It is not trivial to apply a product on one's skin. Premium Beauty News - What about the environment? Loïc Armand - The cosmetics industry is perfectly aware of the challenges related to the increasing demand on the global level. As a collective, the European industry has volunteered for the Product Environmental Footprint project managed by the European Commission to develop a harmonized method for calculating the environmental footprint. For technical reasons, our project on rinse-off products has not been selected among the Commission's pilot projects, but we have worked on it on a voluntary basis and we are hoping to get applicable results in 2016. Beyond the projects supervised byCosmetics Europe on behalf of the whole industry, companies strongly commit to ambitious projects designed to reduce their environmental impact on an individual basis. For example, L'Oréal has undertaken to reduce its CO2 emissions by 60% in absolute value by 2020. Other companies like Unilever and many of our members have defined their own objectives. Premium Beauty News - Regulatory harmonization is also one of Cosmetics Europe's main objectives. Loïc Armand - I would rather talk about convergence. The cosmetics industry has had this objective in mind for a very long time, and it makes perfect sense with the ongoing development of global markets and e-commerce. Online sales might actually reduce the States' ability to control their own markets. Convergence is an important challenge for the European industry, as it is a major exporter. We consider the European regulatory model as one of the best in terms of consumer and environmental protection. It is based on scientific risk assessment, and it is according to this principle that we have been promoting it around the world. In practice, we are one the safest industries in the world, and we think we deserve to be trusted by regulators. Premium Beauty News - Could you give us an update on the negotiations regarding the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) in the field of cosmetics? Loïc Armand - The TTIP represented a unique opportunity to solve significant regulatory divergences between Europe and the United States, in particular the definition of cosmetics, which differs a lot on each side of the Atlantic. We have to admit there is no political will to put the most important diverging elements on the negotiating table. Cosmetics Europe has worked with its American counterpart, the Personal Care Products Council, on a list of divergences we intended to solve. The list was forwarded to the authorities in charge of the negotiations, but obviously, they did not wish to go that far. However, if Europe and the United States had agreed on a regulatory model, their influence would have been considerable throughout the world. We have not completely given up moving in this direction, but right now, the TTIP negotiations are focused on more technical issues like the mutual recognition of the lists of UV-filters recognized as both safe and efficient, or the mutual recognition of the alternatives to tests on animals validated by the OECD. That being said, we are convinced the next transformations in the cosmetics market, in particular the rise of online sales, will encourage this convergence."
Natura cultivates its naturalness,"Premium Beauty News - 1.3 million advisors represent and sell Natura products in Brazil. As this force has made the brand successful in an increasingly competitive, retail-driven environment, how can you make it change? Marcelo Bicalho Behar - Natura has developed around the customer relationship: direct selling guarantees trust, which is a key element, here in this country. These women and men represent one of the founding pillars of the group. They have actually come to form a social network, in the original meaning of the word, and we have been mixing it with online networks for a year. We have transposed the advisor-customer relationship on the Internet, which makes access to our products easier, while preserving the link between our consulting trademark and a real relationship. This mix works perfectly well and the advisors concerned have already got better results. Our pool of advisors is being renewed with many young people, who see this job as an interesting way to pay for their studies. They are very knowledgeable about what the Internet has to offer. Premium Beauty News - Are there other ways for tourists visiting Brazil to have access to Natura products? Marcelo Bicalho Behar - Today, tourists can buy our products through our consultants in Brazil or on our portal rede.natura.net. In addition, we are considering increasing our presence in airports and launching an amenities project in hotels. Premium Beauty News - What about the global markets less used to direct selling? Marcelo Bicalho Behar - By purchasing Aesop, Natura has banked on a brand that shares the same values and helps it monitor the retail model in many countries. Besides, we are still working on experimental operations on mature markets like France, where our marketing strategy on ingredients from Amazonia is very well-perceived. European consumers are very sensitive to products' sustainability. Premium Beauty News - Is sustainability not a strong argument in Brazil? Marcelo Bicalho Behar - We are the first Brazilian company to have developed eco-responsible products for Brazilian consumers. Our commitment to preserving Amazonia has become natural, it just goes without saying. Over 15 years, 15 million Brazilians have moved out of poverty: they have gained access to ""non-essential"" products, and as a middle class they have become demanding in all respects. Therefore we need to offer them both innovative and sustainable products, and to this aim we dedicate 3% of our turnover to these requirements. Premium Beauty News - How do you organize responsible innovation at Natura? Alessandro Mendes - We have set up a very strict innovation process over the last 12 years to control carbon emissions at each phase of development, for each new product. We launch 150 new products every year. Our rule is that a new product's environmental impact must be lower than that of the product it is meant to replace, and if it is not, a committee decides whether it can still be launched or should be reviewed. We aim to keep improving quality, while reducing the environmental impact. We have replaced all mineral oils by vegetal oils, and 88% of our formulas are plant-based. Premium Beauty News - Your flagship ingredients are derived from the Amazonian biomass. How can you exploit it while still preserving it? Alessandro Mendes - We remain close to local populations. We show them the forest is a valuable source in the long term, and it is more profitable to protect it if we want to obtain a regular income from it, rather than clearing parcels to sell wood. As for ingredient sourcing, we draw inspiration both from their very instructive practices and traditional research. Natura guarantees efficient traceability by selecting the harvesting methods and periods with the communities, and then our partners – Symrise, Croda, or BASF – take over. Premium Beauty News - Which segments are you focusing on for your next developments? Alessandro Mendes - We intend to establish ourselves even more firmly as leaders on skincare products adapted to Brazilian skin types, as this segment has a strong potential, like makeup."
GEKA Group set for growth with the acquisition of OEKA,"GEKA, one of the world's leading manufacturers of brushes, applicators and complete packaging systems for the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries, is the new owner of OEKA, an internationally active manufacturer of plastic and metal components. The merger will strengthen the global market position of the two regional companies from Franconia. ""Our aim is to create a globally operating German champion specialized in the development and production of applicators and complete packaging systems for the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries,"" said Nikolaus Michelsen, managing director of GEKA. ""At the same time, we are eager to retain going forward OEKA's tight-knit corporate culture with its rich tradition rooted in Franconia."" OEKA, which has a history that stretches back more than 100 years, is specializing in deep drawing of metal, plastic injection molding, surface finishing and assembly technology. OEKA's product range also extends to the development and manufacture of hybrid parts, such as innovative brushes and applicators for cosmetic and medical applications. ""I am especially pleased that GEKA is going to retain the approximately 220 employees and is even planning to make new hires,"" said insolvency administrator Joachim Exner, partner at the law office Dr. Beck & Partners, after the purchase agreement was signed yesterday evening. The transition is scheduled for mid-July 2015, and the creditors have already consented to the sale, the amount of which has not been disclosed. ""For us, OEKA is the perfect partner to help implement our plans for global growth and expand our value-added chain,"" said Amaury de Menthière, managing director of GEKA. ""Above all, we will be relying on the experience of OEKA's highly qualified employees and the production capacities of the Bamberg location. With regards to the planned growth, we intend to invest millions into the site to upgrade its technology."" GEKA also anticipates that merging the two companies and the use of a single brand will generate synergies with regard to the cost of materials. More specifically, GEKA plans to integrate the OEKA BEAUTY and OEKA MED divisions into the GEKA Beauty and GEKA Healthcare divisions. However, the OEKA Tech division will be assigned to the recently founded GEKA company 'OEKA Tech Automotive GmbH'. It is also planned to give the OEKA executives some greater additional responsibilities within the GEKA Group."
Ancorotti Cosmetics: exponential growth,"The new registered office and head office alone employs 130 people, distributed in brand new premises, the interior design of which evokes the intense creativity of its founders, especially Enrica Ancorotti. Twenty million euros in turnover in 2013, thirty million last year and nearly 40 million expected this year, including 5 million in skincare, the Ancorotti saga is a very good example of this - family owned - Italian industry where the catchword is clearly ""here we work!"" Because such progress and such results owe obviously nothing to chance. And as everyone knows, the example comes from above… Not a day, not a week, not a month passes without Renato Ancorotti and his daughter Enrica, not taking front stage, one of them travelling around the world, constantly in touch with customers, and the other studying new formula for a new development. ""And that's not all, explains Enrica, we also have to manage the production and logistics of a business employing about 125 people today. To better cope with growth and the new organization we decided to recruit Marco Mazzola as our General Managing Director. He has been in cosmetics for 30 years."" The gone through road for Ancorotti Cosmetics - almost - operating in all segments, from make-up to skincare, is impressive! With regard to its industrial capacity, managers have pulled out all the stops in past months. ""Thanks to this, explain officials, we are only using 73% of our total capacity, which makes us extremely flexible to deal with unexpected new orders."" To note that the Italian firm probably has one of the most impressive pool of back injection machines in the area, with a total of 13 units capable of producing some 63,000 pieces per shift and per day! The filling capacity for mascaras is not bad either with 185,000 pieces per shift and per day! This did not prevent the company from also investing heavily in compaction machines and quality control equipment for powders. ""Our full service activity has not stopped growing in recent months,"" says Renato Ancorotti. ""So much so that this year it will account for 55% of our business!"" Reflecting other Italian companies in the sector, its export activity is continuing to grow, now representing more than 80% of its turnover. The most recent development being the opening in January of a subsidiary in New York. A momentum that is certainly not ready to end. The company announced the development and production of a new product in a ""new"" building by the end of the year. As for its presence at MakeUp in Paris, it will be marked by the presentation of a new collection where make-up becomes art in all its forms, with innovative products that allow a woman to use her beauty as a perfect canvas on which she can draw, paint, sculpt and refine her facial features."
Brazil: Fareva develops its own exclusive skincare collections,"Due to its climate, different skin types and consumption patterns, Brazil has its own requirements when it comes to cosmetics. Thanks to its satellite laboratory dedicated to sourcing and customer knowledge, Fareva now lies at the heart of the Brazilian market and develops two body and face skincare collections every year. This approach is new for the group, and is enriched with the experience of its newly integrated makeup division, Chromavis, which offers customers innovative textures and formulas several times a year. After Amazonia, Hemisphere Advantage, the collection launched in late 2014, was meant to be surprising: whitening intimate hygiene product, gasless deodorant, anti-aging shampoo, hair gel with an SPF, anti-cellulite aerosol, revitalizing eye contour roll-on, SPF 99 or anti-dark spot sun products with a dry feel, Wake up cream with a light texture… This really original range comprises 16 references with extracts from Latin America, and also two fragrances for Men and Women. Launched in May 2015 with 15 products to be available by the end of the year, the new collection, Mystical Treatments, targets city dwellers seeking escape and puts an emphasis on sun care, a booming segment in Brazil. It already comprises a skincare shower gel, zen and youth mists, a mummy and baby family moisturizer, an after-sun refreshing foam, a post-sunburn mask, and an anti-aging night mask. ""We aim to offer Brazilian players a different concept for cosmetic products. Our collections in Brazil are developed with this spirit, but they can be produced in any country,"" Thibaut Fraisse explains. This is a winning strategy for the group, which expects to double its number of local customers as it has now by the end of the year."
Omnicos: 17 years already!,"The gone through road is impressive for this Italian SME specialized in the creation and production of cosmetic formulations intended for the make-up industry! ""There is no secret recipe,"" explains Manuela Guerrini, the Sales Director, ""to insure one's development and presence today in this make-up niche, we must innovate, innovate and innovate! In 2010, we created our own R&D laboratory."" As a proof, this new ""fluffy concept"" recently developed and whose main characteristic is the sensoriality and the three-dimensionality of the product. Another proof, our 24h long lasting automatic pencils. Not to mention this new tablet tint concept: colour tablets to be mixed with a face primer to create different colours suited to each skin. A whole series of novelties that will be presented at MakeUp in Paris in a few days. ""In fact, insists Mr. Cicchetti, the company's CEO, we actually invest between 8% and 10% of our turnover each year in this innovation policy."" The company can also boast achieving 85% of its turnover from export sales with, as priority markets, for the time being, France and Germany. ""But we have set foot on the US market last year,"" emphasises Manuela Guerrini. Another strong point of Omnicos, and not the least, its ability to create its own filling and automated machines through its partnership with the company Automation IDM, located near Milan. ""This gives us obviously quite a lot of flexibility"", explain officials at Romanengo."
Sensai to launch first fragrance ever,"Launched in 1983, four years after the first steps of Kanebo in Europe, the Sensai brand is the international flagship of the Japanese cosmetics giant. The brand is currently available in 4400 doors in 43 countries, mainly in Europe (34 countries) but also in the Middle East (8 countries) and South Africa. The main markets being Germany and Italy. ""We want to transform Sensai into an independent global luxury brand, with both functional and emotional features, with a strong and consistent identity, in order to compete with French and European rivals,"" says Yuji Naito, who has been responsible for revamping the brand since 2012. Mr Naito thus decided that all Sensai products would be reformulated with Koishimaru silk, the prestigious ingredient that originally contributed to Kanebo's success in Japan. Into cosmetic products, this silk, an exceptional fibre once reserved for the imperial family, has exceptional moisturizing properties and can stimulate the production of hyaluronic acid. As a second step, the design Simultaneously, the brand entrusted Gwenaël Nicolas, a French designer based in Tokyo and founder of the agency Curiosity, to fully rethink the products packaging drawing on the brand's roots and DNA. Thus were born in 2012 the new packaging inspired from silk cocoons. In 2013, the brands transformation culminates with the launch of the Ultimate Cellular Performance range, and in January 2014, Sensai Cosmetics Inc. is created to succeed Kanebo International. ""Sensai is one of the five key brands of Kanebo. It must become a major player in the 'super prestige' segment and is poised to become Kanebo's first true international brand by expanding from Europe to Asia,"" adds Yuji Naito. The brand will therefore carry on to strengthen its ultra-premium offer by completing its Ultimate range and continue to differentiate from its competitors through its Japanese origins in particular by communicating on its ""skincare saho"" method, derived from the Japanese tradition of hospitality and service. In September 2015, Sensai will launch its very first fragrance, based on the collaboration between Mary Salamagne, perfumer at Firmenich, and designer Gwenael Nicolas. Named ""The Silk"" (of course!) the fragrance will be available in two 50 ml versions: Eau de Parfum and Eau de Toilette. ""The fragrance will contribute to build the Sensai universe and reinforce the emotional side of the brand,"" concludes Yuji Naito. Entry into new markets will come next, with Asia as a priority."
Granado's made in Brazil cosmetics are on a roll,"When Nazish Munchenbach took over the marketing department in 2004, Granado was moribund and under bankruptcy threat. But as she was both convinced of the brand's potential and moved by the affection Brazilians of all generations felt for it, she started by rebuilding its image with the support of Christopher Freeman. She got some help from a designer friend based in New York City, Jérôme Berard, and from Sissi, Christopher's daughter, and drew from the brand's precious archives to recover its original DNA. A team of eight people worked on updating the visual identity, which was to become a key element of this rejuvenation. The image was restored with colours and drawings from the old days, and attracted a new generation fond of the vintage trend. Meanwhile, ranges developed and grew wider, and the other Brazilian historic brand, Phebo, fell into Christopher Freeman's hands as well – but both needed a showcase to present their new faces. Again, Nazish Munchenbach drew inspiration from the brand's movable heritage, delving into the past, and restoring the old furniture stored in the back shop of her very first pharmacy to redecorate and give a new boost to the historic store located on Primeiro de Março street, in Rio. ""The dusty place still had this 70s Formica style,"" she recalls. In 2005, it became the first flagship store of a long series, as Granado/Phebo counts more than 40 points-of-sale across Brazil today, as well as an online store. With Phebo and Granado, Brazilian customers - 40% of men - were able to bring back their memories of childhood scents, an integral part of their own stories. But they could also revive quality products with genuine fragrances like lavender, which, as it is associated with baby care in all families, conditioned Brazilian women's taste for this scent from elsewhere. Soaps are plant-based, and skincare products are mostly formulated with natural ingredients, without being tested on animals. ""We mainly aim for efficacy and safety, without going indiscriminately natural,"" specifies Nazish Munchenbach. Now, the brand does not intend to stop at the 20% growth rate per year it has shown since 2005. In addition to the historic Phebo plant in Belem, it has just opened a new plant in the State of Rio to meet the production demand. It has also announced a 22% growth for the beginning of 2015, and is savouring an unexpected breakthrough on the French market. When cousins Mario and Antonio Santiago created Phebo in Belem in 1930, they intended - and managed - to compete with French brands, which dominated the market, by offering exclusively high-end, plant-derived products. ""More than 100 years later, things have gone our way, and it is a nice reward to see how warmly the French have welcomed Phebo and Granado products,"" confesses Nazish Munchenbach. Indeed, given the results and craze the French quickly showed for these vintage, genuinely Brazilian products, the almost exclusive partnership with Le Bon Marché in Paris was extended. However, when the brand has found its ideal distribution channel, no doubt it will liberate itself from the left-bank Parisian department store. As an example, it opened a subsidiary in Paris in September 2013, and has also gradually appeared in a few points-of-sale elsewhere in France. ""We have maintained relationships based on closeness with our partners in France. It is essential, because we value our Brazilian identity and want to keep it this way. Our country is quite popular in France,"" concludes Nazish Muchenbach."
B. Kolormakeup opens a second factory,"""This is a brand new building,"" underlines Mario Luigi, co-founder, ""in which we installed all our powder activity and several research laboratories. We also divided, in the form of independent workshops, the different production types."" The current site of Treviglio will continue to house the other remaining research laboratories and the production of products in an emulsion form. With a 40% increase in its turnover last year, compared to the previous year and a 2015 start to the year particularly tonic, B. Kolormakeup & Skincare is unquestionably reaping the fruits of its past years' innovation and investments policy. ""An increase in activity, which forced us to step up last year, again the number of production machines,"" explains Mario Luigi. The other ingredients in this winning recipe, we were told at the Head Office, being, research, innovation and business strategy. ""We are a small company with all the advantages of flexibility and proximity and we want to preserve this exception,"" insists Mario Luigi. ""It is not a question of growing for the sake of growing. We have earned the trust of customers who rely on us and our service capacity."" Commercial successes, which are of course directly related to the Italian company's product development strategy. ""One of our strengths,"" insist company officials, ""is to continue to develop ourselves drawing our inspiration from what is happening around the world, especially this so-called 'natural' trend, through the development of high performance organic products. A research work, which started ten years ago, and which is for us a source of great satisfaction and concrete orders. To date, among the latest examples of innovations, we have developed a new range of products, called 'second skin' that perfectly expresses this need for invisible perfection."" With this in mind, B. Kolormakeup will present around forty new products at the next MakeUp in Paris tradeshow. Not to be missed..."
"""Pour Toujours"", with Martine Denisot","While she was busy with her career in communication and tourism, Martine Denisot longed to penetrate the secrets of perfumery, but kept it to herself. The day she met Jacques Polge was a fortunate coincidence: he opened the doors of the Chanel Laboratory for her to ""train her nose"", watch, and learn. She dissected raw materials, investigated dilutions, and experienced creation for a whole year. These first steps in the inner circle of perfumery reinforced her desire to be part of it. She went on with her training at Cinquième Sens, where she met Anne-Sophie Behaghel and Amélie Bourgeois, who she later supported by becoming her associate as part of the Flair olfactory creation studio project. At that stage, Martine Denisot could finally create; and she did not think twice. For herself, her family, her husband, and the people around her, but just for fun. Then, it is an unexpected collaboration with Lostmarc'h that gave her a boost. She composed a mist around quince, inspired from the gardens in her native Berry region, in central France. The idea of commercially sharing her creations eventually became reality, and this is how the Pour Toujours collection was recently given birth. The six fragrances introducing this new confidential perfume range are presented in a pretty bottle capped with porcelain and luxuriously laid in Philippe Di Méo cases. The formulas are short, but very sophisticated, and mostly with natural raw materials. ""I am trying to create cocoon, 'feel-good' perfumes that correspond to the slow movement philosophy"", Martine Denisot explains. Bootylicious, a floral fruity fragrance also worked with quince, is combined with the Davana flower, among others; Tudo Bem evokes the soft atmosphere typical of Brazil, like a caipirinha scented with citrus fruit, bergamot orange, citron, mint, ginger, and black pepper; Pyrus is a pear and vetiver fruity perfume; Graines, a childhood memory at the seed merchant's, with barley, cocoa, cardamom, and oregano aromas; Boule de Gomme smells like the softness of orange blossom and lavender, while Khasmin is a narcissus, jasmine, saffron and sandal Oud perfume blown away by the desert winds… The collection will be exclusively available at the Bon Marché, in Paris, in June, at 160 euros for 100ml."
Private Label: the Arthes Group widens its offering,"With no less than seven new contracts in 2014 and both home fragrances and perfume creations, the Private Label department of the Arthes Group has achieved a two-digit growth since it was launched four years ago. It already represents 10 to 15% of the company's turnover. ""The team gradually structured itself. It now counts four full-time employees and works in perfect synergy with the other departments,"" explains François Papyle, who used to work at L'Oréal and Panini and joined the Arthes Group in October 2014 as the Sales Director. The strong presence of the Arthes sales teams with mass distribution buyers in France and around the world makes it possible to report information on the needs expressed by brands. ""This is a considerable business advantage,"" François Papyle emphasizes. The services of the Private Label department of the group are mainly turned towards export (90% of the activity), in particular to Europe and the Middle East. They started by attracting the major drugstore chains seeking affordable products developed by private labels. Decoration and textile brands are also growing more and more interested. Another advantage of the Arthes Group in this sector is its production capacity of over 120,000 bottles per day, which helps meet the conditioning demand from numerous international brands. With 75 maceration tanks and 7 fully automated filling chains, the group has one of the largest perfume production plants in the south of France. The investments that came with the group's launching of the brand Jeanne in the French region of Provence – a cosmetics formulation laboratory was built and a conditioning workshop for toiletries and body care products opened – now make it possible for the Arthes Group to produce numerous cosmetics to complement perfumes. ""Obviously, this enables us to widen our offering to new categories like skincare and body care as a Private Label, and to consider growing at the same fast pace in this sector,"" François Papyle concludes. The French company will be on the exhibitors' list at the next PLMA's World of Private Label show, the reference event for Private Label and mass distribution in Europe, which will be held next May 19 and 20, 2015 at the RAI Exhibition Centre in Amsterdam, Netherlands."
"Flair, a creation studio in the service of artistic perfumery","They met at Cinquième Sens, where they also got to know Martine Denisot, who later joined the Flair project as well. Amélie and Anne-Sophie share the same olfactory language and sensitivity. They complete each other in the creation process, as one enjoys working with natural ingredients, while the other prefers delicate synthetic materials. Their credo: making surprising, but wearable and bearable perfumes. This desire makes sense to young creators of niche perfume brands seeking new inspirations and the guarantee of a very precise, sophisticated creation work with the materials. Flair, a free spirit in the perfume sector, enjoys its independence and plays with its ability to develop compositions with exclusive ingredients. ""It is the small volumes specific to artistic perfumery that make it possible. We are always seeking unusual, differentiating raw materials that tell a story"", the duo explains, giving the example of Piri Piri, a plant with hallucinogenic properties sourced from Peru by Stéphane Piquart, a rare ingredient expert. It was incorporated into their latest creation, Une nuit à Bali. Amélie and Anne-Sophie are confident, stimulated by the increase in the perfume extract volumes sold by the studio every year. They believe in a grand future for French perfumery and have been investing in brands. ""We bank on the success of the brands we work with. They know we are at their side to defend our perfumes – this is our added value, and it is in our interest too,"" Amélie Bourgeois explains. Amélie Bourgeois and Anne-Sophie Behaghel will be presenting Flair at the next Beauty World show in Dubai, and willingly admit they aim to reach the Middle East creation market. ""Perfumery there is generous, very oud-oriented, and absolutely voluptuous. Many brands are developing there right now. And we would like to add a little more artistic, different touch to their compositions. They are actually quite open to novelty"", Anne-Sophie concludes."
Aircos reaps the benefits of its innovation strategy,"Premium Beauty News - You are one of the only companies in France, if not the only one, to be able to boast about a double activity, plastic injection and formula production, for the cosmetics sector! Frédéric Lancesseur - Indeed, our operations are fully integrated, and we can assert this double activity. Besides, it is actually thanks to our double expertise that we decided and were able to develop a new back injection process called IPM, which makes it possible for us to put forward our mastery of the container/content compatibility. This technology requires our know-how both in formulation and injection. It was entirely developed by the company. This new process enables not to ""traumatize"" the ingredients (in particular pigments and pearlescent agents), and therefore obtain amazing softness and brightness. Premium Beauty News – And you have actually grown enough to offer industrial production in this field, haven't you? Frédéric Lancesseur - Absolutely, we developed a high-capacity automated machine as early as last year. And the percentage represented by this new technique in Aircos's turnover has risen to about 20%. Besides, this only served to reinforce what was already one of our advantages: our ability to guarantee our customers a full service offer. This new technique presents many advantages for us: optimum results in terms of textures, forms and surface effects, an extremely clean process, and a very competitive technology. Premium Beauty News – And this technology eventually drove you to refocus on your core business! Frédéric Lancesseur - It has to be said, our company is organized around three major activities. First, plastic injection is carried out on our site in Ardon, near Orléans in the central region of France, where 33 injection machines and several automated assembly and finishing lines are operating. Then, formulations are developed in two laboratories located in Boulogne-Billancourt, near Paris, and Romorantin, also in central France. Lastly, manufacturing and conditioning are also carried out in Romorantin, where the plant has a production and conditioning capacity of more than 110 million units per year. We have taken the necessary steps to become full service specialists. This clearly constitutes a cornerstone in the development of Aircos. We have expertise in all phases of makeup production, which, to our customers, makes us responsible for every aspect of the product, including, of course, the packaging part. However, our main development strategy is focused on powders. Mastering different powder formulation and production technologies represents one of our cornerstones, which obviously makes it legitimate for us to boast about an excellent expertise in the ""complexion"" segment: eye shadows, loose powders, body powders, etc. Premium Beauty News – No doubt 2015 will be a year of exports! Thomas Sirot - Among other things, yes, it will! As an example, we will take part in the MakeUp in New York show for the first time as exhibitors. It is clear the North American market represents a development potential for Aircos. We aim for our exports to reach between 20% and 25% of our turnover by 2017, compared to 10% right now. Today, we are holding all the cards: perfect control in R&D, and unique technologies and processes. In addition, the euro has weakened, and some brands wish to highlight their ""Made in France"" production. Premium Beauty News - Which new products are you going to launch next June at MakeUp in Paris? Thomas Sirot - Our main product innovations comprise a range entirely dedicated to the face contouring/sculpting trend, specific eyebrow formulas, and unique powder sampling concepts, including a ""Small is beautiful"" range to come out as soon as June 18."
"""We are returning to Marionnaud's roots,"" Eileen Yeo","Premium Beauty News - How will the launch of ""Code Beauté"" impact the relationship between Marionnaud and its customers? Eileen Yeo - ""Code Beauté"" is opening a new era in terms of how Marionnaud addresses the needs of its customers. This new service will help us to better understand our customers' needs and to treat them individually. Collected data will also help us to define what each of them really expects from us and to customize our communication. We are shifting from ""one to all"" communication to ""one to one"" communication. Premium Beauty News - Another brick of your new brand strategy, in the wake of the deployment of your new store concept? Eileen Yeo - It's not really a repositioning but a return to our roots: proximity, personalisation, services and expertise. What we offer our customers is to explain the products and provide advice. This is Marionnaud's DNA and has never been highlighted so clearly. Premium Beauty News - Nevertheless, the new store concept is transforming the shopping experience! Eileen Yeo - Our goal was to illustrate our expertise and proximity to customers. Therefore, we selected softer materials and soft colours so consumers feel at home, with no pressure. There is a lot of wood, a warm ambiance and no loud music. Beyond the décor, this concept also features several integrated services, many of which are free. Today, consumers are searching for new and different experiences. That's exactly what we want to bring to them. We have tested this concept in various environments, in Paris, in the North and South of France and also in Italy, with very good results. Premium Beauty News - What is your opinion about the evolution of the French beauty market? Eileen Yeo - Europe in general is a difficult market and France is no exception. My opinion is that retail is too focused on prices and promotions. We have to provide more to customers and offer them a truly unique shopping experience. Premium Beauty News - I assume that this includes your own product lines? Eileen Yeo - Marionnaud's private label products are key elements of our development strategy. We'll continue to extend our own range of products, but we want to offer only what is useful to our customers."
"""Any lever is possible on the perfume market"", Alexandrine Demachy, Fragrance Resources France","Premium Beauty News - What are your observations on the perfume market right now? Alexandrine Demachy - Even if, from an economic standpoint, China and Brazil are slowing down in growth, what can be noted is that brands have been adapting to these markets, whether on a structural level or with their product offer. Large groups have been streamlining their structures in Europe to grow in emerging countries. They develop specific products there, or buy local brands to establish themselves firmly in these regions. There has been a new diversification in many fields on the global scale. Several models work well, there is no longer only one approach possible, and that is why the largest groups are starting to take interest in smaller ones. Premium Beauty News - Absolutely, and many alternative brands have recently been purchased by large groups. What conclusions should be drawn, then? Alexandrine Demachy - This is a very different philosophy in terms of acquisition. It is all about recognizing an expertise here. Companies seek to take these structures as a model, from their modes of creation down to their means of distribution, which are very close to consumers. And this has consequences on us creators. In the selective segment, the olfactory dimension only represents about 5% of the value of the product sold, the remaining part being related to marketing, communication, packaging, etc. The ratio is reversed in alternative perfumery. Differentiation is achieved through creativity, the selection of raw materials, and the price. We have to adapt to this new trend, because it is favourable to us. Our short and light structure makes it possible for Fragrance Resources to achieve this. Premium Beauty News - In light of this new order, could this lead to rethinking the method of remuneration of perfume composition companies, which today is only based on the volume, and not on creation? Alexandrine Demachy - This is a recurring question. It is true the whole creation process is completely free, regardless of the call for tenders. This specificity is to be taken into account, because contrary to architects or advertising companies, we have to cover the development costs related to projects that have not been acquired yet. But brands feel attached to them, and even if there were a will to change things, there would have to be a consensus. Premium Beauty News - You were talking about China, although it is a region where the perfume sector has hardly developed yet. Do you still believe in it? Alexandrine Demachy - Sure, Asia will eventually reveal itself, and the relationship with perfumes will change. In China, perfumes are currently viewed as products that help gain recognition, gift-products for those who want to bring out their comfortable status. But Chinese people travel more and more and are learning a lot about the Western world, so they will end up using perfumes for themselves. But this will take time. Premium Beauty News - There seem to be many growth drivers. Is the future of perfumery all mapped out? Alexandrine Demachy - Perfumes will always be a mode of seduction. As long as there is love, there will be perfumes, and I am confident about their future. However, there will be a huge upheaval on all axes. It is true, any lever is possible: creation, distribution, regionalization, mode of scenting… everyone is already positioning themselves. So one has to ask the right questions: how to attract young people, how to make European consumers take interest again, how to deal with the sourcing problem when our planet increasingly has to produce more to feed itself… We must build the future."
Geka is strengthening its strategy on beauty accessories,"Premium Beauty News - How did you adapt your production tools to support your increased service strategy? Luca Bistoletti - We chose to strengthen first our European production tools and the control with our Asian suppliers. We have a minimum of three partner suppliers for each type of product to ensure optimum production and quality. At Bechhofen, the headquarters of Geka in Europe, we have a storage capacity of 5,000 pallets which therefore enables us to supply our European customers in days. For example, we have developed with one of our retailer customers a replenishment activity. We handle the management of their stock of accessories and we are capable of restocking any product and to deliver it directly in stores. This is what sets us apart from our competitors. We are integrated in the organization of our clients and offer value-added services. This year we have increased particularly our investments at Geka Asia Pacific, with our offices in Shanghai and Hong Kong. It is primarily a commercial entity, but we want to be as close as possible to our suppliers based in China, Korea, Thailand and Taiwan, and manage the production related risks to limit flaws and ensure that our products have the highest quality. Premium Beauty News - Have you already identified the first results of this strategy? Luca Bistoletti - We have doubled in size in just eight years, and our sales in 2014 are in excess of 20 million euros. Our development is partly due to organic growth but also to winning over new customers. Premium Beauty News - What types of products do you offer and for which markets? Luca Bistoletti - Our offer consists of make-up accessories (brushes, applicators, sponges, false eyelashes, etc.), bags (kits, brush holders, etc.), haircare products (brushes, accessories, etc.), and products for well-being, body and face care. We also offer accessories for manicure and pedicure, technical and fine brushes (accessories for hairdressers). Everything is produced and packaged ""ready-to-be-sold"" at the POS. We operate both on mass markets and prestige markets, through direct sales or as a custom manufacturer, with all the major beauty players. Premium Beauty News - What is your main advantage on the market? Luca Bistoletti - Our know-how is unique and prestigious. Beyond our products in Asia, we own a historical production site based in Bechhofen, for the manufacturing of shaving brushes, among others. With the revival of beards and moustaches of all kinds and the 1920s/1930s coming back into fashion, our expertise is very much appreciated. We can produce a wide range of brushes depending on the desired level of personalization and the brand's prestige. Our craftsmen come from schools located within Bechhofen where the trade of ""master brush maker"" is taught. Premium Beauty News - Finally, can you tell us more about your strategy in 2015? Luca Bistoletti - We want to focus on marketing and innovation to increase our added value. We already have a good system in place, a good reputation on the market. We want to introduce a little more creativity, and in particular promote our local production. The ""made in Germany"" is an undeniable asset on the market, and we are looking at the fashion industry for possible opportunities. Furthermore, Asia is becoming for us a destination market. The market is growing and local brands are strengthening. It will become for us not just a sourcing hub, but potentially a growing marketplace and we are working on several interesting projects that will allow us to tap into this market. More to come on this in the near future. In conclusion, our expertise and knowledge of the market are undoubtedly undeniable assets to meet the expectations and requirements of the global beauty market."

Make-up industry: Taiwanese suppliers are in working order (part 1),"The main characteristic of some of these skincare and make-up suppliers: an almost total integration! For many of them, their salvation depends on it. In these conditions, it is not surprising, while wandering in the aisles of the production sites, to visit one after the other, the workshop for the manufacturing of moulds, the workshop for injection machines, to then enter into the area dedicated to the manufacturing of formulas, followed by the one which is home to filling and conditioning machines. A strategy initiated a long time ago by some players, but that is promised to ""pay off"" today due to the growing demand for full service. At any rate, these industrialists do not seem to be bothered by the fact of needing to master several trades to be successful... ""We are used to it, they say, and our independence and our flexibility are well worth the difficulties that may be paving the way to technological changes!"" ""We are specialized in the packaging of nail polish"", explained Thomas Hwang, Commercial Director. ""The company started in 1977 as a small humble factory supplying goods locally in Taiwan. Business grew progressively and operation expanded to China in the late 90s to satisfy different export needs. After all these years of interacting in this global market, we are convinced that the keys to successful results are the right products with the right pricing and the right timing. Our cumulative experiences in production and in a wide range of finishes, give us the ability to consistently deliver customized packaging to suit individual requirements. We strive to serve each and every customer like if it were our own business and deliver accordingly for a mutually beneficial and sustainable long term relationship, we aim to grow together with our customers, not just as a one-time partner."" Pinkpac is the typical example of the Taiwanese company whom after several years of production in China, decided to relocate all of its production back to Taiwan for continuous improvement. ""We are probably one of the very few nail polish packaging suppliers that focus packaging mainly for nail polish use, hence various customization technology available developed for this area. Our product portfolio consists of between three to four hundred different models, with two hundred readily available"". These are the company's own design made available for standard production, but Pinkpac also works on customized shapes. ""We export 100+ million units annually worldwide and we continue to look after both mass market and also customized high end market to suit the different need. The latest technology developed for decoration is a new type of printing technique that has no limitation on print colours unlike conventional silk screen on cap, as long as it is a flat surface or slightly curved surface, we can print anything from a simple one colour logo to a portrait of Monalisa on cap. This brings infinite possibilities for decoration on cap and is visually very eye catching. This benefit we provide the customer is the result of the continuous development we focus on our products."" The Tonnie Cosmetics Company is a fine example of how successful the Taiwanese industry can be in this area. A company headquartered in Tainan City that employs a total of 600 people over two production sites, one in Tainan and the other in China. Main customer markets, in declining order, the United States (35%), Europe (30%) including England and Germany, followed by Middle East. The factory in Tainan, which is home to 48 injection machines, is fully integrated in terms of full service for make-up (it even has its own team of designers!), a sector which today accounts for 90% of the company's revenues. Main investment planned this year (1 million dollars): to increase the number of assembly machines. The company mainly produces make-up compacts and palettes and lipsticks, but also a full range of make-up products. ""We offer a complete range of make-up & skincare lines with superior quality at the most reasonable prices,"" explained Jane Ko, Commercial Director. ""We run complete production lines with consistent integrated operations, including formulation research, packaging design, component mould, filling, assembling, packing, etc. We are GMP and ISO22716:2007 (E) certified and our products comply with FDA, EEC and global regulations. Tonnie has its in house certified laboratory and we also have our strict Quality Control and contracted SGS inspections."" Another example of Taiwanese contract manufacturing in the particularly dynamic make-up packaging segment, the Cosmety Company aka Decorative Cosmetic Container Co. The firm was founded in 1982 by Yun Chang Su. It is based in Wuci Dist in Taichung City and has twenty injection machines. Turnover in 2014, 33 million dollars for a total staff of forty people. It has gone from strength to strength since it was established about 30 years ago. It passed the ISO 9001 international Quality Certification in December 2008. The company is also highly integrated in tooling development, design, injection, manufacturing, and decoration of cosmetic packagings. ""One of our particular strength,"" explained Nathan Su, Production Director, ""is that we have our in-house tooling department where our R&D team utilizes our customers' samples or drawings to analyse, design, plan and manufacture the most efficient and precise mould structures. Also, our injection techniques have made us more flexible and helped our customers accelerate the launching of their products."" ""Since Cosmety's inception, our production team has been in charge with coordinating finished mould development with product manufacturing. Our goal has always been to provide quality products to our customers at extremely competitive prices. Creativity and innovation are at the heart of our R&D department,"" added Jenny Wu from the commercial department. ""Over the years, we have developed a range of compacts and jars. To benefit our customers, we offer a full pallet of testing equipment that our R&D team uses for each customer's sample or drawing, to analyse, design, plan, and manufacture the most efficient and precise mould structure. Our R&D department not only possesses solid research capabilities, but also communicates clearly with customers on their market positioning and the design baseline from the very beginning. By researching, thinking and innovating continuously, we ensure each design meets both the needs of our customers and adds value to their goods."" Main focus for the firm, be more open to US and European markets. To be continued…"
Chromavis Fareva: Total creativity for the fourth edition of Chromaville in Bologna,"In a new location of over 1,000 square metres at ""Autostazione di Bologna"", Chromavis Fareva has developed a fantastic world of colours and trends for its customers and suppliers in a so-called ""unusual and visionary"" urban path made of products, collections, trends but also of important novelties. ""Visionnaire"" definitely aimed to be a real open-air laboratory, the room of ideas, a path to fight the frenzy and the pretence of an immediate innovation and to give space to the creativity of those who visit it. Anyone who entered this room past through a labyrinth made of tissues, fabrics, objects, unusual materials and installations away from the cosmetic world but capable of generating inspirations for future products, concepts and systems. Everything there was in continuous evolution, thanks to the presence of a group of researchers and trend-hunters that - together with Chromavis - have identified and represented with their installations the nine moods that will materialize in trends over the next three/five years."
Hwa Sung: a new plant to better cope with the dynamics of innovation!,"Premium Beauty News - These past few months were particularity busy for Hwa Sung. A new factory and new offices! Kim E.H - Indeed, we decided to build our own plastic injection plant, called ANP, while keeping our network of suppliers. This allows us to be much more flexible for the development and marketing of our products. The plant is home to 20 injection machines and with a staff of 50 people. It was built following the highest standards in terms of production quality. As for the new offices, it is true that the time had come to move to more functional premises. Premium Beauty News - The Asian Beauty market is still recording an important growth. What do you see as you main strong points to be successful in this competitive market? Kim E.H - Our strength is innovation!!! Our range includes single use products and four-in-one Slim Stick size products. Our innovation-focused strategy greatly satisfies our customers who are happy to use a product that is easy to carry and that takes up very little space. Our products are up to the expectations of professionals who demand the highest quality. Our range of Eyebrow Pencils enjoys an excellent reputation abroad. All our customers say they are very successful on their market with this type of product. Our strength lies undoubtedly in our quick decision making and flexibility. We are very reactive to customer demands. Premium Beauty News - Your presence is international. You therefore have a global vision of the evolution of demand at an international level. In your opinion, what main criteria characterize the world's four major markets, which are Europe, North America, South America and Asia? Kim E.H - In Europe, the decision process is very slow and all the components of a project are very thoroughly considered, sometimes over considered. The launch of a new product is often difficult, but once it is on the market everything then runs smoothly. While in North America, if products displayed show a new and innovative concept, it can go much faster. South America is growing fast almost like Asia. Products from Asia are acclaimed all over the world, but this wave of success can also be reversed just as quickly. Products range from super low, to premium prices. Everything coexists. Premium Beauty News - What do you think 2015 will be like in your field, in Europe, the Americas and Asia? Kim E.H - Markets are changing very quickly especially because of the Internet. The world of beauty is a constantly connected one particularly via Facebook, among others. It has become so easy to share, compare, wanting to be the prettiest of all and therefore to buy more. Premium Beauty News - The concept of full service seems more and more present and desired. Do you agree? Kim E.H - We have always offered full service, so there is nothing new for us here and nothing to worry about. I really think full service makes things easier and more comfortable for the customer. This saves him a lot of time in product development and production. But on our side, we have to manage a lot of responsibilities in terms of production steps or delivery deadlines. Premium Beauty News - You exhibit at almost all the MakeUp in™ trade shows... In a few words what, do you believe are the key strengths of these events? Kim E.H - We really love this event and we can feel that visitors are also really starting to love the Make Up shows that take place over two days (giving enough time to meet people). Make Up events are really upscale and very professional events. The exhibitor does not need to invest much time and money in the setting up of his stand, or in displaying his products. This allows him to spend more time on doing business. Conferences and industry news are also very useful. One last thing, the Beauteam team is always very friendly. This is important and I hope there will be many more Make-Up shows around the world."
"""Perfumes will always make people dream, but they must change,"" Olivier de Lisle, Firmenich","Premium Beauty News - The perfume market is changing. Does that bring you any serenity? Olivier de Lisle - From a quantitative standpoint, according to the latest feedback from our customers and the various statistics published on selective perfumery, it seems the market is stable. Several important areas are experiencing economic difficulties, in particular Europe and Russia. And there is a slowdown in Brazil. Dynamics in the Gulf States and Asia partly make up for it, but not enough to be able to provide a positive impetus. However, this situation is not overwhelming for us: one can achieve a strong growth even on a stable market! Premium Beauty News - Apart from these current difficulties, we also have the impression consumption and purchase habits are evolving in perfumery. Olivier de Lisle - There are many ways to consume perfume right now. And there are many alternatives available apart from traditional channels such as selective distribution. Direct-selling plays a significant role in some countries. And specialty retail is also quickly developing, as can be seen with Victoria Secret in the United States, Yves Rocher in France, or Boticário in Brazil. This channel is doing well, in particular with the young generation, because it creates a universe, a form of closeness, a different shopping experience. As far as the high-end sector is concerned, there is the same phenomenon with prestige perfumery. Brands which possess wholly-owned stores like Dyptique or Jo Malone attract customers seeking a privileged purchasing experience. As an example, the recent acquisitions of alternative brands by major groups such as Estée Lauder or Puig will enable them to reach targets they do not or no longer have. Premium Beauty News – Talking about these new alternative brands, do you work for them a lot? Olivier de Lisle - At Firmenich, we aim to create perfumes for our customers to succeed. We are called to develop classics, but it is also our job to bet on entrepreneurs, just like we did with ""Le Labo"". So yes, even if it only represents a small part of our activities, alternative perfumery is important to Firmenich. It makes it possible to create without any restraint, which constitutes another form of stimulation for our perfumers-creators. It is important to be aware that we only have twelve perfumers-creators in Paris, although that is where our largest creation centre is located. Perfumery is a world that is still extremely close to craftsmanship! That is why we can offer our customers a customized service. Premium Beauty News - Regulatory and supply-related issues now seem to play a major role in the world of perfume creation. Olivier de Lisle - Absolutely. The way regulations are evolving encourages us to renew our palette of creativity by taking into account the constraints. Innovation is more than ever crucial, with the search for new ingredients, and the likely evolution towards more naturalness. The supply issue is essential too. In addition to being a perfume creator, Firmenich is the main world supplier of perfumery ingredients. We must guarantee our customers total supply security from a qualitative, quantitative, and economic point of view. Today there are about a hundred critical raw materials in perfumery, for which a minimum of stability in terms of price and quality must be ensured. Many of these materials come from countries plagued by rural depopulation, where plantations are being abandoned for good as people flow towards large cities. In India, Laos, Uganda, Haiti… we have been investing in programmes to support rural populations and help them grow their cultures, while ensuring them stable incomes and prospects in the long term. We make sure these people get a stable income so they can plant, invest, and innovate. This is designed to be a long-lasting organization. Premium Beauty News - What are your challenges for the future? Olivier de Lisle - The challenge is to always adapt to market changes! We know there is arbitration in terms of luxury purchases today, and that perfumery is a highly competitive market, in particular with new technologies. But perfumes will always make people dream, as they provide intense emotions. Consumption habits have already changed a lot, and they will keep changing. Even if the presentation and means to diffuse perfumes are evolving, they will always constitute a significant preoccupation in our societies. So it is up to us to explore new territories."
The Alkos Group gets global,"The Alkos Group is on a roll! With a turnover of 47 million euros in 2014 and a target of 51 million for 2015 – a +36% growth over the period – the French subcontractor is entering a new phase in its development. ""The group's activity is now stable and strong, and it is growing significantly,"" explains Florence Lefeuvre, Sales and Marketing Communications Director. ""Obviously, developing on the global level represents an important growth driver for us."" The Alkos Group expects 35% of its consolidated sales to be destined for export in 2015 (15% in 2011). As the French company intends to keep growing at the same rate and intensify its global development, it will strengthen its export team this year, in particular with a new recruit to join the team and create an International Business Development Director position. Florence Lefeuvre and Dominique Vautier are proud of this move: ""We are very happy to welcome Eric Goyer, a great professional of the cosmetics industry. He will start working for the group at the Cosmopack show in Bologna"". ""The European markets are a priority for us, of course, but also North America and Brazil,"" Florence Lefeuvre emphasizes. ""The United States is at the core of our globalization strategy. We do not exclude the possibility of acquiring a local player if we get the opportunity to, especially if there is a complementarity or if we can diversify our industrial facilities…"" The Alkos Group should also intensify its participation in the major international trade shows, with Cosmopack in Bologna, Italy, Beautyworld Middle East in Dubai, MakeUp in Paris, and MakeUp in New York this year. The Alkos Group is composed of three entities (Intercosmétiques, Alkos Cosmétiques, and Sagal). Today, 56% of its turnover comes from the makeup market, and this percentage should reach 63% in 2015, in particular thanks to the dynamism of Alkos Cosmétiques, the only French producer of cosmetics pencils, whose sales amounted to 15.8 million euros in 2014 (M€8.9 in 2011) and are expected to exceed 17 million in 2015, that is, almost a 90% growth between 2011 and 2015! The percentage of makeup formulations in the activities of Intercosmétiques also grew significantly, as it rose from 18% to 38% thanks to the success of the Chubby Jumbo Twist Lipsticks by Intercosmétiques. To Florence Lefeuvre, it all results from the increasing reliance on outsourcing in the makeup sector. ""The specificity of the know-how, the importance of innovation, and the growing diversification of this category encourage brands to seek external industrial expertise."" As for industrial investments, the Group is to open a third wholly automated production line for plastic pencils as soon as April 2015. A series of investments is also scheduled on the mascara segment, in particular by fitting an existing line with conditioning and filling equipment. And the Alkos Group will present its first mascara products both at the Cosmopack show in Bologna, Italy, on March 19-22, 2015, and at MakeUp in Paris next June 18-19. To be continued…"
Beauty retailer Marionnaud seeks repositioning with new store concept,"The 3P concept, its bright colours and its strong lighting, are officially over. Marionnaud's outlet renovation program, which was launched in 2011, is shifting towards a new warmer and upscale store concept. Actually, the retailer is moving away from mass-market codes and is betting on the high-end values: warm welcome, services, and wellbeing. The company wants to please its customers with a high quality services and products. ""We want to offer customers a unique shopping experience in a warm and human scale atmosphere,"" says Eileen Yeo, Managing Director of Marionnaud France. The retailer thus opted for a bright and soothing ambience, a palette of soft colour. The brand now wants to attract its customers with exclusive services and the discovery of new products rather than through an endless race to price discounts. One of the distinctive features of the new concept is the importance given to in-store free beauty services such as ""flash make-up"", in a dedicated area at the centre of the store, or with the ""Ioma Link"" skin diagnosis now fully integrated within the skin care area. Some stores also offer a ""nail bar"" paying service offering a wide range of nail and manicure services, with or without an appointment. Moreover, all the Marionnaud stores offer free Click & Collect services. ""Today's digital innovations, such as Click & Collect, Store to Door, Reserve and Collect, are the core of our customer strategy. They perfectly address customers' expectations in term of services and increase the number of visits in our stores. Our priority is to link digital services with our in-store offer in order to provide our customers with a comprehensive shopping experience,"" adds Eileen Yeo. A pilot store was opened in 2013, rue des Martyrs in Paris, and the new concept was tested in 2014 in nine stores located in shopping malls or in city centres across the entire French territory. The new concept will now be deployed in priority in the 150 French stores that have not been renovated for the last 6 years. The program provides that 60 stores per year will be put in line with the new concept. ""2015 promises to be an extremely dynamic year for Marionnaud, with a lot of opportunities. We are redeveloping our network with several store relocations as well as new openings, with the aim to be closer from our customers,"" concludes Mrs Yeo. With more than 1,000 stores in Europe, including 519 in France, Marionnaud is one of the leading European retailers of high-end perfumes and cosmetics"
Nail polish: Fiabila inaugurates its new French production unit,"""To be the best and remain so"": Fiabila's goal today finds its fullest expression to date in the opening of a second high-performance production unit in the company's historic seat in the Eure-et-Loir region of France. The unit features 16 tanks dedicated to storing raw materials, four kilometers of pipeline to convey them without risk of cross-contamination, heightened computerization and security features for every step in the production process, except for coloring, an operation that remains deliberately artisanal. All of these improvements mean Fiabila can continue to ensure a nail polish offer of uncompromising pureness and performance. ""The quality and performance of our formulas have been the basis of Fiabila's commitment ever since the company's founding in 1977. It was therefore essential to equip ourselves with an industrial tool that is at the forefront of technology. That was the goal for this new production unit which, in addition, fulfills our strategy of ensuring security, respect for the environment and social responsibility in order to satisfy the increasing demands of our clients,"" said Pierre Miasnik, president and founder of Fiabila. For example, the company has reduced its carbon footprint through the capture and reprocessing of volatile compounds and the recycling of washing solvents. Receiving raw materials in bulk, in dedicated tanker trucks, will make it possible to economize on several thousand metal casks per year. Lastly, the increased automation mentioned above will contribute to reinforcing the security of personnel and improving work conditions overall. In tripling the production capacity of Fiabila's French site, this ultra-modern facility makes it possible to respond to increased demand across market sectors, regardless of size. In fact, according to a recent study by Euromonitor, the worldwide market for nail polish is set to increase by 11% by 2016. In addition, in an effort to meet client demands worldwide, Fiabila announces the impending opening of new production units in Brazil and Russia. As the future looks promising for nail polish, Fiabila too can see the horizon in a rainbow of colours."
"""High shine and long wear are the leading trends in nails right now"", Mary van Praag, OPI","Premium Beauty News - How is your brand positioned today in the world of nail care? Mary van Praag - At OPI we believe nothing can change your look or your outlook faster than color. That is why our brand is built on innovation - both in long wear color and technology. The brand was originally founded in 1981 as a dental supply company when founder George Schaeffer noticed many of his customers were manicurists seeking quality acrylic formulas. With a solution in hand, George teamed up with co-founder, Suzi Weiss-Fischmann the ""First Lady of Nails,"" to create the now flagship OPI nail lacquer. By 1987, OPI became the first nail brand to trademark its iconic bottle – now one of the most recognizable in the world. Today, we remain dedicated to bringing salon professionals the next generation of nail innovations—like our new hybrid lacquer, Infinite Shine, and OPI GelColor offered in the same 150 iconic OPI lacquer shades you have come to know and love. Premium Beauty News - What do you ask your suppliers to bring you first, whether in terms of formulas or packaging? Mary van Praag - Creativity, innovation and cost effectiveness are all top priorities in terms of formulas, however quality is by far the highest expectation we ask of our suppliers. Recent research provided by Kline & Company found OPI products to be the #1 brand of salon professionals worldwide. Without quality products, we would not be able to remain a trusted brand for both professionals and consumers. Premium Beauty News - What were, for your company, the main axes of development, in the past 12 months? Mary van Praag - In the last 12 months, we have introduced two groundbreaking innovations. Our first being Infinite Shine, a long lasting, photo-activated lacquer which delivers up to 10 days of intense shine and wear without the complications of gel application or soak-off removal. Currently there are 30 on-trend shades to choose from, with more new color offerings to come. In the next nine months, the collection will grow to nearly 90 high-gloss long lasting shades. Our second, being GelColor as we are also changing expectations for Gel application and wear. For those who love our bold, of-the-moment colors but want the durability of a Gel, OPI offers our lacquer shades in matching gel formulas. With more than 150 iconic Gel color shades to choose from, OPI is unmatched in breadth and depth of Gel selection. And to help nail technicians create the fastest, most durable, and beautiful Gel looks, we're excited to introduce the next generation of salon professional GelColor products in the coming year. Premium Beauty News - In 2015, what do you see as the main leading nail polish trends? Mary van Praag - The continual leading trend in nails right now is high shine and long wear; which is why we are so pleased with the quality of our long wearing hybrid lacquer, Infinite Shine and technology advanced OPI GelColor. In nail polish and gel trends, the nude nail will be huge in 2015. Soft, demure, neutral color shades are on trend this spring and beyond. We also know nail art is here to stay, so plan on seeing nail art looks that experiment with nude colors in an exciting way. Premium Beauty News - What are your ambitions at an international level? Mary van Praag - With OPI currently being in more than 100 countries and truly being a global brand, our main ambition is to continue expansion worldwide. Research has confirmed there's momentum in the nail category in all regions; however our immediate expansion focus will center on Europe, Latin America, and Asia.

Mary van Praag - To guarantee a top quality OPI experience with our lacquers, we are honing in on our distribution networks to ensure OPI Products are only sold through authorized salon and professional channels.

"""We want a harmonious development"", Thierry Aubry-Lecomte, Natura Brasil France","Premium Beauty News - Natura Brasil is not much present outside South America. Do you consider getting more aggressive to conquer global markets? Thierry Aubry-Lecomte - First of all, it is essential to understand our philosophy. Since the very beginning, Natura's raison d'être has always been to remain humble while contributing to the creation of a better world. We do not advocate growth at all costs. Our economy is based on social and environmental commitment. This is the actual backbone of our group. We make sure we work with small producers using environmentally friendly practices, and we get involved in education, training, and land renewal. As for products, we started developing refills as soon as 1983, our packs are ecodesigned and they all bear environmental labels. Now, at the level of the group, we have been carbon neutral since 2007 and we aim at having a positive impact. Everything we do is intended to improve our footprint, and we have worked on that for over 40 years now, in accordance with our bem estar bem philosophy – well-being and being good – which aims to combine personal well-being and emphatic well-being with others, nature, and the world. Premium Beauty News - So what is the current position of the group on the global level? Thierry Aubry-Lecomte - We have been present everywhere in Latin America and France for ten years. And we are now on various continents, as Natura recently purchased Aesop, an Australian brand in perfect symbiosis with our values. This position helps us observe the different markets, which we will try to enter at our own pace. Aesop also made it possible for us to integrate the retail expertise into the group. We greatly value words like humility and wisdom: they make us connect with the rhythm of the Earth and take shape on a sustainable basis. Premium Beauty News - Why did Natura choose France? Thierry Aubry-Lecomte - When we arrived in France in 2005, we aimed at learning from a mature, extremely competitive country. We were willing to face difficulty and get the richest experience from it. That is when we set up a research laboratory and opened the store located Place Michel Debré in Paris. Premium Beauty News - What about it now? Thierry Aubry-Lecomte - The laboratory does not exist anymore because we have switched to open innovation: research is spread over several sites and often carried out in partnership with universities of all continents. The store in Paris is our only physical point of sale in France for now, but there might be more of them in the future. Besides, we have set up a network of 2,000 direct-selling advisors throughout the French territory. This network counts 1.7 million people all around the world (mainly women), including 1.2 million in Brazil, and the rest in Latin America. This is where the brand's hub lies, because it guarantees a unique customer relationship, and it also represents an essential social pillar. Direct-selling is not anchored in the French culture, so we are proud of this network, as it contributes to convey Natura's principles and product quality, again, thanks to our customer relationship. We aim at uniting digital technologies and advisors. That is why this network has been supported by an e-commerce site since November 2014: people can contact an advisor in their own region and get personalized tips or buy directly from the website. Online selling is a way to conquer new customers, but also to make our advisors' work easier and improve their turnover. This coherent model was developed in France and might prefigure the evolution of Natura's distribution in the world. Premium Beauty News - You have no icon, and you never launch any campaign in the media. How could you make Natura more famous among French women? Thierry Aubry-Lecomte - That is true, there is no Natura icon, because we consider beauty cannot be personified, it lies within each and every one of us. Besides, even if we do not appear much in advertisements, we are actually very active on social networks. For example, our Facebook page counts almost 9 million fans around the world, including 28,000 in France. It takes time to communicate such a meaningful message as ours, and that is why it is essential to have a good contact with consumers. Once they have got familiar with our products, they are very loyal to us. They are attracted by transparency, quality, and our commitment. And Brazil makes them dream!"

Atelier Cologne aims to lead the niche fragrances segment,"This is a beautiful story that begins in 2006 when Sylvie Ganter met Christophe Cervasel in New York. One year later Atelier Cologne - the first Maison de Parfum dedicated entirely to cologne, the legendary fragrance classic - was born. For the first time, citruses - the traditional ingredients of a cologne - were blended with the most precious raw materials in perfumery to create original creations with evocative names such as Orange Sanguine, Rose Anonyme, Vétiver Fatal, Bois Blonds, Santal Carmin, Vanille Insensée, Cédrat Enivrant, Pomelo Paradis, etc. Thanks to a very high concentration of essential oils these colognes enjoy an outstanding lasting power. Atelier Cologne was launched in 2007 in the United States in a very selective high-end retail network of department stores, including Bergdorf Goodman in New York and Neiman Marcus in all major US cities. The brand currently generates 20 million euros (17.5 million US dollars) in retail sales, about 7 million euros (6 million US dollars) at the company level. The brand is now available in 26 countries and 300 stores, including four own stores in Paris and New York. After having doubled its turnover in 2013, the brand has increased its sales by +75% in 2014. Atelier Cologne makes 15% of its sales in France, 20% in the rest of Europe and in Russia, 35% in the United States and Canada, 14% in Asia, including China, 10% in the Middle East and 6% on the internet. In total, more than 500,000 bottles of Cologne Absolue have been sold worldwide since the creation of the brand, which has been profitable since its very first year and every year since. However such a growth needs to be funded! After having sold their respective apartments in order to finance the first steps of the brand, Sylvie Ganter and Christophe Cervasel found four business angels whose contribution allowed the opening of the Paris boutique in 2012. In 2013, a capital increase of 2.5 million euros was completed in less than 6 months. The company's governance was not modified, however the board was strengthened with the participation of strategy, retail, finance and emerging markets experts. From June 2014, a new round began with the aims to raise 5 million euros and to welcome a strong financial partner, interested the growth potential of company and able to support the brand in the long term while allowing the founders to keep a majority stake in the company. After several months of discussions, an agreement was reached with the Extendam, a private equity fund that decided to invest 2.5 million euros in the company. The pool of the initial investors brought 1.5 million euros more and, according to the founders, new entrants would have subscribed the last million already. The company's aim is to close this fundraising round before the month of June 2015 These new resources will enable Atelier Cologne to deploy the next steps of its development plan and, first of all, to open new stores and thus to stimulate the sales in all the other channels. Among the cities under consideration are: Hong Kong, Seoul, Shanghai, Dubai, London, Cannes, Paris (left bank), New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Other actions include the strengthening of partnerships with historical customers, the development of sales in the travel retail channel, the strengthening of the website and of online sales, as well as several new product developments planned for 2015, 2016 and 2017. Atelier Cologne once again forecasts to double its turnover in 2015 to reach a volume of retail sales of 40 million euros, and to reach the 100 million euro bar soon, thus becoming the leader of the niche fragrances segment, which currently represents 4 to 5% of the global selective perfumery market. ""With the emergence of the niche fragrances segment, which washed over department stores and the most prestigious beauty store concepts, authentic perfume houses could represent 20-25% of the global market soon,"" said Christophe Cervasel, Chairman and CEO of Atelier Cologne. Atelier Cologne's innovative concept, the quality of their ultra-selective distribution, their customized products and their solid financial base, are first class assets that should help the brand to achieve its goals."

The Different Company celebrates its 15th anniversary,"The two creators wanted to break free from the traditional codes, briefs and costs of fragrance creation to get back to exceptionality. When Luc Gabriel took over the reins of the company in 2004, after the departure of Jean Claude Ellena, the brand gave tribute to exceptional creation by entrusting famous fragrance creators such as Céline Ellena, Christine Nagel, Bertrand Duchaufour, Emilie Coppermann, Corine Cachen, Delphine Jelk and Alexandra Monet. The brand offers a total of 24 references over 3 collections - L'Esprit Cologne, Collection Classique and Collection Excessive. Nuit Magnétique, The Different Company's latest fragrance, was created in 2014 by Christine Nagel. To celebrate the brand's 15th anniversary, two new fragrances are expected in 2015: a 15th fragrance should be added to the Collection Classique, as well as a creation by Bertrand Duchaufour for the Collection Excessive. ""For any new creation, I make sure the consistence of our lines and our fragrances is respected, but I also introduce bold and innovative scents in the collections. We want to explore all avenues with various states of mind and compositions while keeping in line with the style of each collection and each creator. Raw materials must be exceptional and in proportions allowing them to express their own characteristics. Our keywords are Elegance, Innovation, Top quality and Singularity,"" says Luc Gabriel, the brand's president of The Different Company and co-founder of the young Comité Joséphine, a trade association focusing on the promotion of rare perfumes. Created by Thierry de Baschmakoff and produced by Pochet, the perfumes' glass bottle stand out from the mass with its cover, a true symbol of the brand, which is made of silver finished metal (La Factory) or black Bakelite, depending on the collections. From the beginning, The Different Company chose to combine luxury with eco-design by offering a refillable 90 ml version. The also offers a chic nomadic spirit through its crocodile or lizard leather travel cases, and its 10 ml lightweight version. In addition to fragrances, a bath line and a collection of candles complete the range, which is available at the brand's store in Paris but also in independent perfumery stores and some selected department stores in 35 countries. As many other niche perfumery brands The Different Company generates 80% of its turnover from exports. ""There is a huge interest in this category around the world,"" says Luc Gabriel ""In the Gulf countries, Russia, Latin America and in the Baltic countries, where independent niche retail stores account for 15% of the market, the haute parfumerie is gradually replacing selective brands. We are also prospecting new markets such as Sweden and Mexico,"" he adds. With sales growing by 20%, in line with the estimated market growth, The Different Company maintains its market share in a competitive environment that has largely changed in recent years. ""It is true that many alternative brands have been launched and this impacted us between 2008 and 2010. However, consumers are now returning to true quality. Actually, only fifteen marks are really interesting and have the financial capacity to invest in brand consistency and in the creativity of the fragrances and packs. Our positioning as contemporary French haute parfumerie brand is our main asset and originality,"" concludes Luc Gabriel."
The Body Shop plans to set up 500 stores in Brazil by 2019,"L'Oréal announced the entry of The Body Shop in Brazil in October 2013 with the acquisition of 51% of Emporio Body Store. Although information on investment and product development in Brazil has not yet been disclosed entirely, at the end of 2014, when this article was written, The Body Shop brand was available in 130 points of sale, either Empório Body Store or The Body Shop outlets. The company forecasts all Emporio Body Store retail stores to turn into The Body Shop in 2015 and has announced plans to expand the number of franchise stores from 122 to 500 in five years. ""The brand is being very well received and we are looking after the project with particular attention so as to continue with the solid relationship we've built with both the market and the consumers over our first months in Brazil,"" says Tobias Chanan, founder of Body Emporio Store. When asked about speculations involving the opening of a The Body Shop plant in Brazil, Chanan says that ""at this stage, all products will be imported."" The Brazilian project can also be a great opportunity to expand the use of the country's native raw materials by The Body Shop. Currently, the multinational partners with communities of local farmers, artisans and rural cooperatives in more than 20 countries, but only two of the ingredients are extracted from Brazilian soil - soybean oil and babassu oil - and the products made from these raw materials are not yet available in Brazil. Tobias Chanan started the Empório Body Store in 1997, with a store specialized in imported cosmetics at Shopping Iguatemi, in Porto Alegre. The operation was made possible by the favorable exchange rate and the popularity enjoyed by international products among Brazilian consumers in the 1990s. But it was only in 2001 that the brand gained its emporium character – inspired by a trip to California, Chanan decided to adopt a handmade concept for the manufacturing of the products, which still remains the company's philosophy to this day. Ten years later, entrepreneur Helio Seibel saw the potential of Emporio Body Store and acquired 65% of the company, which allowed the installation of its own plant and the consolidation of the franchise model. With sales valued at R$ 20 million in 2012, Emporio Body Store became an attractive contender for acquisition by The Body Shop, which already operated in 60 countries around the world and was studying its entry into the Brazilian retail market. The Brazilian outlets join over 3,000 The Body Shop stores worldwide. Among its iconic products is the world's first body butter, launched in 1992. According to company data, one tube of body butter is sold every two seconds. On the other hand, Emporio Body Store became known in Brazil for its bath and body care lines Lolita, Leite de Cabra ('Goat Milk') and Sakura No Ki. The English company Lush Cosmetics, which returned to Brazil in March, and the Australian Aesop brand, which opens its second store in São Paulo in January 2015, are expected to be The Body Shop's main competitors in Brazil. Not coincidentally, the three brands share many values, including their support for fair trade initiatives and their campaign against animal testing."
La Prairie opens first flagship store in Paris,"Premium Beauty News - Laurent Marteau, Travel Retail Director recently told us that La Prairie grew by 6% last year, taking advantage of dynamic sales in Asia (+6%), Russia (+36%) and in travel retail (+10%). What about France? Laurent Leblond - France is La Prairie's first subsidiary in Europe, over 5 years, a higher growth than in other countries. We have grown our turnover by +25%, while decreasing the number of POS from 650 to 450. Our products are among the most luxurious cosmetics in the world and the über-premium segment is doing well, the brand's sales are increasing by +5% this year in skincare while the market is decreasing by -4%. [1] Premium Beauty News - Why opening this new prestigious store while you are in the process of reducing the number of POS? Laurent Leblond - Selective beauty retail chains have entered a sqm-profitability strategy that does not allow us to showcase our entire offer. We wanted a more controlled distribution in selected and geographically relevant outlets, including 80 independent perfumeries, department stores, hotel spas and our own flagship store, with all the freedom that comes with it. La Prairie needed to take the next step in terms of recognition. Showcasing our entire offer this space is the ultimate reference about the brand's range, as well as about our services and supports. Some of our products, such as Caviar collection, are best sellers, but few consumers really know the variety of our offer. Thanks to an internationally popular location and a comprehensive assortment, we can reach a greater number of women of all ages and all nationalities. Premium Beauty News - Can you give more details about the new La Prairie outlet? Laurent Leblond - The entire place - 210 sqm and 3 levels - displays La Prairie's colours: white and silver grey. The ground floor is dedicated to the sale. Our clients can enter the shop and discover La Prarie's world through the ""Collection Wall"" featuring the brand's entire skincare offer: the Platinum, Caviar, White Caviar, Radiance, Anti-Ageing, Cellular Swiss Ice Crystal, Cellular Power, Advanced Marine Biology, Cellular Hydrating collections. A total of more than a hundred references. The apartment upstairs, connected by a glass staircase, is dedicated to VIP and press reception. Customers are also welcomed for a personal check-up before entering the elegant 15sqm cabin. At the lower level there are two other cabins and a makeup area. Premium Beauty News - So you offer products for sale and skincare sessions in the same location. Laurent Leblond - There is a real demand for a La Prairie experience. In the new store, our customers can enjoy exclusive signature treatments. We will showcase everything that makes our quality and in turn we'll surely learn a lot about our customers."
"""The cosmetics industry can be proud of what it represents,"" Patrick O'Quin, FEBEA","Premium Beauty News – It has been just over six months since you took up your position. What image do you have of the cosmetics industry? Patrick O'Quin - I am impressed by how well this sector can renew and reinvent itself. If the French industry occupies this position in the world today, it is because it has never been under the illusion it had won the game. It has always known how to renew itself despite difficulties and changes in the market. If we have a look at the number of patents registered, the cosmetics industry is the second most innovative sector in France after the motor industry! It is a sector that managed not to stick stubbornly to tradition. On the contrary, it capitalized on its long history to make it a driver for progress. As a result, thanks to its image, its capacity to innovate, and the quality of its products, it is now a very competitive industry. We have extraordinary companies of all sizes! Premium Beauty News - How do you think the market is going to evolve? Patrick O'Quin - From a general standpoint, the current situation of the French cosmetics market is rather disappointing, just as it is for any other sector. Even though we do not have definite statistics yet, we are expecting a slight decline in 2014 in France, and a stable market at best in Europe. However, the industry should keep growing thanks to the dynamism of non-European markets. Of course, China and Brazil are no longer as powerful drivers as they used to be, and exports to Russia have been disrupted due to the geopolitical situation and the fall in the rouble. But other markets are emerging, in particular in Africa. It is true that the impressive growth rates they show are not always significant given their initial weakness, but several countries have experienced a real economic development. The sky has definitely not cleared up yet, but it is not altogether dark. Premium Beauty News - How do you view discussions with the government? Patrick O'Quin - I am convinced that as a sector, the cosmetics industry should be more visible, and prouder of what it represents for France. It is far from the triviality it is often reduced to, and it is the 3rd export sector of the French balance of trade. It represents 42,000 direct jobs, and at least three times more indirect jobs. National decision-makers and political representatives are not aware of the importance of this sector for growth! And we are deeply concerned about the numerous decisions that are taken hastily, without a real dialogue or impact assessment, sometimes without any scientific basis, and which directly threaten whole areas of our industry. We must speak up again. My predecessor, Alain Grangé Cabane, had initiated a study on the image of the sector, its companies and products, and the results will be used as a basis to set up a strategy aiming to better highlight our industry's assets. Premium Beauty News - What will be the great challenges for 2015? Patrick O'Quin - We have several issues of concern. First, all the themes related to health: allergens, endocrine disruptors. We want the safety of our products to be guaranteed, but rather on facts and scientific bases than emotional grounds. The second group of issues has to do with the evolution of regulations in the world, especially in China. Third concern: the denaturation of alcohol, and the questioning by the European Commission of the French system, which allows denaturation through the perfuming composition. To us, it is a key element in the quality and reputation of French perfumery. We have already evoked another important challenge, the implementation of a communication strategy. Lastly, I would add sectoral synergy to that list. The industry's companies should form a united front. That is why we endeavour to strengthen our bonds and relationships with other entities, in particular the Cosmetic Valley, whose activities are really complementary of ours. Premium Beauty News - What about the TTIP agreement? Patrick O'Quin - Cosmetics represent an important part of the transatlantic partnership. [1] It is quite remarkable to see that in this sector, there are points on which manufacturers agree on both sides of the Atlantic, and we are supported by the European Commission. The objective is not to seek some kind of utopian harmonization, but to reach mutual recognition. Indeed, consumer safety is the main concern for regulations on both sides of the Atlantic, and it is well taken care of. Most operators in the cosmetics sector are present on both sides of the Atlantic, so this would make trade easier."
"Cosmax, investing and expanding its global presence","And that's not all, Cosmax leaders have announced one after another: the setting up in Korea of a Research and Innovation Centre more specifically dedicated to packaging, the increase in the production capacity of their two Chinese factories, the extension (4,000 sqm) of one of the Korean factories, and to top it all the makeover of its internal organization with the creation of a Strategic Marketing oriented team and the restructuring of the group's management (SAP). A series of investments that occur at a time when the Group will be posting for the year 2014, an increase of more than 30% of its consolidated turnover, which is expected to reach 600 million dollars. For Jay Kim, CEO of Cosmax International, ""our main areas of international development are clearly oriented for the coming months on the strengthening our presence in the U.S. and on supporting the significant growth in the skincare and make-up market in South-east Asia, especially in China (40% of our activity). This explains our continuous investments to strengthen both our financial and human resources in these two regions. As for Europe, we, of course, also intend to increase our presence, especially commercially speaking, knowing that eventually, as I already had an opportunity to say in your columns, an industrial presence is not excluded in the longer term"". The Korean company, which is positioned as a total outsourcing company in both the niche of skin care and make-up, stresses this year on the importance of the service that it is entitled to provide its customers with, in terms of packaging development but also applicators. ""This is essential, explained Jay Kim, innovation and quality in formulas are all the more valorised when the packaging is adapted and if we take into account the way they should be applied. Our customers and, in particular, our key international customers are expecting this type of service from us."" Hence the opening this year in Korea, of the ""packaging"" dedicated Research and Innovation Centre which has all the necessary equipment. Besides Indonesia and the U.S. The group so far has three factories in Korea and two in China, and we were at the told headquarters that a fourth unit could soon see the light in Korea."
"Nail polish: ""The Brazilian market is on the verge of transformation"", Cary Robinson, Keystone's President and CEO","Premium Beauty News - How is evolving the nail polish market worldwide? Cary Robinson - The market growth is slowing, we no longer record the impressive double digit rates that we experienced a few years ago. Novelties and special effects products are now driving the market and consumers are demanding better performing products. I am convinced that the new chemistries and technologies are going to renew the interest in this market. Gel polishes, for instance, already represent 15% of the US market and are one of the most dynamic categories in Europe. Our strategy is based on strong technological advances, highly reliable and qualitative industrial tools, breakthrough innovations combined with differentiated marketing offerings to support our clients. Premium Beauty News - Actually, you recently announced your intention to open new production facilities in Europe and Brazil. Cary Robinson - We export from the United States about 40% of our production, two-thirds of which go to Europe. Russia, the Middle East, China and Brazil are also important markets with strong opportunities for growth. In a market where speed to market is a key factor of success, it is important to have fill-in and logistics facilities closer to our customers. However, 100% of our products are formulated in the USA. Premium Beauty News - A lot of suppliers of cosmetic and beauty products are currently investing in Brazil. Cary Robinson - As far as nail varnishes are concerned, Brazil is the world's largest market in volume, while the United States are the leading market in value. The Brazilian market cannot be ignored but barriers to trade are very prohibitive. We are therefore identifying small Brazilian companies to buy and within the next 12 months will own a Brazilian company. Our competitors are doing exactly the same. Since it was protected from foreign competitors, the nail polish market in Brazil had no pressure to evolve. As a consequence the chemistry of these products has remained the same for 25 years. The presence of new manufacturers, introducing new processes and chemistries will have a strong impact on the market. Brazilian brands will now have the opportunity to market different and innovative products. Also, the quality of products will improve. Many consumers are ready to pay a bit more for products with a better quality. We'll not be another low cost producer in the Brazilian market."
The Brazilian market to be the first to discover the new Clarins women's perfume,"""Given the good results we have had with Azzaro Pour Homme, we have chosen to intensify our strategy over the next three years in Brazil, our most important market in Latin America"", explains Patricia Abergel, General Manager Latin America for the Clarins Group. To start with, the market's star men's fragrance was the focus of a large media campaign in 2014. New packaging, new TV film, new visual, new face with Ian Somerhalder (Vampire Diaries)… the brand has been occupying the various advertising, digital, and travel retail channels since last July. In May 2015, Azzaro Pour Elle, the women's version, will be launched as a preview in Brazil. The new fragrance will be promoted through a TV campaign with Ana Beatriz Barros as its icon – the Brazilian model who already appeared in the TV campaign of the men's version. Ultimately, in 2016, Brazilians will be able to discover a new Azzaro juice for men. Although they are mostly distributed through a selective network and on the Internet, the Clarins perfumes are gradually positioning themselves on the market: ""our fragrances are doing well, Angel by Thierry Mugler is ranked 10 despite a limited presence"", Patricia Abergel explains. And the Source, the concept of bottles endlessly refillable from ""two-head"" fountains in store, most certainly has something to do with the success of the two lines concerned, Angel and Alien. ""It is a concept we must absolutely promote, as it is Thierry Mugler's DNA, by highlighting loyalty, service, ecology, and economy"", she says. Above all, the group pays close attention to its visibility. ""Right now, we are enhancing our image and productivity, and then we will be seeking to develop distribution"", Abergel adds, although she specifies the group is not considering opening wholly-owned stores for now."
New ambitions for Manifesto,"A new management team, a new location in the heart of Paris, close to the Place de l'Opéra and the Place Vendôme, and plenty new projects! After a full restructuration, Manifesto unveiled last week its new business goals within the Superga group. While the creative and technical teams remained unchanged, the specialist of beauty cases, bags and textile accessories for the cosmetics industry now has a new sales team and a new Executive Director: Nathalie Duvoisin. ""The first step was to strengthen the company's technical capacity and to consolidate its sourcing capacity. We have therefore settled two technical teams in China, one in Hong Kong and the other in Shenzhen,"" said Alain Bréau, president of Manifesto and of the Superga group. The aim is to perfectly control the quality of the production but also the commitments on environmental and social responsibility, which have become a prerequisite for most customers. The second step is to beef up the company's international business, including the opening - by the month of January 2015 - of a sales subsidiary in the United States, in addition to the one opened in China in conjunction with the technical activities. These investments should support Alain Bréau's goal to double the turnover of the company and to reach a turnover of 15 million euros by the next 18 months. The implementation of the new strategy has been entrusted to Nathalie Duvoisin who intends to rely on her knowledge of Asian sourcing to provide more innovation and expand the company's range of products. ""Manifesto should be at the state of the art of manufacturing techniques, to master new materials for the cases and bags - which form the heart of company's offer – thanks to materials markets now well developed in Asia,"" she said. Regarding the extension of its offer, Manifesto might be interested in scented products (candles, scents, fragrance diffusers), textiles (t-shirts, sponges) and hard goods (jewellery and fancy containers). ""One of Manifesto's weaknesses was precisely to be too focused on a single product category, to be locked in its specialty, we needed new products, innovation, and new ideas."" Together with Beauty Packaging Services (BPS), a co-packing company for cosmetics, Manifesto now forms the new Beauty division of the Superga group. By continuing to diversify its activities from the luxury sector to the beauty, Superga has created a platform of services offering its customers the possibility to couple sourcing, filling and logistics. ""We evaluate the gain to about one month during the development process,"" concludes Alain Bréau."
Caudalie to multiply openings in Brazil,"Premium Beauty News - What is Caudalie's strategy to enter the Brazilian market and set up there? Virginie Milosevic - Caudalie is developing through three main networks: our wholly-owned stores, our local e-commerce website, and the Sephora network. Premium Beauty News - You opened your first wholly-owned store in March 2013 in Iguatemi. Has the network developed since then? Virginie Milosevic - Today, Brazil counts three wholly-owned stores, and there will even be a fourth one soon, which is really unusual for our brand: one in Sao Paulo (Iguatemi), one in Rio de Janeiro (Village Mall), a Spa boutique in Curitiba (Patio Batel), and another Spa boutique is to open in Sao Paulo (Higienopolis) in November 2014. Brazil is in full swing, the beauty market is booming and in the process of structuring itself, so it is the right moment for us to invest. Premium Beauty News - Is the partnership with Sephora exclusive? Virginie Milosevic - Yes, Caudalie has been distributed through this network since May 2014, and the first months have been promising. Premium Beauty News - What are Caudalie's assets on this market? Virginie Milosevic - Our brand has a very strong identity. We're very lucky! Our history is very original, our scientific innovations very promising, and our self-imposed ethical charter very demanding. In addition, we work a lot on the glamour of our brand with natural and efficient, but also ultra-feminine and attractive products. Premium Beauty News - Do Brazilian women know the brand? Virginie Milosevic - Caudalie still mainly aims to develop brand awareness in Brazil - we work on it on a daily basis. We target all women with different ranges to provide an answer to every desire and skin type, from the most sensitive to the most demanding. Premium Beauty News - Do you intend to open spas? Virginie Milosevic - Our boutique in Curitiba has a wonderful spa cabin, just like the next one that is to open in Sao Paulo. We are convinced we should offer our customers the possibility to discover and try our products via our Spa expertise. We have not concluded any partnership with any hotel yet, but we are reviewing the proposals we were made."
SIMP is settling in Mexico,"Quite an outstanding performance for this French SME, located in the Paris area, employing 32 people and specialized in the manufacture of cosmetic applicators, among which a host of mascara brushes. Taken over in July 2011 by its current managers, Alain Blondel and Eric de Bardonneche, supported by the investment fund Omnes Capital, its staff will have doubled in three years and its turnover increased by more than 50%. SIMP produced last year in its plant in the Paris region an all-time record of 100 million mascara brushes and more than 120 million rubber wipers! The winning formula: a new industrial organization to optimize production to its maximum, maximum automation of the different production stations, a will to fully control the entire production chain, including in particular the manufacture of moulds and rely on strong innovation to be able to produce out of the ordinary shapes. ""We can design a pilot mould in five weeks, and a production mould in eight to nine weeks,"" says Blondel. One of the French company's other strong point, according to its leader, is its ability to develop innovative products and more specifically, to reinvent the cosmetic applicator, and this, at competitive prices. All this of course backed up by patents... no less than seven patents were filed since the takeover of the company. ""This clearly can be attributed to the industrial model that we implemented, combined with our ability to master both the design and manufacture of our moulds upstream"". ""The start of this factory in Mexico, explains Blondel, is the natural outcome of our success abroad and of our commitment to support our clients wherever they develop their businesses."" Hence, the French company is settling in Mexico in the city of Aguascalientes, in a 1,500 sqm factory, and will start first by producing what is also one of its main assets in Europe, rubber wipers. By mid 2016, the Mexican plant will be able to produce about 30 million of them per year. ""This is an important step in our development on the North and South American continents. The recent MakeUp in New York trade show, to which we took part, was an indicator of our growth potential across the Atlantic. Our presence at MakeUp in São Paulo also illustrates this,"" explains Alain Blondel. ""That is what is at stake,"" we were told at SIMP. ""Even though the mascara plastic brush remains one of our featured products, enabling us to claim a 25% global market share, we are focusing a lot on other types of applicators, especially gloss applicators but also applications outside the cosmetic field, like for example for health-related products or various industrial applications."" To note that this ""extra cosmetic"" activity, this year will account for nearly 30% of the company's turnover."
Beautypress convinces cosmetic brands,"Premium Beauty News - What differentiates your services from those of a traditional press agency? Gabriele Fuchs - A PR agency - or an in-house team - takes care of the PR strategy, the budget, the press releases and press conferences and has to be in personal touch with a selected number of media and editors. So a lot of personal involvement and creativity is required to do this. While we as a digital service take over the below the line activities as archiving the press releases and the images of standard and new products and wiring out newsletters to get the attention of the press. With our very widespread editor contacts and the possibility to measure for each brand their individual media list we maximize the outreach. Being digital all product information and images are available at any time for an instant download and publication. This availability is our great advantage. Furthermore, our database is fully searchable through multiple ways. Our goal to support the PR teams to get more publications. Premium Beauty News - You opened your French service in 2011. How did it evolve? Gabriele Fuchs - We started mainly with brands that knew our services already from the German or US market, like Procter & Gamble, Lavera or Santé Naturkosmetik, but in the meantime more and more French brands followed. Premium Beauty News - How many brands are working with you now? Gabriele Fuchs - We are working with more than 150 brands in France and we developed very strongly in the past three years. What helped us to grow is a second service that we offer: our multi-brand events, where we offer brands a face-to-face time with beauty editors. With reaching the break even point last year the French team can be very proud of their achievement. Premium Beauty News - What is the typical portray of a brand using your services? Gabriele Fuchs - Actually, there is not a typical brand. Among our clients are global players, niche brands, natural cosmetics, luxury and mass market brands. That was our intention right from the start. Editors look into all different kinds of brands and we want to offer a complete overview of the market, not just a ""glimpse"" of it. Premium Beauty News - And in the US? Gabriele Fuchs - This is a much more difficult market due to the distance that we have and the sheer size of it. But after 5 years we are a recognized service. Growing each year at a 30% rate is a success after the disastrous economic depression of 2009 and the 2 following years. Premium Beauty News - What will be your next developments? Gabriele Fuchs - We are looking into new markets to launch the concept as we see how much interest we get from international brands offering our services now in eight countries. Clients support us to move forward and to support them on more markets. This is based on their experience how efficient and cost saving our service is."
Strong growth for Crystal Claire Cosmetics,"Together under Crystal Group, owned by CEO Roger Hwang, Crystal Claire Cosmetics and its sister company,Crystal International (est. 1992) have seen a remarkable performance growth in both sales and new clients over the last few years. This year's expected sales for Crystal Group are estimated at 135 million US dollars with a total staff of more than 2,000 people worldwide. Crystal Claire Cosmetics' Canadian production facility is fully dedicated to providing Full Turnkey Services ranging from product/package design to final product delivery, including in-house formulations, and manufacturing and packing of cosmetic products. Crystal International Inc., in its own right, has become a leading global packaging supplier with several production units located throughout China, offering customized cosmetic packaging from initial concepts, design prototypes, to finished components. The company specializes in Plastic Injection Moulding, Dual Dispensing Systems and Airless packages. ""Innovation and Quality is a top priority at Crystal Claire Cosmetics"", explains Rhonda Beveridge, Vice President of Product Development & Marketing. ""As the demands of the marketplace evolve, it is crucial to be a step ahead to introduce unique, high performing quality formulations to our clients. Our research team is always in search for the latest advances in ingredients, processes and technology. Our knowledgeable experienced chemists understand the importance of developing high performance formulations using the best ingredients.

""Clearly,"" emphasises Beveridge, ""this structure mainly consists of large international groups for whom we have become one of the main partners in North America these past years."" The market operations of Crystal Claire Cosmetics remain concentrated at 90% in North and South America with European operations growing rapidly. So much so, that the opening of a wholly owned subsidiary in Paris, France could happen in the very near future of Crystal Group. ""More than mere suppliers, we truly position ourselves as generators of ideas and creators,"" insists Beveridge. ""Our efforts to develop new textures are constant, our R&D team works vigorously on developing new textures that will perform and exceed consumer expectations."""
The Brazilian factory of the Geka group will be operational in the first half of 2015,"Premium Beauty News - Within thirty months, your group has undergone significant changes! Amaury de Menthière - I will recall a few facts. In early 2012, the international investment fund 3i entered into an agreement to take a majority stake in Geka's capital. Founded in 1925, this German company is a pioneer company in the field of plastic injection moulding for mascara brushes and packaging. Geka has production facilities in Bechhofen, Germany and in Elgin, Illinois, and has sales offices in Paris and New York. We employ approximately 800 people worldwide and this year the company's turnover will be on the rise. We can consider that we have in the field of mascara a global market share of around 30%. Premium Beauty News - What key decisions were taken in recent months? Amaury de Menthière - We started by launching a few months ago a ""supply chain"" plan to shorten our delivery times and reduce our minimum order quantity (MOQ) to 25 000 pieces to better meet the requirements of our customers. And the least we can say is that this operation was a success, since we are about to achieve a customer satisfaction rating never reached before. Second decision, take advantage of the company's technological expertise to diversify its activities towards health care and applicators in a field that encompasses not only skincare but also pharmacy and, to some extent, the medical sector. This was achieved as it is now a separate activity. Third decision, an effective industrial presence in Brazil. Premium Beauty News - Brazil, an important issue? Amaury de Menthière - Jérôme de Prémare, the Group's Sales & Marketing SVP, had already stressed on this point in your columns a few months ago. If our objective is to strengthen the development of the Group's activities both in Europe and the United States, we also want to set foot in new markets in Asia and South America, particularly in China and Brazil. After the successful creation of a business structure in Sao Paulo, we made some plans to build a factory of its own. This will soon be achieved. It will be located in the outskirts of Sao Paulo. The first injection and assembly machines are actually on their way to the site. This factory will help address projects that are already under way, not only concerning mascara but also lipgloss and eyeliners. But that's not all! I remind you that our trading subsidiary Victoria (specialised in cosmetic brushes and accessories) is opening some offices in Hong Kong and Shanghai to import products in Europe and the US. A structure that only reflects what the next steps of our development in Asia will be. Premium Beauty News - The American factory has also been revamped? Amaury de Menthière - That's right, our factory in Elgin, Illinois, has fully integrated, since this year, the ""injection"" part, which was previously outsourced. Premium Beauty News - A group in working order? Amaury de Menthière - Absolutely! All the more since both the sales and technical teams have been reinforced and we continue to build on innovation. This has always been in the company's DNA and we are pursuing this strategy more than ever. On average we file between five to ten patents a year and the goal is clearly to expand our product portfolio in the field of system applicators. The Geka Group is and will remain a leading and unavoidable player in this market segment."
"Dear Rose, Chantal and Alexandra Roos's ode to women and perfume","Premium Beauty News - What made you decide to embark on this common adventure? Chantal Roos - Strangely enough, I had never had in mind to create my own brand, it is Alexandra who gave me the impulse. It is true it is much more interesting, but it is also an opportunity to create where there is actually something missing. At the moment, consumers' real longing for a more precious world is felt particularly strongly, as well as their need for perfumery to lie at the core of emotions. It was the right moment. Alexandra Roos - It is also related to passing down my mother's knowledge of this trade. It felt obvious. I am an artist first, and my world is that of music, but of course I have always been surrounded by perfumery. We decided to match both, as they are not such different worlds. We talk about notes, composition… the writing process is quite similar in music and perfumery. Musical references are never far in the creative part of the brand, such as the perfume names or the bottle designs. Premium Beauty News - Can you talk about Dear Rose? Chantal Roos - Dear Rose celebrates the eternal story of women and perfume, it is an ode to femininity. 'Rose' reminds of the name, but especially of the flower: if only one flower were to be remembered in the perfume, it would be the rose. It embodies the perfume. Nevertheless, not all our perfumes contain rose. Fabrice Pellegrin, the perfumer, immersed himself in our story and composed the five fragrances – A Capella, the sound of a pure voice, a fresh green, I Love My Man, for women in love with love, Bloody Rose, Sympathy For The Sun, which is very sensual on bare skin, and La Favorite. Alexandra Roos - The bottle is very feminine, with quite a heavy glass weight for an easy grab, and adorned with copper, a material that is both organic and precious. Premium Beauty News - This line was launched last May and distributed by the Différentes Latitudes label. What about your future projects? Alexandra Roos - Indeed, the collection has been launched with success, and a new one is scheduled before the end of the year. Now apart from France, we are already present in Germany, Austria, Benelux, the Baltic states, we are starting at Harrod's in October, and we have contacts in the United States. Our online store is also accessible."
"Dr. Jörg Karas, new Managing Director of Schwan Cosmetics: ""People, Profit and Planet""","Premium Beauty News - Which positions did you previously hold before your appointment to Managing Director of Schwan Cosmetics? Jörg Karas - I started at Schwan Cosmetics as one of the department managers in Production and was subsequently responsible for different, partly international areas within Operations. Six years ago I was appointed to the Executive Committee and have since been Head of R&D. After these very interesting and successful years leading this group I am looking forward to the new challenges ahead. I am certain that Schwan Cosmetics will further set standards within the industry when it comes to innovation and client orientation and will continue to strengthen its leading position in Service and Operations. Premium Beauty News - Where do you see the challenges in your new position? Which goals and objectives are you setting for yourself and what do you specifically want to ""tackle""? Jörg Karas - First and foremost it is imperative to secure and pursue the current positive economic development. Sustainability is part of our DNA and not only a trendy expression for us. We have initiated a few major projects in all three dimensions – People, Profit and Planet. The harmony of these three aspects is ultimately what will make companies successful for the long‐term future. In addition we will put more emphasis onto our global production network ‐ especially in the growth markets. Premium Beauty News - What is your vision for the company? Jörg Karas - So far Schwan Cosmetics' strategy has been a very successful one and subsequently offers an excellent framework for the future development. However it will no longer be sufficient in this industry to set the standards in product and service only. Successful companies will re‐invent themselves in shorter cycles and thus adapt to quickly changing market and client requirements. My vision: a dynamic organization for sustainable success – for our customers as well as for Schwan Cosmetics."

"Hwa Sung, make-up innovation at the heart of the strategy","It may be recalled that Hwa Sung specialized in the production of pencils and plastic applicators in the early 1980s to actually begin its series of ""two and three in one"" in 2004. Today it also offers, along with formulas, multi-compartment make-up cases and closures, combined or single lipgloss and mascaras... On the industrial side, the Korean company owns a factory in the outskirts of Seoul, employs 100 people and will achieve this year a turnover of 34.5 million U.S. dollars (compared to the 20 million posted n 2012!). Hwa Sung has operations mainly in Korea (60% of its business), but continues to increase its penetration in the US, which represents 80 per cent of its export sales, and is now targeting Europe. On the side of recent launches in which the company was involved: – for Anastasia Beverly Hills, an eyebrow pencil with a super slim Brush, and a diameter of 1.6 but yet a hard moulded texture. The fine pencil tip mimics the appearance of tiny hairs. – as for Stila, this innovative waterproof brush pen applicator, can help define natural looking brows, its felt tip guarantees an easy smudge- and crease-proof application that stays on all day. – for smashbox is a triangular eye brow pencil with a gel to define a full coloured or thin line. The coloured or clear brow gel is perfect to set eyebrow hairs. – Finally, for Korea's Aritaum, this slim lipstick with its smudge tip will be perfect to blend the formula while achieving colour gradients on the lips."
"""The potential of beauty boxes is far from being exhausted"", Charles von Abercron, founder and CEO of Glossybox","Premium Beauty News - In three years, Glossybox globally emerged as one of the main actors of the beauty box concept. What is your assessment at this stage? Charles von Abercron - Every 12 seconds we sell a new box. We are really proud of these facts. We are represented in ten countries and three continents. It is highly interesting to see how the beauty industry works in other countries, which habits, or which products are more likely to be appreciated by German, American or Swedish customers. What is also very important is our surveys. This is how we know that our customers' favorite product in ALL countries is Mascara. We have also recently learned, according to a survey, that French women among others, are the ones that value being tanned the most. Premium Beauty News - How to explain the Glossybox success story? Charles von Abercron - It is the love of detail that makes our success, and makes the difference. Therefore, our Mantra is ""It's not done until it is perfect"". We want our customers to have the best experience and reach their expectations. The use of Big Data on the one hand, and our beauty expertise on the other, ensure that the composition of the box is appreciated and brings joy to the user. The fact that we use Big Data makes our company unique. Our goal is to know our customers better than they know themselves. To this aim, Big Data is essential to us. Trying to surprise customers by sending products they will like without knowing them is somehow the secret of Glossybox's success story. We take also advantage of the fact that we are an international company. So brand awareness can be developed in several countries at the same time. In Sweden, for instance, it worked out really well and really fast. Premium Beauty News - Is the Beauty Box phenomenon still so trendy? Charles von Abercron - When I just take a look at the figures, I have the feeling that the potential of beauty boxes is far from being exhausted. In an era of mass consumption, where everybody has everything, we need to convince people by using other marketing tools, such as emotionalizing. This is where we take our advantage. Customers want to be surprised, and to discover products they do not know, but which suit their needs. The unboxing experience reaches that goal. Premium Beauty News - What are your projects of development? Charles von Abercron - Our current project is to increase customer satisfaction and enthusiasm, which is working very well already: within 6/six months, we managed to improve our customer satisfaction from 68 to 84 %. We expect to reach 90%. This is why we are launching a new version of our Glossybox for our third anniversary. We really hope it is going to please customers and make the unboxing moment even more exciting. The design of the box is the result of common/joint work with our customers. Premium Beauty News - Do you also plan to open stores like your competitor? Charles von Abercron - This might happen in the future, and we have already had a few first tests with the opening of pop up stores in Sweden and in the US. It is a completely different experience for the customer. However, for the moment we are devoted to the ultimate customer unboxing experience."
"HCP, contemplates possibility in setting up industrial presence in Europe","Premium Beauty News - The start of your aluminium-processing plant and of your fourth plastic injection factory barely completed in China, 2015 also promises to be a ""rich year» in investments and acquisitions? Eddy Wu - Indeed, thanks to the support of our financial sponsor, TPG Capital, who is stating our common ambition to continue to work towards positioning HCP Packaging as a leading player in the beauty packaging industry in the world, we are looking forward to strengthening our presence in the coming months. With industrial investments, of course, but with the right kind of investment too. In China for example, our fourth plant ideally reflects the new industrial face of HCP. It is, as you know, a unit where all the production flows have been optimized to the maximum in order to not only increase our global competitiveness but also to strongly improve the quality of our production. At a competitive level, it can be estimated that this factory employs, an equivalent level of production considered, almost 50% people less than a conventional factory. As you know China has to face the challenges generated by the expansion of its economy, which must be associated with the natural increase in wages. ""China = cheap labour"" is a concept doomed to fall into oblivion in the medium-term. In term of quality, the challenges that we are taking up in the area of automation and of improvement of industrial flows allows us in addition to reach always higher levels of quality. Premium Beauty News - Your investment decisions in terms of production capacity differ depending on the regions where you operate? Eddy Wu - That's true. If in China we are continuing to invest in terms of volumes and quality, like for example with our plastic injection capacity but also with our production capacity of moulds (+ 30% next year) and in metallization/varnishing, the goal for the USA and Mexico is not necessarily to increase our capacity. What matters most in this region, it is our reactivity to customer requirements and the industrial proximity we offer the whole North American continent. This is also what will drive us to establish ourselves industrially in Eastern Europe. An operation, which is scheduled for the time being and according to our plans, next year. Premium Beauty News - And commercially, what parts of the world do you favour most? Eddy Wu - As usual, of course, the United States, Europe and China, but also other areas where finally our expertise and the quality of our productions are increasingly recognized, like for example and surprisingly, Japan (The Kose group has awarded us for the second consecutive year a prize for the excellence in our work). Brazil is obviously a country we are watching closely too."
Make-up: Sleever is gaining momentum!,"Premium Beauty News - What have been the changes since its launch in 2010? Eric Fresnel - After a first year focused on pencils, a second on polishes and then lipsticks, and presently mascaras, Sleever International, the leader of the sleeve concept, offers comprehensive solutions in terms of, protection at the source of the make-up product, of traceability (QR Code, C133-type Datamatrix, laser number marking, transfer coding), of design and brand customization: an exact reproduction of the lipstick shade, a palette of special effects, the use of bright, pearlescent or iridescent technical polishes, a sharpness of printed details, the ability to produce miniseries for consumer testing. To achieve this, Sleever International has developed a new film, the C-PET-KG-050 with improved cosmetic properties (facilitated tearability, low temperature, dressing of complex shapes) and through its design ability (printability, transparency, brightness). Premium Beauty News - Industrialization is an additional constraint to cope with, for the development of the SleeverMakeup® range! Eric Fresnel - We have developed a new device with an advanced technology, the ""SleeverLogicpak® LPK 80"" machine, which complements the range of SleeverLogicpak equipment and which is perfectly suited for the sleeve positioning and horizontal shrinkage of small packagings (pencils, lipsticks, mascaras, creams nail polishes...). The SleeverLogicpak machine stands as a new standard for the make-up industry with an optimized footprint: 2 sqm, i.e., reduced by half compared to standard market equipment, format changeovers bellow 10 minutes, , an ideal, very compact, very flexible machine for end of lines with a output of 60 to 80 items per minute. Premium Beauty News - Today you are going even further by creating a position of ""Business Development Manager dedicated to make-up""! Eric Fresnel - In 2014 Sleever International presented SleeverMakeup® Mascara Skinsleever, a product intended to awaken all your senses, which projects you in the 3D world with the ""Skinsleever®"". The Skinsleever offers a new sensory dimension to the make-up sector, with a design surface enabling the development of material-like relief effects: skin, wood, metal, stone, fabric. All these effects offer both a new sensory dimension and the feel, and impart a 3D effect to your products. Its shape helps single out, special effects are attractive, its variety of surface finishes is pleasing to the touch and allows you to create a trendy brand image. To get such a result you must pay a constant attention to markets needs. You must also adapt to each market and each region. With SleeverMakeup these new services paired to technology allow us to meet the expectations of the make-up market, our two printing technologies, Helioflex and Flexodigital allow us to have the desired reactivity to meet deadlines, to have the required flexibility with regards to the breadth of the product ranges, from multi-references to exclusive collector series. To maintain this level of innovation and service, we set up a global network of specialists by market and created a position of Make-up Business Development Manager to strengthen a team fully dedicated to this sector, which posts, each year, at Sleever International, double-digit growth rate figures. We are strictly and totally committed to a Marketing focused on the product offer with a ""Market"" dedicated ""Make-up/Product"" relationship."
Makeup innovations: BCM relies on its French-German synergy,"Two is better than one! BCM relies on its French and German-based branches to meet the needs of the makeup industry. If the French entity is more specialized in coloured emulsions (foundation, eyeliners, mascaras, etc.), the German entity is more of a powder and lip product expert, although it can produce all categories of makeup, except for pencils, and it is even equipped for nail varnish filling. The third entity is based in the UK, and is specialized in skincare. Amongst the innovations showcased at the last edition of the MakeUp in Paris trade show held at the Carrousel du Louvre last June 12 and 13, 2014, the Boots group's subsidiary specialized in cosmetics subcontracting highlighted its latest powder innovations. The Germany-based BCM plant recently invested in new powder technologies, such as the multidimensional 3D technology, and thus expanded the product range to extremely varied and sophisticated renderings and designs (flat effects combined with 3D rounded, satin and pearly effects on the surface and in mass). ""This technology provides an excellent payoff. It's the next generation of powders,"" emphasizes Marie-Christine Clerc, Sales and Marketing Director of the French BCM entity. In addition, BCM showcased two Cream to Powder emulsions, a blush [blush poupoupidou] and a foundation [effect & matte foundation SPF15] with extremely thin textures that provide a high coverage, and melt on the skin for a light, ""second skin effect"" makeup. But above all, the company launched a novel Powder to Cream formula: when applied, this free powder transforms itself into a real melting cream with a playful metamorphosis effect and surprising sensations, like a cooling aqua effect. It is available as a blush [powder to cream blusher], a foundation [powder to cream foundation], or even an eyeshadow [powder to cream eyeshadow]. As for emulsions, BCM's French entity has followed the ""cushion"" trend that is booming in Asia, and especially Korea, by developing ultra-fluid textures to be applied with a double sponge. The principle is simple: an ""inker"" sponge receives the product, and an ""applicator"" sponge takes the dose required for the application. Even the most fluid formulas remain easy to apply and use, including when retouching during the day. BCM showcased two formulas to combine care and pleasure, protection and colour, light and efficacy, a regular application and convenience, and thus meet the specific needs of European consumers: – [Mist Cushion SPF 15], a foundation that is as fluid as ink, which makes its coverage adjustable, – [Primer mist cushion SPF 30], a primer endowed with a high sun protection factor, a makeup/skincare/sun care hybrid with a steady blur effect that captures the sunlight while protecting from its rays. ""BCM has always adopted a skincare approach in makeup. The fact that we develop products destined to be marketed through the pharmacy network for Boots undoubtedly guided our approach to makeup,"" Marie-Christine Clerc explains. A new wave has also been sweeping the stick segment for a few seasons, and BCM is definitely riding it, for instance with [hip hop hair stick], a coloured stick destined for hair, with short-lived but very playful effects, and other sticks for a fresh effect on the complexion: [cooling blush] and [cooling highlighter] are formulated with a very high water percentage, so that the colour is applied without any ""material effect"" that would mark wrinkles and fine lines."
Birchbox leverages its concept through a first store in New York,"Located in SoHo, at 433 West Broadway, in lower Manhattan in New York City, the very new Birchbox store features 2,000 products from 250 brands including Smashbox, Caudalie, Jouer, Supergoop!, Cynthia Rowley, Baxter of California, Lab Series, and Art of Shaving. The store concept leverages the insights and feedback gathered from the company's more than 800,000 active subscribers: editorial content, videos and product reviews throughout the shop to help customers learn and self-navigate, touchscreens on display throughout the store to help customers to source product recommendations, and testers available for every product in the store. A vertical merchandising strategy allows consumers to shop by category instead of by brand. For example, a shopper could come in looking for a red lipstick and compare different types in the 'makeup' section of the store. The store also features a ""Try Bar"" where customers can experiment with different beauty trends and find the products that are right for them. Also, for a personalised experience, a dedicated B.Y.O.B. (standing for ""Build Your Own Birchbox"") section allows shoppers to hand-pick five sample size products of their choice for 15 USD. A good way for the retailer to recruit new members of the Birchbox community… There are different beauty services available by appointment (and for walk-ins when available) for hair, nails and makeup, as well as group classes on a variety of topics. Classes are designed to appeal to all types of beauty consumers and allow them to sample, try and learn about the products. Classes will be free for Birchbox subscribers and $30 for non-subscribers. ""Our goal with Birchbox has always been to make it easy, efficient and fun for people to discover new brands and products fit for their lifestyle,"" said Katia Beauchamp, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Birchbox. ""We have learned so much about how we can drive customers to change their behaviour online, and we see an opportunity to extend into offline retail to evolve with our customer's needs."" Launched in 2010 in the U.S., Birchbox sends every month a selection of sample size beauty and grooming products, adapted to the profile of its subscribers who provided information about their skin and hair conditions. In April 2012, the company launched Birchbox Man in the U.S. and in September 2012, Birchbox acquired France-based company JolieBox, thus gaining outposts in France, Spain and the UK. Additionally, through Birchbox's online store, customers can shop full-sized products from more than 800 brands. With the opening of the SoHo store, this omni-channel retail concept is certainly one of the most well-conceived to date. ""Birchbox is well-positioned to understand omni-channel beauty given its start as an ecommerce company, and learnings gained from a series of successful pop-up shops throughout the years. The Birchbox store is another channel to help create a robust shopping experience, allowing Birchbox to engage with consumers through multiple touch points - from commerce to content to trial - and further bring it's 360 retail experience of 'try, learn, buy' to life,"" the company explains."
Fiabila announces the start of its second filling unit in Japan,"Premium Beauty News - This acceleration in your investments in major theatres of operation in the Beauty industry around the world is quite impressive! Pierre Miasnik - I don't know if it's impressive but it was necessary. We must be able to meet the needs of brand owners in all the areas of the world where they operate. This responsiveness, industrially speaking, is of course important but it's not enough. What matters the most, and especially in Japan, is to comply with deadlines and regulations, security of supply and, above all, offer an impeccable level of quality. Quality and security are and always have been key criteria for us. Our business has evolved significantly in recent years. We never stop adapting each day. I have already emphasised in your newsletter, but this is now a leitmotiv: the more our customers concentrate, the more their requirements increase in fields as diverse as the reduction of the environmental impact, the carbon footprint of offered products, ethical and quality considerations. They have become so strategic and vital that we are compelled to set up teams capable of mastering these areas. Premium Beauty News - There is no better example, indeed, in terms of quality requirements than Japan? Pierre Miasnik - We have been carrying out conditioning activities in this country since 2000 under the leadership of our partner Akira Hara. Undoubtedly those who can claim handling flammable products in Japan, where authorizations are scarce, automatically acquire a true legitimacy in terms of quality. I even surprise myself when I visit this country, to see, in our own production sites the quality level we have reached. This is in fact the whole meaning of my message in this announcement on the doubling of our production capacity locally that I have wished to pass on today. This second Japanese plant, extending over 1,300m² of premises on a plot of 6,000m² with its three filling lines and a storage capacity for flammables products of 20 tonnes is clearly designed to strengthen our capacity in Japan and for Japan. This industrial complex was designed with all the necessary precautions in terms of geographical location and complies with the Continuous Business Planning concept in the event of climatic or seismic damages. Premium Beauty News - This strategy also reinforces, of course, your presence in Asia? Pierre Miasnik - That's right! As you recall, we commissioned over there, a short time ago, our first filling line in China with our partner Shya Hsin and we are gaining momentum in India. But Japan is at the same time a country in full evolution. Japanese women, currently, very fond of nail polishes in the form of gels, after several setbacks, are increasingly turning to traditional polishes again. The market is growing again. Where we are fortunate enough to be present and recognized."
Makeup and skincare innovation: the Alkos Group launches surprising textures,"The Cosmopack and MakeUp in Paris trade shows, which took place respectively in early April in Bologna, and last June 12 and 13 in Paris, represented another opportunity for the Alkos Group to highlight its expertise in lip and complexion product formulation, in particular by capitalizing on its Alkos Cosmétiques subsidiary's expertise in plastic pencil formulas. On the lip segment, the French manufacturer launched the Matte & Long Lasting Veil, a new matte texture in a plastic jumbo pencil. When applied, the pencil leaves a real, long-lasting, and no transfer coloured veil with a matte finish on the lips which cannot be felt at all when touching the skin. ""We have incorporated hydrating, anti-aging skincare actives into it for smooth, perfect lips,"" specifies Florence Lefeuvre, the Commercial, Marketing and Communication Director of the group. In addition to this jumbo, Alkos has developed an automatic plastic pencil for the lip contour: the Matte & Smooth Definition. ""Its smoothing formula fills in fine lines for a perfect contour, and its velvety finish suits both matte and more satin-like lipsticks."" The same formula is also available in a wooden slim pencil. Also in the lip segment, the Alkos Group has developed Lift & Comfort, a new lipstick texture. It is no longer about the matte world here, as red has got a more intense and satin-like texture. Alkos claims a good adhesion, a very comfortable, long-lasting thin film, as well as lifting, toning and hydrating actives. ""Makeup can no longer be efficient only in terms of colour, it must also provide a skincare benefit,"" Florence Lefeuvre emphasizes. Formulated for cheeks and lips with a light, flexible texture and natural skincare actives such as mango and apricot butter, the Jumbo Twist Cheeks N'Lips is specific in that it leaves a shiny finish on lips, and a velvety finish on cheeks. Alkos also showcased several new formulas only for complexion, in particular in the form of sticks: – Perfect Complexion, a compact cream-to-powder, smoothing and corrective foundation formula with average coverage which does not mark dry areas, for a natural, flawless result. – Lift N'Stay Concealer, a long-lasting, anti-dark circle formula available as a plastic jumbo or jumbo retractable pencil containing lifting, filling and blurring agents for a radiant, relaxed look. – Soft Cream Blush Stick, a blush mini-stick with a melting texture, easy to apply and soften, and thus ultra-flexible, for a natural or sophisticated result. – Terracotta Stick, long-lasting summer makeup to even and matify the complexion, – Foundation Stick SPF 10, for a powdered effect: an intermediate between foundation and powder. Lastly, the Alkos Group developed two skincare products as part of a partnership with applicator supplier Cosmogen: – Instant Wake Up Serum, a lifting, decongestant serum in Cosmogen Squeeze'n Pentaball applicator packaging. The formula is to be applied before makeup for a fresher look. It also suits men's needs. – Eye Perfector Serum, an anti-wrinkle, anti-dark circle gel with an applicator from Cosmogen's Tense range destined to make the formula penetrate more easily. ""We offer them both as ready-to-go, full service formulas so that they can be placed on the market extremely fast. Of course, they can be delivered in other types of packaging, but then the time periods for performing tests have to be taken into account,"" Florence Lefeuvre concludes."
"""We have to carefully watch the competitiveness of the European cosmetics industry"", Bertil Heerink, Cosmetics Europe","Premium Beauty News - The latest market figures published by Cosmetics Europe show that sales of European cosmetic products have been stable in 2013 despite the difficult economic context, in particular thanks to the dynamism of exportations. Bertil Heerink - Exports out of Europe have increased in 2013 and that was very good news considering the overall economic context and the value of the euro. That made us convinced that the quality of European cosmetics is still very much in demand all over the world. Despite the lack of dynamism of the European market, we can be quite proud of the performance of our industry in 2013. However, we have to be cautious, as a too expansive euro can be a risk. We have to watch the European competitiveness very carefully. Premium Beauty News - Do you see current negotiations on a EU-US free trade agreement as a way to support this competitiveness or as a risk? Bertil Heerink - It is good news! Actually, the representatives of the cosmetics industry on both sides of the Atlantic have developed joint proposals in order to simplify trade between the two zones. Few industries have gone as far as us. Removing unnecessary technical impediments will ease the transatlantic business. However, I want to stress the fact that our goal is not to lower the standards but to progress in the way of mutual recognition while keeping the same level of protection for consumers. Premium Beauty News - As far as cosmetics are concerned, the U.S. and European regulation widely differ. Do you think it would really be possible to harmonise them? Bertil Heerink - It is not our goal. For instance, I do not believe that the definition of products will be harmonised. The European definition is much wider than the US one. Nevertheless, there are several areas where progress is possible, in particular regarding testing procedures and technical requirements. For instance, good manufacturing practices (GMP) for cosmetics makers could be harmonised based on an ISO standard. Testing requirements for the determination of the level of protection against UV rays and the Sun Protection Factors (SPF) could also be harmonised. We can also progress in the harmonisation of labelling requirements. In particular, divergences regarding the labelling of colour additives could be overcome. The more we can do in the way of regulatory alignment, the easier it will be for companies to adapt to local requirements. Premium Beauty News - What about animal testing? It has been banned in Europe but is still permitted in the US. Bertil Heerink - The European Union has been a pioneer in this field and animal rights NGOs strongly pressure policy makers in the US, Canada, Japan or Brazil to follow our path. As far as the European industry is concerned, our goal is to accelerate the validation of alternative methods and their acceptation by regulators worldwide. We also have to harmonise the different approaches of the animal testing ban in order to avoid unnecessary technical barriers to trade and unfair competition. Premium Beauty News - How to achieve regulatory alignment without cutting back on consumer protection? Bertil Heerink - We have to prepare ourselves to fresh thinking on how we can use free trade agreements not only to ease business and trade, but also to increase the level of consumer protection globally. The European Commission's DG Health & Consumers has been very clear on this issue: progress in the way of regulatory harmonisation cannot be done through lower standards. The industry fully agrees with this approach. Premium Beauty News - What are your other priorities? Bertil Heerink - I would mention self-regulation, communication and China. Self-regulation is a strategic issue, in particular as far as claims and advertising practices are concerned. It is the best way to protect consumers efficiently while guaranteeing enough freedom for innovation and competition. We want to set up a process where we can learn from each other in the common interests of both consumers and the industry. Our goal is that the principle of self-regulation, after discussion with consumers' organisations, be accepted globally in the field of advertising. We should also coordinate our communication about the products. Information is global now and when there is a safety concern in a major market it can quickly spread all over the world. Eventually, China remains a priority to us. The country is in the process of building a new regulatory corpus for cosmetic products and we are cooperating a lot with Chinese authorities to avoid unnecessary barriers to trade while improving the level of consumer protection."
ABC Texture: Ten years already!,"Premium Beauty News - ABC Texture will be celebrating this year, its tenth anniversary! Louisette Bourdin - That's right! In 2004, after more than 20 years of R&D in cosmetics and several experiences in the creation of labs for industry subcontractors, I decided to start my own business with the creation of ABC Texture, a Research and Development Company in cosmetics. It all started in Saint-Malo in a small of 20 sqm laboratory, with a formulation technician. First specialised in the development of new textures, I decided to expand very quickly the expertise of ABC Texture by offering my clients to produce their products. Premium Beauty News - 2008 is a pivotal year in your development? Louisette Bourdin - It is indeed the year when we decided to invest EUR 1 million in the construction of a new site in Dinard, just minutes from Saint-Malo. This new eco-designed 850 sqm industrial building was built in compliance with the High Environmental Quality (HQE) standards. Committed to listening to the market and our clients, the machine park at the time was evolving to meet demands for small and large series. The team then consisted of 6 people for a turnover of EUR 0.4 million, including more than 40% from exports. The following year, the company closed the year with a turnover of EUR 1.2 million. I must stress on the fact that this success was based on listening and supporting our clients, with an extensive range of ready to launch formulas (sun care, make-up and skincare) and the development of tailor-made solutions. Premium Beauty News - Several novelties will be launched this year! Louisette Bourdin - Today, ABC Texture is a team of 18 people for a turnover of EUR 2.3 million, implementing a growth strategy in France and abroad. Our ambitions are clear: accelerate innovation and increase our international presence. To achieve these goals, we hired two new executives: – Tifenn Boutard, doctor of pharmacy and physics, who joined us in December 2013 as Research Director. – Nathalie Dessirier, joined the team as Exports, Sales and Marketing Director. Present on many trade shows (Seoul, Dubai, Paris, New York, Hong Kong), we are launching this year several new products to meet the needs of different markets. What these novelties have in common is that they are all formulated without silicone: – A matte long-wear Lipstick, with no volatile compounds. It delivers a pure and intense colour after just one application, exceptional comfort and glide thanks to an ultra-thin film on the lips. Enriched with vitamin E and F, it won't run during the day. – A Primer with an amazing formula that changes upon application; first a gel-cream for a cocooning skin feel, it quickly changes into a powdery veil for a flawless complexion. – A range of compact concealers containing hydrophilic actives acting on effects like dark circles. Silicone-free, it provides a fresh skin feel and reinforces hydration upon application. A SPF15 concealer also complements the range."
"""Design is the primary component in brand development,"" Dominic Bakic","Premium Beauty News - The DieterBakic Group is well known for its innovative and unconventional designs. Dominic Bakic - Historically we are a design agency and a strategically oriented packaging supplier, specializing in high-end stock packaging, but we grow to become much more! We see design as a primary component in brand development. The brand's positioning and strategy is the keystone of our creative process. We explore the nature of brands we are working with, in order to define unique identities and strengthen the relationship with important target groups. Our aim is that packaging fully contributes to the brand personality. Our diversified services range from stock packaging to custom design, and from concepts to all-inclusive solutions. Since we also work on the brand's image and positioning, what we offer goes far beyond full-service and usual turnkey products. Now, many of the projects we are working on are based on branding. For our customers the main benefits are that they get access to a fully integrated process and not only get concepts to market but also and immediately the partner that can execute those concepts. In addition, when we start working on a brand concept, we start very early to think about what is needed to promote and advertise the new products successfully; hence looking at all touchpoints and initiating successful campaigns. Premium Beauty News - Can you provide us with an illustration of such a project? Dominic Bakic - Of course! One of our most recent projects consisted in the development of the brand identity of Wunderbar, a line of professional hair care products launched by Pro Duo, a subsidiary of Sally Beauty Holdings. The group wanted to strengthen their footprint in the professional hair care market in European. We helped them to develop the entire brand concept, starting from scratch. The only thing that existed was the name of the brand and a short description of its target positioning. Our services included the creation of the brand story, packaging design, logo optimization, colour code, as well as the art direction of the communication campaign (concept and realization of the photoshooting, brochures, sales-folder, POS advertisements, etc.) Premium Beauty News - Innovation is the key factor of success in such a business. How do you handle this task? Dominic Bakic - Actually, we handle the first stages of innovation through a quite unstructured approach. We collect ideas and packaging worldwide, we visit many tradeshows and retail shops, not only those related to the cosmetics business but also in sectors such as foods or leather goods. I'm convinced that cross-fertilization is key to true innovation. Premium Beauty News - What are your main challenges and forecasts for the current year? Dominic Bakic - Today, we work on projects that go beyond the mere packaging aspect and that contain higher levels of complexity compared to what we have dealt with in the past. This required setting-up new internal procedures and ways of working! So far, we have been quite successful in selling this complexity to the market and we achieved a good growth over the last two years and are expected to continue that growth in 2014. Our ability to create and strengthen the brand's image, from the design of its packaging to the point of sale is our strongest asset. A product must be successful at every step: at the point of sale, it must attract and convince the consumer, and during its usage at home, it must produce enough consumer satisfaction to induce repurchases."
Industry: A new President for the FEBEA,"He is a new face at the head of the FEBEA, the main trade federation representing the companies manufacturing and marketing cosmetic products in France: on July 1, 2014, Patrice O'Quin will succeed Alain Grangé-Cabane, who had been managing the organisation for 16 years. ""I'm convinced trade organizations play a major role in today's complex societies. They have a double mission: expressing companies' needs to politicians and government officials, and explaining the constraints of public services to companies. Besides, a Federation has a double duty towards its members: on the one hand, it represents them collectively before public authorities or the various ""stakeholders"" (the scientific community, NGOs, the media…), and on the other hand it provides its members with personalized services (regulations, social issues, exports…) for them to develop their activity in the best conditions,"" explains the future President. A former student at the prestigious French college ENA, which trains future top civil servants, Patrice O'Quin started his professional life in the public administration before joining the business world at Danone, where he was the Director of External Relations and Government Affairs for a little over ten years. ""I saw the cosmetics industry profoundly transform itself. First, it got globalized, and then it found a way to adapt to new society requirements: the environment, safety, and ethics. Rules and standards gradually became much stricter, but our manufacturers managed to anticipate regulations by implementing 'good practices'. We were thus able to renew and revive our contract of confidence with our customers. As I'm convinced Patrick will know how to make our Federation reach new heights, I can only wish him to be as happy as I was as the President of the FEBEA,"" declared Alain Grangé-Cabane, who was elected Honorary President, and who will sit as such on the Federation's Board of Directors. Portrait: Patrick O'Quin Patrick O'Quin is now 59 and has a double experience in public life and the business world. He studied at the prestigious French college ENA, and after getting a diploma in Political Science, he was first appointed senior civil servant at the French Ministry of Agriculture. Then he worked as a Technical Advisor at the Office of the Minister of European Affairs from 1984 to 1986. For the following nine years, Patrick O'Quin held various international positions at the Ministries of Foreign Affairs or Cooperation, in particular as the Advisor of the Chad Republic's Minister of Finance (in N'Djamena). In 1995, Patrick O'Quin decided to stop working for the public administration and join the business world, first as the Director of Environmental Relations at Brasseries Kronenbourg. In 1998, he was called to work at the Danone group headquarters, first as the Director of Corporate External Relations, then as the Director of Government and Multilateral Affairs, as from 2010. He has also had to deal with Danone's relations with various non-business partners of the group as part of his recent duties (public institutions, regulatory authorities, scientific bodies, professional federations, non-governmental organisations, consumer movements)."
"The prestigious Ellis Island Medal of Honor is awarded to Charles Chang, Topline","Born in 1949 in China, Charles Chang grew up in Taiwan. At age 22, he came to America as an international student at the University of Mississippi where he received an MS degree in Chemical Engineering. He continued his studies at Rutgers University, earning an MS in Packaging Science and Engineering, and later obtained an MBA from Farleigh Dickinson University in 1978 and an APC in Marketing from NYU in 1979. Before he started Topline in 1982, he gained corporate experience at Lever Brothers, Avon and Airwick Industries. Since founding Topline, Mr. Chang has transformed his company from an importing business to a vertically integrated manufacturing operation that is emerging as one of the global leaders in the cosmetic packaging industry. Topline has its headquarters in New Jersey and more than 1,000 employees, operates factories worldwide in China, U.S., and Mexico. Additional corporate offices are located in Paris, San Paulo and Shanghai. Under Mr. Chang's leadership, Topline has grown at a 30 percent annual compounding rate from 2001 to 2008 and was ranked as one of New Jersey's top 50 fastest growing companies for five years in a row. ""I came to America 43 years ago as an international student. I studied, worked and build a business. In between, I got married and raised a family. There have been many people who have played important roles in my life. They lend a hand, helped and supported me along the way. I do feel that I am a truly blessed person for so many good things that happened to me,"" said Chang during the ceremony. The National Ethnic Coalition (NECO) was founded in 1986 and is the awarding body of the Ellis Island Medals of Honor. The Medal embodies the spirit of America in celebration of patriotism, tolerance, brotherhood and diversity. This event seeks to single out high profile individuals who have made it their mission to share with those less fortunate their wealth of knowledge, indomitable courage, boundless compassion, unique talents and selfless generosity; all while maintaining the traditions of their ethnic heritage as they uphold the ideals and spirit of America. NECO remains dedicated to the maintenance and restoration of America's greatest symbol of its immigrant history, Ellis Island. As the Medal is based on merit, there are no 'winners', only recipients who are recognized for their contributions to America. Its recipients included six US presidents, Mohammad Ali, Bob Hope, Joe DiMaggio, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump. Last year it honoured Hubert Guerrand-Hermes and Xavier Guerrand-Hermes as International Award recipients. From the cosmetic industry, Leonard and Evelyn Lauder were also among the recipients. ""From his earliest days in the cosmetics industry as a packaging engineer and later as president of Topline Products, Mr. Chang has distinguished himself as a forward-thinking, long-range visionary"", stated the communiqué. ""He was a pioneer in introducing packaging solutions from the Orient to North America and among the first to combine that manufacturing with filled cosmetics made in China. These two achievements have made Topline unique in the beauty industry: the company stands apart as a supplier of complete turnkey solutions for customers. Mr. Chang is also recognized as a creative innovator, obtaining more than 30 utility patents worldwide. Persistent in finding solutions to problems when others typically give up, he lives by his own motto - 'No Way. No Way.' (There is no way that there is no way.) But this dynamic attitude is balanced by his genuine concern and compassion for others, always lending a hand to help - 'a businessman with a heart' as one of his colleagues described him."" Mr. Chang was inducted into the prestigious Packaging Hall of Fame in 2007 by the New Jersey Packaging Executives Club - an honour only given at the senior level to executives who have made a major contribution to the industry. He also received the distinguished Asian Business Leadership Award in 2009 from the U.S. Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce (USPAACC) and Wells Fargo Bank. He founded and is chairman of Rutgers Packaging Engineering Advisory Board, a member of Industry Advisory Board of the School of Engineering at Rutgers University, and also a member of Board Overseers at the Rutgers Foundation. This year, in addition to Charles Chang and Yue-Sai Kan, the other personalities singled out were FOX Business Network Anchor and Global Markets Editor Maria Bartiromo, hit reality series So You Think You can Dance creator and celebrity judge Nigel Lythgoe, Heavyweight Champion of the World Evander Holyfield, Ambassador David Thorne, Chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs Rep. Ed Royce."
"""Brazil could become our first market,"" Nicolas Geiger, L'Occitane","Premium Beauty News - It's already a long story between L'Occitane and Brazil! Nicolas Geiger - We have been among the first ones to bank on this country by starting a joint venture in 1995 with a local partner. In 2005, the economy began to quickly develop, and both our sales and investments were boosted. We purchased the whole subsidiary in 2009; there were 45 L'Occitane en Provence stores throughout the country then. Premium Beauty News - Where are you up to now? Nicolas Geiger - We have about 100 L'Occitane en Provence sales outlets throughout the whole territory, both wholly owned stores and franchises. Then there are 30 sales outlets for L'Occitane au Brésil; the first store was opened one year ago. This brand is mainly present in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte, but it is spreading fast. Shopping mall managers have got to know us better, and they like us. Of course we do have good arguments, and our best store achieved a 25 % sales increase in 2013. Premium Beauty News - How would you describe the Brazilian market? Nicolas Geiger - Exciting and dynamic, but also complex because it is very closed and competitive. On the one hand, the Brazilian tax system results in huge additional costs for imported products. On the other hand, the market is very concentrated, with large groups such as Natura, Avon or Boticario. Just to give you an idea, the O Boticario brand alone counts about 3,600 sales outlets. So to succeed and make oneself a place among local players, one has to have a real offer to make. Our 19-year experience is a tremendous asset from this standpoint. We have learned a lot, including from past mistakes. In order to keep developing, it seemed crucial to us to produce on a local basis; hence the launching of the brand L'Occitane au Brésil. This was not achieved without any difficulty, especially to find an industrial partner that corresponded to our quality requirements, and who would accept to produce in our current quantities for costs that remained competitive. Anyway, with a 20 % growth in 2013, we are the fastest-growing market in the group. Brazil is currently the 6th or 7th market for L'Occitane, and we aim to make it first. Therefore the next step will be the opening of a research and development laboratory in Brazil. Premium Beauty News - What are your strengths on this market? Nicolas Geiger - Here in Brazil, L'Occitane is traditionally viewed as a toiletries and perfume brand. For instance, our more premium eau de toilette line La Collection de Grasse has experienced a great success, and so has the Cherry Blossom fragrance derived from the ""classic"" line, with only one ingredient highlighted. But our Divine face care cream is also very popular around here: it is part of our Top 5 in terms of sales. However, our strength is more about the story told by our products. We invest a lot in training to transmit and make people share the love of tradition and of the ingredients we use. Brazilian consumers also like the traceability of these ingredients. Premium Beauty News - Didn't founding L'Occitane au Brésil have an impact on the sales of L'Occitane en Provence? Nicolas Geiger - There is a small loss in market share, but these brands do not exactly target the same consumers. L'Occitane en Provence aims at women of 35 and over, whereas ""au Brésil"" targets the 25 and over."
Yves Rocher to open 10 stores in Brazil by the end of 2014,"Premium Beauty News - What are your assets and ambitions for this market? Arnaud Williart - Brazil is the 3rd largest cosmetic market in the world, and it has a tremendous potential, so we had to be there too. It undoubtedly has a very strong inclination toward Cosmétique Végétale®, so since Yves Rocher actives are derived from the botanical world, and their efficacy is claimed by science, our brand has everything it needs to succeed there. Besides, our Brazilian signature is ""O poder das plantas. A Certeza da ciència"": the power of plants sublimated by science. This market should be approached with both humility and determination. This year, we first intend to open about ten stores in large cities such as Sᾶo Paulo and Rio, depending on the opportunities for good locations. We also launched our e-store website on May 1st to cover the whole country's territory: www.yvesrocherfrance.com.br Premium Beauty News - Will they be wholly owned stores? Arnaud Williart - We are already present over there, not via a subsidiary, but through a distribution partner. We do intend to start with wholly owned stores, but given the craze for franchises in this country, they will also be a way for us to develop once our model has been validated. Premium Beauty News - Is the brand already known to Brazilian consumers? Arnaud Williart - The Yves Rocher brand has already made itself a name in Brazil, especially to travelling Brazilians. Some of them already know exactly what they want. Premium Beauty News - Are products made in Brazil? Arnaud Williart - For the moment we stick to an export model, but of course, depending how things go, we have no rule against a local production with industrial partners, starting with heavy products to be transported, in order to reduce the environmental impact. Our decision will be determined by our capacity to have enough volume and set up a local production for reasonable costs. We will sort this out over the next one or two years, I guess. Premium Beauty News - So do prices get higher? Arnaud Williart - Brazil's customs protectionism makes the product registration procedure pretty heavy and costly, which does also make products more expensive. Unfortunately, we do have to pass an increase in logistics costs and import taxes on to the customer, but we endeavour to minimize this impact and keep products easily available. Premium Beauty News - Which specificities are taken into account when selecting the products? Arnaud Williart - In the hygiene category, it has to be noted that the market is towards soap rather than shower gels; that is a first point. As for perfumery, Brazil is the country of body mist, so we have put an emphasis on ranges such as the very floral and fresh ""Un Matin au Jardin"". We are also thinking about developing a specific body mist range. In the segment of skincare, we favour lighter textures to meet the needs of combination and oily skins, which represent a vast majority in this country. This approach is actually backed up by the first results of the UV Beauty Shield, which combines a light texture and an SPF 50 protection. We are arriving in Brazil with the core of our catalogue, that is, 530 references, including the make-up shades. The first feedback from the Morumbi shopping mall in Sao Paulo is pretty good, with our perfumes proving really popular. Premium Beauty News - Do you have a supply chain for raw materials in Brazil? Arnaud Williart - Yves Rocher is supplied by cooperatives and associations in the State of Pará through its Brazilian supply partner, and also supports the organization, training, economic development, and therefore empowerment of local communities. We purchase several materials in Brazil, including organic Andiroba, which is used for instance in a dry oil, such as in our Riche Crème, now a cult product. The Yves Rocher Laboratories have also selected the organic Andiroba nut oil, a true botanical treasure from the Amazon basin. Premium Beauty News - Where will the next stores be opened? Arnaud Williart - We are opening a second store in Sao Paulo in the next few days at the Center Norte shopping mall, and a third one will be inaugurated in early June in Rio."
Aircos: new textures,"Premium Beauty News - As far as Full Service is concerned, you are obviously well positioned? Frédéric Lancesseur - At Aircos, our mission is to offer innovative, customized solutions through our formulation laboratories and, of course, our specialized sites (make-up and injection). From the designing of the pack to the formula including production, our teams can offer a truly full-service make-up range. A solution that oversimplifies the supply chain, reduces development times and offers competitive 'Made in France' products. Don't forget that to complement our formulation offer and propose an innovative technological solution, we have developed a specific back injection process called ""IPM"", from our expertise in plastic injection and make-up formulation. This process allows for the development of new generation formulas combined with surface effects, while maintaining the best in each ingredient. Premium Beauty News A lot of novelties are planned at our stand at MakeUp in Paris? Thomas Sirot - Yes. We have, for the past 3 years, placed innovation at the centre of our development strategy. At the forthcoming MakeUp in Paris on 12 & 13 June next, we will showcase a powder range for a flawless complexion (the Blur range), a new futuristic eyeshadow effect (the Holographic Glitter), a 3-in-1 metal product (the Glossy Metal), and a 3D volume effect to dramatically highlight textures. As for the Blur range, it is a range of loose or compact powders that makes it possible to optically correct skin irregularities. The formula fills in the skin reliefs while reflecting the light from the small hollow of the epidermis in order to illuminate these shadowy areas. As a result, the skin texture looks smoother, pores are tightened and blurred out, small scars are less visible, wrinkles and fine lines are reduced. With Glossy Metal, the metallic trend of podiums is revisited with a multifunctional product. Obtained with the ""IPM"" technology, it is an ultra-creamy texture with an intense and thin film as of the first application. It is truly a fashion accessory! On eyelids it can be used as a halo, a contour or as an up or under liner. It can also be used on lips or eyebrows. Its promise: a very good hold, which does not require an airtight pack. As for our product, Holographic Glitter, it provides a true futuristic effect to give a 3D effect to the eyelid thanks to its holographic glitters. Its creamy, melting texture, obtained with our ""IPM"" technology, enables to achieve an ultra glittery eye shadow with a long hold. Finally, to highlight a featured product or create an animation, again with our ""IPM"" technology, we offer impressive volume effects (half sphere) with very fine details. A plastic grid can also be used to create logos or give specific geometric shapes."
Barcelona creates its Beauty Cluster,"The official launch of the Barcelona Beauty Cluster took place on May 12 in the headquarters of Acció, the agency for the development of Catalan companies. The beauty industry in Catalonia represents about 350 companies (53% of the companies from this sector in Spain) and 4.2 billion euros and 18,000 staffs. The establishment of the cluster is the result of two years of joint analysis and reflection between the industry and the Catalan government, which kick-started this project in 2012. The cluster currently gathers 13 founding members specialising in formulation, filling, brand strategy, packaging and retail - Eurofragance, Carinsa, Ainea Perfums, MartiDerm, Genocosmetics, Bella Aurora Labs, Fit4Ever, Camacho Cosmètics, Laurendor, Teknics, Quadpack Group, CosmeticInMind and BlueMandarine - that account for a turnover of over 145 million and 700 employees. ""Spain ranks fifth among the EU27 producers in the beauty industry, with a market valued at over 7 billion euros. Catalonia yields over half of that, with its high concentration of businesses in the sector. So this is a very active part of the world and we saw an opportunity to set up a cluster, to work together for mutual benefit,"" explains Gloria Prats, cluster manager at Acció. Just like its French alter ego - the Chartres headquartered Cosmetic Valley - the cluster aims to gather the companies of the sector's entire value chain: raw material suppliers, packaging companies, fillers, and manufacturers, etc. The cluster's mission is to exchange knowledge, encourage partnership and promote its members' products within Spain and beyond. ""The cluster's mission is to create an area of commercial cooperation between member companies, with the aim to launch new, creative and innovative projects,"" says Josep Maria Martinez Ribes, CEO of Bella Aurora Labs and president of the Barcelona Beauty Cluster. ""There is so much energy and enthusiasm here and our number is sure to grow. Through grouping companies in the same value chain, we will be able to exploit synergies and learn from each other,"" comments Quadpack CEO Tim Eaves."
Private Cosmetics to develop niche brands in Brazil,"Brazil Beauty News - How do you proceed? Claude Requena - I've been working for a year with my Brazilian partner, Cristiane Vilar, to distribute cosmetic products, make-up lines, nail varnish and perfume ranges around Brazil. We have selected about 20 to 22 brands, including 13 niche perfume brands such as Ann Gérard, Teo Cabanel, Comptoir Sud Pacifique, Mark Buxton, Frapin and Micaleff, which originate from the European and American markets, but also brands from the segments of skincare, like Alorée or Gentlemen's Tonic, and make-up or nail varnish (NCLa), which we have been importing into Brazil since April. Brazil Beauty News - How will these brands be distributed? Claude Requena - Mainly on the big retailer channel, for example through Onofre, one of the main Brazilian retailers. Onofre originates from the pharmacy world and represents a network of about 3,000 sales outlets in Brazil. They have been developing greatly on the beauty market, and also own five megastores in Sᾶo Paulo today, which involves about 1,000 customers a day, and a monthly turnover of almost one million euros. Three other megastores are scheduled to open by the end of the year. They have come to realize there is a significant demand for this type of products, and very few players to meet it. They have found our initiative interesting, so they offered us specific spaces for our various niche brands. We are also launching a very top-of-the-range designed website, cosmopolitandobrasil.com.br, which will soon be operational. Lastly, we are thinking about opening our own sales outlets over the next one or two years, and we are developing our contact network to reach new thresholds. Besides, we have been working on other distribution concepts. Brazil Beauty News - What makes the Brazilian market interesting for niche brands? Claude Requena - There is a real expectation, as can be seen with the demands formulated on our brands' websites. This market is a completely virgin territory, although we are talking about the largest fragrance market in the world. There are 200 million people in Brazil, and the number of people with a high purchasing power is increasing, even outside Sᾶo Paulo and Brasília. That's why it's important to be able to offer them this type of products. They are huge niche brand consumers when they are in France. For instance the Alorée brand, which is part of our selection, has observed Brazilians represent a large part of their customers at Sephora in Paris. As for perfumery, it is just the same. Many high-income Brazilians buy their perfumes in Miami to avoid paying any taxes, but the niche perfume brands they like to buy in Paris are not available there. We are the main importers – not to say the only ones! – of niche perfumes to offer a certain category of Brazilians the possibility to get them easily in their own country. Brazil Beauty News - What advantages do you offer these brands? Claude Requena - Easiness. It is almost impossible to develop in Brazil without a local partner. It can take a very long time before being able to register one's products. And administrative services tend to tighten things and to increasingly practice protectionism. This is going to be very hard for foreign brands to enter this market. My partner is an importer based in Brasília, where the ANVISA has its headquarters. It makes things much simpler with registration issues, which are relatively important in Brazil. There can be many differences between what is written in legal texts and the reality. It's very complicated. Brazil Beauty News - As for perfumes, what type of fragrances do you tend to choose? Claude Requena - We usually select rather floral, fruity, light and fresh scents. For example there is the new Molinard range, or Ann Gérard, whose new fragrance is just pure bliss, and there is also Comptoir Sud Pacifique's latest range, with light ouds which have nothing to do with the strong, lingering fragrances that can be found for the Middle East. We aim at working with rather high-end brands, and though the packaging, concept and textures play an important role, the first thing is to have a brand that provides all the documents needed for registration… and which has a lot of patience. All our partner brands have shown they do. Brazil Beauty News - What are your objectives? Claude Requena - In terms of development, we intend to be present in several big chain stores, with very specific spaces, but also to open our own sales outlets as from 2015-2016, with our own name. These will be specialized in the field of niche perfumery, with a real high-end concept. Development depends on São Paolo and Brasília first. And only then will we have a look at Rio, because although it stands as Brazil's iconic city, it is not where business is done. We prefer to remain very sensible in terms of volume predictions: a turnover of €5 million over the next three years seems conceivable to us, though I think it can go much faster."
HCP ramps up its production capacity in China,"Premium Beauty News - With 4,000 employees, more than $ 200 million in revenue, five plants (three in China, one in the United States and one in Mexico), HCP is a beautiful machine, with operations in the packaging, make–up, skin-care and perfume sectors, and whose main asset remains innovation. You have announced a new industrial expansion in China. A mean to significantly increase your industrial capacity? Eddy Wu - Absolutely. We can speak of a double digit increase rate. Plans are to add 50 injection moulding machines and 10 metallisation and painting lines during an upgrade that will also allow expansion of lean manufacturing programmes. The new expansion will not only give us additional space to expand our capacity but also, maybe more importantly, provide more flexibility for HCP to implement various lean manufacturing production which tends to be more difficult to realize in a traditional packaging factory. Premium Beauty News - A few words about the new aluminium processing unit! Eddy Wu - Yes, we now have at our disposal a new aluminium processing plant which currently employs 200 people and which is located near our existing plant in Huai'an. It covers an area 27,000 sqm (300,000 sq ft). The building itself covers 11,500 sqm (124,000 sq ft). All the moulds are made on site. The plant can produce around 200 million pieces per year and of course is equipped with several automatic and semi-automatic anodizing lines. Premium Beauty News - In parallel, environmental protection is constantly on the agenda? Eddy Wu - We are working hard to reduce carbon footprint through environmental programmes. We use renewable energy sources to produce heat in order to support manufacturing processes and install solar panels and wind turbines in the grounds of the factories to generate electricity. Premium Beauty News - Innovation remains one of your watch words! Eddy Wu - You remember that we have set up a ""Innovation Committee"" in which the senior management of the company meets every month to discuss of the proposed innovation, decide on priorities between different ideas and ensure that the ones selected receive the necessary resources for their implementation. This includes both ideas on new designs and on new features. Premium Beauty News - You have focused in particular on material ""effects""? Eddy Wu - We all have a secret urge to ditch civilisation for a quiet cabin in the woods somewhere. Maybe a plot of land with some plants and flowers and a river running through it too, or at least a babbling brook. And trees everywhere, towering overhead, leaving just enough room to stargaze. These fantasies have inspired our R & D team to bring a little bit of nature back to packaging, with a ""natural wood effect"" and some spectacular ""water effects"". The first one uses real wood pulp mixed with PP base material to create a wonderfully textured and natural grain finish that looks every bit like the real thing. And about the ""Water effects"", we use two different methods, 3-D Droplets and Gelology. 3-D Droplets are formed by a unique manufacturing spray process that creates a droplet effect over metallization leaving a tactile and extremely realistic finish. The aspect an appearance of 3-D Droplets can be controlled to meet specific customer requirements. Great visual effects have been created using ""Gelology"" technology with graphics created by us to give a dramatic ""bubbles"" effect. Premium Beauty News - Are your ambitions in terms of industrial growth in the rest of the world still relevant? Eddy Wu - More than ever! We are working very hard to establish a present in Eastern Europe in the mid-term and potentially in South America as well in the longer term."
Alkos and Cosmogen: Two entities in the same holding,"Founded in 1982 by Gérard Gieux, the Cosmogen company has gradually specialized in high-end packagings for cosmetic products, with as main clients, leading names in luxury cosmetics. In 1998, Gérard Gieux acquired one of his customers, Alkos Cosmetics (cosmetics pencils), and set foot in the formulation market along with the production of cosmetic products. In 2008, with the help of financial investors (Bpi France and NCI gestion), he took over two companies – Intercosmétiques and Sagal (make-up, skincare and hygiene) – that became part of the Alkos Group umbrella. After having successfully developed the two groups in parallel, with operations in France, USA, Brazil and China, Gieux decided to organize his operational succession while keeping a minority stake in the capital and taking the Chair of the Supervisory Board. ""The new strategic plan, the statement details, is mainly based on organic growth, new product developments and international expansion. But acquisitions are not excluded however, to strengthen this organic strategy enabling to expand the product range or complete establishments abroad. The shareholders' aim being to increase the turnover from 64 million euros to 100 million euros in the 5 year to come."" ""A few weeks before the kick-off of MakeUp in Paris, explains Vautier, the turnover of Alkos will have increased by more than 16% in 2013 over the previous year, and prospects for 2014 look very good."" A 2013 year that saw the arrival of new production lines for lipsticks, plastic cosmetic pencils and eyeliners and the complete renovation of the production line for soaps. ""This year, he adds, we will continue to invest in plastic pencils and the conditioning of cleansing products."" Vautier also recalls that ""this excellent performance is due to the 3 million euros that have been injected in the past two years in the Alkos Group and to the work carried out to improve the industrial performance, but also, of course, to the work undertaken to reorganize the sales and marketing departments around the three poles of the Group. A particularly wide product offer covering skincare, pencils, make-up (except powders and polishes), soaps and perfumed deo sticks."" To note, on the occasion of the upcoming MakeUp in Paris, the presentation of industrialized innovations, such as, among others: – A new lip stick, ""Lift & Comfort Lipstick""; the new perfectly balanced great classic, – A novel fluid lip texture ""Fluid Color Sensation"", with a subtle satin film – A full service skincare ""Instant Perfector Eye Zone"" in the innovative packaging, Cosmogen Tense, – The latest generation in the success story of Alkos plastic pencils textures in an Eye Liner version ""Liquidlike EL"", with a ""Wow! "" sensation!"
New ambitions for the Arthes Group,"Already the owner of one of the largest fragrance production plants in southern France (75 maceration tanks, 7 fully automated filling lines for a capacity of 120,000 bottles per day), the Arthes Group has invested nearly one million euros for the construction of a cosmetic formulation laboratory and for the opening of a cosmetic workshop for its skincare products. Investments took place over nearly a two-year period. Priority was given to the opening of the R&D lab, which is operational since September 2013 and enables the group to achieve its own formulas for skincare products and toiletries (shower gels, body lotions, creams, face, hand creams, etc.). The second step concerned the creation of a cosmetics workshop complying with GMP standards. The company opted for a clean room, with a gowning room for operators, an air tunnel at the entrance to prevent contamination, and a water osmosis unit for the entire conditioning process. Operational from May 2014, the new room is equipped with a 1000 litres reactor for the mixing of raw materials, a 500 litres boiler to facilitate the use of fatty materials, an industrial laundry for the disinfection of utensils, a hot and a cold group to vary the temperature of the water, a reverse osmosis (900 litres/hour) and a 4000 litres water reserve - to constantly have water osmosis available and finally of a filling line. So far solely focused on the production of perfumery products, the Arthes Group now has its own in-house equipments for the formulation and packaging of skin care products. Investments that follow the successful launch of the Jeanne en Provence brand, two years ago. Just one short year after its launch, this line of perfume waters, toilette waters, body care products, and home fragrances intended for the mass market, was present on the store shelves of 300 outlets in France, with specific wood displays set up in the beauty section, and was exported to Japan, South Africa, Algeria, Australia, Belgium, Ecuador, Finland, Paraguay and Tunisia. The success of the Jeanne en Provence brand is emblematic of the strategic realignment of the company, who celebrated its 35th anniversary in July 2013. ""First intended for the production of low-price, made in France perfumes for export markets, ten years later, the Arthes Group decided to set foot in supermarkets in France,"" explained Aude Genesté-Barera, Marketing Director. ""In addition, since 2011, the Private Label division of Arthes serves the needs of fashion and retail brands seeking to make their own perfumes,"" she added. Today, this - constantly growing - activity represents about 15% of the group's turnover. In 2013, the Arthes Group's private label division achieved, among others, the launch of a fragrance for one the leading drugstore chain in Germany, and the development of candles and home fragrances for a famous French home decoration retailer. Eventually, the group's strategy - which employs around 100 people and is present in a hundred countries and 3,000 outlets in France - seems to be a winning one, with a sales increase of 11% in France in 2013, and significant market share gains in mass perfumery, despite a difficult market environment. In 2013, while total sales of mass market fragrances declined by -0.2% in France, Jeanne Arthes grew by 9%. The global turnover, meanwhile, has remained stable despite the difficulties of south-European markets in which Jeanne Arthes is very present."
Fiabila opens a factory in Brazil and increases its investment in the United States and France,"It's official, Fiabila, the French manufacturer of nail polish, has acquired a factory in Brazil of more than 7,300 sqm on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, close to the international airport. ""Production start-up is scheduled in three phases,"" explained Pierre Miasnik, CEO. ""As of next July, tinting processes will be operational. The implementation of packaging lines and then the manufacture of bases will follow in the following weeks and months."" An important milestone for the French company considering that this region is the second largest market behind the U.S., in terms of nail polish consumption. ""Which doesn't stop us, from continuing our investments in France and in other parts of the world,"" highlighted Pierre Miasnik. In the United States first, where the French Group, who already owns two plants, has recently taken possession of a new building to house its packaging lines and which will be operational by the end of this year. In France too, where the Group, as part of a proactive environmental policy, has just spend the tidy sum of twelve million euros for the extension of the Maintenon site. Storage tanks with a total capacity of 450,000 litres were installed for the distribution of solvents and polymers replacing for the latter, a former supply system relying on 200 litre barrels. ""This means much more efficient, secure and clean logistics, explains Pierre Miasnik, which makes it possible to source our polymers using road tankers, to fully automate transfers carried out in a closed circuit to limit the release of VOCs [1] in the atmosphere. All VOCs will be captured at the point of emission and oxidation–treated before there are released in the atmosphere. An environmental effort, accompanied by a number of other decisions, like for example, the use of raw materials of plant origin."" The company, which will be present at Cosmoprof, will take the opportunity to present its new website. ""A website, insists Pierre Miasnik, that will reflect what our daily work is made of, namely an ongoing quest for creativity and quality."""
Luxcos: more than 25 new mascara formulas in April,"Luxcos was founded in 2003 to diversify the IL Cosmetics group's product offer. The company is specialized in the manufacturing of mascara, liquid eyeliners and lipgloss for European customers mainly. It is focused on two areas of activity: bulk sales, and the full service offer in partnership with Interpack, the conditioning unit of IL Cosmetics. Since it was founded, Luxcos has kept on developing, and has achieved a two-digit yearly growth on average over the past few years. The 2014 turnover should reach about 10 million euros. ""The first investments were focused on the R&D department, to which we dedicated 20 % of our personnel. Two innovation areas are destined for the development of new formulas and the optimization of the packaging/formula combination. Product performances are indeed closely linked with the effective interaction between the various elements within the system. This is particularly true for mascaras, but also for eyeliners and lipgloss"", underlines Christophe Delas, Director of Luxcos. Efforts and investments in R&D materialized in 2013 with the granting of a first patent for colour intensity enhancing agents in mascaras. Two new patents are already planned to be registered this year, including one next month. ""As for mascaras, customer requests mainly focus on 'volume + additional effect', just like for 80 % of market claims,"" explains Christophe Delas. ""They also concern quick transfer to eyelashes, hence the importance of the research work done by our packaging engineer on optimum combinations. Besides, we have organized collaborative work – without any exclusive contract - with most European packaging suppliers in order to offer a wide range of possibilities to our customers."" However, Luxcos also develops other types of formulas, such as wet-effect formulas, or others which are adapted to specific make-up removal methods (such as water make-up removal at 38° C). ""As for waterproof mascaras, which represent 15 to 20 % of the market, we have gained a real competitive advantage on all the effects sought after: volume, longlash, curl, multiple effects or all-in-one,"" he adds. In order to adapt its developments to market evolutions, Luxcos also invests in the understanding of customer needs, in particular through the organisation of panels representing the various types of eyelashes (Caucasian, African, Asian, depending on the particular needs of the developments). ""We aim to offer a whole range of formulas and formula-packaging combinations which can meet all types of customer expectations, since women's eyelashes and make-up rituals are all extremely different. We have indeed found out there is no perfect mascara likely to suit all consumers alike, which undoubtedly explains the multiple, diversified brand offer. These conclusions made us develop a great number of systems. As a result, more than 25 new mascara formulas will be available as soon as April this year."" The marketing department jointly works for more efficacy with the R&D department and packaging suppliers to enhance these systems. Luxcos has grown stronger with their 10-year expertise, and can now rely on the synergies between the various services involved (laboratories, production unit, sales department and marketing department), which is facilitated by a settlement on a unique site in Luxembourg. Luxcos now intends to focus human investments on the sales department to support the growth of the company in terms of market shares. ""We are also going to work on our future bulk production unit as part of an increase in our capacity. We will have the opportunity to talk about this in a few months,"" concludes Christophe Delas."
L'Occitane au Brésil goes worldwide,"The two concerned ranges are based on two native Brazilian plants: jenipapo, a fruit tree from the Cerrado, and vitória régia, a water lily that blossoms only at night. The Jenipapo collection includes face and body products with fragrance and sun protection, such as a roll-on perfume oil, an SPF30 face mist, an SPF15 lip balm, an SPF15 body oil, and a transparent soap bar. The Vitória Régia collection consists of a daytime line (eau de Cologne, shower gel, body milk, hand cream and transparent soap) and a nighttime one (eau de Cologne, flower-shaped soap and transparent soap). To design the packaging of its new limited edition products, L'Occitane founder Olivier Baussan enlisted the help of two Brazilian artists: Joana Lira and Andrés Sandoval. Already available in Brazil, these new products will arrive in France and in other L'Occitane stores around the world from April 16 and will be sold through the end of summer at prices ranging from €4 to €48 (around US$5.50 to US$66.50). L'Occitane, which has been present in Brazil for almost 20 years, has started last year to produce in this country the brand L'Occitane au Brésil, with the aim to overcome trade barriers and increase its local presence and thus to develop its sales in this country, which is viewed as a keystone of the company's growth."
Aroma-Zone gets settled on a 500 m2 area in the heart of Paris,"The new Aroma-Zone store welcomes its customers in a wholly ecodesigned environment which consists of a 300 m2 sales area on the ground floor, and a 50 m2 training area as well as a 150 m2 customized treatment area on the various other floors. The store counts 1,500 references, including about 200 essential oils from all around the world, ingredients dedicated to DIY cosmetics, and the ready-to-use skincare range. There are also a chemist, two advisers, and five digital search points to meet demands according to people's needs - such as ""devitalized skin"" - or to a keyword, including the localization of articles in the various departments: customers can thus easily find their way around and select their products. With the possibility to exchange, get some advice, benefit from a cosmetic bar with free demonstrations, or enjoy a relaxation and reading area, this place espouses both a customized and educational approach. The programme of public and professional workshops, which will take place in the training area, strengthens contact with customers. Each participant can prepare one or several recipes of natural, ultra-fresh skincare products in groups of 8 to 12 people, supervised by a naturopath or a biochemist, and then leave with their own formulations. Personalization and customization are also part of the spa's uniqueness. A digital diagnosis, the sensorial organ of textures, a 300 ingredient base, the olfactory or musical choice for your treatment area, the bright atmosphere rendered by a variety of lights in chromography… all these elements mingle to offer an original whole for every customer to build themselves a truly unique protocol according to their needs, tastes and expectations. Five treatment areas with star-studded vaults and bright, natural colours create a cocoon effect that cannot but make everyone indulge in serenity. Aroma-Zone was founded by Pierre Vausselin and his two daughters in 2000, first as an informative website, and later as an e-store dedicated to essential oils from all around the world. It stands out for the irreproachable quality of its natural products, which are rare and made available at the right price. In 2006, the website developed their do it yourself offer and gave access to over 1,000 cosmetic DIY recipes, together with a rich catalogue of raw materials, containers, utensils, and eventually finished products. The year 2014 marks a new turn for Aroma-Zone with the opening of this new, unusual area, which should soon establish itself as a reference. ""If the concept of the store-spa as we have just opened one works well, we will indeed be able to think about the same type of place in other cities in France and around the world,"" says Anne Vausselin, Managing Director and co-founder of Aroma-Zone."
Faber-Castell Cosmetics: innovation and personalization,"Premium Beauty News - You are at the junction of two fiscal years. What are your comments on the past year and what do you expect from the one to come? Stefano Castelletti - Regarding Faber-Castell Cosmetics, Brazil continues to be extremely dynamic with a growth of over 40% compared to the previous two years. We also performed well in the United States with a growth of over 20%, destined to continue particularly in the premium segment. Conversely Europe, like its economy and an ongoing crisis, will have remained a little behind. As for Asia, and particularly China, it is clear that this country remains a future market for us. Brands are starting to emerge and there is a real shift upscale. To enable us to be competitive, these two criteria are essential. We have three factories in Indonesia, one in Malaysia and one in China and consequently, we are extremely well equipped to deal with local market requirements. Premium Beauty News - What is your outlook in terms of development and positioning of Faber-Castell Cosmetics? Stefano Castelletti - What we are experiencing in developed countries is quite revealing of what a company like ours should aim at. We can clearly observe that classic brands have the wind in their sails again and that at the other end of the chain, consumers are asking for ever more innovation and especially personalization. Not only must our products be flawless but they must also provide a real added value perceived by the end consumers. At the formula level, of course, but also concerning their application tools. Our teams are focusing a lot on this at Faber-Castell Cosmetics, i.e. on the megatrend ""personalization"", on which we strongly believe and for which we will be presenting new and interesting concepts. The interplay of innovation, fashion trends, engineering and manufacturing together with the international market dynamics are a real challenge for the management of a B2B company in the cosmetics sector. Our industry has been and continues to be characterized by strong personalities and entrepreneurship, who have implemented their success with knowledge, experience, intuition and charismatic leadership. Premium Beauty News - Are some of the sectors where you are investing, more promising than others? Stefano Castelletti - As everyone knows, eye make-up is very promising at the moment. We are moving with this trend and plan to significantly increase our production capacity in the area. But eyes are not the only sector of interest. Lip make-up is also very dynamic with a true revival of lipstick for the years to come. Again we will support demand with not only an increased production capacity for everything that has to do with lips, but always with a desire to innovate. Latest product to date is SIMPLY RED XXL, a mat lipstick with a specific formula to achieve a moisturized and 5h long-lasting look on the lips, which creates an ultra-rich, even colour without feathering. It is available in the classic wooden Jumbo pencil or in the new Chubby Mechanical Pencil. Further novelties of our new spring collection ""No Limits!"" are: – COOL CATS: a deep black 12h liquid liner with extra-long tapered tip and a cream kajal with intense finish which we will showcase in our new airtight Combo Stick. – FLUO LIPSTICK: lightweight neon colours that create a radiant glow under UV-light. – METALLIC CHIC: long-wearing eye- and lipliners with high iridescent pearl pigments and a smooth, even glide. The wooden pencils are refined with a special metallic lacquer and a pure chrome finish. – BLUSH UP: a lightweight, moisturizing cream formula for lips and cheeks. Hyaluronic acid, vitamin E and Dermaxyl® prevent and smooth wrinkles. The Super Jumbo provides a convenient one-hand application. – With MIRACLE NAILS we developed a premium care with rich natural oils and vitamins that restores the moisture balance and deeply hydrates nails and cuticles. It is available as Nail Fluid and Nail Serum with a non-oily feeling. – And let's not forget our Trend Colours 2015. Premium Beauty News - Faber-Castell Cosmetics has launched its new internet site last week. What's the benefit? Stefano Castelletti - The new site features a multitude of useful updates and navigational improvements to make the on-line experience even more user-friendly. Right from the start you will find all the latest news, such as fair guides, new product information, press releases and more. And as registered customer, you can take full advantage of our exclusive content that takes you deep into the world of Faber-Castell Cosmetics. We look forward to seeing you on-line at www.fc-cosmetics.com."
Strand Cosmetics Europe: a new step,"Premium Beauty News - First changes this year at Strand Cosmetics Europe, with your forthcoming appointment, Eric, to an operational position as the Managing Director and you Dominique, with the intensification of your commitment in R&D. Éric Bouvier - Yes, the Board of Strand Cosmetics Europe decided to reconfigure the management team to suit the new development goals that we set ourselves in terms of turnover increase, extension of our industrial activity and internationalization. Dominique Bouvier - And for my part, my personal investment will be fully focused on research and innovation. If we look back at the thirty-four past years, we can be proud – with all the teams at Strand – of having built a sound company, with one of its important milestone being the transfer of our activities in 2001, on the current site of La Source in Lentilly. Premium Beauty News - At the age of 53, Éric Bouvier, these responsibilities are in line with your career… Éric Bouvier - Indeed, both my training and professional experience stick well to the goals we have set ourselves. I am a Doctor in Pharmacy; in 1993, I graduated with an MBA degree from the Management School of Lyon and did a stint at the London Business School. Professionally, I was President and CEO of a NASDAQ listed U.S. company, BG Medicine, a start-up specialised in the diagnosis of heart disease. Prior to that, I led Leica Microsystems in Germany after being Deputy Director General of the BioMérieux Group in charge of the Immunoassays and Human Resources global division. A Group in which I also acted as President of the subsidiary in the United States, BioMérieux Inc., Vice-President of the ATU (Advanced Technologies Unit) and President of Apibio. Premium Beauty News - Sport also holds an important place in your career and your encounter! Éric Bouvier - You are right once again, since in 2000, I was the CEO of Occade Sport (creation of the website, Le Club du Sport.com) based in Caluire in the Lyon region. I also took part to two Olympic Games in 1988 and 1992 with the French volley ball Team. And everyone knows the sporting career of Dominique. It's actually near the sports courts that we met more than 35 years ago. More than a necessity, sport is a philosophy that conveys a lot of positive concepts - concepts which, for some of them, are fully applicable to the corporate world. Premium Beauty News - Your forthcoming appointment as CEO of Strand Cosmetics is in line with your commitment, and that of your equity partners, in the development of this company you acquired in 1980. What are the next steps of this development? Éric Bouvier - Indeed I actually know the company very well and the company knows me well too. I took part with Dominique and our shareholders to all the phases of recovery and development of Strand Cosmetics Europe. The work that was undertaken by all the teams in the past years is remarkable and fantastic. May I recall the main pillars that support this development: Creation/Innovation, Quality/Regulation, and Internationalization. Thanks to them, we have become one of the European leaders not to say the world leader in our field. Our name and our expertise are acknowledged worldwide and we intend to increase our export share from 32% to more than 50% in the next five years, by reinforcing our activities in Asia, Brazil but also Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the Middle East. Accounting for 60% of our sales, make-up remains the spearhead of the company, with a significant portion coming from foundation. We also gained significant market shares with powders and lipsticks. The skincare activity has grown steadily. We packed a total of more than 9 million units last year. Premium Beauty News - Your ""pharmaceutical"" experience comes into play at the right time! Your forthcoming investments prove it. Éric Bouvier - Well, as you know ...., according to the good old saying, ""there's no time but the right time"" As you know, the boundary between make-up and skin care products, not to mention health products, has never been so narrow. Market demands are heading towards that direction and we have decided to follow the trend. Hence a new building will soon be built from the ground up, on our La Source site at Lentilly near Lyon and it will complement the existing 8,200 sqm. It will host very ""Medical Device""-oriented OTC premises and with of course an FDA certification. To note that on the regulatory side we are going to get the ISO 14000 and ISO 18000 certifications. And as you know, we obtained the ISO 9001 certification more than a decade ago and the ISO 22716 certification three years ago. Premium Beauty News - The concept of team is a key component for you? Dominique Bouvier and Éric Bouvier - Essential, indeed! It is through dialogue and respect for the given word that we can build a lasting relationship of trust, a key element for the success of any team, in both an entrepreneurial or sport environment. Strand Cosmetics Europe employs today more than 140 people with an average age under 38. One third of the staff comes from reputable regional schools or universities (engineers, pharmacists, chemists, microbiologists, computer specialists, colourists, galenists...). We spend a lot on training (three times the legal requirements). We have an entrepreneurial and very ""German"" vision of the business. We favour development and long-term sustainability by building on strong relations of partnership with our customers and suppliers."
Nail polish: U.S. company Keystone and its Polychromatic division are investing,"Premium Beauty News - A company whose history goes way back? And a family business too! Cary Robinson - Yes, absolutely! The history of Keystone dates back to 1898. The company was bought by my father in 1968, almost half a century ago, at the time it employed thirty people for a turnover of $ 4 million. Its main activity was focused on the production of monomers and polymers for the dental sector, with a strong R & D expertise in these technologies and the industrial quality requirement associated with this sector. Then, thanks to this technical cross-disciplinary expertise, the company gradually began to move towards the fast growing segment of nail gels, where we filed significant patents. This was our first encounter with the cosmetics industry where, in no time, we became one of its leading and acknowledged actors. It is indeed important to stress on this historical mastery of monomer and polymer production, because it is on this core activity that we managed to built our expertise, bring talented teams together, build our learning curve up to marketing. Hence, today, we can legitimately claim providing a real ""plus"" in the manufacture and marketing of nail polish. Our strategy is based on strong technological advances, a highly reliable and qualitative industrial tool (GMP, ISO, Pharma), breakthrough innovations, combined with a differentiated marketing offer to support our clients. Premium Beauty News - What difference does the ability to manage these manufacturing processes precisely make? What is actually the ""plus"" that you bring in the designing of nail polishes? Cary Robinson - We have brought considerable progress in the development of nail polish. For example, I can tell you that we were able to improve very significantly the four functional parameters - which are Adhesion, Brightness, Application, Drying - both through our know-how in formulation with our expertise and the added value of new ingredients, and the manufacturing processes. On adhesion, which is a parameter for which demand is often unsatisfied, our results are exceptional and - in accordance with our strategy of technological sustainability - protected by a strong patenting policy. We also invested particularly in stability issues to reduce consumers' perceptions of poor quality, I am referring to syneresis, and sedimentation. Concerned about market expectations for coloured products, like some pastel shades, and also nail care products, we have also managed to develop a new technology that reduces the risks of yellowing of nitrocellulose over time. With this know-how and technology, we are also capable of meeting new requirements, which are important, concerning care products in the nail care segment. Premium Beauty News - You have launched a consistent investment program! Cary Robinson - If we put together the financial efforts already made in the United States and those to come in Europe and Brazil, it indeed makes a lot of money. In the Pennsylvania plant where we produce nail polish and offer an ""Open Lab"" of active development and dedicated to our clients for the past six months, this represents some US$ 40 million to which must be added five million in The Netherlands and the same amount in Brazil. To note that we invest for both gels and nail polishes. Today, we export from the United States about 40% of our production, two-thirds of which go to Europe with Germany on top of the list of customer countries followed by Italy. Russia is an important market for us as well as the Middle East and China. Premium Beauty News - The investment is just as important in R&D? Cary Robinson - That's right! 20% of our staff is dedicated to R&D. Our teams, our high-tech equipment, the constant search for new more efficient manufacturing protocols, lab surfaces, are all very important. This is the core of our original knowledge. We draw our DNA from it, for the sole benefit of our customers. We redesigned our in-site lab at Gibbstown to integrate a dedicated area for our customer so that they can stay in permanent touch with the developers during the creation phase and for the latter to better keep track of the customer's requirements. We have a very competent and talented cross–disciplinary team in both the manufacturing field, and the marketing area. While the appeal of the nail polish market's high cycle has led to many changes in capital during the last three years, the strategy of a family business like Keystone, which is part of an ongoing process, offers through its investments, its high capacity, and its innovations, a new growth driver in nail polish. We had conceitedly claimed, but also in a spirit of challenge, ""Reinventing nail polish"", we reached our goal on the nail gel segment; today in the more traditional nail polish segment, the performance and the differentiation of our offer are such that we want the profession to take advantage from it, starting with the forthcoming Cosmoprof in Bologna."
Strong growth for Weckerle in the United States,"With this relocation, Weckerle increased twofold its filling capacity in lipsticks. In addition to increasing its production capacity, the company also equipped itself with R&D capabilities and reinforced its sales force. Meanwhile growth has only accelerated. After experiencing a rise of over 30% in recent months with the arrival of new manufacturing and filling equipments, officials expect another similar increase in the next two years. From just a little more than 30 people on average, the staff can jump to nearly 150 when demand is high. ""The production of lipstick remains our main workhorse,"" explained Mauricio Pachon, General Manager of Weckerle USA. The year 2013 saw the commissioning of a new machine that is already in operation and for 2014, we are increasing further our capabilities with a very versatile filling unit. A growth that can also be explained, according to officials, by the Group's ability to adapt to changes in demand. ""Our production capacity can very quickly be transferred any place in the world where the Group is operating and our customers know it,"" explained Mauricio Pachon. To sustain its growth, the firm also builds on its innovation capacity, particularly in the area of multi-component products. ""We are putting in place all the fundamentals to maintain and sustain our turnover growth for Weckerle USA in the next three years,"" highlighted Mauricio Pachon."
L'Oréal : net sales on the rise and record operating margin,"""2013 was another year of robust growth for L'Oréal. The Group achieved sustained sales growth and, in a market whose expansion was more moderate in 2013, accelerated its outperformance versus the market,"" said its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jean-Paul Agon. In 2013, the French group's sales amounted to 22.977 billion euros, an increase of +2.3% compared to the previous year. The like-for-like sales trend of theL'Oréal Group was +5.0% and +6.0% at constant exchange rates. The group's growth was driven by the L'Oréal Luxe (+5.3%) and Active Cosmetics (+4.9%) divisions. According to the group, the L'Oréal Luxe division (Lancôme, Yves Saint Laurent, Giorgio Armani, …) grew significantly faster than the market, in all geographical areas. For instance, Lancôme's La Vie est Belle established itself as a top seller. Travel Retail, which will form its own division in 2014, also outperformed the market. As far as it is concerned, the Active Cosmetics division (Vichy, La Roche Posay, SkinCeauticals, …) strengthened its position as the world leader in the dermocosmetics market. The Professional Products Division (Kérastase, Matrix, L'Oréal Professionnel, Essie, …) recorded growth of +2.1% like-for-like and -1.0% based on reported figures in a channel that was still affected by declining salon visits in the mature markets, but remains dynamic in the New Markets. Eventually, the Consumer Products Division posted growth of +4.9% like-for-like and +1.5% based on reported figures. ""The Division is outperforming the global market and winning market share,"" comments [1]. Strong growth in ""New Markets"" In terms of geographic zones, Western Europe (+1.1%) remains a strong basis for the group and North America (+2.8%) keeps on growing, despite that the market was less dynamic than in 2012. Growth in the ""New Markets"" remains strong, approaching or exceeding the double digits like-for-like. However, reported figures are negatively impacted by currency fluctuations (-3.7% for the whole group). In the Asia-Pacific area, L'Oréal recorded annual growth of +8.4% (+9.5% excluding Japan) like-for-like and +2.2% based on reported figures, despite slower growth in China and India. In Latin America, L'Oréal recorded growth of +11.5% like-for-like and +3.7% based on reported figures. In Eastern Europe, sales increased by +8.2% like-for-like and +4.2% based on reported figures. Regrading Africa and Middle East, sales increased by +14.3% like-for-like and +9.0% based on reported figures, reflecting the good performances of the new subsidiary in Saudi Arabia, strong growth in the Gulf states, Egypt and Pakistan and the recent acquisition of Interbeauty in Kenya. All the Divisions recorded double-digit growth in 2013. Lastly, profitability reached a record level in 2013, with an operating profit of 3.875 billion euros, representing 16.9% of sales (up by 0.4 points). ""The quality of these results illustrates the Group's ability to continue to deliver sustainable and profitable growth. We are starting 2014 with confidence, driven by our mission of 'Beauty for All', the power of our research and innovations, the strength of our portfolio of complementary brands and the globalisation of our major brands. In an economic context that is still marked by uncertainties, particularly on the monetary front, L'Oréal is confident in its ability to outperform the market once again in 2014, and to achieve another year of sales and profit growth,"" concluded Mr. Agon."
REN Clean Skincare partners with Nocibé to grow in France,"Created in London in 2000, REN Clean Skincare is now distributed in over 30 countries. As far as the turnover is concerned, the UK remains the brand's largest market, followed by North America (U.S. and Canada) and Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway, Sweden). In France, while not being negligible, the distribution of the brand remained rather modest until now. REN was available in some Parisian concept stores like Colette, Nose, Oh My Cream, at the Bon Marché department store in Paris, in a dozen Galeries Lafayette, in Paris and across France, as well as in about thirty independant retailers. ""The French market is very difficult and highly concentrated,"" explains Mohamed Rezal, the brand's international business development manager. The new partnership with Nocibé will allow REN to be distributed in 367 additional points of sales. At the heart of the brand, is the so-called ""clean"" formulation technology. ""Clean"" is precisely the meaning of ""ren"" in Norwegian or Swedish. The concept consists in selecting the ""safest ingredients"", preferably but not only natural substances, and to focus on efficiency and to turn to available high-tech solutions. ""It's not herbal tea, but it's clean,"" says Colette Haydon, the French cosmetologist behinds the products' formulations. Shortly speaking, REN's recipe for success lays in three words: performance, purity, pleasure. However, Nocibé explains that, beyond the technical performance, REN was also selected for its price accessibility. REN Clean Skincare offers a range of more than 40 face and body care products, intended for both women and men, for both mature and young skins. Among the brand's best sellers are: – the Evercalm range, for sensitive skins, formulated to minimize allergic risks, that help to fight redness and all the inconvenience of sensitive skins, – the Bio-Retinoid anti-wrinkles range that delivers retinol results without irritating effects, – the Keep Young and Beautiful SH²C Serum, formulated to keep skin looking smoother, firmer, younger and more radiant, – the Glycolactic Radiance Renewal Mask, a potent bio active peel mask designed to renew the complexion, reduce the appearance of fine lines and dramatically improve skin tone within 10 minutes, Next March, the brand will add two new references: V-Cense Revitalising Night Cream, based on essential Boswellia Carterii essential oil, an active known for its incense smell and relaxing properties, and V-Cense Youth Vitality Day Cream, also based on Boswellia Carterii, to fight environmental stress and prevent and minimize the signs of premature ageing. REN will also launch next May, V-Cense ""Flash Rinse Intensive 1 Minute Facial"", with boswellic acid, magnesium and stabilised Vitamin C."
"""Ethical sensitivity should be matched with the act of purchase"", Betty Santonnat, COSMEBIO","Premium Beauty News – What is COSMEBIO's main mission today? Betty Santonnat - Our top priority is to support natural and organic cosmetic brands, especially by promoting our labels. The COSMEBIO association, which was founded by about ten laboratories, now gathers more than 400 members, 90 % of which are French, but which also come from everywhere around the world. The rise in the number of members came naturally, along with the increase in consumer demand. We have aimed at contributing to the growth of this market since the beginning by providing clearer information to consumers and defining what ""organic"" is in cosmetics. We have enhanced the development of standards with specialized organisations, Ecocert and Qualité France/Bureau Véritas. To benefit from the COSMEBIO label, products must meet the requirements of these standards, and manufacturers must be members of our association, and therefore respect our charter, which imposes additional commitments, in particular on the ethical level. We also demand a true commitment: for a brand to become a member of our association, at least 20 % of the product range must be certified. Another important mission for us consists in supporting and professionalizing our members who, for example, must take part in at least one training session among those offered by COSMEBIO. Our ambition today is also to promote our label worldwide. Premium Beauty News - Weren't you disappointed by the growth of the organic cosmetic market? Betty Santonnat - The growth of this market was strongly supported in the past few years, and it paved the way for the emergence of many brands and for the development of a great number of innovations. Today it is still growing, although the pace has slowed down a bit. Disappointment comes from the small market share of natural and organic cosmetics, which does not exceed 5 % in France, and rarely more elsewhere. The priority for brands is to capture new customers, and the COSMEBIO association must support them to this aim. Consumers' strong sensitivity towards ethical and environmental issues should be matched with the act of purchase. Organic cosmetics still suffer from early disappointments, when consumers used to conventional textures and formulas might have been surprised by natural products which sometimes failed to offer the same textures as their competitors. However, today the quality of formulations has greatly improved, in particular because more organic substances are available to laboratories. People just don't know about what natural and organic cosmetic brands actually propose, and they are often prejudiced. It should not be forgotten that most of these brands, 85 % of our members, are SMEs or very small companies that cannot afford mass advertising. That is why our role is even more important. Our collective actions aim at showing organic cosmetics can seduce. They used to be presented in much too technical terms. Premium Beauty News – Was launching the Nat label in September a way to counter these received ideas? Betty Santonnat - It's a way to meet a new need of the market. This label is based on the new COSMOS standard, which harmonises the different European labels. COSMOS makes provision for a ""natural cosmetic"" category, which still does not really exist in France today, whereas it is already well-established in Germany. Organic issues acted as a trigger and enabled to raise awareness of the problem. However, their impact on people's minds and on brands was much stronger than its actual market share. For some consumers, it is a choice that is viewed as ""extreme"". The natural market seems a better growth driver, but it still remains to define what natural is, and generate confidence by eliminating greenwashing. That is what the Nat label aims at. To benefit from it, products must comply with the technical specifications of the COSMOS standard, and manufacturers must share the values of the COSMEBIO ethical charter by becoming a member of the association. For organic as well as natural products, certification remains the only reliable guarantee for consumers. These products meet actual needs. They are more sustainable, have a lower environmental impact and are also reassuring for consumers."
"""The market is shifting from colour to texture,"" Romualdo Priore, Chromavis","Premium Beauty News - How is the integration of Chromavis within the Fareva group happening? Romualdo Priore - For Fareva, the acquisition of Chromavis is a new experience. Although the group has made numerous acquisitions during the recent years, Chromavis will be the first independent entity within Fareva. Actually, the two companies are very different with very distinct product portfolios. Fareva is a strong filler and contract manufacturer, in particular in the skincare or aerosol fields. Chromavis is renowned for its innovations and technological products in colour cosmetics. Furthermore, Fareva has a large international network with strong manufacturing capabilities; these are strong assets and real opportunities for the development of Chromavis. Eventually, Fareva owns manufacturing sites that are OTC approved by the US FDA and this is an important advantage for developing sales in the US market where most of the make-up products have SPF claims, and are therefore classified as OTC drugs. Premium Beauty News - The acquisition of Chromavis is also the opportunity for Fareva to enter the nail polish market. Romualdo Priore - Indeed, in 2010 Chromavis acquired Durlin France, one of the world's leaders in the development and production of nail polishes. Durlin had a catalogue of high quality products and we brought our strong marketing culture to them. Premium Beauty News - What are your latest innovations? Romualdo Priore - Based on our expertise in baked powdered products, Chromavis is the world's leading producer of these kind of products, we recently launched Metamorphosis a new kind of formula, more creamy, providing increased transparency and a second skin feeling. Actually, the market is shifting from colour to texture, seasonal collections are no longer the norm."
Hapsatou Sy refocuses on product ranges,"Premium Beauty News - At the very beginning of your adventure, there was this original conception of ""global beauty"". How does the HapsatouSy brand position itself today? Hapsatou Sy - We had launched our brand as a beauty salon brand via a stand-alone network, first as Ethnicia, and then as HapsatouSy. Very soon, we started developing several hair and skin care brands, such as Ethnicia and HapsatouSy, followed by Artisan Make Up and Dazzia. We have been working for many years in the development of these brands, and the liquidation of the salons network made us rethink our whole strategy and to focus on the development and marketing of our own products. On the model of what we made in the salons network, all our brands consist in an offering of products adapted to all the various types of beauty. The point was to counter a sort of ghettoization, which tended to force black, Maghreb, Asian or mixed-blood women to look for other brands or sales outlets than those found in traditional networks. This never sounded logical to me! Some white women have very curly, even frizzy hair, and complexion differences are considerable both for so-called black and white skins. I did not want to reproduce the segregation I had known. That's why we still offer products that are adapted to particular types of hair (dry, brittle, curly, etc.) or skin, but not to types of people. We are going on with our adventure by following the same concept, but with new distribution networks. Premium Beauty News - What lessons have you learnt from this experience? Hapsatou Sy - The compulsory liquidation of our activities with beauty salons was obviously a traumatic period, but in the end it was positive for our brand because there were actual problems of coherence within our network. This is what is tricky with a network of franchisees, you sometimes have to deal with businessmen and women with strong personalities, who have their own vision of the development of their activity. Today we devote our whole energy to the development of our four product lines: Artisan Make Up, our makeup brand, which counts more than a hundred references, Dazzia, a brand for professionals specialized in hair smoothing techniques, Ethnicia, a nail polish and beauty product brand with affordable prices, and HapsatouSy, which is a high-end brand comprising hair care and skincare products. Premium Beauty News - The growth of these brands will depend on the development of new distribution networks. Hapsatou Sy - Our products are currently available on the new HapsatouSy online shop, which we thoroughly rethought and relaunched on November 18, 2013. American e-store Doobop.com has also been selling the HapsatouSy and Ethnicia brands since October 15, 2013. This site, which is one of Oprah Winfrey's favourites, is destined for all beauty types throughout the world, and highlights the richness of diversity. It perfectly suits our philosophy. HapsatouSy, Ethnicia and Artisan Make Up products have also been available on Brandalley.fr since November 25, 2013. Of course, increasing our sales also depends on a physical sales outlet network in France and around the world. We are already distributed in about fifty points of sale in the USA and in Africa (Angola, Ivory Coast, Gabon and Senegal). We often receive requests from pharmacy networks, and we should soon open in about a hundred new sales outlets in the French overseas departments and territories. Obviously, the development of these partnerships must be achieved in keeping with each one of our lines. As for HapsatouSy in particular, we destine this brand for selective channels. It aims at active, urban women, with a core target between 25 and 40 years old. It is an affordable high-end brand. Premium Beauty News - Are you thinking of reopening your own new concept stores? Hapsatou Sy - No, not at all. Our top priority is to develop new products and reinforce our brands."
Ancorotti Cosmetics: sales over 20 million euros in 2013,"And yet in 2009 things were looking less rosy, when the greatest economic crisis to hit the Western world in over seventy years was just beginning. ""My daughter and I realised the potential of the mascara market,"" says Renato Ancorotti. ""All the surveys show that if there's just one product women really have to have it's mascara! Mascara is also a very complex product to manufacture with a lot depending on the applicator used. There's a very close bond between the two. That's why brands demand greater security of supply and a total quality guarantee. And this is precisely what we offer."" The company has clearly not skimped on its industrial resources to meet these needs. In four years, its number of production and storage units has risen from one building in a Crema industrial zone to seven covering 10,000 m². And that is set to grow still further next year with the addition of 3,000 m². Ancorotti Cosmetics counts no less than ten filling lines, and increased its capacity to 30,000 units per day just a few weeks ago. ""Mascara is still our spearhead, and represents over eighty-five percent of our current business,"" says Renato Ancorotti, ""but we also rely heavily on the back injection technique to produce eyeshadow."" The Italian firm has invested several hundred thousand euros over the past few weeks in the implementation of this technique. Nine machines with a total capacity of 40,000 parts/day now work together in one of Crema's seven buildings. And it's not over yet. Not only does the company intend to increase its influence in other niche make-up markets (powder, foundation, etc.), it also wants to continue expanding its geographic footprint throughout the world. Especially since, in terms of production capacity, there is room for manoeuvre with more than 20% still available. ""I have to admit, requests are pouring in from everywhere,"" says Renato Ancorotti. ""Almost 80% of our customers are based in Europe, but there is huge potential in other continents. Which is another reason why we make they very most of the marketing opportunities opened up by the trade shows developing overseas, such as MakeUp in New York and now MakeUp in Seoul."" The firm prides itself on its sales presence in some twenty countries worldwide, and rightly so. To this has been added Ancorotti SkinCare, whose production unit based in north Milan will be transferred to the Crema site in the coming weeks. ""Here too, development prospects are particularly bright,"" says Renato Ancorotti. ""We expect a 47% increase in 2014 and almost 60% next year with a sales target for 2015 expected to approach 3.5 million euros."""
Mascara Plus: strong growth in 2013,"Premium Beauty News - So you were right to move to Inzago! David Chant - Yes, absolutely! The operation cost us 3 million euros, which is a heavy investment for a young company like ours, but we had no choice. The plant has a total capacity, depending on the number of production hours, of more than 30 tonnes per month, sometimes as much as three times that. And the filling workshop has a capacity of 75,000 pieces a day. We also have our own brush production line with an output of 60,000 brushes per day. Premium Beauty News - One of your strengths remains your search for new formulas. David Chant - One of our latest developments is our mascara, which you're familiar with, composed of two different formulas with different viscosities that are mixed just before application. We're also working on other brand-new formulas, which we'll probably be presenting at the next Cosmoprof in Bologna and maybe at MakeUp in Seoul too. Our chemists and R&D departments are constantly researching natural materials to develop the most innovative mascaras. After thorough research, our chemists conduct compatibility testing through emulsifying trials, before then performing quality control on the chemical-physical parameters (pH, viscosity & density) of the finished product. Once stability testing is complete, Mascara Plus' laboratory sends mascara bulk to external labs for microbiological testing and chemical quality control. Depending on what service the client wants, for example a bulk, bulk & filling or full service, our labs perform the necessary compatibility testing of the applicator, packaging in respect to the bulk. In addition to the aforementioned laboratory, we opened our second laboratory in Thailand several months ago, which explains why we are so interested."
Make-up: FSKorea is investing in a new sponge manufacturing plant,"FSKorea's new plant is located in Hebei, Cangzhou city, China and with a surface of 8,800 sqm formatted to produce some 30 million units per year (NBR, SBR, Cotton Puff, Flocking, EPDM, Cellulose). To note that the plant is using toxic-free sponge (latex free) materials with a toxic neutralizing agent. Amount invested: one million dollars. A new production plant for this Korean company which comes in addition to the one that produces more than 100 million mascaras per year and to other plants in Asia and even in Belgium that produce brushes, compacts, airless packagings and eyeliners. ""FSKorea,"" explains its President, J.K. Hwang, ""is a company that built its prosperity through innovation and creativity. We are constantly looking for new ways to meet and exceed customer requirements in terms of design. Our teams also provide turnkey packaging development solutions, while maintaining a precise control of the budget and draft according to the set deadlines."" Since its inception in 1988, FSKorea remains indeed a model of its kind in terms of development. That year, the firm with only 10 people, was manufacturing its first brushes in a small factory to achieve a turnover of USD 230,000. In 2000 the company posted a turnover of USD 12 million and with a staff of 400 people! In 2005, a fourth plant for the manufacturing of brushes emerged, also in China, north of Beijing and a fifth on in 2007. During the year 2009 the Research & Development Centre was created in Seoul. In 2010, the Head of FSKorea decided to acquire a metal processing plant with a staff of 150. Last year FSKorea will have seen its sales reach the USD 40 million mark."
LVMH gives a new dimension to its perfumes and cosmetics R&D,"Approximately 250 researchers today, nearly 300 in a near future, 1,200 new product formulas developed each year and a portfolio of 200 patents: LVMH Recherche is spearheading the development of the French luxury giant in the field of perfumes and cosmetics. The inauguration on November 18 of its new premises, located on the site of the Parfums Christian Dior plant, in Saint-Jean-de-Braye, near Orléans, emphasises the importance of perfumes and cosmetics within the group's global growth strategy. With 55 hectares, the site of Parfums Christian Dior is one of the largest areas dedicated to perfumes and luxury cosmetics in France. On this site, the new Helios research centre gathers most of the research and development of the brands Parfums Christian Dior, Parfums Givenchy, Guerlain and Fresh, and also develops products for Kenzo, MakeUp For Ever, Aqua di Parma or Benefit Cosmetics. Its 18,000 sqm are distributed in a set of six three level buildings forming a perfectly equilateral triangle. LVMH has invested over 30 million euros in the construction and development of this new centre, which is fully operational since the end of October. Over 20 key areas of expertise are gathered on the site, including molecular and cell biology, physical chemistry, ethnobotany, sensory analysis, formulation and histology, as well as safety and efficiency control, regulatory compliance, sensory evaluation and market trends monitoring, among others. Located in the heart of the Cosmetic Valley, a cluster gathering about 300 members - of which 78 % are SMEs - and 7 universities, and covering seven departments across three regions (Centre, Haute Normandie, Ile- de- France) in France, Helios will also be one of the two entities of the Skinovalys project, the other being the University of Orleans that will focus on basic research. Specifically, the centre will allow researchers outside the LVMH group, academics, but also from start-ups and small and micro businesses, to find in a temporary shelter for the completion of their experimental projects and thus benefiting from Helios' the state-of-the-art equipment (electro-microscopy devices, cell culture materials, genomic targeting tools, etc.) at interesting prices. Applications to join the programme will be centralized by the Cosmetic Valley. Beyond the regional level, LVMH Recherche also boasts numerous partnerships with universities in France (Bordeaux, Paris VI) or abroad (Modena, Shanghai, Stanford, Zurich), or with independent experts, particularly in the field of ethnobotany . On the occasion of inauguration ceremony, LVMH managers confirmed its next development steps, in particular its interest in completing its portfolio with another skincare allow the group to better meet the needs of Asian customers. However, according to Reuters, Antonio Belloni, Group Managing Director of LVMH, would consider that Clarins, which is often mentioned as a potential target, is a too big prey. The group would favour a smaller brand offering strong development opportunities. Nevertheless, the group is giving priority to organic growth, including the development of is Fresh brand in Asia. The American bath and skin care brand joined the LVMH group in 2000. Fresh now has 15 own stores worldwide and its products are available in many prestigious points of sale around the globe, including North America, China, Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore."
IL Cosmetics is gaining momentum!,"At the forefront of the novelties showcased by IL Cosmetics: a last generation of formulas that enables to solve all the stability issues which mostly affect export markets. To note also the launch of a new technology which enables to optimize the key parameters of a polish: an improved glide upon application, an improved uniformity for a smoother finish and, in addition an enhanced brightness, an improved shine for visibly brighter shades. Not to mention a range of formulas dedicated to glitters, covering all the needs in this segment. ""You mustn't forget that for glitters to remain stable and in suspension, additives used had a tendency to make the formula murkier. It was a real challenge to achieve this type of transparency. With an ever increasing level of requirements these past years, we must also deal with often conflicting demands, like for example getting both a good product suspension and bright, transparent polishes, and with increasingly shorter drying times!"" explained Aurélie Ignaccolo, Marketing Manager. But that's not all! In addition to the doubling of its production and conditioning capacity for nail polish, IL Cosmetics has announced the construction of a new building which will be fully dedicated to the production of make-up products and will be operational in late 2014. A building which, according to officials, will be at the forefront of technology as far as good manufacturing practices are concerned. ""In the course of these two years,"" explains Ignaccolo, ""the group will have invested a total of between seven and eight million euros."" Main customer markets for the company, Europe followed by Asia, the United States, Latin America and Turkey. ""But it's definitely on the American continents – North and South – that we will focus our efforts in the coming months,"" she said."

"""There is a lot of quality and depth in British beauty brands"" Séan Harrington, Elemis","Premium Beauty News - How does Elemis size up against the competition in the premium beauty industry? Séan Harrington - Elemis is one of the leading British beauty brands with a turnover of £75m (about 90 billion euros) in 53 countries. In the UK, we have reached a strong position of influence and market share. The past five years have seen our best performance, despite the economic downturn. Pre-Elemis, I experienced many ups and down, including going through receivership, which taught me what not to do. So in 2008, the signs were there for me and I remodelled the entire business, dropping headcount by 30% and stripping back the cost base. In 2009, we were able to deliver profitability and from there built a very lean business. I believe that emerging brands can react quicker and appeal to the undecided consumer during uncertain economic times. The boom years tend to favour the bigger corporations. Premium Beauty News - What is the potential for British beauty brands overseas? Séan Harrington - It's been a really exciting time for British brands over the last three years, following the Royal Wedding, which was conducted with class and humour and the Olympics that combined competition with creativity. Great Britain is perceived as having heritage and considered trustworthy and principled, not just in the world of beauty, but in fine fragrance, aromatics and technology in beauty. There is a lot of quality and depth in British brands. It's a fantastic time to sell overseas. When I travel overseas I see that British brands are well represented. Asia is crying out for whatever Britain can throw at it and the emerging markets in India and Russia are also keen to have British brands. Through our association with Steiner Leisure, Elemis has 160 spas on cruise liners and 85 in resorts. But you can't succeed abroad until you have a level of success at home. This is something we are working on, but it can be challenging when you are working with different cultures, languages and time zones and there is a lack of awareness for your brand. It's only sustainable if you have the resources to support your brand. Premium Beauty News - What is your strategy for retail vs spa? Séan Harrington - Elemis is a multi-channel business and our spas and beauty salons represent 50% of our total. I wouldn't want the percentage spa represents to be any bigger. The remainder is divided into thirds between retail, online and QVC. We were one of the first beauty brands to launch on QVC and have been number one for the past 18 months. Since our launch on QVC in 1994, there have been no peaks and troughs, just a continuous upwards growth. We do 20% of our business in department stores and deliver a range of services aimed at getting consumers to spend time at the counter and to visit our stores more frequently. In October, a new counter opened in the refurbished Debenhams store on Oxford Street offering a whole new image, which is forward looking and incorporates a lot of interactivity. The game plan is to put a big investment into retail, regenerate the offering in high street beauty salons and invest in e-commerce. Premium Beauty News - Which are your most successful product lines? Séan Harrington - Product development is incredibly important for Elemis and we have fantastic innovation coming through with exclusives for QVC and ecommerce. Our largest franchise is Pro-Collagen, which has been extended with several new lines and lots more development planned. It takes a long time to find something that good. The hero product is Pro-Collagen Marine Cream which is ten years old and has entered the canon of beauty greats. There were 52 formulations for Pro-Collagen before we achieved what we wanted, which is an anti-ageing formula packed with ingredients, including three different types of seaweed and liposomes of gingko biloba which galvanise the micro circulation of the face. Today, it's the only anti-ageing skincare line with collagen sold on airlines. Premium Beauty News - What is Elemis doing in beauty salons that is innovative? Séan Harrington - We looked at mobile phone technology which is capable of carrying so much data and thought how we could apply this to machinery in salons, which still tends to be very large and cumbersome. Next year, we will launch a new 5-in-1 treatment machine in salons called Biotec. Noella Gabriel, director of UK sales, training and new product development, has been empowered to create a new treatment menu for Biotec that incorporates the best from the world of high-end skin care technology. Biotec is the next generation of Elemis professional treatment facials including lifting and toning to light therapy and an ultrasonic peel that works as an alternative to microdermabrasian. Techno beauty for in-home use is a huge and fast-growing category. We've looked at the success of Clarisonic and at the end of next year will be introducing our own version designed to complement Elemis in-salon treatments. Premium Beauty News - What is your goal for Elemis? Séan Harrington - To double our turnover in the next five years. I have a clear plan and know where we can do it and how to make it happen. We are still growing, learning, emerging and aspiring - these are all words I like to use."
USA: The Color Factory changes its name to Cosmetic Group USA again,"Premium Beauty News - The company that you helped create more than twenty five years ago is enjoying a complete revival? What happened in recent years and how far has your company gone now? Judy Zegarelli - The Company was founded in 1984 in Marina del Rey, California by Alfred Booth and me. The company moved to Sun Valley California in January 1990. In 1997, we sold the Company. Then the Company changed names to The Color Factory and changed hands several times, mainly to financial holding companies, until the arrival of its new current owner, Jonathan Mitchell, an entrepreneur who decided to support us in the revival of the Company and gave the management of the Company to Andrea Chuchvara. The consequences of this new impetus given to the Company by the current team are obviously huge. Between 2012 and 2013, we simply doubled the turnover. Thanks to investments made possible both through the personal involvement of Jonathan Mitchell and also the firm's newfound health, the renewal of the fleet of machines has become a priority. Premium Beauty News - And you chose to go for the name of origin? Judy Zegarelli - That's right! Cosmetic Group USA was a perfect name. It has at least the advantage of being clear and to show our abilities. And on top of it, it is one of the mainstays of a positive past that we are currently reviving.

We have added to our already extensive equipment list a new fully automated lipstick machine using state-of-the-art silicone moulds, a new six colour powder press machine, two new patent pending machine processes. Our next target in two years' time, a new plant."
"From the sponge to the ""turnkey"" applicator","Main production units, Korea, of course, with headquarters just a few minutes from the Seoul International Airport, but also China. More than 80 people in the first unit and +300 in the second, Sponge & Puff World (S&P World) will achieve this year a turnover of twenty million dollars. Main markets, Korea with about 40% of sales, followed by the U.S. (25%) and Europe. (20%). ""Today, explains James Moon, Commercial Director, what matters for us is to offer and sell a sponge or a powder puff with its applicator or it support, on a turnkey basis. The markets of sponges or powder puff alone are extremely competitive and the number of producers is on the rise."" This means lots of innovations to come up with for this major Korean player in his field. ""Innovation has become a second nature,"" agrees Moon. ""We never stop devising on the shape a new sponge or a puff will take for such and such applicator."" The company has also developed a network of partners specialized in plastic injection with whom it develops new make-up cases and applicator concepts. Latest innovations to date, a whole range of rollers fitted with small cylindrical sponges but also Pen-Tip/Brush applicators for lip gloss, eyeliners or eye-shadows. Not to mention Brush-on-tubes and, of course, a variety of powder jars. ""You couldn't believe the shapes we invent every day for our sponges!"" we were told at S&P World. ""In fact,"" stresses Moon, ""the leading position we have acquired over the years can be explained by both the quality and consistency of our products but also the flexibility and timeliness of our deliveries. The concept of 'time to market' is also our everyday philosophy."""

""Of course it requires being wisely undertaken,"" agrees Ferrari. ""Innovation is first the concrete result of a good anticipation of consumer demand. And that's precisely where the difficulty lies. How to nose out and properly conceptualize the underlying trends in the four corners of the world where tastes and colours are different? We must go beyond the simple material innovation. For a large part, psychology and culture come into play. We're working on it."" For the head of Intercos, ""aside from market vision, what matters the most is the ability to anticipate and innovate but also increased responsibilities within the company as well as the industrial response."" An industrial response concretely translated today in the field, with among others, the actual commissioning of the Brazilian plant with a production surface of 10,000 sqm, dedicated to the manufacture of the whole product range (powders, lipsticks, emulsions etc.), but also with the doubling of the production area of the Group's Chinese factory (+ 12 000 sqm). ""Industrial choices that also often mean making difficult decisions,"" explains Ferrari, ""but which are mostly driven by changes in demand. The latest example is the transfer of our pencil activity from Europe to Asia. Industrial strategies are not an exact and set science. Because the greatest asset of an industrialist remains his ability to quickly adapt to market changes. What was true yesterday may be less true today and totally different tomorrow. Today the market trend is prompting us to invest globally, including, for example, in the development and production of packagings, particularly in Asia."" To be continued..."
Crystalmoda: a new factory,"A new milestone for Dario Moretti, the CEO and main shareholder, who decided to fully devote himself to the development of Crystalmoda after recently selling to the Lumson Group his packaging activity, Modapack. ""Made in Italy, when it comes to cosmetic formulas is more than successful,"" he says. ""In this field we have the industrial and human skills coupled with an almost ancestral expertise. And this is a well known fact abroad!"" The newly completed 5,000 sqm factory can already produce some two million pieces per year of make-up powders. A figure which will jump to 25 million next year and more than 30 million in 2015. ""Powder is currently our core business,"" explains Moretti, ""but we can also rely on a production capacity of 8 tonnes/month for the production of lipgloss, mascara, and lipstick, among others."" Between 2014 and 2017, the financing plan is projected to inject each year some 500,000 euros. The factory is already GMP compliant and in the process of obtaining ISO standards. ""We are also about to integrate several new production machines,"" adds Moretti. ""Demand is growing more and more. From 5 million euros in sales at the end of this year, our activities will enable us to exceed the 8 million euros mark next year. And this is only the beginning. Some foreign customers, with several of them in the United States are just waiting for our production capacities to grow."""
Success paves the way for new ambitions at Alkos,"Alkos Cosmétiques, Intercosmétiques and Sagal merged into the Alkos Group in 2008, shortly before the financial crisis. The group then had to manage both structuring and the significant decline in the sector's activity. However, today all lights are green in terms of turnover growth and results. This year the Alkos Group has exceeded their targets as sales have risen by +16 %, and their 2013 turnover should reach more than €43 million (€37.4 million in 2012). As for 2014, the aim is to maintain a two-digit growth, partly with the good results obtained on the cosmetic pencils market (+20 % compared to 2012), due to exports in particular, and with the success of Intercosmétiques with lipsticks, the Jumbo Twist Mania and new major launches (+15 %). Sagal has also taken off (+24 %) with their translucent soaps, among others. The group is now reaping both the benefits of the patient work done with activity structuring and integration, and ""the results of the efforts made in quality and manufacturing, with two new site directors hired"", specifies Florence Lefeuvre, the Sales and Marketing Communications Director. The three entities that form the Alkos Group today were well known in their own specific sectors, yet the group's identity remained to be defined when it was set up. ""Our first task consisted in developing a commercial and marketing approach by relying on the three companies' synergies. The group's product offer is particularly rich, with full ranges in skincare and makeup, except for powders and varnish, and also comprises soaps and stick deodorants. It was an asset from the very beginning, but it all had to be structured"", Florence Lefeuvre explains. As soon as she took up her post in 2011, she got involved in implementing the commercial tools required for presenting and promoting a global offer. The company also invested in communication and participated in many trade shows to strengthen their reputation. As for sales, the Alkos Group has relied on the various assets of its three entities. ""Beyond the synergies and complementarity of product portfolios, we mainly aim to develop manufacturing know-how for the global quality of our formulas, but also to focus on details, getting to know our customers, listening to them and meeting their specific needs"", adds Florence Lefeuvre. The development strategy also requires significant investments in the group's strengths. Among the products concerned are lipsticks, for which the group has invested in a third hot filling line, cosmetic pencils, with a second, fully automatic filling line for plastic pencils to be inaugurated this month, and eyeliner pens, with the purchase of a second filling machine. All in all, more than €2 million were invested in 2013, and this pace is to be maintained in 2014, with the possible purchase of a third filling line for plastic pencils, and a second automatic filling line for waterproof retractable pencils. ""What we want is to meet demand and be able to do credit to the markets we have won in the best conditions possible, with actual partnerships with our customers"", underlines Florence Lefeuvre. While some companies are leaving Europe, Alkos is proud to have restored profitability and achieved a two-digit growth, and has announced their teams will be strengthened as soon as the end of the year. ""As producers of plastic and wooden cosmetic pencils for more than 50 years, our ""made in France"" mark guarantees quality and is thus more and more highlighted, affixed near the logos of French brands that listen to their customers and are more and more sensitive to it"", Florence Lefeuvre explains. The Alkos Group has thus reached their goals by ""making different cultures merge in the same project"", stresses Dominique Vautier, CEO. Shareholders and customers trust the group, which can now look ahead and even consider a possible coherent acquisition in terms of product and/or geographic complementarity. The group is indeed still strongly focused on the French market, which globally represents about 70 % of their activity. To be continued…"
Jean Patou reinvents itself,"It was a kind of sleeping beauty. Since its acquisition by Procter & Gamble, the brand had gradually slipped off the radar of beautiful fragrance lovers. Then bought by British company Designer Parfums [1] in July 2011, Jean Patou now offers Joy Forever a modernized reinterpretation of the brand's legendary fragrance Joy and relaunches three of its previous creations, Chaldée (1927), Eau de Patou (1976) and Patou pour Homme (1980). ""The brand's portfolio was so wealthy that we deemed not necessary to initiate a completely new creation,"" explained Bruno Cottards, Vice President. With this in mind, Designer Parfums chose to reinvent the brand by focusing its efforts on two issues: – the modernization of Joy , the best known and most emblematic fragrance of the brand, by offering a version for today's women, – the revival of some 50 fragrances created by Jean Patou, with the aim to launch three new fragrances per year. It took some time to restart the brand, which had been integrated into a major industry giant and thus needed some reorganisation. ""In particular, we had to fully reorganise the supply chain,"" said Bruno Cottards. The tricky task consisting in reviving the spirit of Joy into a new juice was entrusted to Thomas Fontaine, the new perfumer of this prestigious fragrance house where famous names such as Henri Alméras, Henri Giboulet, Jean Kerléo, and Jean-Michel Duriez have been working. With Joy Forever, Thomas Fontaine launches a fragrance ""more accessible and better adapted to contemporary lifestyles."" Top notes feature bergamot and mandarin with galbanum. The heart is made of marigold, rose de Mai and jasmine echo Joy but are complemented by iris and orange flower notes. Base notes feature: cedar-wood, sandalwood, amber and white musks. ""Thus, the cohabitation of Joy's rose and jasmine is made more easily accessible. Joy Forever is a kind of initiation, which then may lead the consumer to test the original fragrance,"" said Thomas Fontaine. Joy Forever comes into three sizes (30ml, 50ml and 75ml). It will be launched in the selective distribution network in approximately 1,000 points of sales in France. Joy Forever's bottle was developed by Verreries Brosse, the cap by RPC France and the secondary cardboard packaging by Landerer (Autajon group). Jean Patou is also reintroducing three of its classic fragrances, which form the first part of its Heritage collection, thus attempting to reconnect with its roots and the tradition of French haute perfumery, but targeting the community perfumery enthusiasts. The three fragrances - Chaldée, Eau de Patou and Patou pour Homme - will be available in 100 ml bottles from November in France, in niche and high end perfumeries and at Le Printemps. The bottles of the Heritage collection were made by Saverglass, the wooden caps by Technotraf, the pumps were provided by Aptar and the secondary packaging cartons were manufactured by Prestige Packaging Industries (PPI)."
Topline Products: a plant in Europe within one year,"It is now certain, even if the details of the operation have yet to specify: Topline Products should get, within one year, its own production unit in Europe. According to Topline Products, several options are being considered, including an acquisition or the building of a new unit. The goals: to be closer to customers, to control production, costs, lead-time and quality. The operation should also help Topline to strengthen its positions on the skincare and fragrance markets. For this company, which was founded in 1975 as a trader of packaging, it will be the culmination of its transformation into a global manufacturer. Topline Products, which is headquartered in Wayne, New Jersey, set up its first factory in 1995 in China. The company, which now has more than 1,000 employees worldwide (speaking no less than 14 different languages), has sales and technical offices in Europe, the United States, Brazil, and Asia, as well as four production units in the United States (Dundee, Michigan), Mexico (Reynosa) and China (Tianjin and Shanghai). ""We are strengthening our position as a global supplier, able to meet the demands of global customers,"" said Charles Chang, the founder and CEO of the company. ""Today, our core competency is the expertise in customized package executions, including plastic moulding (injection, bi-injection, injection blow moulding, extrusion blow moulding, in-mould-labelled packages), metal stamping, injected metal (zinc alloy and aluminum), finishes (hot-stamping, silk-screening, pad printing, metallization, anodization, electroplating, heat transfer film), rapid prototyping (in-house production tool and unit cavity tool development), cosmetic pens and other complex delivery systems."" In practice, Topline's strength is to be able to transform the concept presented by the customer into a final industrial product. ""Most of our customers come with a design concept and entrust us to finalize and execute it,"" added Charles Chang. Furthermore, Topline's marketing and formulation teams can proactively contribute to the brand creation process to propose and advise clients on trends, choice of formulas and offer guidance on feasibility. The company has its own team of R&D and formulation experts with full knowledge of the latest regulatory issues, and operates its own industrial sites dedicated to formulation and filling in Asia and North America, including assembly operations for secondary packaging. Since its beginning, Topline Products has focused on innovation and has invested in the development of its facilities. In close partnership with brands, the company creates solutions that bring added value in terms of product delivery systems, functionality and differentiating design. As of today, Topline Products has over 40 active patents worldwide. Among the latest innovations, let's mention a patent pending compact with an innovative one hand action ""push and slide"" opening. This focus on innovation, combined with its industrial know-how, now allows the company to rely on a portfolio of prestigious clients such as Burberry Beauty, Lancôme, By Terry, YSL and many more."
"Rusi, the German firm is gaining momentum!","Premium Beauty News - We can say that you are now reaping the fruits of the reorganization work undertaken for the three past years. Klaus Sindel - Our growth has exceeded 7% last year and we expect 11% this year. And don't forget that we inaugurated in Bechhofen, just a year ago our new 2,500 sqm production site which therefore comes in addition to the existing 6,500 sqm. And we will have finished building a new storage centre of 1,500 sqm in November. Main objective at the time, increase by 15% our production capacity for mascaras, lip gloss and eyeliners, and also further develop our lacquering line with a capacity of 15 to 20 million pieces per year (a 1.5 million euros investment). We also increased our decoration capacity (hot stamping, screen printing, pad printing, etc.) by about 30% (20% through the recovery of the industrial tool of Sun Creative Cosmetics and 10% by investing in new equipment). To date, we have thirty injection machines and a brand new 80-tonne press should be delivered to us in the coming days. Among the other consequences of this set of decisions, we worked on optimizing logistics flows, stepping up quality standards, reducing reaction time, increasing customer proximity and optimizing project management. All in all, one of our key strengths today at Bechhofen stands in the full integration of the manufacturing process. Premium Beauty News - How is your activity broken down between the different products you manufacture? Thomas Hübner - Today, we can say that we have a total production capacity of approximately 70 million pieces per year which is broken down between mascaras, lip gloss, lipstick tubes, and other products, but in which the Mascara has the major percentage. One of our latest innovations, to be launched in the coming days, our new ""Beth Mascara"", a model that we will be showcasing at Luxe Pack Monaco and which suits perfectly the current trend for larger sizes (16-18 ml). Premium Beauty News - Can we speak of a revival of lipstick? Thomas Hübner - We can actually say that. We are starting to feel the benefits of the take over of Schmidt & Niedermeier in 2010. We can rely for this activity on more than 250 plastic injection moulds and Rusi invested some 350,000 euros to upgrade them. Demand is growing stronger. We have a production capacity of nearly 400,000 pieces per week. And, of course, we are working on new models coming from new pending patents."
"Pierre Miasnik, Fiabila ""Be and stay one step ahead!""","Premium Beauty News - Not everyone can claim being a nail polish manufacturer? Pierre Miasnik - When a market is growing strongly it always looks attractive from the outside and seems easy enough to tackle. But regardless of the country in which we carry out our activity, safety and regulatory aspects limit the possibilities of a high level of production. To produce a few dozen tonnes in a few hundred square meters is easily manageable but to produce several thousand tonnes in thousands of square meters requires getting authorizations, which are always difficult to obtain and result in particularly high investment costs. To ensure the full traceability, as required by regulations, of several hundred tons of flammable liquid every week, enables to understand how such amounts are reached. We were often asked to extend our business to other products, but we preferred using our investment capacity to strengthen our position on our market. Productivity, production capacity and product safety involve significant investments for a product, where profitability comes from volumes and to achieve these volumes you need to be particularly competitive. The important position that we hold in many markets with our French company and our subsidiaries have allowed us to validate sustainable sources of raw materials and to strengthen our purchasing at a global level. Today, the consolidated turnover and volumes achieved by Fiabila put us well ahead of the industry, not to mention our quality level recognized worldwide. Premium Beauty News - Practically and industrially speaking, where do you stand today? Pierre Miasnik - I was already given several opportunities to speak in your columns. And your readers already know part of the story. Examples include investments made on our site in Le Perray en Yvelines concerning high-speed filling lines (zero defects!) suitable for mass production. We can also mention the gradual replacement of our slower lines in our other site in Plaisir. We can also mention the opening of our second production site in the United States and the commissioning of our first filling line in China with our partner Shya Hsin, preceding the commissioning of a tinting line scheduled in September. Finally, I can tell you that we will be operating in Russia by the end of this year and that our future establishment in Brazil is rapidly progressing. Ah! I almost forgot... our new factory in Japan will also be operational by the end of 2014. Premium Beauty News - A progression that takes place in a very specific context. Pierre Miasnik - Quality and safety are and always have been decisive aspects for Fiabila. Our trade has evolved significantly in recent years. We have to constantly adapt ourselves every day. In a few months we had to significantly strengthen our regulatory support team. To meet the various legislatures around the world, we need very precise information. Do you know that we have to deal with more than 2,000 different raw materials, with have of them almost daily! The greater the concentration of our customers, the greater their requirements. Environmental, safety and quality aspects have become so strategic and vital that we have forced ourselves to build very performing teams in all these areas. To give you a picture, do you know that our industrial investments for environmental matters in our French units represented an amount exceeding 12 million euros over the past few months. But it is not just industrial investments. We have also invested heavily in men. A new Director of Operations has joined us. A new Marketing Director is being recruited. We also strengthened our team in the colour and product development department. It is very important today to anticipate marketing developments and thus, the industrial and logistical consequences they entail. It is all about managing the future in a more conceptual way."
Oriflame wants to boost sales through innovation and a better organization,"After experiencing a growth rate of nearly 15% per year during the 2000s, Oriflame saw its momentum stopped in its tracks by the 2008-2009 crisis. Since then, sales have stagnated, with a turnover approaching € 1.5 billion. To find a new lease of life, Oriflame has repositioned its brand under a new slogan ""Your dreams - Our InspirationTM"" and signed a contract of international representation with actress Demi Moore. But the Swedish giant specialized in the direct sales of beauty products, founded in 1967 by brothers Jonas and Robert af Jochnick, can also rely on other assets. Oriflame can first build on a strong capacity for innovation. Its R&D centre in Dublin, Ireland, designs each year more than 400 new products for the global market. Its 160 researchers and technicians from 14 different countries, have an accumulated experience of 927 years! Other strong point: an impressive sales force. Oriflame can rely on 3.4 million independent consultants (90% of which are women) located in more than sixty countries, including 1.8 million in its flagship market: CIS countries and the Baltic region. Oriflame has operations on every continent except North America. Recently the group set up a new remuneration scheme for its consultants in the CIS with the aim of boosting sales. ""Oriflame wants to maintain its position in its flagship markets and increase its presence in Africa, Asia and Latin America,"" explains Johan Rosenberg, Executive Vice President Global Marketing and R&D. The group's business model makes it particularly suited to developing countries, where beauty products are less accessible due to an underdeveloped or ill-adapted distribution network. Among noteworthy launches planned for the month of September 2013, the new Ecollagen cream, which is based on natural ingredients originating from the Swedish countryside while taking advantage of the benefits of stem cell cultures. For Alain Mavon, Skin Research Director at Oriflame, ""this allows using very little plant material and increases without limit research opportunities since even protected plants can be used without causing any damage to the existing flora."" Another novelty for the fall season, the new Colour Drop lipstick with a grape shaped like a water drop. According to Jonas Wramell, the Company's Global Beauty Artistic Director, the idea was to replicate ""the shape of the lips for a perfect application."" On the side of hair care, Oriflame has focused research on the ""health"" of the scalp. The new formula in the HairX shampoo was designed around a ginger derived component, 6-Gingerol, selected for its ""anti-oxidant, soothing and purifying"" properties. The group has also announced a series of measures to be implemented during the last quarter of 2013 and early 2014, with the aim to improve time to market, increase the efficiency of catalogues and promotional campaigns, while improving the company's overall efficiency. Oriflame will first create four new sub-regional structures (Central Europe, Western Europe, Turkey, Africa) to take a better account of local specificities and particularly of the markets' various degrees of maturity. In parallel, the EMEA structure will be reduced. In the same vein, the creation and production of product catalogues will be managed by the new sub-regions to better ensure their adaptation to the needs of the concerned markets. Other measures are aimed to streamline costs: a better distribution of responsibilities, a greater centralization of purchases at a global level, the further integration of information technology tools at the back office level. These efforts, according to the group should help generate savings of 15 to 20 million euros."
"IL Cosmetics, continues to invest","IL Cosmetics (International Lacquers, Luxcos, Interpack), a producer of nail polish and make-up products, also offering a turnkey service via Interpack is continuing its investments to cope with a significant growth of its operations. The group expects to increase twofold its turnover by 2016. IL Cosmetics has significantly surpassed its objectives over the past year with an above-market growth, particularly for nail polish, a product whose sales should remain robust. In this context, after an average growth exceeding 25% over the past five years, the Luxembourg Company expects to double its turnover by 2016 to reach 120 million euros, against 52 million in 2012 and a forecast of 63 million in 2013. To meet the increase in business, IL Cosmetics will continue its efforts in terms of investments. The group has acquired a new packaging plant, which will be equipped to be operational in early 2014 and which will help double its overall packaging capacity to reach 200 million units per year. In addition, consolidation in R&D is continuing. The number of employees dedicated to this activity was quadrupled in two years and will reach 35 people end of 2013. The research and development laboratory of International Lacquers is organized into specialized teams for each type of product: basic research for formulation, innovation, special effects associated with pearls and pigments, nail care, raw materials, colouring solutions. IL Cosmetics is making significant investments in R&D, is growing faster than the market and, as a service provider in the area of nail polish, now ranks world's number two."
Nail polish: Major shifts!,"A series of announcements following, one may recall, the takeover, a few months ago, of one of the largest U.S. player in the industry, Kirker Enterprises, by the group, also American, RPM International. New deal of the cards, concentrations, this sector continues to be highly coveted. And for good reason! The consumption of nail polish has exploded over the last ten years in the world but also in France. The annual growth rates of this product are quite enough to make any entrepreneurs' mouths water. We are witnessing a real ""nail polish mania"", with an increasing number of buyers (20% of French women, for example), and with increasing quantities (2.4 units per buyer). On the side of the Intercos group, the takeover of its colleague, DropNail is not a surprise. Dario Ferrari, the CEO of the Italian group, had never made a secret of his interest in the sector. Nail polish remains an important niche in the make-up sector. Drop Nail srl is actually a new player in nail polish who has established itself two years ago in the area of Crema. Its 1,500 sqm production unit boasts to date, a production capacity of 1,800 tonnes/year or 180 million units/year. For Dario Ferrari, ""with the arrival of this company specialized in the production of nail polish, we will be able to fully use the synergies that exist between us. DropNail will thus be able to benefit from both our global industrial presence (Europe, United States, Asia, Brazil), where we are going to invest in filling lines, and also from Intercos' capacity for research and development which, as you know, is significant. As far as we are concerned, we can rely on a very effective industrial tool whose capacity is fort the time being totally satisfying. We can also take advantage of their good commercial presence in Brazil."" As far as the French group Fareva is concerned, Bernard Fraisse, its CEO, considers that the acquisition of Chromavis mostly enable the company ""to play a significant role in make-up with the recognized expertise of Chromavis in this field."" Indeed, he adds, ""nail polish only accounts for 30% of its turnover."" In the future, Chromavis will be in charge of the group's make-up activity. ""There are many synergies, like in particular a complementarity of the customer base or the industrial sites of Fareva and the sales locations of Chromavis. In addition, through this acquisition, Fareva clearly state its objectives of being present and to invest the world over in innovation and R&D."" As for the two other main players in the market among which the French company Fiabila which achieves the biggest worldwide consolidated turnover in nail polishes, but also with the Luxembourg-based company IL Cosmetics, investments have been on going over the last few months. In early 2012, Pierre Miasnik, the CEO of Fiabila had announced the opening of a new packaging site of 3,500 sqm in France, in Le Perray en Yvelines, hosting both a filling area equipped with high-speed filling lines but also two storage areas, one for packaging items and the other for flammable raw materials. In the United States, the company had just acquired a second plant due to be operational in May 2013 with on top of it, an extension of the site in January next year. Two joint actions, which have enabled the French company to increase twofold its operations across the Atlantic. Third action, in India where Fiabila just completed the construction of its second factory (3,500 sqm). And eventually, just one year ago, the French firm confirmed, through the voice of its CEO Pierre Miasnik, the establishment of a manufacturing and packaging unit for nail polishes in Kunshan, China. A commissioning which was effective at the beginning of this year. An operation carried out as part of a joint venture with the Shya Hsin group. And Pierre Miasnik insists: ""our investments only concern nail polish and no other product!"" For its part, IL Cosmetics has also accelerated the pace of its investments with, among others, the creation of a new entity in the United Kingdom and an increased in R&D investments. The Luxembourg-based group, is building on the sharp increase of its activity (+ 25% in 2012, and more than 20% on average over the past years) to continue the investment program set up in 2012. The R&D division has seen its investments increase threefold in 2013 and the group has built a new laboratory in Luxembourg. In addition, the production site in Luxembourg was expanded with a new manufacturing unit to address the company's increase in activity."
Chemicos Creations : from eyeliners to mascaras,"Premium Beauty News - Eighteen years ago when the company was created, it specialized in the production of eyeliners. Katsutaka Hattori - Yes ! Since our founding, in 1996, we have endeavoured to create the BEST in cosmetics and cosmetic packaging, and are particularly proud of our eyeliner and eyeliner packaging. We have now many formulations for pen-type liquid eyeliner, and can also create an eyeliner to the specifications of our customers. We produce packaging for pen-type liquid eyeliners for every woman's convenience and preference. Further, we have also a wide selection of basic skin care line packaging, as well as complete colour cosmetics packaging, including lipsticks, glosses, eye shadows, nail polishes, mascaras, foundations, concealers, and tattoo colours.All of our containers are sold with or without inks as finished products. We have worked hard to develop inks which are greatly compatible with our packaging systems and our inks are highly recommended to be used with our packaging products. Premium Beauty News - One of the strong points that you put forward concerning your eyeliners is their formula. Katsutaka Hattori - Our eyeliner contains carbon black (pigment) which is approved by the US FDA. High technical polymer formulation dries rapidly without blur. Thanks to the characteristics of pigment, recoating is unnecessary. Among the main advantages of our formula: – High-molecular weight polymer realizes instant adhesion and coating. – It stays on even when exposed to sweat, sebum and water. – The solid line will stay on for 24 hours but can be taken off easily. – It doesn't require removers or cleansing lotions. – It can be removed easily without damaging the eyelids. Premium Beauty News - The ""health"" aspect for the skin and eyes is an essential part of your approach. Katsutaka Hattori - Absolutely! Standard eyeliners have been utilizing dye which is easy to formulate. Caused by the characteristics of dye, repeating usage causes spotty skin and dullness. This results to dullness and one of the aging phenomena. Since our eyeliners never utilize the dye, it is an epoch-making eyeliner which does not use dye for skin. Our eyeliners have been utilizing only safe pigments for make up on the skin. Among the other advantages of our eyeliners range is their ability to be easily removed. As for the standard water-proof eyeliner, the disadvantage is that it takes time to wash off and damage the eyelids. Rubbing friction with remover, cleansing cream and lotion destroys your muscle fibre. Our product adopts special polymer soluble in warm water with beauty soap and facial cleansing lotion. Resistant to water, sweat and tears, but easy to wash off. Premium Beauty News - You have just got started in the production of mascaras. A feature of your group, the mastery of formulas. Katsutaka Hattori - Yes, at present we succeeded the development of mascaras using special silk powder which always have been requested. The special powder is a kind of protein included in fine silk that is harmless to human body and friendly ingredient. Miraculous harmony of silk powder and mascara created a marvellous mascara. Premium Beauty News - What is your business strategy for the coming years? Katsutaka Hattori - The Japanese market represents about 50% of our market, which is a lot. Exports sales are dominated by the U.S. market with over 70%. It is clear that our expertise can be of interest in many other parts of the world, especially France."
Nippon Shikizai: A new plant in Japan in 2014 and major investments in France too!,"Premium Beauty News - A few words to start on your group. Kouji Okumura - Nippon Shikizai started its business in the 1930s as a manufacturer of pigments for facial cosmetics and is now one of Japan's most innovative cosmetic providers of research, development and product manufacturing technology. In addition to across-the-board manufacturing capabilities, comprehensive quality control and an unrivalled commitment to research and development, we bring together a unique group of specialists dedicated to providing cosmetic companies, worldwide, a comprehensive and total business solution. Globally, we have more than 180 clients including several larger-sized cosmetic producers in domestic Japanese market and overseas markets. Premium Beauty News - You are one of the few Japanese companies in the cosmetics sector to have taken the initiative to invest commercially in Europe by acquiring a French company, and you will continue investing. Kouji Okumura - France is the leading country in the cosmetic field where numbers of beauty/ fashion brands and prestigious global manufacturers originated from. We believe that we can introduce our high-quality and value-added products into such sophisticated market with the help of the clients who understand our quality. In 2000, we acquired the French company, Thépenier Pharma Industry, headquartered in Paris, as a 100% owned subsidiary, in a move to expand operations internationally. Thépenier is an integrated pharmaceutical manufacturer; that primarily focuses on the manufacturing on assignment. Production includes drugs, sanitary goods and cosmetics. Thépenier supplies contract-manufactured goods to major pharmaceutical companies, mostly in Europe. This enables us to carry out internationally targeted product development and global marketing. We have indeed planned to invest significantly to expand the plant's production capabilities by the middle of next year. The interest for us to take over Thépenier Pharma Industry stood mainly in its ability to guarantee us a production tool at the top in terms of quality production and of compliance to standards. Levels required for pharma production enable to develop ourselves in total peace of mind in the cosmetics sector. Premium Beauty News - What are the main strengths of your group in today's competitive environment? Kouji Okumura - Our strategy is built on four pillars: - We foster creativity and technical expertise to supply outstanding products that can proudly bear your name. - Our uncompromising commitment to quality and our flexibility are the pillars of our business success. - We strive to be a major global player and the most innovative and cosmetics contract manufacturer. - We seek to enrich lives with formulas that deliver maximum sensory delight. I want to emphasize on what makes the difference between us and our competitors. This lies in our ability to innovate, our customer service, our level of quality but also in our competitiveness in terms of prices. We definitely position ourselves in bespoken and upscale products and as a highly reliable supplier who is loyal and trustworthy, to its clients in terms of quality assurance and delivery schedule. Premium Beauty News - Make-up products are important in your portfolio. Kouji Okumura - That's true. Still today foundation products represent 25% of our business, but they are closely followed by mascaras and eyeliners (15%) and lipsticks (12%).

"Red Of View: ""Small is beautiful""","Premium Beauty News - You have just decided to come out into the open? Caterina Bondioli - You can say it that way, yes... We attended our first show this year by exhibiting at Cosmoprof Bologna and we plan to increase our presence in trade shows next year. The reason for this is simple. Our know-how is now sufficiently recognized and our customer base strong enough for us to offer our creative and production capacity to other actors in the make-up market. We have activities in every segment, mascaras, foundations, lipsticks, lipgloss... Premium Beauty News - You presented a few weeks ago a whole new range of products. Caterina Bondioli - We can start with our cleansing oil Soft Tidy, a blend of natural oils, rich in botanical actives, and natural derived esters. It preserves the delicate skin balance providing a thin barrier while removing make up and impurities. It is enriched by desert date oil (rich in linoleic and oleic fatty acid, omega-3 and omega-9 with moisturizing and emollient properties, and also in saponins that confer an anti-inflammatory activity), derived from first cold pressing of the kernel of the Desert Date. We can also talk about our lipstick Satli', which moves toward a satin soft reflection offering high coverage and long lasting performances. Actually, the use of selected pigments which are particularly adhesive thanks to their coating treatment, and the soft film formed by a special resin, permit a longer stay-on on your lips compare to a classic formula. The addition of a special derived amino acids emollient balances the richness of powders to avoid a dry skin feeling. This emollient is derived from glutamic acid, natural fatty acid, and phytosterol. It forms lamella liquid crystals identical to ceramide working as an intercellular lipids as well as having high water holding capacity. Because of its high skin affinity, it starts to moisture as soon as it is applied. As for our blush, Cheek & Chic, it is our offer for a natural and healthy glow: a creamy blush presented in a poured form. Easy to blend, it imparts a silky shade with a weightless finish. The formula contains a balanced mixture of esters with emollient properties and a pleasant after skin feel. A sophisticated microsphere powder runs on to the skin making it extremely easy to apply. The elastomer powder provides a matte appearance as well as cushioning effect. Premium Beauty News - Your know-how in the manufacturing of foundation is important. Caterina Bondioli - With the foundation Elaskin Photolite, we have created a simple and sophisticated foundation. Its outstanding properties come from a compound, a Photochromatic Titanium Dioxide, which can change the skin tone according to the intensity of UV light. The colour of the compound becomes darker upon UV light irradiation restoring its original colour intensity without irradiation. It can change the skin complexion according to the light intensity avoiding an over whitish effect when outdoors (while indoors, your skin tone is perfect). An hydrolyzed elastin solution enriches the formula with regenerating and moisturizing properties. Soft and lubricious boron nitride, in a water soluble version, gives a smooth and seductive touch. It's a new formula to brighten your face. Premium Beauty News - Not to mention mascara... Caterina Bondioli - The mascara Sericil is an extremely soft and creamy mascara which intensifies lash volume creating deeper-looking lashes. It glides on easily making lashes more eye catching, luxurious and healthier. It is formulated with sericin, which was transformed by ionic reticulation into a cationic form, promoting a conditioning effect on lashes. Sericin strongly binds to lashes, acting as an adhesive, which cements the damaged cuticles for a darker and radiant look."
Laboratoires BEA: focus on growth,"Headquartered since 1992 in Forcalquier, in the Alpes de Haute Provence (Southern France), Laboratoires Bains and Aromas (BEA) are tapping into the continued interest from French and foreign consumers in Provence inspired cosmetics. Specialized in the manufacturing of personal care products (face, body, hair), whether conventional, natural or organic (Ecocert, NOP or Cosmos certified), but also of soaps, colognes, candles and home fragrances, Laboratoires BEA employ 80 people and have achieved a turnover of 12 million euros in 2012.

In total, the company is investing around 1.2 million euros to support its development and the modernization of manufacturing facilities, including an upgrade and increase of production capacities on the two manufacturing facilities (including the site of 9000 sqm site in Forcalquier) and the acquisition of new packaging equipment. About 65% of Laboratoires BEA's sales are made abroad and the company wants to strengthen its position in emerging markets, particularly in Asia and the Middle East. ""Today, the United States are our first export market,"" says Julie Le Bacquer, marketing manager. ""For the second consecutive year, we participated in the Beautyworld Middle East tradeshow in Dubai and we'll also exhibit at Cosmoprof Asia, in Hong Kong, in addition to our participation in European trade fairs: Cosmetic Business in Munich and Beyond Beauty in Paris. The Provencal origin of our products is a big asset. This is true in the United States, of course, but also in Asia and the Middle East."" In Dubai, the company introduced Aqua Intense, a new collection of four bath and body care products made from lavender, a typical ingredient in Provence-inspired cosmetics, and from Alpine glaciers water: – Essential Water Pearls, that dissolve in the bath, – a sulphate-free Foaming Water, for the shower and bath, – an Oxygenating and Soothing Body Lotion, compliant with the COSMOS standard, – A Regenerating Hand Cream, rich in shea butter.

Premium Beauty News - Recently, it was the birthday of a famous product of Schwan Cosmetics? Jörg Karas - 25 years ago, ""Addition"", the very first slim cosmetic pencil with a twist mechanism, was developed. The technique of pouring lead mass directly into the pencil's plastic case was at that time considered revolutionary and generated many followers throughout the industry. To this day this eye- and lipliner is one of the most manufactured products at our global locations and a must have to any modern woman. With our unique formula technology and constant innovations Schwan keeps the position as leading global manufacturer in this sector. To meet the demanding requirements of application and wear characteristics of modern formulas and to stay at the top, it is imperative to continuously push manufacturing- and casting technology further ahead. This was also one of the reasons to invest 5 million euro last year in the reconstruction of the cosmetics factory in Heroldsberg. Together with the ""birthday boy"" this is where the company now produces various other very successful products under the most modern conditions."
Faber-Castell Cosmetics will inaugurate its new plant in Brazil next month,"Premium Beauty News - Crisis, what crisis? We are tempted to ask ourselves when we analyse the progression of your group in the cosmetic segment. Stefano Castelletti - There is no magic wand! We have worked hard in recent years and months on our costs to improve our productivity and to develop new products. And it's working! Remember, in 2011 we started with the product concept ""BRUSH-ON!"", our Liquid Applicator with a unique bristle brush for gels and emulsions. This airtight packaging is freshly activated with each click thus preventing the formulas from drying out. At Cosmoprof we presented it as ""FLASH LASH"", a long-lasting brush-on top coat for lashes in flashy metallic colours with multi-dimensional sparkles. Another packaging to mention is our PVC-free, airtight and sharpenable Plastic Pencil in Slim and Jumbo. This packaging allows creamy formulations with excellent glide that blend smoothly and then transform to a lightweight finish that doesn't crease or melt away. We presented highly pigmented eyeshadow colours with the concept name ""UNDERWATER LOVE"", which highlights the performance power of a 16-hours waterproof formula that withstands tough waves and gruelling workouts. Premium Beauty News - Before going into the details of this dynamics of new product launches, can you tell us more on the drivers behind this growth? Stefano Castelletti - In fact, to be honest, we were pleasantly surprised by this growth in Europe. It was in line with our expectations, that is to say ""strong"" in Brazil. And it was not up to our expectations in the United States. Concerning Europe, we can say that it was boosted by brands that are changing the world of make-up with a strategy that was both dynamic and very aggressive in terms of marketing and sales and who attracted mostly the younger generations. We were able to present a full set of services and products well suited to this type of demand, with a both innovative and demanding quality and service offer. Concerning Brazil and this is no surprise, this country remains extremely dynamic on the make-up market and, as you know, we have the huge advantage of having our own fully integrated production chain. Premium Beauty News - What will be the impact of this new plant in Brazil on your overall production capacity? Stefano Castelletti - We will be doubling our production capacity of cosmetic pencils in this country through the construction of a new building. A production which is actually not just intended for the South American market, but also for our other geographic areas, be it Europe or the United States. Premium Beauty News - Makeup in Paris in a few days will be the next appointment giving you an opportunity to showcase a host of new products. Stefano Castelletti - With this year's motto ""Nouvelle Vague"", we are also going to present novelties with which we pay tribute to the style and elegance à la Parisienne. Whether smokey eyes in enigmatic shades, lips that make a statement in glamorous red tones or excellent new packaging components, these novelties play on both formula and application to offer outstanding products. A few words about ""DARK STAR"", a 16-hour waterproof smokey cream shadow in our PVC-free Jumbo Plastic Pencil. Special volatiles combined with silicone resin provide ultimate staying power. The highly pigmented cream shadow also provides a multilayer effect thanks to the sparkling effect pigments shimmering over a blackened undertone in deep darkened shades. Premium Beauty News - Lips have become an area of choice for you? Stefano Castelletti - Absolutely! And the variety of products presented at MakeUp in Paris will emphasize this highlight. We will present ""SIMPLY RED"", a moisturizing lipstick with semi-matte finish and ultra-rich, 5-h lasting colour with no bleeding or feathering. The wooden Jumbo lip pencil with its 8 mm lead is lipstick and liner in one. ""TINT'N'YUMMIE BALM"", a Lip stain with a unique balm for comfort and shine, its unique texture looks and smells like gummy bear (jelly baby). Dual ended product with integrated balm and soft tip for precise contouring and outlining. Premium Beauty News - After the lips.... the eyes! Stefano Castelletti - With liquid liners this is THE category on the rise in make-up and we offer the right products and packagings for this trend with for example our full palette ""EYE-CATCHER"". Our liquid liner range offers different tips for different styles, : Whether classic, modern, drama or retro their various tips design an even line in one stroke and make these looks a whole lot easier. In Bologna we presented BAMBI EYES, its extra-long, tapered tip designs fine or bold lines just with a flick of the wrist and creates the perfect retro line. To note also our ""Full colour liquid Eyeliner"", 12-hours long-lasting deep matte or metallic shades with rich pigments for bold colours. The pointed felt tip assures a continuous flow for a smooth, even line in one stroke."
Arcancil Paris confirms its growth objectives and invests in digital,"Premium Beauty News - At the time when FSI Régions and Oséo acquired a stake in your company, you had set ambitious development goals for Arcancil Paris. What is the situation like today? Anne Delleur - Our goal to strengthen Arcancil Paris at all levels, particularly by reinforcing its distribution in France and by doubling its export turnover in three years time is coming true. Our sales have jumped by 60% between April 2012 and April 2013. In France, we have doubled the number of our shops over 2012 and we have also doubled our sales force. We have opened new markets abroad, like Hong Kong, Cambodia or Kazakhstan, and we are in the launch phase in Korea, Indonesia and China. Throughout our small company, we manage to achieve a controlled growth rate in France and abroad. Premium Beauty News - Your performance in France is particularly impressive in a mature, very complex and highly competitive market environment. Anne Delleur - Our growth in France (+30%), in France is one of our greatest sources of satisfaction. We owe it to the expertise of our teams, to rigorous product developments and the importance we place on the quality of services granted to our relationship with our distributors. As part of our partnership with French retail chain Beauty Success, we have opened 50 outlets in 5 months time. We also concluded an agreement with Beauty Success for the training of their sales personnel to enable them to gain a better understanding of make-up. As with all our clients, we also insist on logistics to minimize our distributors' stocks. This implies, in particular, anticipating launches of new products to avoid returns. We rely on these assets to continually strengthen ourselves in France. Arcancil Paris has also entered Leclerc Group's ""Une heure pour soi"" perfumery chain stores. Premium Beauty News - How does the Arcancil Paris brand manage to find its place in a selective network where large chain stores rely heavily on their own brands? Anne Delleur - Unquestionably, private labels or brands with networks of their own like Kiko, have changed the landscape of the French market. Only the best brands have managed to come unscathed. Arcancil Paris was among those thanks to its strong points: Eyes and price accessibility. To take the example of our partnership with Beauty Success, we are treated like a differentiating brand, in parallel with the own brand of the store. Our offerings are complementary: Our strong point is the eyes, with over 60% of our catalogue addressing this segment, which has been in the brand's DNA since 1935. Moreover, we work together on our launch plan to generate incremental growth. Premium Beauty News - What are your priorities in terms of international development? Anne Delleur - After our successful come back to Europe, South America and the Middle East, our main priority now is Asia, which has become Arcancil Paris' growth driver with ranges dedicated to the eyes, complexion and lips, developed specifically for these markets, following the regional customisation strategy we successfully optimized for our ranges in the Middle East from 2010. Premium Beauty News - Your third growth driver is digital? Anne Delleur - This is one of the pillars of our communication strategy, we spend on it over 40% of our communication budget in 2013. We have completely redesigned the visual and editorial identity of our e-commerce web site www.arcancil.com, available in six languages (Chinese, French, English, Spanish, Portuguese, and soon in Arabic) to embody the Parisian chic. This new breath of life is inspiring a new corporate image, with trendier and more sensual visuals. We are also present on social networks and we develop make-up tutorials with an international focus. During the redesign of our e-commerce website, particular attention has been paid to highlighting products on the site: HD photos, choices of colours, opinions of online users, products composition, link to social networks. Every effort has been made to provide comprehensive and transparent information to consumers of the brand and in order to create a real Arcancil Paris community. The hosts of events organized with the famous make-up Artist Morgane Hilgers, our brand ambassador for the past two years, will be relayed on the website and on social networks."
"Italy, new ambitions for the Polo Cosmesi","The Italian association Polo Tecnologico della Cosmesi, which up to now only included Italian cosmetic companies located mainly in the surroundings of the city of Crema - about forty kilometres south of Milan - decided at its eighth General Assembly last week to take a new step. At the instigation of its President, Mr. Matteo Moretti, the ambition of the association is now to become an association representing the entire Italian industry of the cosmetic sector, thus covering the whole Italian territory.

Aircos: new textures,"Premium Beauty News - You announced just a year ago the implementation of a new operational internally developed technology for the injection of make-up products. What is the situation like today? Eric Merville - This technology using both our expertise as a formulator and injector was 100% developed internally. We will be in an industrial production stage this year for products marketed in 2014. This new process enables to not ""traumatize"" the ingredients (in particular pigments and nacres) and to thus obtain an amazing smoothness and brightness. Premium Beauty News - You will be attending in a few weeks MakeUp in Paris. What will be the main highlights in terms of product lines? Especially concerning your Spring / Summer 2013 range?

Eric Merville - Regarding R&D, we have actually reinforced our team to reconcile innovation and comply with our commitments; we known that these two qualities do not always go well together! Concerning full service, with the increasingly demanding market, it was logical for us to adapt to it; it must be recalled that when Aircos refers to full service, it concerns 100% industrial Aircos solutions. Premium Beauty News - What will have been the other industrial investments made during the last twelve months and what are those scheduled in the coming months? Eric Merville - In our injection factory, an automated injection and assembly line for compacts was developed in 2012.

Surya Brasil expands its international distribution,"With 250 employees worldwide, Surya Brasil does not have the size of giants such has O Boticário or Natura, but the compaby now ranks among the Brazilian cosmetics manufacturers that are the most successful on foreign markets. And the comparison always makes smile Wanda Malhotra who now runs the business founded by her mother. ""We cannot compare ourselves to these giants. Our products are completely different, we are not operating on the same market segments,"" she says. While Surya Brasil has been concerned with ecology and naturalness since foundation (the brand was created in 1995), it is again by remaining loyal to its principles that the company has been successful at home and on export markets. Today, Surya Brasil is leading the Brazilian natural hair colour market, in particular thanks to it historical products based on hena. Today, the company is present in 32 countries on all continents, and its products are available on 95% of the U.S. territory, in particular thanks to its distributor, the retail chain store specialized in natural products, Whole Foods Market. In order to better serve this market, where its sales grew by +53% in 2012, Surya Brasil will open a manufacturing facility in the USA in 2014. For Wanda Malhotra there is no doubt that this success stands on Surya Brasil's natural and ethical positioning. ""We are not growing thanks to the financial support of a big group, but because our customers appreciate our products and because of our credibility in the natural segment,"" she says. Since its foundation, Surya Brasil has been focusing on natural ingredients and engaging various actions to support local communities. For its supply, the company has its own plantations, but also relies on Amazonian communities with which it strives to build a fair trade relationship. In order to settle the credibility that is sometimes lacking to some Brazilian brands on these issues, Surya Brasil has invested massively in certifications. Thus, Surya Brasil is only Brazilian company proposing Vegan certified cosmetic products, that is to say without animal by-products. Some of the products are also certified organic by Ecocert and Cosmebio. Eventually, cardboard packaging are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). As far as packaging is concerned, Surya Brasil emphasizes partnerships with raw material and packaging suppliers that develop their business strategy taking into account social and environmental responsibility. The company requires its suppliers to guarantee the origin and sustainability of their products. All the packs must be recyclable; some of them may also be composted. Thus, the jars of the skincare products of the Amazônia Preciosa line are made from coconut fibre and are 100% biodegradable. A range of strong assets on which the Brazilian company will continue to build in order to further expand its international distribution, now one of its key priorities."
Luxury beauty: L'Oréal redoubles efforts in China,"L'Oréal Luxe has led the way for luxury beauty in China since it first introduced Lancôme to Chinese consumers in 1993. Twenty years and ten luxury brands later (and soon 11 with the upcoming launch of Yves Saint Laurent Beauté), this foresight has paid off. Today, L'Oréal Luxe is the most dynamic of the major luxury cosmetics groups in China with a growth of 1.3 times the market. To meet success in China, the division relies on the understanding of local needs. Thus, L'Oréal Luxe has been able to adapt its offering to the cultural habits, texture preferences and skin care routines of Chinese women and men, providing them with iconic, tailor-made premium products like Giorgio Armani's Crema Nera Extrema and Helena Rubinstein's Life Pearl Cellular. Chinese consumers' penchant for ingredients used in traditional Chinese medicine has also inspired L'Oréal's formulations, as seen in the Énergie de Vie range by Lancôme which uses precious root extracts of rhodiola, gentian and wild yam. This a deep understanding and insight of the Chinese consumer and the specificities of Chinese skin and hair are made possible by the Group's long-term investment in Research and Innovation, creating research hubs all over the world, like the one in Pudong, Shanghai, to be ever closer to its consumers. The launch of new brands like Yves Saint Laurent on the Chinese market will further enhance the existing L'Oréal Luxe portfolio, allowing the group to meet the needs of Chinese women and men across age, economic and lifestyle categories. Thus, Chinese luxury beauty shopper can choose from rich European heritage brands like Lancôme and Giorgio Armani, disruptive American brands like Kiehl's and Clarisonic as well as Asian gems like Shu Uemura or Yue Sai - the local brand that is based on high-tech extraction methods of traditional Chinese medicine and emblematic of ""invented in China, for China"". Despite the anticipated slowdown of Chinese growth, L'Oréal still considers China as the main foremost growth driver for its luxury division. ""The most beautiful expression of L'Oréal Luxe brands is in China. Our brands have flourished and we have consistently outperformed the market growth for the past 10 years. Our desire and commitment is to continue investing in the development of the luxury beauty segment in China, growing our Luxe offering and leading the way in innovation and retail,"" says Nicolas Hieronimus, President, L'Oréal Luxe. China has, in turn, provided L'Oréal Luxe the opportunity to reinvent itself and redefine its brands to cater to the beauty needs of a new generation of Chinese consumers. ""The exigencies of the market have challenged and inspired each of L'Oréal's Luxe brands to constantly raise the bar in terms of product offerings, distribution, retail and service excellence as well as creative communications campaigns,"" adds the company. ""Chinese consumers are at the heart of L'Oréal's focus and energies,"" details Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman and CEO, L'Oréal Group, said. ""A potential 250 million new Chinese consumers will be using L'Oréal's products in the next 10 to 15 years, making China the number one contributor to our ambition of winning 1 billion new consumers and to our strategy of universalization. A significant portion of these consumers will be recruited by our Luxe brands, the segment where L'Oréal has historically led the market and where it will continue to influence the shape of its future."""
Star Colour Laboratories: An English SME that wants to carve a place for itself!,"Starting point for the Star Colour Laboratories: six employees including Kirsty Simmons, who were made redundant during 2010 when the company they worked at, was taken over by its main competitor. A bleak outlook at the time for this small group of colleagues. The only solution being to start their own business with the help of an investor. On October 2010, the project is underway: Located in a building of 500 sqm Star Colour Laboratories sees the light and releases its first productions. 2 ½ years later, the situation of the company is more than promising. The company produces 80% of make-up products (powders, mascaras, eyeliners, lipsticks, foundations, etc.) and 20% of skin-care products (BB creams, CC creams, etc.). ""Our passion, explains Simmons, is to create products which perform outstandingly and are a pleasure to use. We pride ourselves on being innovative and versatile in the development and production of a wide range of products – traditional, natural, paraben-free, synthetic-free."" The company's current portfolio of clients includes established colour cosmetic, household brand names and small independent businesses alike. ""With many combined years of experience in the industry, we have acquired expertise in new product formulation for an extensive range of categories, and in particular exceptional knowledge of colour matching. We aim to work to understand particular requirements and specifications to ensure that formulations are innovative and effective, creating cutting edge formulations even to the most demanding of specifications."" Star Colour Laboratories has the expertise to develop formulations or product lines specific to the requirement. ""Skincare, toiletries and the colour cosmetic market is constantly evolving. We ensure we keep abreast of the latest developments and are proactive in researching new raw materials. All our raw materials are sourced with great care to ensure that the products we manufacture are of a consistently high standard.

We offer filling, capping, labelling and batch coding. Our skilled work force has experience in filling, assembly, pack-off and labelling of a variety of componentry, giving total quality and flexibility in both long and short runs,"" adds Kirsty Simmons. Future investments planned for this year: a new tube filling line and a new mascara line."
"""Made in France"" luxury beauty drives L'Oréal growth","If L'Oréal's global growth was stronger than that of the worldwide cosmetics market in 2012, it is partly due to the Group's luxury division. In 2012, L'Oréal Luxe posted the group's finest performance with growth of 8.3%. According to the group, this growth higher than that of the selective cosmetics sector at 6.3%, stands on an ""in-depth understanding of consumers and a portfolio of prestigious brands, most of which affirm their 'Made in France' attributes, synonymous with luxury around the world."" The largest share of fragrances and cosmetics sales now comes from export. While several emerging countries like South Africa, Indonesia and a number of Central Asian countries have become players on the luxury market, China is where it's really happening. Chinese consumers accounted for one quarter of luxury purchases in 2012. A large affluent middle class (estimated at 280 million households by 2020, or twice that of 2011) and the luxury groups' recent development of retail networks explain this phenomenon. The Middle East is also a market with strong growth potential for luxury brands, cosmetics in particular, and the American continent also shows promising results, especially in fragrances. However, the growth of the global luxury market and its diversification imply to adapt industrial resources. The key issue, according to L'Oréal, being to satisfy a variety of consumer desires for luxury goods all over the world that meet the same quality standards. ""This approach targets excellence from the design phase to the point-of-sale in an environment of increased buying power driven by the emergence of a clientele seeking ultra-luxury goods,"" explains the group. To meet this growing demand for luxury goods around the world and to satisfy aspirations for unique, exceptional products, the L'Oréal Group combines artistic craftsmanship with industrial excellence. Most often, the challenge is to succeed in combining image with quality and a concern for detail with mass production. The Lancôme fragrance ""La Vie est Belle"" illustrates this control: its pack alone required 5 phases for a launch production of 2.6 million units. However, L'Oréal must also satisfy the expectations of a demanding clientele looking for products that are constantly more precious and unique. This segment is characterised by very limited series and may be comparable to hand craftsmanship; Armani's ""La Femme Cristal"" fragrance, produced in 100 unique, engraved, numbered pieces, is a perfect example. Each bottle, selling for 5000 euros, was produced by the Cristallerie Royale de Saint Louis which truly demonstrates the extent of its talent here: a hand-blown crystal droplet containing the perfume inserted into a hand-chiselled 10-faceted crystal shell crafted by the Meilleurs Ouvriers de France masters. This dual market reality is why L'Oréal Luxe uses Operations as an essential advantage in serving the growth of its brands and their ambitions. The European industrial and logistics excellence centre was created for this purpose in 2009 in the North-Picardie region. With their specialisation by technology, the three sites that compose it are genuine ""excellence centres"". Its organisation is based on the specialisation of each of the three production plants that compose it. The Sicos site (Caudry) specialises in emulsion technologies for skin care products, mascara and foundation. In Fapagau (in Gauchy, Aisne dept.) production is dedicated to fragrances. While the Lassigny plant in the Oise department produces anhydrous make-up (Lipstick, Gloss, Powders and Varnish) and custom-made fragrances. According to L'Oréal, ""this specialisation by technology ensures the level of expertise and innovation required to meet the demanding brand standards and this strategy is why L'Oréal Luxe is one of the highest ranking in the cosmetics industry."" Each year, L'Oréal Luxe technical development creates 1500 new products for the Lancôme, Armani, Yves Saint-Laurent, Biotherm, Helena Rubinstein, Diesel, Cacharel, Victor & Rolf, Stella McCartney and Maison Martin Margiela brands. This centre and its staff of 80 play the role of ""orchestrator"" in the Division's product development process. Regarding packaging development, as far as the Luxe divison is considered, L'Oréal has opted for in-house control. Thirty-five dedicated experts ensure the industrialisation, design, development, certification and specification of all of our finished products and packs. Over 200 new moulds are created each year. All techniques are used, from glass to metal to a variety of plastics. To satisfy the highest aesthetic standards, various perfecting techniques are reviewed, from galvanisation to interior lacquering, for instance. Close collaboration with suppliers selected from among the finest in the profession enables us to meet the most innovative technical challenges."
Carole Franck: time for renewal,"For the President of Carole Franck, ""the products of the brand were praised for their very good quality, but were sometimes seen as a bit old-fashioned and quite expensive."" It must be said that the time had suspended its flight over the quiet place du Général Catroux in Paris in the 17th arrondissement, where is located Carole Franck's Aromas Spa. Indeed, the brand had launched no new products since 2010: actually an eternity in the cosmetics industry where continuous innovation has become a prerequisite for survival! Geoffroy de Rosamel therefore initiated a development program that led to renew the packaging of several products and gave birth to Okana Radiance Complexion, an emulsion for enhancing skin brightness, which is based on marine actives and oyster nacres. Four other launches should follow this one during the year. For Geoffroy de Rosamel, a former executive of Laboratoires Pierre Fabre's Strategic Marketing Division, the challenge is to add new features while maintaining the values of a brand founded in 1975. Today, its newly formed marketing team is working at ""bringing value to the brand's DNA by capitalising on its main singularities and adding a touch of modernity and a lot of emotions."" In the meantime, Geoffroy de Rosamel set up three main goals: to develop a marketing strategy focused on the uniqueness and effectiveness of Carole Franck products, to rejuvenate the brand image and to revitalise its business on French territory. The French market now accounts for 20% only of the brand's sales, which offers its two lines, in 150 beauty salons and about 80 pharmacies and para-pharmacies respectively. According to Geoffroy de Rosamel, the development of the business in France implies to strengthen the brand's presence in beauty salons, where Carole Franck has its origins and its strongest legitimacy. A goal that requires the development of new treatment protocols and partnerships with schools and beauticians. ""There are many beauticians who wish to create their own institute. At the same time, four out of ten institutes created every year are going bankrupt after one year. We need to find a way to support them."" With regard to exports (80% of sales), the priority is the diversification of markets. Indeed, while the brand is present in 60 countries (in Europe, North America, Asia and the Middle East), Asia represents 2/3 of the export turnover, with China being the first customer. The new management wants to better exploit other markets, with the United States and Japan being the main targets. In the mind of Carole Franck's president, Aromas Spa at Place du General Catroux will symbolise the brand's revival. Its front door now appears on the new packaging of all its new the emblem of Carole Franck new products. The Spa, which is a beauty salon, a boutique, and an innovative centre for the development of new protocols, is also becoming a training centre for the brand's partners in France and abroad. A scented candle named Une balade au Parc Monceau has even been created to pay tribute to this place and celebrate the brand's new creativity."
Ponzini: a specialist in mascara brushes!,"An original story of this company based in Milan area that began one day in 1862 with the manufacture of carriages and ""equipments"" for horses. And in those ""equipments"" were obviously some brushes. This activity will finally be chosen and developed by the descendants of the company founder in the middle of the 20th century. Hair brushes, tooth brushes, the first small brushes on the market to apply mascaras... The story gathers momentum in the 1950s. Not that simple, a mascara brush! And even more complicated to manufacture at high speeds. A true know-how that will manage to cleverly develop leaders at Ponzini by designing their own assembly and cutting machines. A result, a speciality that draws the attention of industry players who foresee the fantastic boom of this make-up accessory, today the indispensable tool to feminine beauty. L'Oréal is one of them. ""And who is still widely today,"" says Lorenzo Bistoletti, Special Project Manager. To note that in 1997 managers at Ponzini decided to separate the two activities for the manufacturing of mascara brushes and tooth brushes. The first activity settles in Misinto in a 6,600m² building, the second stays in Lazzate. ""Very quickly there was high demand from this growing market,"" says Bistoletti. A market demand which has never stopped gaining in sophistication over the years. ""We are now asked very high tech developments with hybrid mascaras and with more and more original shapes, often combining very different fibres from one another or combining fibres and injected plastic parts."" In 2007, the Italian firm decided to invest in a production plant in China. ""We thought for some time that injected brushes were going to conquer a significant market share, says Bistoletti, but eventually the traditional fibre brush remained the mainstay of mascaras, even if the development and production of injected mascara brushes will continue thanks to innovation."" The success of traditional brushes certainly owes a lot to the skill of mechanical specialists at Ponzini who, with the help of their ""home-made"" machines succeed in assembling, using a automatic process, fibres, textures and shapes of different sizes at impressive rates. A true work of art. ""And believe me, say Lorenzo Bistoletti, there is still a lot to develop and discover."" Given the market growth, leaders plan to invest in two new lines this year."
"FSKorea: one credo, innovation","Premium Beauty News - The latest brochure you just edited on the innovations designed by your company during the past few months is impressive. Not less than 13 innovations! JKH Wang - FSKorea is a company that builds prosperity via innovation and creativity. We have an innovative design team specialized in the provision of concept development, 3D modelling, visualization and digital data. We are constantly developing new ways of meeting and exceeding customer's design requirements. Also our team provides turnkey design packages, while maintaining accurate budgets and timely projects. Our design team makes it a priority to stay in tune with industry trends to bring the best and newest ideas. Premium Beauty News - Could you comment and give us some details on some of those innovations? JKH Wang - Yes, with pleasure! Of course we cannot detail all thirteen of them here but we can mention the new patent-pending auto-fill droppers which functions easily and efficiently to ensure the consumer always has the correct dosage in the pipette every single time it is used. All the consumer has to do is twist the dropper top mounted on the container – the pipette automatically fills thanks to the new design, primed for use. To release, the user simply has to press the button on top of the dropper to release the liquid onto the desired spot. The system is extraordinarily clean, with almost no residue left inside of the applicator and easy to use – the button release mechanism requires minimal pressure to be activated. A word also on our ""Spinning Powder Jar"". Once again refuses to disappoint the cosmetic market with its new spinning powder jar, a round powder container with a built in brush that spins to provide access to the applicator which can be popped out, used, then put back in place and spun shut for an extraordinarily handy product that's as elegant as it is distinctive. The spin jar is incredibly easy to use, resting flat until the consumer picks it up and turns it open. The powder reservoir spins into the outer casing, exposing a lid that incorporates a brush. All the user has to do is pull out the lid, dip the brush into the reservoir, apply the product, then replace the lid and brush and spin the container closed. Premium Beauty News - You have also caused a small revolution in the world of powder jars... and the one of applicators for concealer and blush. JKH Wang - Rather than have to twist the ""Grinding Compact"" to grind the top of the powder block and produce a fine powder, the consumer simply has to push down with a pad to have the entire top portion simultaneously lower and swivel, which releases a small dose that's perfect for applying on the spot. It's great for morning make-up application as well as spot treatments, and it can be carried around without fear of having a bag accidentally filled with powder. The new container includes a reservoir for pressed powder, which can be incredibly dense as it is shaved off upon use. The new grinder features a simple push-top mechanism. As regards our range of ""All in One"" applicators the first version, with just a quick twist, provides a brightening effect under eyes and along the cheek bones for an instant highlighting result and glow. No need to pack a separate brush : Its built-in tapered brush allows for precise application and it controls the amount of pressure against the skin. This super-soft applicator has a larger cut end compared to others and it expertly blends the product on the eyes. It is a real professional touch! Just slip it into your bag to ensure a luminous glow, from day to night. The second version: The new applicator presents a very handy and easy to use instrument for consumers, as it is small enough to carry in a bag all day. The container is perfect for concealers or a highlighting cream. Further, the high quality of the brush allows the consumer to use it at any moment by just twisting the bottom of the container, pushing the product up and out through the aperture, applying the correct amount, then using the brush to spread the product perfectly. The new version features a washable brush that ensures the packaging is always clean, as the dial dispenser ensures that only the required amount is dispensed at any single time. There is no worry of product spillage Rather than have the product dispensed directly into the applicator, this new version puts the aperture on the other side for a two-step, controlled application. Premium Beauty News - For brushes too, you never cease to innovate. JKH Wang - Intensive coverage brush collection is our new innovation, Intensive coverage brush head is very densely packed with bristle that feels extremely soft. A traditional paddle-shaped foundation brush, it takes more patience to build up coverage but FSKorea's new innovative brush allows user to quickly pick up and distribute more product more rapidly. It is wonderful to work with and to blends foundation well and the silky brush hairs are a tactile pleasure! Also it is easy to control and user can pick up as much product as they want with it and vary the coverage, whether they are going for a more opaque finish or sheer look A various design of brush head cutting allows comfortable feeling on the skin and nicely for into facial grooves and corners for a smooth finish. Any shape that customer request, we can achieve them and gives a perfect tool for their foundation. With a slanted even cut, the supple velvety bristles feel comfortable on the skin and fit nicely into facial grooves and corners, allowing for a smooth finish. Also there are various shapes of brush head so customer can choose ideal design for their foundation. Intensive coverage brush is very densely packed with bristle which is remarkably soft. No scratches. It grabs foundation well, then it lay it down quickly and softly onto the face. Also it does not have a brush mark. Premium Beauty News - It is also one of your flagship innovations this year, the mascara... JKH Wang - We found a very common problem when applying mascara: the bristles on the market were tested and simply weren't strong enough to apply dense formulations properly. The solution we have developed is to apply a heat treatment to the brush. This ""baking"" allows the formation of various shapes to the bristles, also making them stronger and harder. The special heat treatment makes bristles very tight and firm, provides great separation, and maximizes length and definition, providing the consumer with the ability to cover lashes thoroughly from root to tip. Thanks to this, more formula stays in place between the bristles providing a noticeable improvement in performance. Any design for shape of brush is available to appeal to every customer. We have also developed the spinning mascara which smoothly rolls on to your lashes causing no irritations to sensitive eyes. The spinning mascara may look just like the other mascaras. However, once you open the lid and pull the brush out you will see FS Korea's secret weapon, the bar. This bar allows you to dip the brush into the formula container just once by capturing enough amount of formula, saving your time and energy of dipping it back and forth. With its spinning function and enough formula already on the brush, FS Korea's spinning mascara guarantees better colour formation at every touch."
The Body Shop sets three goals to its suppliers!,"Premium Beauty News - About the Supplier's Day, it was the third edition. What were your goals? The Body Shop - We brought together 55 collaborative and strategic suppliers from all categories (Trade and Indirect Sourcing), from three areas (Emea, Apac and Ame). We wanted to confirm their commitment to reinforce their cooperation with The Body Shop through three objectives: – Inspire through the universe of the Brand, its 5 Core Values (Against animal testing; Supporting Community fair trade; Encouraging self-esteem, Defending human rights and Protecting our planet), its DNA and better integrate them into the company through our Award Ceremony, a question and answer session with The Body Shop and an opinion survey to measure the alignment of the strategy to the operational activity to identify the strong points and the ones requiring improvements. – Look back at the strategy and performance of The Body Shop and outline goals for the coming year. – Set up foundations for a sound development of the supplier relationship by also relying on good market practices thanks to the intervention of renown speakers in their fields: Gordon Crichton (Director of the MAI Institute of Purchasing Management - BEM Bordeaux Business School) and the Purchasing Director of the Lego Group, Michael McNulty. Premium Beauty News - You also presented the Innovation Day. What was it about? The Body Shop - This was the second edition of the Innovation Day, a major event. The objective being to identify innovations of tomorrow, the upcoming launches. They are proposals, meeting the briefs of the Brand or directly developed by the labs of our suppliers (following a market evolution or based on their knowledge of The Body Shop ranges). Through the Innovation Day we want to improve synergies with our suppliers to be more market responsive and launch products faster, when demand emerges. We received for example more than 60 drafts from suppliers we had invited like, Chromavis, Laleham, S&J, LF Beauty, Autumn Harp and Fareva. We hope to convert 10% of these innovations and thus irrigate the pipeline of product launches for 2014. Premium Beauty News - Your brand strategy was redefined, and you are rolling out a new store concept, what are the results? What is the role of suppliers? The Body Shop - Indeed our ""natural and ethical"" brand strategy has been redefined and clarified. The Body Shop offer is increasingly focused on ingredients while highlighting our 5 core values. We talk about ""story selling"" (connect our Values to the product in the purchasing process). In parallel, the goal is to optimize our formats with fewer but more efficient launches, relying on the core products of the brand. We have also launched a new store design called ""Pulse"", which will be identical in all countries. This design is currently being deployed in 400 outlets. This new design is a major change that contributes to the acceleration of our growth. Our vision of beauty is ""Beauty with Heart"" which can be translated as follows: – 'Look Good' through product efficiency, – 'Feel Good' thanks to the texture and fragrances in our formulas, – 'Do Good' with the five founding values of the Brand. Our suppliers have a major role to play either in the relaunch of the Brand, or in the deployment of our new store strategy. They are integrated at a very early stage in these projects. Their contribution is tangible on every pillar of their performance: quality, level of service, sustainable development, innovation and launches and competitiveness. A sign of their importance for The Beauty Shop, our CEO, Fréderic Ennabli was present at the event, as well as three members of the Executive Committee: Ann Massal - Exec for the Brand, Philippe Reale - Exec for Operations and Paul Mc Greevy - Exec for R&I values. We are also strengthening our links with L'Oréal by creating the right gateways (that provide results for The Body Shop). Régine Lucas, the new Group Purchasing Director and Isabelle Faivre, Subcontracting and Partnership Purchasing Director, also attended the event. In conclusion: The Body Shop is enjoying an honourable growth of + 4.9% in 2012, despite a difficult economic environment, and its turnover was of 855.3 million euros, according to figures published by the L'Oréal group. The Brand still has a bright future ahead with the ongoing development of its Internet sales and its store redeployment."
Alkos Group: the strength of the French know-how!,"We are French and proud of it! ""It is not by chance, explains Florence Lefeuvre, the Sales and Marketing Director, if we wanted to assert our feeling of belonging to the long-standing French know-how in the manufacture of cosmetics with our little Eiffel Tower at the centre of our communication."" Especially since the expertise of the Alkos Group is real. ""It just needed to be nurtured,"" says Dominique Vautier, CEO. ""A process which started two years ago and which is not competed yet..."" First axis, reinforce the image of a group of its own that concentrates the expertise of Alkos, the only manufacturer of Made In France cosmetic pencils praised by export markets, of Intercosmétiques specialized in the development and industrialization of cosmetic and skincare products and finally of Sagal, a manufacturer of soaps and perfumed deo sticks. Second axis, highlight the capacity for innovation and the wealth of the offer of these three entities: – Make-up: in all possible galenic forms: pencils, fluid, poured, sticks and for every axes, eyes, lips, face and even nails. – Skincare: in airless tubes, bottles, jars, sticks for creams, masks, serums, scrubs, bi-phase, milks, gels, jellies, mists, oils. – Scented soaps and deos: with translucent and transparent, opaque textures. ""Our strength also stands in our full range of services to meet the needs of our customers and the market trends, explains Vautier. Our core-business is to provide industrialized innovations (concepts and products) and 'tailor-made' products to our customers using their briefs as a starting point. Our activity is complemented by a comprehensive' full-service offer (developed by our teams from formulation and components to the finished products), including a 'partial' full-service offer (with components developed by our clients' services)."" Third axis, guarantee a top level of quality services (99.3%, 99.5% and 99.9%) and OTIF which makes the Group's strength for the three entities. The French group is also very proud of the motivation and involvement of the staff in the three Business Units which is capable, since 2012 of working on a 3X8 7d/7d basis if necessary. To fulfil these commitments, the Group did not skimp on resources both human and technical. The Intercosmétiques plant located in Angers is capable of producing some 41 million units per year (currently 25 million in skincare and 16 million in make-up). The workshops operate under a controlled-atmosphere and the factory provides custom developments matching the specificities of each project whether in formulation, manufacturing or packaging. As regards make-up more specifically, the factory offers for 2013 a capacity of 20 million pieces for lipsticks, 13 millions for gloss, 10 million for mascaras and 6 million for hot filled products. Citus, a ""latest-generation"" brand new machine for hot filled lipsticks was commissioned a few days ago. The factory is also capable of filling 30 million tubes, 14 million bottles, 3.5 million of jars and 8 million of airless bottles. As for the Sagal plant, the production capacity for soaps in 2013 will exceed 15 million units and that of deo sticks 6 million units. Finally the Alkos Cosmétiques factory located in the North of France will rely this year on an overall production capacity of 96 million pieces. 34% of its turnover comes from wood-made cosmetic pencils (Slim, Jumbo and Super Jumbo) and 46% from plastic pencils (Slim and Jumbo) which, due to the sharp increase in demand explains the installation of a new high performance line for the filling of plastic pencils. The factory's other booming activity concerns the production of eyeliner pens, brushpens, French liners, make-up felt erasers and correctors, for an overall conditioning capacity of 30 million pieces per year accounting for 18% of sales. The Group is now reaping the fruits of a successful ""product"" repositioning and of industrial investments with sales jumping from nearly EUR 27 million in 2009 to more than 41 million expected this year. ""Our make-up product offer, which represents 55% of our business, has enriched itself considerably,"" emphasises Lefeuvre. ""We will be showcasing a whole range of new products on the occasion of upcoming professional events, at Cosmoprof Bologna this week and MakeUp in Paris in a few months."" Alkos has decided to give readers of Premium Beauty News a sneak preview of some of the fruits of its innovative harvest by unveiling its Jumbo Twist Mania. A series of innovative textures presented as part of a Full Service offer with a new gesture, Must Have: at last a lipstick mechanism in the form of a pencil!

The Alkos team is exited to introduce these new products and more!... at the Cosmoprof (Hall 15 - Stand C6-D5)."
"""The life cycle of an organic cosmetic is very short,"" Nicolas Fouchère, Laboratoire Sicobel","Premium Beauty News - The Laboratoire Sicobel is known for its natural dermo-cosmetic brands. You were one of the pioneers in this segment? Nicolas Fouchère - That's right. The Laboratoire Sicobel, which now has more than 60 years of existence, has made a name for itself thanks to its natural actives promoting skin cell regeneration. Placentor, the historic brand of the laboratory was one of the pioneers in ""phytodermatology"" When I took over the company in 1996, I chose to reinforce this positioning, combining natural actives and dermo-cosmetic products. We worked all our formulas to make them more natural while ensuring that they remained effective. Premium Beauty News - This is the time when you embarked on the bio adventure? Nicolas Fouchère - We realized that we had trouble developing the reformulation work we had undertaken with Placentor. In France, the emerging organic trend seemed to be a strong element of differentiation. And the Laboratoire Sicobel became a founding member of the Cosmébio Association. The organic approach allowed for the implementation of precise specifications, controlled by certification bodies independent from manufacturers and brands. In 2003, we launched the BcomBio brand with an in-house team, because at the time outside expertise in this area was scarce. And we stayed in our field: Dermo-cosmetics. BcomBio was the first biological brand to enter pharmacies. At first, we had to face some scepticism from our interlocutors. But the bio trend helped us and big pharmacies, eager to respond to the competition from health & beauty stores began to really take an interest in our products and support them. Today, the Laboratoire Sicobel manages five brands. Two brands with a strong natural connotation but not bio certified: Placentor – our historic brand, and Edenens, which targets young women. And three organic brands: BcomBio, BcomBio Homme, BBcomBio our organic dermo cosmetic brand for babies. Premium Beauty News - Going organic is therefore compatible with a dermo-cosmetic positioning for which the need for efficiency is particularly high? Nicolas Fouchère - We clearly epitomize this. Dermo-cosmetics is an integral part of Sicobel's DNA. In our case, they are self-prescribed dermo-cosmetics. From the beginning we were careful to make sure that our products were efficient and we had them tested. This was not always easy because at the very beginning the number of ingredients available was very limited. The efficiency goal we had set ourselves with forced us to enter into a continuous reformulation process to take advantage of new ingredients that kept appearing on the market. I can say that for the past 3 or 4 years we have managed to get with our organic products the same results as with conventional dermo-cosmetic products. Premium Beauty News - While remaining competitive in terms of prices? Nicolas Fouchère - There is no significant price difference between BcomBio and conventional dermo-cosmetic brands. Again this was one of our goals and it called for much efforts. Indeed, organic formulas are generally more expensive, to which must be added the certification cost. In addition, the life cycle of a bio product is often very short. As new molecules are made available to us at a very fast pace, we reformulate very often in order to remain at the forefront of innovation. This ongoing reformulation process, very characteristic of the bio in its early stages, is still very true today. In a nutshell, we must make efforts on our margins. Premium Beauty News - Hence the organic positioning is particularly delicate. What is your insight on the true potential of this market? Nicolas Fouchère - Since 2011 the growth in sales of organic cosmetics has slowed down. We went from a double-digit very strong growth, to a much more moderate growth. In such a context, there must therefore be a feeling of disappointment from some major groups who had made significant efforts to develop themselves on the market. Currently, it is estimated that the organic market accounts for between 3.5 and 4% of the French market. There has been a mushrooming of brands until the 2010s but a slowdown in sales as of 2011 led distributors to streamline their offer and there was a lot of product delisting. In our case, we always thought claiming being bio was not enough to convince consumers. This is even truer on the dermo-cosmetic market where we work in the long term, and where credibility is required on every front. Like all the other players, we suffered from the slowdown on the market of organic cosmetics in 2011. But we resisted quite well afterwards particularly thanks to the development of cardboard boxes for our products. Initially, we had decided not to use secondary packaging, but their introduction early 2012 allowed us to better express the uniqueness of our brand. Premium Beauty News - And how do you see the future? Nicolas Fouchère - We will first continue our efforts, to renew our ranges, in reformulation and in the research of new actives, with the aim to continue to offer products at the best level. Then our second axis of development is the internationalization of our brands. Currently Placentor (10% of our export turnover) is the only one of our brands to be truly present outside France, even though BcomBio was launched in Italy, Belgium and Russia. In parallel, we continue our contract manufacturing business which represents 10% of our turnover and which enables us to constantly confront ourselves to new issues. Premium Beauty News - What is the impact of regulatory changes underway, particularly the forthcoming entry into force of the new European Regulation on cosmetics? Nicolas Fouchère - This is especially heavy for SMEs that must be at the same level as large groups, yet without having the same means. This represents of course an additional cost to our profitability."
"Intercos, 40 years and on top form!","Does it mean the Intercos ""model"" has changed? The driving forces which still constitute and will continue to constitute what many do not hesitate to call the ""Intercos exception"" are well and truly there! ""Creativity pushed to its limits, continuous innovation, unbridled research, marketing and anticipation of market trends,"" a unique winning combination that no company in the sector has so far, admittedly, managed to come to par with. Not to forget one of the Italian Group's major asset, an industrial production capacity available in every corner of the world. ""Supporting or even anticipating our customers' needs,"" insists Ferrari, ""the experience shows that we were right to settle in the United States, where we now have three factories, and in Asia, where we have four factories. We will be opening a plant this year in Brazil near Sao Paulo and we are about to sign a joint venture in Japan for our colour activity"". After the downturn imposed by the 2008 crisis, business at Intercos resumed with renewed vigour. The group's strategic plan for the coming months is running like clockwork. While maintaining and developing the core values that have made its success, Intercos intends to successfully complete its restructuring, that is to say by building on its ability to focus on creation, but also by making it more accessible to a larger number of companies. Continue to innovate but by always keeping in mind reactivity and competitiveness. ""Time to market..., time to market!"" insists Ferrari. But innovation means ""research""! And in this domain, the Italian group has never lowered its guard, quite the contrary. 460 people out of a total staff of 3,200 work on innovation. That is, nearly 15% of the Intercos staff. An estimated cost of 145 million euros in 5 years! Who can top that! As a result, more than 10,000 new formulas emerge each year from the six research laboratories of the company located for four of them, in Europe, one in Asia and the last one in the United States. ""And each of these research centres has a dedicated mission,"" says Ferrari. ""Hence, the one in Maastricht in the Netherlands looks like a real start-up that takes full advantage of the fantastic research environment in this region. It is mainly specialized in the development of innovative raw materials for colour and skin-care. In China, the laboratory is in charge of finding new competitive raw materials etc."" Research, creativity, marketing, a comprehensive range that takes full advantage of the industrial clout that the group has built around the globe in ten year's time. Results are quite impressive here too: twelve factories, a production capacity of more than 1.5 billion pieces per year! A turnover divided between the USA (52%), Europe (39%) and Asia (9%)! ""And we have more in reserve,"" explain officials at the Group's headquarters in Agrate Brianza, near Milan. ""Opportunities for growth are strong across the Atlantic and huge in Asia, emphasises Ferrari, and we progress by 30% every year!"" To note that one of the two U.S. plants has seen its surface increase this year by 10,000 sqm. Not to mention Brazil, where a 10,000 sqm factory will be commissioned in the coming days, without forgetting Japan. ""As for Italy, he says, we have one of the most remarkable factory in the world in Dovera with its 40,000 sqm of surface production to which we are about to add an additional 15,000 sqm."" The Agrate site will focus in the end on emulsions to gradually become a technological centre dedicated to powders and lipsticks. ""Options are also clear for our markets, says Ferrari. Colour remains the bulk of our business (55%) followed by pencils (22%), skincare (12%) and the rest. It is on the prestige market that we achieve the largest part of our business (34%) followed by mass market (25%), direct sales and private labelling sharing the rest. We have invested heavily in our industrial and our research capacity in skin care and pencils (a current capacity of 100 million pieces per year!) to manage to become key players in these two segments. As for the full service activity, there is no denying that it is continuing to grow."" ""I will have the good fortune of turning seventy this year, says ironically Ferrari, but at the same time it is sort of a handicap of being already seventy!"" A septuagenarian who has clearly not lost his appetite to undertake."
Taiki increases European capabilities and launches antimicrobial resin,"Taiki wants to offer an even wider range of full service solutions to its customers, the big players in the European cosmetics industry in Europe. The supplier of makeup and skincare tools, dispensers and products, is therefore working at strengthening its production capabilities in Europe. Taiki Cosmetics Europe thus announced alsmost simultaneously the conclusion of two strategic partnerships. The first agreement, with Monomer Tech, a company based in Barcelona, specialized in plastic injection and customized packaging developments for the cosmetics industry, focuses on plastic injection of closures and containers and the production of high quality powder puffs.

""This partnership will allow Taiki to further develop its 'full service' offer to its growing customer base,"" said the company in a release. Simultaneously, Taiki also announces the introduction on the European market of EcoG+, a patented antimicrobial plastic resin. EcoG+ allows creating packaging and functional dispensers that play an active role in the preservation of the formula. This new resin combines three materials: plastic, glass beads and Silver ions AG+.

Mascara brushes: Dupont is pulling out all the stops and going upscale!,"Premium Beauty News - A market always on the rise! With it seems a strong comeback of fibre-based brushes. Sarah Perreard - Yes, we can consider that this market is continuing to grow globally by about 6% a year, with differences depending on countries of course. It is clear that those with the highest increase can be mostly found in Asia, South America and Central Europe. As for the different types of brushes, the latest statistics show that indeed fibre brushes are becoming again increasingly popular among women and therefore brands. We can consider that they represent about 60% of the market, with the remaining 40% still belonging to the injected brushes. Premium Beauty News - An old story that of mascaras. Sarah Perreard - A story that dates back to the 19th century with the arrival of the first non-toxic mascara imagined by the chemist Eugène Rimmel who used a bulk made of petroleum jelly. In 1913 another chemist, T.L. Williams creates a similar substance for his sister Maybel. In 1917, the first mascara sees the light with the company Maybelline. In 1923 appears the cake mascara, sold for the first time with a brush as applicator. In 1957 Helena Rubinstein creates a lotion-based cream formula. Mascara-Matic, the first mascara wand and tube applicator is launched. It is the ""first automatic mascara that needs no brush"". 1959 is the year of the launch of the Maybelline Magic Mascara, the first filaments twisted brush (spiral brush). In 1964, the Ultra Lash mascara by Maybelline is created, the first mass market tubed mascara. Then we can make a huge leap in time, with in 2004, the launch by Beiersdorf of ""Lash Revolution"" with its brand Nivea Beauty, it is the first moulded brush using thermoplastic elastomer. Premium Beauty News - In fact what is important in the design of a mascara to make it efficient? Sarah Perreard - Having a good fit between the brush and the bulk is the most important factor. The winning association between formula-wiper-brush ensures the efficiency of a mascara. In no way only one of the parameter alone would make a difference. For this reason, it is crucial to develop the brush depending on the bulk or vice and versa. We can summarize by saying that the main parameters on which we can play are: the tightness of the wiper, the thickness of the formula, the filament, the brush design, and the brush stiffness. Premium Beauty News - Why is the stiffness of a mascara brush so important in the make-up result? Sarah Perreard - When the brush is not stiff enough compared to the thickness of the bulk, the ""umbrella effect"", feared by consumers, happens: when the filaments go through the wiper in order to clean the excess of mascara, if the bulk is too thick, filaments have difficulty to get back in shape, they remain stuck together. This is also what happens when the formula has dried. The brush stiffness is influenced by the following factors: the number of filaments in the brush, the filament diameter, shape and length, as well as their composition (the resin they are made of). Most of our filaments are made of nylon 612 and some of thermoplastic elastomer, which both offer minimum liquid absorption which respects the formula, not making it dry. Premium Beauty News - The range of fibres that you offer is very wide? Sarah Perreard - That's right! The most standard and the first one we offered in the 1960's is DuPont™ Tynex® Standard (0900) which characteristics you find in all other filaments we have developed since then: solid round level filament and cylindrical shape. It is a Nylon 12.6 in diameters ranging from 0.051 mm to 0.127 mm (2mil - 5mil). A product suited for nails, mascaras but also other applications. Main advantages: excellent bend recover (thus, optimum application), low liquid absorption (respects the bulk), good stiffness when wet. But I can also detail you our range DuPont™ Tynex® Soft (0902) whose main advantages can be summarized as: – Soft feel – Full brush – Half the stiffness of standard Tynex® – Smooth lay down and flexible application – Excellent bend recovery. Our range DuPont™ Tynex® Supersoft (3100) which is a thermoplastic elastomer with the following main advantages: soft touch and low stiffness even with large diameter. In terms of make-up ""benefits"" this means: smooth laydown and flexible control, and a soft brush, nice to use. Premium Beauty News - Filaments are not all cylindrical, quite the contrary! Sarah Perreard - Indeed, the shape of the fibre is often fundamental to obtain a specific desired effect. Thus in the case of our DuPont™ Tynex® Hollow (0950 & 0951), several ranges are available: – 0950: oval hollow filament. – 0951: round hollow filament. – Cylindrical shape. Main added value: – Lower stiffness than solid round filaments. – Used for soft bushy brushes. – Hollow section enhances design freedom. Results in terms of make-up: – Soft and unique make-up experience thanks to the softness of the hollow filament. – Bushy brush allows to carry thick bulk for great volume result. Another interesting example with our DuPont™ Tynex® Seahorse (0960) which is a round level hollow filament. Main advantages: – Great Amount of surfaced area. – Random shape formation. – Hollow section allow for design freedom. Regarding make-up result: exceptional pick up and pay off. Premium Beauty News - Then sophistication rises crescendo! Sarah Perreard - This is indeed the case with our DuPont™ Tynex® Diamond Hollow (0993) with a diamond shape hollow filament. Main advantages: – Diamond shape increases filament surface area in contact with the lashes. – Sparkly appearance. – The hollow section ensures a soft touch. Make-up result: more volume is brought to the lashes thanks to a unique diamond shape. Its angled shape penetrates easily between the lashes for a better separation. Our DuPont™ Tynex® Quadrilobal (0920) is a four-lobed level filament. Main advantage: Up to 10% more surface area with 20% less volume, as compared to equivalent diameter of solid round filament. Regarding make-up result, this means exceptional pick up and pay off. The DuPont™ Tynex® Crimp (0900HW) is a solid round wavy filament which brings bushiness to the brush which therefore holds more formula into the crimps allowing for volume result. In the case of DuPont™ Tynex® splittable (0930) and DuPont™ Tynex® Supersoft splittable (3100), it is a three hole hollow filament, the first one being in nylon, the second one in thermoplastic elastomer, softer. Main key advantages: – Large diameter, splittable into thin tips. – Once separated, the filament offer surface with more filaments which improves the brush performance. Make-up result: Lengthens the lashes thanks to the splittable tips of the filament that retain the formula up to the tip. Premium Beauty News - You end up adding a lot of features on your filament. Sarah Perreard - That's true! This is also the case with our DuPont™ Tynex® Texturized (0901) which is a textured solid round level filament. Main advantage: structured surface. Make-up result: – Higher pick up and release of formula. – Enhanced pick-up prolonged hold of the formula up to the tip of the lashes, resulting in perfect and uniformly covered lashes from origin to the end. As for our DuPont™ Tynex® Natrafil ® (0101), it is a polyester with different additives. Main added value: – Structured surface. – Softer than nylon-based Tynex® Textured. Make-up result: – Higher pick up and release of formula. – Soft feel even in small brush. Finally, the last but not the least. The DuPont™ Tynex ® PTFE loaded (0906). It is a solid round level filament loaded with PTFE. Main advantages: Improved slip characteristics allow for better bulk distribution on the filaments; it allows to use longer filaments while ensuring that the bulk is distributed on the whole length of the filament. It also allows to increase the speed of application. Make-up result: – Less residuals on the lashes thanks to better redistribution of the bulk along the filaments after wringage in the neck. – Maximum distribution of the bulk on the lashes, since attachment on the brush is limited. Volume is brought thanks to thicker layers of bulk. Premium Beauty News - We do not always realize but could you give us a few figures to give us an idea of the number of fibres in a mascara brush? Sarah Perreard - It varies from one brush to another, as the number of filaments per brush is one of the crucial parameters in terms of make-up result. What I can tell you is that one kilo of fibre enables to make on average 10,000 mascara and 40,000 nail polish brushes. Premium Beauty News - So what really makes the success of a mascara? Sarah Perreard - Like for any product what ensures the second buy of a mascara is its capacity to deliver the promised result. But we may add that each consumer has different lashes, and specially a different gesture when applying mascara, which has a huge impact on the make-up result. This being said, in terms of product development, we will never repeat enough the importance of developing a brush according to the bulk or vice and versa, since the success hangs on the association between brush – bulk – wiper."
"After 2012 sales grow, L'Oreal expects to outperform market in 2013","Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of L'Oréal, was right to be confident during the presentation of the group's 2012 first half results. While the global cosmetics market grew by 4.6% in 2012, L'Oréal's sales amounted to 22.463 billion euros, an increase of +10.4% at December 31st, 2012. Like-for-like, i.e. based on a comparable structure and identical exchange rates, the sales trend of the L'Oréal Group was +5.5%. The Group benefited of a favourable currency effect, thanks to the (relative) weakness of the euro at the beginning of 2012. Globally, currency fluctuations had a positive impact of +4.2%. Eventually, the group's net profit grew by +17.6%. Reflecting the evolutions of the global cosmetics market, L'Oréal results are quite contrasted from a geographic area to the other. In Western Europe, the economic context saw the decline of markets in the southern countries, particularly in hair salons and the luxury segment, and the resilience of the rest of Europe. At 12 months, L'Oréal sales increased by +0.6% like-for-like, and +2.1% based on reported figures, thus raising its market share. The group performed well, particularly in France - where the acquisition of Cadum fully played its part - in the United Kingdom, in Germany and in Northern Europe. Despite this moderate growth, Western Europe remains the group's most profitable region. In North America, L'Oréal ended 2012 with growth of 7.2% like-for-like and 18.3% based on reported figures. The good results seen in 2011 were surpassed in 2012, with a strong growth of Garnier, Maybelline and Essie, the very good results of Clarisonic and the increased presence in drugstores of products of the Active Cosmetics Division. 2012 also marked a milestone in the acceleration of L'Oréal's internationalisation, as the ""New Markets"" (Asia-Pacific, Eastern and Central Europe, Africa, and Middle-East) became the number one geographic zone, accounting for 40% of the group's turnover. In the Asia-Pacific region, L'Oréal achieved annual growth of +9.6% like-for-like (+18.4% based on reported figures). India, Indonesia and Thailand are particularly dynamic. India (+35% on average), for instance, is the main contributor to the growth of the Professional Products Division. In the geographic area, according to Jean-Paul Agon, the improvement of the group's results requires to strengthen the penetration of local retail channels. In China, in particular, L'Oréal is seeking to strengthen its positions in 3rd and 4th rank cities. In Latin America, L'Oréal faces more difficulties. The group achieved like-for-like growth of +10.4% and +8.7% based on reported figures, and bets on its acquisitions to accelerate its growth. In Africa and in the Middle East, L'Oréal is growing by +14.7% like-for-like and +17.6% based on reported figures, with very good performances in Turkey, the Gulf States and the Levant. 2012 was notable for the rising momentum of new subsidiaries in Egypt and Kenya, and the opening of a new subsidiary in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, the cosmetics giant will open a new plant in Egypt in 2013 to serve the Middle East area. In such a context, L'Oréal shows strong confidence. ""The Group achieved strong sales growth, and once again demonstrated its ability to outperform the beauty market, and to gain market share, even in the more difficult markets of Western Europe and the United States,"" said Jean-Paul Agon. ""2012 was also a very good vintage in terms of innovations - amongst the most remarkable in the industry - in each of our Divisions and major business segments. In view of these successes and improvements, we are facing the future with optimism and confidence. The Group is thus well prepared to outperform the market in 2013, and to achieve another year of sales and profit growth,"" he adds. L'Oréal's CEO has confirmed that the group would remain attentive to the possibilities of new acquisitions provide they are consistent with its strategy."

Premium Beauty News - Laura Mercier, it's first an atypical career! Al Lustrino - Laura Mercier is a world-renowned makeup artist and founder of Laura Mercier Cosmetics. As the personal makeup artist to celebrities such as Sarah Jessica Parker, Julia Roberts, and Juliette Binoche, and as a contributor to cover designs and editorial shoots, Laura Mercier created looks that are both flawless and accentuate one's natural beauty. Raised in Provence, Laura began her training at age 17 when she entered a painting school in Paris. After deciding to shift her talents from the canvas to the face, Laura attended the Carita School where she studied in makeup application. Subsequently she represented Carita as a makeup artist and makeup teacher, working closely with Thibault Vabre. In 1985, Laura moved to New York when she was asked to join the team to launch American Elle. She immediately began working on advertising campaigns for Bergdorf Goodman, Bloomingdale's, Clairol, as well as editorial spreads for magazines including Elle, Vanity Fair, Glamour and several other publications. She began working with clients such as L'Oreal, Maybelline, Victoria's Secret, Gap, Banana Republic, and many other cosmetic and clothing companies, while working with Madonna on her looks for print, television and film. Subsequently Laura entered into a four-year contract with Elizabeth Arden, designing the makeup looks for all of their advertising campaigns, and also worked with Chanel on the company's beauty advertising campaigns in France. In 1996, Laura developed Laura Mercier Cosmetics to benefit women of all ages and skin types. She personally created the colours to satisfy the needs of her clients, based on a classic and always-current palette, rather than seasonal trends only. The Laura Mercier line has received numerous accolades from customers and magazine editors. Premium Beauty News - Basically, it is a particular approach? Al Lustrino - Based in Laura's belief that ""what makes you unique makes you beautiful,"" the brand empowers each woman to express and embrace her own individual beauty. Through the creative, artisan vision of a professional makeup artist, the innovative makeup, skincare, body and fragrance products combined with application techniques, are designed to enhance every woman's Flawless Face and inspire confidence. As a working professional makeup artist, Laura saw the need for several products, particularly in face makeup, that were missing from the traditional cosmetics marketplace. Unable to find the formulas, colours, and textures she wanted, she began experimenting and mixing her own to fill the ""white space"" in makeup in creating the flawless complexion. Her search to find the products that worked for her professionally expanded to the desire to help every woman achieve her full beauty potential, and in 1996, the Laura Mercier line was born. The brand's iconic products – the primer, tinted moisturizer, and secret camouflage, and setting powder – help women achieve their own flawless face in four simple steps.

The interaction between package and product is a critical consideration and needs to exceed the customer's expectation"
"""Logistics can be a real competitive advantage for SMEs involved in cosmetics,"" Rémi Perrot","Premium Beauty News - You have developed an offer combining logistics, shipment and exports management, more specifically dedicated to SMEs operating in the cosmetic industry. The needs of this sector are really specific? Rémi Perrot - What is certain is that small and medium companies in this sector rely heavily on international markets. This is particularly true for French companies who often achieve 60-80% of their abroad. International shipments are regular, to varied destinations but often for small quantities. And these companies do not always find a solution matching their specific needs. What we are offering them is to completely relieve them from the burden of logistics issues by providing them in, addition to the management of their exports: a warehousing area to store their production in good conditions, a team familiar with order-picking and packing. Another plus, we understand their daily concerns. In addition to our know-how as a freight forwarder capable of assisting them the world over, our clients benefit from a personalized assistance and of this flexibility which is specific to human-sized groups, responsive and capable of offering a customised service. Premium Beauty News - In details, what does your offer consist in? Rémi Perrot - This is a complete offer that combines logistics, shipment and exports management. STIO has 10,000 m2 (107,000 sq ft) of warehousing space in Morangis, 20 km South of Paris and near the Orly airport and Rungis. We can also handle BtoB order-picking and our clients can access via our website to a software enabling them to know in real time their stock status. For shipment, again we focus on1 flexibility. We can organize the shipment with our carriers, but our clients are completely free to use their own providers. Finally, STIO's strong point is the organization of exports, both by air and by sea. For this we rely on a network of reliable correspondents and we have weekly groupage departures from the Roissy CDG airport to Nagoya, Johannesburg, Jakarta and Houston, and a regular groupage line from Le Havre to Nagoya, Shanghai, New York and Cape Town. Our offer is aimed at companies whose business volume in exports is starting to gain importance, who need a reliable and qualified service provider capable of understanding their needs, of relieving them completely of logistical issues, without the rigidity of industry giants. We also have among our clients some start-ups like Fruit Too, the French brand specialised in skin care dedicated to children, or Carita-Decléor, for which we manage the flow to and from Japan. On imports, we also manage the flow of goods of the distributor of OPI the nail polish brand, in France. Premium Beauty News - Concerning these issues, isn't cost the first decision factor of companies? Rémi Perrot - Yes and no. Cost is obviously important but reliability and trust are two points not to be neglected. Many SMEs focus, rightly, on the development and marketing of their products. Often, logistical issues appear as a distant concern and are eventually neglected and delegated to a carrier or managed on a piecemeal basis. Yet, they can represent a real competitive advantage for SMEs, especially in a highly internationalized sector like cosmetics. In this industry, the ability to respond within short deadlines, to meet the requirements of the clients' schedule, are key elements for success. Other factors, such as concerns related to sustainable development are also important. In times when many cosmetic companies engage in exemplary approaches at this level, both their service providers and suppliers must also play their part in this dynamic. This is why we engaged ourselves in an environmental management process which enabled us to obtain the ISO 14001 certification. This approach is also part of the changes that are going to shake the profession this year. Indeed, an order now sets to 1 October 2013 the beginning of the obligation for all transport providers to indicate on the invoice of every customer, the level of CO2 emissions during the transport."

Philippe Massé - The world of perfumes, aromas and of cosmetics is constantly evolving, both on the technological and regulatory level and in terms of ingredients. For companies in the industry, these mutations result in real challenges to confront every day. Since 1972, the ASFO-Grasse has set itself the objective to accompany, advise and train all actors of the branch. Because we are convinced that the success of a business is inseparable from the level of competence of its employees. Therefore, the ASFO-Grasse assists companies specialised in fine chemicals at all levels of the forward-looking management cycle of employment and skills: – by carrying out studies on employment and qualification (in partnership with the DDTEFP, the PASS cluster), – by participating in the recruitment and qualification of future employees in the branch (sandwich courses), – by participating in the improvement of knowledge and skills of current employees (continued training, individual training leave), – by helping some employees to acquire qualifications or diplomas (educational leave or validation of job experience), – by intervening in difficult times to anticipate industrial changes and prepare professional transitions, – by participating in the reintegration of jobseekers (in partnership with the pole Employment and the PACA Regional Council), – by extending around the world the reputation of Grasse, the capital of perfume, through the International School of Perfumery (Grasse Institute of Perfumery). Training courses at the GIP aim to develop the basic knowledge required to apprehend the different steps leading to the creation of a perfume, to acquire a knowledge in raw materials and know how to use them wisely, particularly natural materials for which Grasse has long been renowned, to learn the language of perfumers and know how to classify and recognise the main fragrance groups, to discover and know how to create harmonies which are the essence of the art of composition, to learn the subtle art of composition. But other disciplines fundamental to the job of a perfume-creator are also covered. The knowledge of international regulations in perfumes and cosmetics, the mastery of the modern principles of analysis (gas chromatography and mass spectrometry), functional perfumery (shampoos, shower gels, creams...) are also part of the curriculum. Premium Beauty News - How long does this training lasts, and what is the cost of it? Philippe Massé - The training of a student will last nine months, from February to June and September to December. It includes 972 hours of training in English given by professionals (perfumers - designers or technicians), interspersed with visits to factories, laboratories and perfume plants growers (jasmine, May rose, lavender, mimosa...). The cost is of 11,900 euros. The number is limited to 12 students, selected for their olfactory talents and creativity. To date 115 students of 27 different nationalities followed the courses with a placement rate of over 90%. Premium Beauty News - A word on the PASS cluster and the ERINI platform in which Prodarom is involved. What is the situation? Philippe Massé - You know that the PASS cluster aims to become an international reference centre for the characterization, evaluation and production of natural extracts used in the aromatic and cosmetics industry. The PASS cluster is based on vertical integration. It is composed of the entire value chain of this industry, historically present throughout the region, from the cultivation of aromatic and perfume plants to the production of aromatic ingredients and their formulation into finished products. These aromatic ingredients are aimed at four major industrial markets: fine perfumery, cosmetics, detergents and food products. In addition, the mastery of complex natural substances is an undeniable challenge for the industry. It requires indeed technologies and a scientific expertise of the highest level to meet the needs of characterization, quantification and authentication of extracts. The ERINI platform was created specifically to meet this need, by the PASS (Parfums Arômes Senteurs, Saveurs) competitiveness cluster, the CNRS, the Nice Sophia Antipolis University and Prodarom. It is located in Grasse, in the Espace Jacques-Louis Lions, on the emblematic site of the former Roure factory, next to the InnovaGrasse (innovative business incubator) and of the Master Foqual (Formulation Quality Analysis). The aim of this platform, a public and private research partnership structure, is to become an international laboratory of excellence in the field of characterization of natural extracts, with three major research themes: – The study of degradation mechanisms of products from the aromatic industry (i.e. oxidation reactions) and the characterization of markers of aging and / or potentially allergenic-by-products. – Identification and quantification of substances in the extracts, to improve on the one hand the development of natural raw materials towards other markets (pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, etc..), and on the other hand, control their quality (research or products or of contamination residues). – The authentication of the natural (naturalness) to guarantee the origin and quality of extracts, and thus thwart fraudulent transactions."
Kanebo starts its revolution,"On November 13, Masumi Natsusaka, president of Kanebo presented in Tokyo the new ambitions of the second Japanese cosmetics maker. For the first time since its acquisition by Kao in 2005, Kanebo Cosmetics is initiating a true revolution, with a main driver: achieving the internationalization of the group. While Kanebo (16.5% market share) and Kao (6.3%) are now almost on a par in Japan with Shiseido (23.7% market share), the two groups did not succeeded to equal the performance of their compatriot abroad. Unfortunately, if the Japanese cosmetics market remains the second in size after the United States, it has almost ceased growing in value since 2002 and has even started a slight decline since 2009. And the prospects are not encouraging. The aging Japan's population has been decreasing since 2005, which will hinder any market recovery. At the same time competition increased, with the entry of new players such as Fuji Films, with the brand Astalift or Ajinomoto, a food giant, and even Suntory, maker of the famous Japanese beer on the cosmetic-food segment. In this context, Kanebo wants to catch growth abroad by entering in the race already underway between major global cosmetic players. The announcement is not new, but this time the Japanese group seems to be ready to adopt the decisions that are necessary to succeed. Masumi Natsusaka has built its strategy for 2015 upon three main axes: the rationalization and reduction of the group's portfolio of brands, the strengthening of the group's position on its home market, and the strong development of the group's international business. The first step is probably the most painful. While the group currently manages an impressive number of brands [1] in all segments of the market, it will drastically reduce their number to a total of twelve key brands, from which will emerge five strategic brands that have a strong global potential. Some lines will therefore be stopped or merged with similar ones. Thus, Kanebo will certainly not cease marketing whitening products but should merge its Blanchir brand within a stronger one. The five global brands are Sensai, Kanebo (now known as Impress), Lunasol, Kate and Freshel. Therefore, on overseas markets, the Kanebo signature will no longer be disseminated on all product lines and will become a brand by itself. The remaining seven brands (Twany, Lissage, Coffret d'Or, Milano Collection, Evita, and a counselling skin care brand and a counselling hair care brand) will be focused on the Japanese market. Indeed, Masumi Natsusaka is well aware that it is also in Japan that he will win the battle for the group's globalization. The equation is quite simple: to enhance the group's profitability on its domestic market in order to fund its global development. While Kanebo's operating profitability is currently at 6%, Natsusaka wants to reach 10% in 2015. In a distribution environment undergoing enormous changes with the advent of on-line retailing, Kanebo Cosmetics is re-focusing on counselling, the starting point of its business, as source of competitive advantage. Eventually, the Japanese group is seeking to achieve dramatic growth in its overseas sales. Its top priority is the expansion of its Asian business, including China. To facilitate this, Kanebo is going to build an R&D structure that will permit local product development based on the technology appropriate to each region. The group should turn to new suppliers who can offer high quality technology at more competitive prices than in Japan. To date, in addition to Japan, Kanebo makes business in 55 countries but only 10% of its sales are made abroad. Masumi Natsusaka targets an overseas sales ratio of 15% by 2015, and 30% by 2020 at the latest."
Make-up: Polish company Bell focuses on investing in production equipment,"Quite a remarkable success for this family-run company founded thirty years ago by the Pałyska family, still the owner to date, and who has carved a place for itself over time both around its own make-up brand Bell, but also, increasingly, through its subcontracting activity which combined operates on forty markets and with one of its characteristics being the almost total integration, from the manufacturing of its proprietary formulas to the production of packaging (six twenty injection moulding machines). Bell's main customers for outsourcing are German companies and those of Central and Western Europe. ""But we are stepping up our commercial presence in both the United States and Asia,"" we were told at the Jozefow headquarters. Regarding Bell brand, products are available in more and more countries around the world, not only in Europe but also in Arabic and Asian markets. ""Topping the list of products coming from the subcontracting, lipgloss and lipstick are bestsellers and these are produced in highest volumes. But we offer the full array of make-up products,"" explains the officials. ""Each season we create new products to bring a palette of brilliant and vivid hues. We provide high-quality services in contract manufacturing of colour cosmetics. Established in 1983, we were the first colour cosmetic brand in Poland with the full make-up range. Paying attention to quality, both in production and service is our priority. We select ingredients and use only high quality raw materials from well-known, verified suppliers. All finished products, raw materials and components are controlled by qualified quality control department. Bell also cooperates with independent, external laboratories and research institutions. All products are produced according to EU legal regulations."" A subcontracting activity whose development requires constant investments. Hence the arrival next year of production machines 'back injection', 'multi-colour pressed powder' and 'multi-colour liquid powder', whose main advantages stands in a perfect mastery of the filling of colour cosmetics in their packaging, the possibility to inject several hues and/or textures at the same time, to achieve extremely varied patterns since it's possible to inject in a hollow imprint, and, in the end, obtain a very high quality product. Bell focuses on investing in new machines and equipment to increase its production capacity and products' quality. The plans of growth and investments concern also packaging production and decoration area, as Bell has its own packaging and decoration production."
Joko Private Label: A new corporate image for Christmas,"Joko was created twenty years ago by the Kosyl couple, with in the beginning the aim to develop their own brand. However, Gregory and Elizabeth soon realized that the subcontracting activity would also provide them the desired progression. Actually, in 2011 Joko Private Label accounted in the end for up to 95% of the Group's turnover. ""Our positioning in this area is clear,"" explains Anna Diaczenko, Head of Marketing, ""We work for large companies that rely on subcontractors with large volumes of production. We offer the full range of make-up products: from lipstick to pressed and/or cast powders including mascaras, lip glosses, concealers, foundations, eyeliners, eyeshadows and blushes..."" Joko production capacity is really impressive and it is rising year after year, along with its investments in new automated machines. And the two production units located in Wolomin (30 km from the centre of Warsaw) have nothing to envy to the most modern units in other countries of the European Union. ""The equipment used to manufacture the lipsticks, the powders, the hot filled products are all latest-generation machines. The workshop has just received a brand new Taiwanese back injection machine which is currently being tested and which will be running in a few days. Some additional productive investments are earmarked for 2013 with, among others, the automation of the assembly shop."" The staff at Wolomin has every reason of being proud to display the whole battery of tests (preservatives, stability tests, skin tests, compliance with the applicable legislation) to which the microbiology laboratory and quality control laboratory submit the products. ""For long-terms development, explains Diaczenko, we can guarantee a period of 6 months from the start of the project to the final completion and acceptance of the formula. A time frame that can be brought down to three months for colours made on our existing formulas."" The Wolomin facility is actually divided into two distinct parts, one dedicated to the ""powder"" products, and the other one to ""liquid"" products, both of them in an ultra-clean environment. ""Of course we scrupulously comply with the highest standards in force in this area (GMP, ISO 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 22716) depending of the legislations in force in the different countries,"" emphasised Diaczenko. ""Our packaging is entirely sourced from external converters. As for our development strategy, commercially speaking, it is clearly oriented towards countries where we are not sufficiently known, the United States, France, but also Asia, where we also become competitive with our prices and outstanding quality."""
Schwan Cosmetics on the rise,"Premium Beauty News - A good development for your Group during the year 2011/2012 which is reflected in the figures. Barbara Bauer-Kropf - Indeed! During the fiscal year 2011/12 (which ended June 30th) the Schwan-STABILO Group exceeded the turnover threshold of half a billion euros for the first time, achieving sales of 503 million euros (previous year: 462 million euros) and an increase of 9%. Gains were once again made in all areas of business: Cosmetics rose by 10.0%, STABILO by 0.4%, and Outdoor by 29.5%.The Cosmetics division showed a particularly successful development, exhibiting organic growth, especially in Latin America and Asia. Schwan Cosmetics was able to significantly expand its business during the fiscal year 2011/12. Compared to previous year (241 million euros), the turnover increased by 10% to 266 million euros. This continued the successful trend of recent years; viewed over three years, turnover has increased by almost 50%. For the cosmetics business, investments amounted to 22.1 million euros, of which 14.7 million euros alone were for the Heroldsberg site. The lion's share of these investments went into the development and industrialisation of new products. The markets of the Asia-Pacific region have experienced unprecedented growth in recent years and are seen as the most dynamic growth region in the world. Increasing independence from the USA and Europe driven by a fast-developing domestic market and a growing, prosperous middle-class mean that high growth rates are also expected for the future. For decades, Western Europe has been the most important sales region for Schwan Cosmetics after North America. Slowly however, the markets of Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and the Middle East are collectively assuming second place among the most important sales regions in the world. Premium Beauty News - The year 2012 was also marked by the 25th anniversary of the famous B-Matic! Barbara Bauer-Kropf - That's right! 25 years ago Schwan Cosmetics invented a very special cosmetic pencil with a new kind of twist mechanism: The technology, which involved pouring the bulk directly into the plastic casing of the mechanical pencil, was considered revolutionary. This eye and lip liner remains one of the products with the highest production level at the Heroldsberg site. In the meantime, over half a billion B-Matic pencils have been sold worldwide. Since the invention of this pencil 25 years ago, Schwan Cosmetics has been able to beautify eyes over 400 billion times all over the world as each pencil can be used around 800 times. To celebrate the pencil's birthday this past summer, employees released more than 700 balloons as a symbolic greeting to Cosmetics consumers throughout the world. Premium Beauty News - 2012, a year also marked by several investments. Barbara Bauer-Kropf - In the past fiscal year 2011/12, the Schwan-STABILO Group's investments totaled 45 million euros with a focus on new products. Furthermore, a significant portion of this figure was invested in construction. As such, cosmetics manufacture in Mexico is currently being expanded by means of a new factory in Toluca. Work continues on the construction of the Deuter (Gerstofen) logistics and administration building. And at company headquarters in Heroldsberg, preparations are underway for a new STABILO building which will also house a new IT centre to cater to the needs of the entire company. In Germany the group created a further 110 jobs so that a total of 1,850 people are now employed there. At the end of the fiscal year the number of employees stood at 4,390 worldwide. Premium Beauty News - And what is your insight for the near future? Barbara Bauer-Kropf - Like our Group Managing Director, Ulrich Griebel, expressed it very well, we are carefully observing the uncertain global economic situation and, with three completely different sectors, we certainly have plenty to occupy ourselves with. Nonetheless, as a family-owned company we feel well equipped for the task ahead, and continue to trust in our competence in dealing with many challenges, diverse markets and different brands."
"""Brazil is the hottest market in the world at the moment,"" Emanuelly Batisti, Shiseido Brasil","Sueli Ortega - What are your next investment plans in Brazil? Emanuelly Batisti - Actually, Brazil is the hottest market in the world at the moment, not only for Shiseido, but for all brands seeking growth. We have just received in the country several scientists of the group coming from Japan, to conduct researches on the skin and hair of Brazilian women. The purpose was to develop more specific products addressing the needs of this market, considering the local variety of phenotypes. Shiseido is recognized as one of the companies that invest the most in research worldwide. We have 14 research centres around the world. Shiseido was granted several awards worldwide, because of the level of research the group develops, and its numerous patents and the development of raw materials. In a growing market such as Brazil, it could not be different. We conducted consumer tests with about 200 persons, using state of the art equipment. Our team of scientists has investigated various topics of analysis. For instance, they used high-definition pictures to measure the amount of cilia that a woman has, and their thickness, in order to develop products adapted to their needs. Sueli Ortega - What are the main events of your presence in Brazil? Emanuelly Batisti - The company has been in Brazil since 1996 and created its Brazilian subsidiary in 2000. As far as the Shiseido brand is concerned, it was launched in 1872. We are celebrating its 140th anniversary this year. We have scheduled worldwide celebrations. In Brazil, the celebrations include launches of limited editions, cultural and entertainment actions, etc. This year was also marked by the launch of new Shiseido brands in Brazil: bareMinerals, a brand of our US subsidiary Bare Escentuals, and Nars, which was acquired by Shiseido in 2000. Sueli Ortega - What is the purpose of these launches in terms of concept and distribution? Emanuelly Batisti - Both are makeup brand, but they have different proposals. Nars has more fashion appeal, a bolder and trendier positioning. It is colourful and vibrant. On the other hand, bareMinerals has a more natural appeal, it's makeup line that reaches a younger audience. These brands have a different positioning than the Shiseido brand, which is almost a functional makeup line, providing both makeup and treatment, thus benefitting the skin, whether it is dry or oily. It also offers anti-ageing features. For instance, lipsticks contain hyaluronic acid. In Brazil, Shiseido is distributed in leading prestige perfumeries and pharmacies, such as Onofre, and also at Sephora. Altogether there are 170 sale points in Brazil. It is a selective distribution that reaches 100% of Brazilian regions, besides the sales of e-commerce. On the contrary, bareMinerals is sold in its own shops and at Sephora. There are no franchises, but only brand stores. And Nars is an exclusive brand brought to Brazil for Sephora. Sueli Ortega - What are Shiseido's best sellers in Brazil? Emanuelly Batisti - What sells most are the skincare products. Skincare is the great strength of the brand in the country. We are the second skincare brand best sold in Brazil, according to a research by Segmenta. Sueli Ortega - And what about the fragrance market? Emanuelly Batisti - Shiseido Brazil only offers its Zen fragrance in the country. However, global brands belonging to the group, such as Issey Miyake, Jean Paul Gaultier, Narciso Rodriguez, Elie Saab, are also marketed in Brazil through independent distributors. Sueli Ortega - What are the launches planned for the country this year? Emanuelly Batisti - Shiseido will launch commemorative editions, such as a perfume with an unique scent that arrives already in October, Eau Dermine, which was the first scent launched by Shiseido. It comes back with the original packaging, totally vintage, for collectors. We will launch other products line, as a 3 in 1 sunscreen that protects face, body and hair. We will launch an anti-aging serum for men, a product for the eye area for women over 40 years and a makeup collection. There will be many releases by November this year."
L'Oréal gets to know Indian consumers,"L'Oréal has been present in India for 18 years with a portfolio of 15 brands, growing at an average annual growth rate of 30%. The Group is number 3 of the beauty sector in India, with 10% market share in urban areas [1]. In order to cater to this market optimally, the cosmetics Group has launched several brands covering various product categories, including: mass consumer brands Garnier, L'Oréal Paris and Maybelline New York; luxury brands Lancôme, Yves Saint Laurent, Kiehl's, Ralph Lauren, Giorgio Armani and Diesel; professional brands like L'Oréal Professionnel, Matrix, Kérastase and Kéraskin Esthetics for salons and pharmacy brands Vichy and La Roche-Posay. ""L'Oréal's rapid success in India can be explained by its ability to adapt to the demands of a market where cosmetic routines and purchases are firmly anchored in tradition,"" explains the French cosmetics giant. For instance, in order to take into account local standards of living, the range of packaging options - and therefore of prices - has been widened. Thus, Garnier Fructis shampoos are available in sachets costing 1.5 rupees (0.02 euros). Of course, such prices are only possible through local production and raw materials supply, in particular with the Pune plant that supplies nearly 85% of L'Oreal's sales in India. Established in India since 1994, Garnier has succeeded in becoming the leading multi-category beauty brand in the country, with nearly 750,000 points of sale, both in the traditional network of neighbourhood shops (which account for 82% of L'Oréal sales in India) and in the modern supermarket network (accounting for 18%). To better understand the aspirations of the Indian middle class, L'Oréal took a decisive step two years ago when it decided to set up a research and innovation centre with evaluation and formulation laboratories in Mumbai. Thanks to a key consumer insight, L'Oréal seized the opportunity to meet the needs of this demanding clientele by offering Indian women products that are modern and innovative yet specific to their existing beauty habits. Thus, Several essential products from the Indian beauty culture have inspired the French multinational's range. For instance, the importance of hair care in India was behind the Garnier launch of a Fructis 2-in-1 shampoo (shampoo + hair oil), specially designed according to the tradition of oiled hair. Similarly, Garnier Color Naturals coloration was introduced as a modern alternative to traditional coloration with henna. As per the top-selling Colossal Kajal from Maybelline New York, it was inspired obviously by women's use of traditional kajal to line their eyes. Although cosmetics spending is still relatively low in India, in particular if we consider the overall population, the outlook is encouraging. The Indian cosmetics market registered impressive sales worth Rs 264.1 billion (US$ 4.75 billion) in 2011. The industry is estimated to expand at a compound aggregate growth rate (CAGR) of around 17 per cent during 2011-2015, according to RNCOS latest research report. Boosted by the growing importance consumers give to their appearance, it has enjoyed double-digit growth in recent years (+13% in 2010), recording the highest growth of any country in the Asia-Pacific region."
Cosmetic brushes: The Raphael/Max Sauer Saga,"Premium Beauty News - A Industrial family saga obviously begins with a story. Pascal Goossens - Indeed, the origin of the current Max Sauer company dates back to 1793 in Paris. Today, it is the oldest factory in Europe for the maufacture of fine brushes. It is in Paris, just a stone's throw from the Pont Neuf, that Mr. Parent establishes his brush factory in 1793. The French company manages to develop itself in spite of troubled times in connection with the Revolution, the Empire and the Restoration. The activity continues from 1820 to 1859 with the company changing hands. Then, in 1859, at the age of 34, Charles Sauer acquires the company and relocates it in Oinville, 50 km from Paris. His son, Max Auguste Sauer, undertakes the construction between 1895 and 1900 of a highly modern steam plant in Hardricourt. It was not until 1925 that the manufacture of fine brushes was transferred to Saint-Brieuc by Max Sauer Jr. After the death of Max Sauer in 1960, the Max Sauer Company, directed by Michel and Gérard Sauer is transferred in 1967 in a new factory which is expanded in 1973, 1987 and 1991. The Berge Artists materials, (founded 1920): canvas products-rolls, pre-streched, canvas boards, as well as Artists' colours, Art papers and other Artists materials from Sennelier (in 1887), are acquired and now manufactured in Brittany. All products are currently distributed in more than 55 countries around the world. With the fifth generation, the Company's succession is now represented by Eric Sauer since 1987. Innovation, research and development, are combined to tradition and know-how. Family rigour in the management, team-work, superlative quality and customer service all remain the top priorities of the Max Sauer Company. Premium Beauty News - In fact, when did the company exactly begin the purely ""cosmetic"" activity? And what is the difference between artists brushesfrom the ones intended for applications on the face, eyes and lips? Pascal Goossens - It goes back to more than fifty years, when major cosmetic brands asked us to manufacture their branded brushes. The market naturally developed thereafter. The two main differences concern firstly the nature of the hairs used. Indeed, the choice of the hair or of the fibre is related to the use of the brush, depending of applications and textures. Then shapes are different, also depending of the type of application. Premium Beauty News - Brush designing and manufacturing truly concerns an almost unique area of expertise. To which times do the very first brushes date back? Pascal Goossens - The exact date of manufacture of the first artists' brushes in France is unknown. In the past, artists would learn to make their own brushes as well as their own colours. 2000 years BC, the Chinese had the idea of inserting natural hairs into bamboos, to write their ideograms. Then in 1730, appeared metal ferrules. It was not until shortly before 1789 that the first workshops, then factories started to appear. French manufacturing had at the beginning a very large monopoly, then Germans from Nürnberg came to learn the French technology. This is why the French form of artist brushes is still the most used around the world. Our brushes are made by highly skilled workers, the ""pincelières"". Products are controlled at each stage of the manufacturing process. Handles and ferrules are selected to offer solid brushes with a flawless finish. The tradition and know-how of our brush makers has been passed on from generation to generation and the extreme care we take to prepare the fine hairs before the manufacturing stages result in supreme quality for the end user. More than 30 people are required for the manufacture of a brush which requires on average three weeks preparation before the brush is completed. The tuft is never cut but made entirely by hand. Extra-fine or fine bristles are conical and have a unique natural ""flag"" which gives the brush its incomparable softness particularly appreciated for all cosmetic applications. Premium Beauty News - It is was rather surprising, in fact to see, while visiting you, that this ""cosmetic"" activity represented nearly a third of your business and that ""discretion"" forced you to create a dedicated website only in a few days! Pascal Goossens - That is true, but we work with major brands and our relationships are both very old and based on trust and loyalty. And it is also in very close partnership with them that we develop a lot of novelties in the form of fully customized products. Premium Beauty News - The make-up brush seems to have been given a real lease of life. Pascal Goossens - Absolutely! And professional make-up Artists, very demanding in terms of quality, are the ones that help the market move forward with quality products. We have developed a true specialty in custom-made brushes. Premium Beauty News - What main industrial and/or commercial investments have you planed in the coming months? Pascal Goossens - We want to focus our efforts on international development which today represents 35% of our cosmetic activity (in direct sales, apart from sales performed abroad which are conducted by our clients). Its among others, at this level that our new website will enable us to showcase our long standing expertise."
"Perfumers want to defend the ""accomplishments of the nose""","The French fragrance community gathered last week in the former Potocki Palace, where is now seated the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the French Perfumers Society (SFP), which counts 800 members, including 300 perfumers, that is to say nearly half of the World's ""noses"". The celebration was marked by three main events: the launch of a rose variety selected for its scent with the participation SFP members and called the ""Rose des Parfumeurs"", the founding of the International Circle of Perfumer-Creators, and the announcement of the winner of the 2012 International Perfumer-Creator Award, Virginie Armand, perfumer at Argenville. However, in the background of the festivities, discussions were focusing on the protection of fragrance creations. Would a smell of rebellion be rising among the usually so quiet noses community? The reason? To date, a fragrance is not considered an intellectual work, but only the mere result of a specific technical know-how. Consequently, it does not benefit from the protection of intellectual property rights. In France, the Court of Cassation, the appellate court of the highest instance, has never changed its opinion on this matter. On two occasions, in 2006 and 2008, despite a contrary opinion by the Paris Court of Appeal, the Court of Cassation has ruled that: ""the fragrance of a perfume, which is the result of the mere implementation of know-how, does not constitute the creation of a form of expression that can benefit from copyright protection as an intellectual work."" [1] Should we follow the reasoning of the Court of Cassation, composing a fragrance would essentially require technical knowledge and the part of the author's personality would be too low for considering it an original creative work. For anyone who knows a little bit the art perfumery and the way perfumers are working, that does not make sense! According to Matthieu Bourgeois, Associate Lawyer operating mainly in the field of intellectual property rights at the KGA law firm in Paris, there may be another explanation. ""The Court's questionable position is probably due to judges being cautious about having to cope with very difficult debates regarding the similarity between two close fragrances,"" he says. ""The Court of Cassation apparently thinks that judges would have hardly any means to evaluate similarities, since - let's not forget it - smell is and remains, in our society, human's less developed sense or, in any case, the most subjective and unequally shared."" They may lack the support of judges, but perfumers have gained the support of art connoisseurs. Last January, the French Minister of Culture at the moment, Frédéric Mitterrand, during a ceremony in which he awarded the Medal of Arts and Letters to six illustrious perfumers, expressed his desire to see ""the accomplishments of the nose recognized on par with the accomplishments of the hand."" It is the project a group of perfumers decided to tackle. The proposal by Maurice Maurin and Raymond Chaillan to create an International Circle of Perfumer-Creators [2], with the mission to enhance, promote and defend the profession of perfumer, thus immediately received wide support. The Circle will seek to unite all perfumer-creators, whether independent or under contract to composition houses or luxury brands, and regardless their country of residence. A ""Committee of Elders"" uniting 29 perfumers, around the SFP president, has been settled and the first plenary session should be held soon, in order to, as Raymond Chaillan said, ""to define and defend this difficult and often denigrated profession, (…) to voice our concern about the ongoing reduction of our palette of natural ingredients, to sound the alarm that creativity is in danger, reaching its limits — that all of the warning lights are on red."" To be continued…"
"BCM, a member of Alliance Boots, wants to be one of the key players working behind the scenes in the Beauty sector","BCM Cosmétique, which is the BCM factory in France, specialised in the formulation and filling of cosmetic products, continues throughout the years its development and to invest in its factory. With three factories in Europe, employing over 2,000 people, BCM is surely one of the market leaders in the European universe of contract manufacturing, formulating and packing, dedicated to the health and beauty industry. Overview with Marie-Christine Clerc, Sales and Marketing Director of BCM Cosmétique, in France. Premium Beauty News - In fact, the three plants dedicated to products formulation, which are owned by BCM in Europe, are completed by a fourth one focusing on packaging, isn't it? Marie-Christine Clerc - That's right! There is an additional factory based in Poland, which specialises in secondary packing, toilet bags and gift assembly. This factory is closely linked to our German plant, which is dedicated to the formulation, manufacturing and filling of colour cosmetics and is located near Frankfurt, in Dietzenbach. Premium Beauty News - So, the three formulation and packaging factories are quite complementary? Marie-Christine Clerc - They are! The one in Nottingham in England is mainly dedicated to personal care products, ancillaries, suncare products and baby products .The German factory focuses mainly on colour cosmetics and has a great expertise in lipsticks, powders, and coloured emulsions, then the French factory located in Vitré, in Brittany, can actually manufacture skincare products, ancillaries as well, colour cosmetics, sun care and hot filled technology products (foundation, blush, sticks). Premium Beauty News - This plant in Vitré has undergone and is still undergoing big changes. Marie-Christine Clerc - As you know, it is not the largest manufacturing unit of the Group, which is our factory in Nottingham, but it is the most diversified. You know, we work backstage and the key to what we do is ensuring we anticipate all new trends and translate these into how we formulate, manufacture and fill. Our factory in Vitré epitomizes it perfectly. Main characteristic: BCM in Vitré delivers 30% of its output to Alliance Boots and 70% to major external customers. Second characteristic, BCM is very flexible: under the same roof, we run small batches of premium brands with sophisticated finishing touches, highly automated filling lines and cutting edge and very efficient equipment. We have set the bar very high at Vitré since at the plant, we are FDA registered manufacturers of OTC products. Our objectives are to be compliant with ISO 22716 and to move towards IFS HPC in tandem with our plant investment over the last two years. We also formulate skin care and colour cosmetics which are Ecocert compliant. Premium Beauty News - In your presentation of this activity in France, you stress on the concept of flexibility and of anticipation of needs. Marie-Christine Clerc - That's right! In the Beauty sector it is vital to feel the ""Zeitgeist"" and anticipate future trends. We not only offer all our know-how in formulation and packaging but we make a point of innovating in offering our own formulas while staying ahead of trends. Several new BCM formulae were patented over the last two years in colour cosmetics. We imbue ourselves in the spirit and the ""DNA ""of our customers and position ourselves as a source of inspiration and ideas. Our R&D team works closely with our marketing team and project managers based in our Paris office. Anticipating is essential for us in BCM Cosmétique. As an example, we started working on the compliance with the 2013 New Cosmetics Regulation at the end of 2010 ! We extended our regulation team to reinforce our service offer in terms of establishment of cosmetics files (products safety, innocuousness, efficiency tests, claims…). Moreover, it is very important and vital for us to always have some spare production capacity. Hence the plant investments undertaken each year, for example for the new bulk manufacturing vessel for mascara and foundation which was commissioned at the end of 2010 and a new filling line for mascaras which was installed at the end of last year. Premium Beauty News - Your dual make-up / skincare expertise is a huge asset! Marie-Christine Clerc - There are obviously important bridges between our different areas of expertise, skincare, make up, hot filled technologies…. This offer which is both diversified and complementary is something our customers really appreciate. Premium Beauty News - You presented several new collections at the last Beyond Beauty tradeshow in Paris? Marie-Christine Clerc - Creativity, innovation and experience enable BCM to help brand owners and retailers to develop innovative new products inspired by current and future trends! For Beyond Beauty Paris 2012, the creative approach of BCM intended to be colourful, light, fanciful with the appropriate dose of rigour specific to formulators! At BCM we take a strategic view of the beauty sector by working behind the scenes months in advance to produce some of the most cutting-edge cosmetic formulations available to the market. Every year we anticipate beauty trends and find new inspiration to enlarge our offer. Innovation is at the core of our approach, through our regular COMIT'INOV meetings. For the Beyond Beauty 2012 event, we have focused on five key themes, each with their own direction and spirit: Re Source, Jungle Mania, Urban Wild, Grand Canyon and Sun Reflex. For RE SOURCE, it is a need of wellbeing and harmony. The return to a raw natural beauty, which is pure and Japanese-inspired. The ""Healthy Nude"" is back but updated to give an ultra-sophisticated and refined look. It's all in the art of creating a flawless and balanced look. The spotlight is on the radiant complexion. The facial features are highlighted by a colour pop of neon coral to awaken the minimalist look. Suitable for everyday, RE SOURCE consists of a range of delicate and sensual products that are ""good for the skin"" with natural, multi-functional formulas. For JUNGLE MANIA, it is blending lush verdant hues with classic forties style: the desire to escape to an exotic haven, where there is a profusion of exotic flowers and lush foliage. A return to the 1940s beauty era with a more graphic look including solid colours and clean lines. JUNGLE MANIA incorporates green and neutral tones to create a tropical woody style reminiscent of the 40s. The focus of this look is the architecture of the face, using bold graphic colours and sweeping lines to accentuate the eyes, lashes and brows. For URBAN WILD, it is an instinctive and creative palette that echoes the vibe of the city. A range of products inspired by ultra colourful street art and the gritty feel of the urban streets. Vinyl textures and powders with amazing cool effects can be applied as a sweep of solid colour or as a wash of lighter pigment. URBAN WILD is punchy, vibrant and playful with richly coloured pigments. For GRAND CANYON, it is an infusion of Light: gold highlights accentuate a summer tan and brighten hair from the first rays of the sun, a wash of pink colour accentuated with copper highlights creates a bright healthy glow for all skin tones. The hair is the key focus, adorned with gold leaves, hair jewellery, or a delicate tiara to echo the precious metals in this romantic-rock look. For SUN REFLEX, as you know, BCM has a rich heritage in sun care (70 years' experience in the UK). For summer 2013, BCM suggests a complete new range of solar products, the result of an 18 month research project. SUN REFLEX provides a wide range of formulations (creams, lotions and sprays) from focused facial skincare products with high protections SPF50+ to SPF 30 formulations and after-sun products."
"Ancorotti Cosmetics: A 2012 year, set to be a record year!","""There is no secret in this increase, assures Renato Ancorotti, quality products well suited to demand and an industrial tool that we are committed in maintaining at the highest level."" As a proof of this, the opening of new buildings in the same industrial zone as the bulk production plant. Buildings, five in total, which have mushroomed to host some 9 filling machines and storage areas. Production capacity: 4 tons of bulk/day and more than 130,000 pieces/day (mascara and/or lipgloss) in one shift. ""It's as simple as that, explains Ancorotti, a second shift and figures are doubled! To note also that in recent weeks we have been granted the ISO 14000 standard and we are also GMP approved."" Among the Italian firm's key customer countries this year, ranking first, Russia immediately followed by Germany, France and Italy."
ABC Texture: always an open ear!,"Premium Beauty News - Creating successfully one's business from scratch, a performance which seems particularly difficult nowadays? Louisette Bourdin - It is not that easy it is true! But we are a living example. Not only It is possible but it is also desirable for the sustainability of quality in the cosmetics industry. Premium Beauty News - From beginning to end, you initiated a voluntarily original process. If only for the design of the plant itself… Louisette Bourdin - You're right! Everything was devised at Saint-Brieuc with a practical focus on sustainable development. This impacted the materials which were used to build the plant, the heating system and hot water supply, the lighting of premises favouring natural light etc. In addition, our assets - industrially speaking - are a fleet of machines well adapted to both small and large batches. Hence, for foaming and fluid emulsions we have a batch ranging from 100 kg to 2.2 tonnes. And for foundations, mascaras, creams emulsions and cast products of batch ranging from 50 kg to 600 kg. We also have a 10 kg to 50 kg vacuum pilot for lipsticks. Of course we control all stages of manufacturing in compliance with GMP rules. Our factory benefits of the ""High Environmental Quality"" standards and we have a full traceability of our products via an ERP. Premium Beauty News - But it is not limited to machines, it is mostly a question of know-how! Louisette Bourdin - It is vital! The hedonic dimension of each cosmetic preparation involves the creation of new sensations and galenic forms, and a good knowledge of traditional textures. Through the development of an experiential marketing, my wish was that we really shifted to a higher dimension in terms of cosmetic services. Starting from a texture briefing, we define all aspects of the product, from its skin touch to its residual film, also taking into consideration hold, application and absorption time. Our priority is to be responsive to our customer's expectations in order to better meet their specific needs. We develop exclusive creations of tailor-made shades and textures. With this sensory marketing approach, we intend to offer our customers new, tailored and customized solutions. Our customers also benefit from our international experience. Our overseas activity enriches our adaptability regarding each country's quality standards. Products formulated by our engineers, are subjected to thorough controls and undergo extensive tests to ensure the utmost quality: – microbiological tests, – safety tests, – stability tests, – efficiency tests. While creating the products, our engineers will take care of gathering the beneficial and active properties of the raw materials and make sure to preserve the efficiency of each active ingredient. We develop tailor-made offers to meet expectations in connection with the specificity of each sector and each customer. Our passion is to create new formulas and new products, and to draw our resources from healthy products with vibrant, pearlescent and subtle colours. Our aim is to provide our customers with the natural benefits of efficient products. The smoothness of a cream, the fluidity of a foundation, the softness of a powder texture... At ABC, we recreate emotions through the match of enthralling textures, delicate fragrances and sensual colours, arousing new sensations. Natural and reassuring, they reflect the complicity of traditional know-how with intensely magical moments. Our mastery in the formulation of various specific skincare products (face, body, sun care...) generates reliable products and is a guarantee for our customers to benefit from the latest innovations and from all our know-how dedicated to their well-being. Premium Beauty News - What is today in your activity the share between skincare products, sunscreens and make up? How much does export account for? Pierre-Henry Mercier - Sun care products alone represent 50% of our activity, followed by make-up (30%) and then skincare (20%). The export share is still potential (20%), but it has sometimes reached 60%. Premium Beauty News - Innovation is truly a second nature! A few examples? Pierre-Henry Mercier - Absolutely! And, as Louisette Bourdin explained before, we want to use all the assets we have to be successful. In 2005, we developed a no rinse cleansing gel, quite a technical feat at the time. In 2006, it was the turn for octocrylene-free sunscreens. We also presented in 2011 a BB Cream with encapsulated pigments and, more recently, a lipstick capable of reactivating the gloss using a simple mechanical effect."
Bullier-Pinceaux Léonard: a passion for innovation!,"Premium Beauty News - Innovation is probably what best characterizes your approach? Stéphanie Bullier - That's true, we can say it has been in the family genes for seven generations. We always pay careful attention to all evolutions, not to say ""revolutions"" that could have an influence on our activity of brush manufacturers. And the development of the ebrush 1S represents to date one of the most original illustration. This brush makes it possible to draw and make up on all capacitive touch screens on the market. The EBrush 1S which was granted the jury's ""Coup de Cœur"" Award at the last MakeUp in Paris trade show, was designed with the same special care as all our brushes. This brush enables a make-up simulation and gives free rein to creation by opening the door to a whole new vision of make-up, a high-tech vision. Premium Beauty News - People have no idea of the expertise it takes to make a make-up brush? Stéphanie Bullier - As you know, a brush consists of three main parts, the handle, the metal ferrule, and of course, the hair or the fibres. Clearly, the most important part of a brush is the hair. Looking at a hair, one can observe the ""root"" and the pointed tip called the ""flag"" It's the flag that makes the fineness of a brush, so it must be kept intact and never cut. Before beginning the manufacturing of brushes, every hair within a bundle must have its flag at the same level. This is where vibrating machines come into play: the hair is placed in metal rings above which wooden plates operate up and down with rapid but minimum oscillation. To make sure that no hair remains standing out, we dust plaster powder over the bundles to keep the hair slippery. Then the hair is inserted into a first flat and thick bottomed cylindrical brass mould that we tap on a marble slab to let the hair settle down on the flag. The hair is then ready for the manufacture of square ended brushes. For curved or pointed brushes, we use a second specific mould, with a rounded bottom. Once the hair has settled down at the bottom of the mould, we tie the root up with a linen thread. To give the lock a more pointed shape, it is rolled between the fingers. At this stage the dexterity of the worker is fundamental and can only be acquired through years of experience. The fineness of the flag varies with the type of hair. The finer it is, the more expensive the hair is. The other important characteristics of the hair are its springiness, its ability to become straight again after having been bent, and its capacity to retain liquids. There are also a lot of varieties of synthetic fibres that look more and more like natural hair. Brushes are made the same way. But what really makes the difference is the proper assembly of the hair, and this is the result of a long standing brush making tradition of which we can be proud. Premium Beauty News - In spite of the international competition and, in particular, coming from regions like Asia or India, it is still possible to keep manufacturing in 2012 make-up brushes in Brittany? Fred Ghenassia - Of course it is possible! Bullier-Pinceaux Léonard employs 35 people, and even if the sourcing is partly done in India for some product lines, our finest pieces are achieved in Saint Brieuc. Remember that there's up to eight different stages to make a brush. This requires a very specific expertise and excellent workmanship. Our expertise in manufacturing allows us also to innovate in terms of materials used, on the shape of the brush and of the hair or fibres, on the type of handle or the ferrule.... We have for example patented a new form of ferrule enabling a new gesture for the application of the product on the face. Premium Beauty News - Are the times auspicious for make-up brushes? Stéphanie Bullier - Well in fact yes absolutely! And it is mainly due to the professional make-up industry who wanted, a few years ago, to find alternatives to the use, of very average quality brushes coming from emerging countries. These professionals opted for quality which definitely gave us a boost. A phenomenon which then attracted most brands. Quality = expertise, expertise = Bullier/Pinceaux Léonard. Today we work with the most renown brands. We are also specialists in small and medium series, from 100 to 1000 pieces. And the ""cosmetic"" share in our activity keeps growing, reaching now more than 55% of our turnover."
RPM acquires leading nail enamels manufacturer Kirker Enterprises,"It is quite an event in the nail polish industry. In the context of a booming nail care market, one of the world's leading manufacturers, the US-based Kirker Enterprises, has just fallen into the hands of RPM International, a holding which was mainly used to operate in the construction industry. Based in Paterson, New Jersey, Kirker has annual sales in excess of US$100 million. Founded more than fifty years ago, the company runs manufacturing facilities in Europe and in the United States. The company supplies several of the most famous brands and also offers full service options for the creation enamel lines. This acquisition is a very first foray in the cosmetics industry for RPM International, a group of companies specialising in corrosion control and flooring coatings, roofing systems, sealants and specialty chemicals, primarily for building maintenance and improvement. ""Kirker will operate as a stand-alone company within our RPM business group and continue to provide its customers the same level of outstanding service and innovation to which they are accustomed. Through our many companies, RPM has among the broadest coatings technologies in the world, and Kirker will be able to access these technologies to bring even more innovation to the personal care industry,"" stated Frank C. Sullivan, RPM chairman and chief executive officer. ""We're proud to have Kirker's management team join RPM."" Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed."
"""Being organic is not enough,"" Thierry Logre, Phyt's","Premium Beauty News - Phyt's will be celebrating this year its 40th anniversary. It is considered today one of the greatest achievements in natural and organic cosmetics in France. This choice to go green goes back to the very origin of the brand? Thierry Logre - Yes absolutely! From its creation in 1972 by Jean-Paul Llopart a naturopath, and biologist and Rosanne Verlé a beautician, Phyt's - then called Phytal - made the bet of natural cosmetics and also looked for ways to avoid the use of preservatives in its products. It was an extremely innovative approach at the time. Also from the outset, the brand targeted the segment of beauty institutes and Jean-Paul Llopart laid the foundations of what he calls the ""Naturo-Esthetique®."" To protect its formulas, Phyt's introduces single use packaging in the form of disposable glass ampoules. In 1974, a patent was even filed for the conditioning in ampoules of pasty or semi-thick skin care products. Very intuitively and empirically, Jean-Paul Llopart then successfully manages to use other types of packaging, to broaden the possibilities of use of products while avoiding interactions with the external environment. This choice for natural materials is at the heart of the brand identity. This is what led him in 2002 to partner with others precursors for the creation of the Cosmébio charter, which truly launched certification in the field of natural and organic cosmetics. But Phyt's is before all a brand intended for beauty institutes. This means that even if our products are natural, they are primarily efficient and pleasant to use. They are tested clinically and under dermatological control for claim support. And we do not hesitate to say that we are as efficient as chemistry, because we can prove it. This is what we intend to summarize under the ""Bio-Active Cosmetics"" concept. Premium Beauty News - This efficiency explains your outstanding success while other organic cosmetic brands seem to be struggling to conquer a truly consistent market share? Thierry Logre - Undoubtedly, the commercial development of natural and organic cosmetics has not been up to expectations. From this point of view, we could say that bio is a failure in cosmetics. The market is stagnant and is only boosted by optimized formulas offered by large groups. So why don't most natural or organic cosmetics manage to line up on the market against their conventional competitors? There are several reasons to this, I think. First because preservatives that can be used in organic cosmetics - the ones which are allowed by Ecocert standards or Qualité France - are often irritating. And secondly they damage the texture of products. For a formulator, they are a real headache. Especially when certain methods for organic formulation, particularly when hydrosol-based formulas are used, make their use necessary. This is one of the reasons why Phyt's has always advocated for preservative-free cosmetics. But it is a know-how that few companies have mastered. But this explanation is probably not sufficient. After all, some beautiful textures in organic cosmetics are still available. The mistake was to believe that claiming to be bio was enough to sell bio. We saw that, particularly with some private labels, for which in spite of beautiful development investments, neither marketing nor merchandising were equal to ambitions. Premium Beauty News - What are your goals now? Thierry Logre - Today the Phyt's brand is present in more than 3,000 outlets in France. We are probably the leading brand in this market segment in terms of distribution. As far as sales are concerned, we are at the second or third place. So we still have room for progress to conquer beauty institutes achieving the largest turnover. We are continuing our progression while this market is experiencing a mild recession in France. Clearly, our goal now is to develop our export sales, with two key areas: Asia and North America. In Asia we have managed to increase our turnover twofold every three years. We have sales offices in Seoul and Kuala Lumpur. Today, Korea, Japan and China, including Hong Kong, are drivers for the brand. Malaysia and Singapore recently opened are also promising. As for North America, we are well established in Canada and the United States are now following. Russia, Australia and New Zealand are also important markets for us."
"Jean-Paul Agon (L'Oréal), confident about second-half 2012","""We confirm for 2012 our ambition to outperform the market, and achieve another year of growth in sales, results and profitability,"" summed-up Jean-Paul Agon, L'Oréal's CEO at the end of the presentation of the French cosmetics giant's first-half results. While they are slightly below expectations of financial analysts, the 10.5 per cent growth in sales (+6.7 per cent at constant exchange rates) and the 11.4 per cent growth of the operating profit, are even more impressive as they come from all the group's divisions: +7.3% for professional products, +8.1% for consumer products, +6.6% for active cosmetics and, above all, +17.9% for luxury products (respectively: +2.9%, +4.7%, +5.4% and +10.4% at constant exchange rates). The group has particularly benefited from the strong growth of its luxury division that is dramatically bouncing back after the harsh years that followed the 2008 crisis. Lancôme is reporting double-digit growth, Khiel's is growing by more than 20%, and Clarisonic by more than 40%. Geographically speaking, the group's growth is clearly driven by the dynamism of ""new markets"" (Asia, Pacific, Latin America, Africa, Middle East, Eastern Europe). Outside these areas, L'Oréal's growth remains strong in North America (+7.3% at constant exchange rates), while the group grew by 0.8% (at constant exchange rates) only in Western Europe. However, Jean-Paul Agon highlights the group gained market share in all geographic areas outperforming the market everywhere. For instance, while the cosmetics market grew by 3 or 4% in the United States, L'Oréal increased sales by 7 to 8%. Even in France, the group's home market and the country where it has the biggest market share, L'Oréal grew 4%, in a flat growth context. As far as product categories are concerned: skin care products enjoyed the highest rate, followed by perfumes and makeup, hair care and hair dyes recording lower rates. Of course, as pointed out by Jean-Paul Agon, half-year figures are not particularly representative of the whole-year activity. However, the group confirm its growth target for 2012, as the global cosmetics market should grow by 4%. ""Despite the strong uncertainties of the economic environment, we are considering the second half year with confidence. The cosmetics market is expected to remain buoyant, although we noticed clear signs of slow down during the summer, for instance in the Asian and US luxury markets and in travel retail,"" he said. According to Jean-Paul Agon, the slow down of sales in Asia is particularly spectacular in Korea, where the market for luxury goods, which was growing by 20% two years ago, could record a flat growth this year. The group also noted a significant decrease in passenger flows and consumption in Asian airports. Nevertheless, Jean-Jacques Agon confirms its growth expectations for the group, saying that it is primarily the result of initiatives, innovations and launches from its brands. In view of scheduled launches, he also anticipates the 4th quarter should outpaced the third one. However, Jean-Jacques Agon admitted L'Oréal had to adapt its marketing mix in the European countries that are strongly impacted by the crisis. ""In Greece or in Spain, it is probably smarter today to invest in promotional activities rather than in television advertising."""

Gabriele Fuchs - As we have teams in all these countries we can fully cover all major show and events and work very intensively with the big associations e.g. as the Fragrance Foundation, ICMAD, HBA Global, MakeUp in Paris, MakeUp in New York, the Make Up Show in the US and in Europe, the FEBEA and Beyond Beauty in France as the VKE and the IKW in Germany. Premium Beauty News - What are your prospects for growth? Gabriele Fuchs - Every year we invest about 15% of our revenues in new technologies and updates- as the new design with a wider screen in 2012. Additional services as the drop-box–function, the topic of the week and our expert pools are highly accepted. We experience each year a double-digit growth - amazing in itself after 12 years on the market. And of course we are looking into new countries in Europe as overseas. The goal is to develop the network faster and we are searching for partners with the same enthusiasm and vigour."
Institut Caméane launches its creative offering,"The strategy of gradual recovery led by Anne Delleur, President of Institut Caméane, paid off. Four years after its return on the market Arcancil can now consider moving a step beyond. The brand, which achieved about 3.5 million euros in turnover of which almost 70% abroad, now offers more than 300 SKUs, distributed in almost thirty countries. In France, Arcancil is available in 150 outlets. ""We have partnerships with strong and highly motivated international distributors, and in markets with high potential but where barriers to entry are lower than in France. We are growing in all countries we have open. The first step was to limit the number of doors to reconstruct a high quality positioning and we are now in a second phase with the expansion of our distribution network in each market. Our goal now is to strengthen Arcancil at all levels, including its distribution in France and the expansion of the product portfolio to double our turnover within three years,"" explains Anne Delleur. To get the best from this new stage and accelerate growth, the President of Institut Caméane made sure to stabilize the company's financial structure and increase its funding. CAM Cereals, which held 51% of Institut Caméane came out of the capital and Anne Delleur, which controlled the remaining shares, took the majority with the support of French equity funds OSEO and FSI Régions. Thus, the company is ready to address new challenges. Effective May 2012, the end of the exclusive distribution agreement with Galeries Lafayette, should allow Arcancil to reach 300 or 500 doors within three years, therefore increasing its potential on the French territory. Internationally, Arcancil prepares its return to Russia and the rest of Eastern Europe where the brand still enjoys a strong reputation. In this context, Arcancil is broadening its products portfolio and aims to reach more than 500 references within three years. The brand's displays for eyes products have been completely redesigned and are being deployed at Galeries Lafayette. ""We came out from the usual pattern with mascaras on a side and eyeliners or eye shadows on the other, and we have created an 'Eye Color Bar', presenting products according to their colour range, not their category. Assorted colours of eye shadows, eyeliners and mascaras are gathered. This new 'Eye Color Bar' has been tested and facilitates consumers' choice and encourage impulse buying. In order to further increase the average purchase, we have also placed our Smoky Eyes Cabaret makeup kits, available in eight colour assortments, next to the matching colours in the bar,"" says Anne Delleur. Parallel to the development of Arcancil, Institut Caméane is launching its new private labelling division. ""Our goal is to be recognized as a makeup expert,"" announces Anne Delleur. According to the Institut Caméane's President, the demand for private make-up brands is particularly strong. ""Retailers we work with around the world generally express common requirements: a European brand, possibly French or Italian, with products offering good value for money and the possibility of exclusive agreements. But when we look at the make-up market, brands there are hardly any brands that meet all these criteria. Private labelling therefore comes as the solution."" But in the makeup sector, where 30% of all SKUs are replaced every year, there are challenges to overcome. Not only in terms of development, but also in terms of stock management and merchandising. ""This product category requires real expertise,"" confirms Anne Delleur. And retailers that have to handle all kinds of cosmetics cannot be experts in all areas. ""We have this expertise, and the fact that we develop our own brand is a real asset because we have a real knowledge of markets and of the operational reality. We will not recreate Arcancil under another name, but offer our expertise for the development of specific lines, adapted to local market needs."" Institut Caméane also plans to draw on the expertise gained in ethnic makeup lines including the specific developments for certain skin tones, as well as on its knowledge of makeup habits around the world. Indeed, in the context of its strategy to boost Arcancil on international markets, Institut Caméane continuously grew a very good knowledge regarding the particularities of each market. This led to the development, for darker skin types, of mattifying foundations formulated with specific rates of pigments, or alternatively, of liquid foundations and powders in pinky shades adapted to carnations of a market as Kuwait, or even ultra-pigmented eyeshadows for the Brazilian market. Institut Caméane more specifically targets retailers with 100 to 500 outlets. The first contract has been signed for a launch scheduled for late 2013 / early 2014 and the company aims to develop about ten lines in the next five years. Ultimately, this may require acquiring manufacturing or filling industrial facilities."
Topline opens a subsidiary in Brazil,"A press conference organised on June 8th in the new offices of Topline Products-Primapack in the business district of Paris-La Defense which was the opportunity for Charles Chang, CEO, to outline the key points of his strategy before the entire French team of the Group. ""Topline Products, he recalled, designs and delivers standard and custom-made packagings, for make-up, personal care, perfumes products and turnkey solutions that include formulation and filling. This unique expertise in full service is made possible with the management of factories directly owned by our Asian network of industry partners whose specialties encompass the full array of needs of stakeholders in the beauty sector. But in addition to manufacturing, we focus on designing, and each year we develop innovative features and designs. To date we own more than forty patents."" To note in this regard, one of the latest developments launched in the U.S.: a new two-in-one eyeshadow, Ultimate Performance Brightening for Mally Beauty, the brand of Mally Roncal, a make-up Artist of celebrities. ""First step, we were explained at Topline, the colour base is applied with the foam applicator in order to apply the right quantity of formula. Ultra comfortable, the formula glides to moisturise, smooth and unify the eyelids. Second step, with the use of the tipped roll-on, the light powder settles gently without overloading eyelids. Both formulas unite perfectly to illuminate the look and create an intense and long lasting result."" As for the packaging of this duo eyeshadow it takes up the green pearl lacquering, dear to the American brand. The content of the coloured base was injected as clear as possible to enhance the colour and allow the consumer to select her shade. Finally, the fibres of the foam applicator were selected to enable the most comfortable application possible. ""Innovation is really our vocation and driver,"" stressed Chang. ""Manufacture... anyone can manufacture! But innovating is a different story! And I can tell you that we are currently working on a really innovative new lipstick tube concept which will also meet new environmental requirements. We don't just manufacture according to the specifications provided by the customer. Our integrated teams in marketing and formulation can play a part upstream in the range creation, be a source of proposals or advise clients on trends, the choice of formulations and on the industrial feasibility of their projects."" Second important point for Topline's leader, social responsibility. ""Nothing is possible in our business without adequate training,"" insisted Chang. ""That's why, as you know, I've decided to get involved in the development of Packaging Engineering at the Rutgers University with the creation of an Advisory Board consisting of leaders and policy makers with a business or industry experience, or with government functions or in the education area, and who can provide us with help and advice."" Spearhead in the U.S. group strategy, its full service activity, which currently represents 35% of sales but is expected to reach 50% very quickly. For example, today, according to customer needs and formulas, Topline Products adapts its model and can either send an European or U.S. formula to China to only undertake the packaging, or propose a turnkey product made in China (formula , primary packaging, secondary packaging) or send the European formula to Mexico to have it conditioned in some Chinese or U.S. packagings and thus be the closest as possible to the U.S. and South American markets. Hence, a comprehensive service, since the Group is capable of delivering a complete packaging - including the instructions for use - ready to be lined on the shelves! Founded in 2002, Primapack designs and develops primary, specific or standard packagings in the field of personal care, make-up and perfume. A specialist in plastic and metal injection, multi-material, decoration and various surface treatments, forming, galvanizing and electroplating, the firm manufactures packaging for most major brands in the beauty and skincare segment. ""This acquisition was perfectly in line with our strategic goals, explained Chang, which are to provide very high quality products and services at a local scale and streamline the production line, while increasing our market responsiveness."" ""For us, this merger had huge advantages, underlined Jean-Luc Haulet, the General Manager of Topline-Primapack. Since our inception we were only involved in trading activities, and we now have become real industrialists with a significant size and an unquestionable legitimacy. Our company is strengthening its technical expertise - a technical office both in Paris and in the U.S. - and its ability to innovate thanks to dedicated resources. Another plus: we now offer a full-service expertise."""
L'Oréal Brasil: a winning strategy for make-up!,"Premium Beauty News - You do confirm this fact! Brazil is about to become one of the make-up markets among the largest in the world! Vivian Steinhäuser - Not only do I confirm this, but I can tell you that it's already true in many segments. This is a sure fact for nail polish. Just look at the performance posted by our brand Colorama that we bought in 2001. All other segments are also growing, apart from, paradoxically, lipstick that remains an important segment but which has been suffering, in recent months, of the dynamism of the others segments, that grows a lot. Premium Beauty News - A specific market, that of the Brazilian market of Beauty! Vivian Steinhäuser - Quite specific, indeed! Since most of the sales occur through door to door selling, a niche where we are not present. Fortunately all the other distribution channels are changing fast. There are about 7000 chains and more than 53,000 independents. A network that we have decided to invest systematically for the past two years and this, successfully! There is also the power of communication that the internet represents nowadays. You have no idea of the number of bloggers who express themselves, on nail polish for example. And Maybelline has now, in Brazil, more than 300,000 ""fans"" in Facebook its pages. A commercial and communication strategy that would not have been possible if we hadn't undertaken substantial work on our brands and by giving and continuing to give a voice to women. It must be said that in the past fifteen years, ""they"" have changed quit a lot. ""They"" have become more mature, just like, incidentally the distribution networks. We also see more and more openings of malls with all the opportunities it offers for creating temporary poles of attraction. Premium Beauty News - Commercial successes which should therefore lead to industrial investments because, for now, most of your products are imported? Vivian Steinhäuser - Of course, this opens interesting perspectives but it is too early to talk about them. Our two plants, one of them located in Sao Paulo, and the other one in Rio de Janeiro, mostly manufacture products for the skin-care, hair-care and nail markets. We have doubled in two years the sales volume of the Maybelline branded products. The potential is there. Roughly, 85 million Brazilian women use make-up products every day and they use them more and more! They are better informed and have higher incomes."

""I have understood its functioning and development potential,"" she wished to underline. ""I am delighted to join the board and share with others members our experiences and insights of the beauty industry, to better anticipate its future."" Yann Lefrancq, the new Secretary General, has been heading the French subsidiary of German glassmaker Heinz Glas since 2007. As for Jean-Yves Bourgeois, he is currently one of the managers of the Beauteam company, which publishes the PremiumBeautyNews.com website and organizes the trade shows MakeUp in Paris, MakeUp in New York and, soon, of MakeUp in Sao Paulo. He is also one of the co-founders of the BeautyFull Club. The members of the BeautyFull Club have unanimously commended the four-year presidency of Charles-Emmanuel Gounod, during which most of the association's objectives were met. ""I was delighted to have contributed to the creation of this club initiated by Jean-Yves Bourgeois. These were four years of great satisfaction during which we had to indeed overcome some obstacles but where the passion of members never failed. Our almost monthly appointments have never ceased to attract a growing number people thanks to the quality of speakers and debates. The latest initiatives in this area, for which several members, including Philippe de Brugière and William Hitchon are attributable, enabled us to benefit from the assistance of grandes écoles and turned out being real successes. Of course, much remains to be done, but I'm convinced the new team has all the required qualities to take up the torch,"" declared Charles-Emmanuel Gounod this week. He will remain an active member of the Club. An equivalent tribute was made to Francis Camilli who contributed greatly, as Secretary General, not only to ""keep the keys of the temple"" as he liked to say, but also to the reputation of the Club through his enthusiasm and interpersonal skills. ""And many thanks to Daniel Saclier, who of course remains an active member of the Club and who has actively contributed to its reputation within the world of brands and was instrumental in setting up the website,"" emphasised Jean-Yves Bourgeois. Many projects and ideas are already in the pipeline: intensify with the grandes écoles the partnership and sponsoring actions, provide always more ""food for thoughts"" through news conferences and new surveys, intensify communication, thanks to, among other things, the website, initiate an offensive recruitment strategy, build bridging relationships with other professional groups by increasing synergies, create a great annual event that would bring together the entire profession, internationalize the activities as much as possible... There is no shortage of ideas."
"CCI Productions: the ""global"" beauty service","Premium Beauty News - Who are you? Isabelle Legallicier - We are specialized in the manufacture of perfumes and cosmetics for Prestige brands. The goal is to offer our customers a range of customised services such as formulation, regulation, manufacturing and packaging. We have two manufacturing plants, one in Acquigny in Normandy on an area of 118,000 sq ft which has 20 automated and manual packaging lines to manufacture high-end products, with ""Haute-Couture"" finishes. The second site, in Echemiré near Angers on a production area of 49,500 sq ft and which hosts 8 automated and manual packaging lines to also manufacture products with exceptional finishes. Premium Beauty News - But it does not only concern filling operations, since you can also manufacture and pack complex products! Isabelle Legallicier - Absolutely! Our perfume labs manufacture alcohol solutions (from the automated maceration of 100 to 10,000 litres, to continuous sealing/filtration and colouring) with an annual capacity of 2.56 million litres. We work from the development of the project to the industrialization of the product. Our 28 automatic lines are scalable to any packaging operations and shape the most creative packaging. Thus, beyond traditional formats, We are able to work with the most unusual packaging shapes such as diamonds, trapezoids and spheres, to which we give a cellophane finish, providing more than mere protection. We can also say that we are real experts in high-end finishes. Our workshops are skilled in the art of baudruchage and gold threading, giving bottles the finest possible decorative effects. Moreover, in our cosmetics department, we also manufacture a wide range of beauty care and hygiene products in all dosage forms. The GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) Industrial processes of this unit are annually recognized compliant with the Ecocert standards and have been awarded the labels Nature & Progrès, Cosmebio, they are FDA approved and have received the Santé Canada certification. Premium Beauty News - End of last year, you decided to create a ""Haute-Couture Studio""! Isabelle Legallicier - We always wanted to position ourselves as a leading partner. This new ""Haute-Couture Studio"" intends to bring our customers' creations to life by working on small series and highly sophisticated products with qualified personnel and appropriate techniques. The aim of this workshop is to respond specifically to each packaging operation. It has been equipped with cutting edge equipment and is backed up by our proven expertise, including the control of production costs.

And in addition, our Regulatory service will assist our clients, from the development to the marketing of their products, whatever the geographical area. Finally, in partnership with our expert toxicologist, we also insure product cosmetovigilance. Premium Beauty News - The opportunity to recall the regulatory deadline of July 11, 2013! Isabelle Legallicier - Absolutely, because each brand, being responsible for placing on the market, must undertake the electronic registration of its cosmetics no later than July 11, 2013. May I recall that this procedure, made mandatory by the European Cosmetics Regulation (EC) No. 1223/2009, concerns cosmetics available for sale, as of 11 July 2013, in one of the 28 member states, whatever their original date of commercialization. The aim of this obligation is to: – Harmonize the legislation across member states thus allowing the free movement of cosmetic products on the European market. – Ensure consumer protection. – Reduce bureaucracy and company costs. Hence, our task is: – To assist our customers in managing these new requirements. – To organize the notification. – To undertake the electronic registration. By launching this new regulatory service, we offer our customers our expertise in cosmetic regulations and their developments. By outsourcing electronic notifications, each customer can fulfil his obligations in complete peace of mind."
Stila: Constantly on the move!,"Premium Beauty News - The name Stila was derived from the Italian word ""stilare,"" which means ""to pen."" Stila's official website states that the name was chosen because they believe ""every woman's makeup should be as individual as her own signature."" Is this true? Jill Tomandl - Makeup should enhance the customers best features and compliment her lifestyle, so each woman's makeup wardrobe will be unique. Stila is a professional make-up artistry brand that delivers prestige, high quality, performance based products to professional makeup artists, consumers, and celebrities. Stila is also known for innovative packaging. The Stila Brand positioning describes Stila as ""a carefree cosmetics brand that is as fun as a fantasy, as individual as a signature, and as inspiring as a dream. Every day is a new day to put your best face forward. You are now your own artist. Celebrate your individual style."" Premium Beauty News - You are a very creative person and obviously you are never short of new ideas? Jill Tomandl - I love coming up with new ideas for products, packaging or innovative programs! I feel so fortunate to be able to make an impact at a company that values creativity and innovation. We launch new core line products, limited collections and exclusive items seasonally (spring, summer, fall, and holiday.) Examples of promotional collections launched by Stila include Stila for E! Live from the Red Carpet tm Collection, Barbie loves Stila Collection, Breast Cancer Awareness Palettes, several movie partnership and fashion collaborations. Premium Beauty News - The latest novelty to date in terms of packaging is the first solar powered, light up compact that is fully rechargeable that you just launched some weeks ago. Jill Tomandl - Yes, this is the first ever compact with a solar panel on the lid. When opened, LED's illuminate the reversed out Stila logo on the lid and the lights around the internal mirror allowing clear visibility for application in any lighting conditions. The compact is supplied by HCP. The compact comes filled with a duo of translucent and shimmer pressed powder that give skin a healthy, shine free, radiance for any red or green carpet appearance. The compact can be refilled with Illuminating Powder Foundation. The glass, solar cell panel has a five-year lifespan and is fully charged in nine hours of sunlight. The green star on the cover indicates the compact is charged. The glass solar panel is protected by a clear cling with 2 passes of silkscreen including the E! Live from the Red Carpet TM logo. Premium Beauty News - Can you give us more examples of this creativity? Jill Tomandl - The first time Stila offered a blockbuster eye shadow palette, it had to be innovative. In order to make the palette unique, I designed a compact inspired by the Color Wheel with the eye shadows positioned, so it is easy for customer to understand how to combine colors and apply each look. Blockbuster palettes are often overwhelming with too many shades and consumers tend to use only the neutral, wearable shades. There is a Dream Catcher inspired blockbuster palette and a new version launching for Holiday 12. The custom tooled eye shadow pans and compacts create a visually impactful design through the clear window, allowing the shades to be visible in an open sell, retail environment. There is an instructional lookbook and App for each palette to further assist customers in completing the looks. It is a Stila tradition to include a motivational quote inside the eye shadow compact, so it was printed on the dust cover."
Ziba Beauty: pushing the limits of make-up!,"Premium Beauty News - Your commitment, both personal and professional, goes well beyond the mere creation and management of a company specializing in the beauty industry. Sumita Batra - As a family business, it is very much our passion and indeed goes well beyond the basics of business development! Kundan Sabarwal, Suman Patel and myself, have our eyes on the future and are poised to grow Ziba Beauty in two primary areas : First, store expansion. It means that, with a keen eye towards the national scene, we lead hundreds of employees and are rapidly expanding the Ziba Beauty brand presence in California. Second, based on the increasing demand for The Art of Threading®, we have developed a plan that allows a unique specialized art form to grow our locations by constantly bringing new clients into our studio's, as well as a strong, loyal repeat client base. In addition to the core management team, we have an enviable list of industry experts in the areas of branding, retail design and real estate. Premium Beauty News - What is The Art of Threading® exactly? Sumita Batra - The Art of Threading® is a non-invasive hair removal technique used primarily for eyebrow shaping. A piece of cotton thread is twisted and run along the skin to grab and remove hair from the follicle. This type of hair removal is prevalent in all parts of Asia, and is a common method used to remove unwanted facial hair. Compared to waxing, one does not have to wait for the hair to be a certain length to be removed. When using The Art of Threading®, a Ziba Artist can remove a single hair or even an entire line of hair in one quick twist. This allows for the brow to be precisely defined and customized to suit each individual. Since the face is the most sensitive area of the body, The Art of Threading® is the ideal application for hair removal. The swift movement of thread by a Ziba Artist also exfoliates dead skin. Fans of threading attest that the service does not cause any rashes or skin irritations common with other hair removal techniques. Regular threading can maintain a clean and sharp appearance of eyebrows without the usual side effects of waxing and shaving. Premium Beauty News - You also have another specialty which has greatly contributed to your reputation too. The one you call The Art of Mehndi® which also extends to The Art of Glitter Mehndi®. A few explanations for the layman... Sumita Batra - The mehndi is a temporary popular form of tattoo, used in various Muslim Arab countries and in Asia. It is often designed, according to ethnic models of varying complexity, especially on the hands and feet, because the skin is thicker in these areas and because of a desire to increase the hold of the colouration over time. In Bangladesh, Kashmir and Sudan, this form of body art is used for weddings for both newlyweds. In Rajasthan (northwestern India), the mehndi is a folk art, and it is common for women to perform designs on them just as refined as those of newlyweds. The preparation of the henna paste is made by grinding the dried leaves of henna to obtain a powder. According to traditions, the powder is mixed with water or a darker liquid such as tea or coffee to darken the colour. Lemon juice can also be added (to release the dye) and sugar (for consistency). The resulting paste is applied, often in very fine drawings (using a small pouch or even a syringe). The contact time with skin having an influence on the hold, the paste is often left on the skin for up to 6 hours before being removed. To increase the drying process of the residue, hands are not washed for several hours. The tattoo can stay as long as a few days up to two weeks depending on the drying time but also the nature of the skin (perspiration or heat promotes discolouration), red-brown colours naturally change to orange before disappearing. Henna mehndi is temporary on the surface of the skin while the tattoo is a permanent and surgical insertion of a dye under the skin. Premium Beauty News - The Art of Glitter Mehndi is an even more sophisticated form with the addition of real jewels on the skin? Sumita Batra - Yes, that's right! Glitter Mehndi can be enhanced with Crystals and other sparkling jewels to create spectacular body art. It started as a new form of accessory for brides, and has now become the most sought after service for special occasions at Ziba Beauty. Premium Beauty News - You also created your own Academy? Sumita Batra - We invest heavily in education and training for our technicians and we have developed a program called the Ziba Way®. The artists are certified through the Ziba Academy in a paid training program, with a focus on the study of facial structures and eyebrow shapes to suit different faces. Ziba Artists must follow stringent guidelines to become a threader. The rapid growth at the stores has created opportunities for students to learn from the Ziba Academy and to build lucrative careers. Premium Beauty News - You also designed and developed your own brand of products including a line of make-up products. Sumita Batra - Yes, and we currently achieve about two million dollars in sales in this niche. This line is a ""must have"" collection of contrast pencils, brow tools and body art. This line is sold at Ziba Beauty locations and is becoming a brand extension into the retail market. Premium Beauty News - Your vision of development is not confined to the U.S. market alone. What about Europe? Sumita Batra - We are interested in global expansion, and have developed a strategy that would allow us to grow smartly in key areas around the world, Europe being one of our geographical interests. Our plan it to expand in the US, then roll out to international markets with presence, leveraging our expertise and elevating the experience of clients all over the world when it comes to our services and products."
Topline-Primapack: A year more than ever dedicated to make-up!,"""First step"", explains Sophie Gaspin, Sales Account Manager at Topline-Primapack, ""you apply the coloured base with the foam applicator which enables to apply just the right amount of formula. Ultra comfortable, the formula glides to moisturise, smooth and unify the eyelid. Second step, the reviving effect, the brightening powder settles gently without overloading the eyelid with the roll-on tip. Both formulas unite perfectly to illuminate the look and create an intense and long lasting result. On top of it, our packaging combines technicality and simplicity for a flawless make-up, and whose format is ideal for women on the go."" It may be recalled that Topline Products designs and provides standard and specific packagings, make-up, skincare, fragrances and turnkey solutions that include the formulation and filling. An expertise in full service made possible through the management of its own factories and through its Asian network of industry partners whose specialties encompass the full range of requirements of actors in the beauty industry. Among other recent achievements of Topline-Primapack, let's mention the first collection of Swarovski lipsticks ""Crystallize Your Lips"" launched a few weeks ago. ""Long, slim and extremely pure, emphasizes Sophie Gaspin, the design of this lipstick had to be in perfect harmony with the bottle of the perfume Aura by Swarovski."" The casing is characterised by its small diameter (1.3) for a perfect and precise application. ""It is this originality that dictated the design of the mechanism, we were told at Topline-Primapack, for which we started from scratch and which is in fact more like the mechanism of a stick than that of a lipstick."" A design work that finally lasted nearly a year and a half. In addition to the specificity of this mechanism, it is a complex object. Indeed, the cap consists of two parts, a slick topper in bright silver anodized aluminium in which is inserted a piece of injected zamac, galvanized in the same shade, whose crimping required a manual adjustment. Injection enabled to created the ideal form to receive the precious contents, whose binding, positioning and sinking, manually adjusted, are worthy of jewellery work. As a result: a perfect incrustation of the stone! Also particularly studied: the subtle shade of the screen printing on the casing, the frank click sound upon closure, or the easy handling of the mechanism. With a creamy and light texture, Crystallize Your Lips is enriched with a Swarovski micronized crystal powder of iridescent pearls Crystal Shine. The grape is adorned with a imprint reminiscent of crystal facets and reveals a powdery floral scent."
Thibiant International: the American beauty!,"The ""Thibiant"" is a family first of all! In 1970, Aida Thibiant and her husband, Michel, decide to leave France to settle on the West Coast of the United States. A fresh start from scratch, him with a background in buildings and construction, her with her degree as a beautician. Aida Thibiant quickly finds a job in a hair salon. She is talented and has a lot of interpersonal skills. She soon attracts the sympathy and friendship of many personalities, especially from Showbiz. In 1973, Aida Thibiant opens her own beauty salon in Los Angeles, in the city's most mythical area, Beverly Hills, by offering in the beginning, the full range of products from the French brand Guinot. The development is such that in 1976 the father and the son, Patrick, in turn get fully involved in the business which takes the name of Francosmétique. They take this opportunity to recover the rights to sell the Guinot products throughout the United States but also start developing their own products under the brand Thibiant Beverly Hills. ""My mother and myself had very specific ideas about the kind of cosmetics we wanted to develop,"" explains Patrick Thibiant. Ideas that focused more specifically ""naturalness"". A first generation of these products appear on the market in the first months of 1980. And it's a complete success! Some more lines see the light, and in 1988, it's a further boost... through direct selling on television. ""At the time, emphasizes Patrick Thibiant, we thought with my mother...why not have a go at it!"" Especially since the use of this new marketing method suits the development of a new generation of products. Within months, sales explode! ""With television, we achieve up to US$50 million in retail sales each year,"" details Patrick Thibiant. ""We had to develop the business and give ourselves the necessary industrial means."" Especially since the good reputation of the Thibiants in the formulation area generated in parallel some requests from large cosmetics brands to perform some subcontracting. In 1990, the first contract is signed with Bath and Body Works. From this date on, the future of Thibiant International will be increasingly associated with subcontracting. In 1995 the company employs 60 people and has a turnover of USD 15 millions. That same year the family business settles in its first building in an industrial area of Chatsworth. Three years later, the decision it taken to acquire a second building, then a third one in 2001. Today, Thibiant International comprises no less than five buildings with a total area of almost 330,000 sq ft (31 000 m²). Meanwhile, in 2008, the mythical brand Thibiant Beverly Hills who helped put the group on tracks is sold. Patrick Thibiant who has been holding the reins of the company for the past ten years focuses his strategy around a strong concept which is summarized in six words: ""Innovation, Personal Care, Development and Manufacturing."" Masks, creams, products for acne, shampoos, foundations... the range is huge. ""Above all, we are formula creators,"" insists Patrick Thibiant, proud of his laboratory at the cutting edge in terms of equipments and which has 25 full time employees. New formulas but new presentations too. ""We are the ones behind the new patented filling system, explains Patrick Thibiant, which make possible the conditioning of different formulas which only mix together at the time of use."" And in addition, you can see it happen from the outside! A filling technique that enables to achieve amazing geometric effects with the different layers of products. ""It took ten years of development!"" points out Patrick Thibiant. And the future? ""It can only be tonic for us,"" says Patrick Thibiant. ""Subcontracting is a fundamental trend in the U.S., which is not ready to disappear. And some other cosmetic sectors are within our reach and just waiting to grow."""
Make-up subcontracting in the U.S.: the consistent business card of The Color Factory,"Premium Beauty News - How do you stand today in the industrial spectrum of the U.S. Beauty sector? Kathryn Geller - What can, in my opinion, best express our positioning is summed up in a few key words: ""Production capacity, flexibility, responsiveness, research and development."" The Color Factory is a complete cosmetic & skincare development and manufacturing company. We stand as the west coast leaser in all phases of contract manufacturing. Our manufacturing capabilities enable us to provide a full line of cosmetic & skincare products for lips (natural & organic, silicone mould lip stick, lip gloss, lip pencil, lip powder), for the face (pressed face powder, loose face powder, mineral and organic powder, cream and mineral foundation, tinted moisturizer, concealer), cheeks (pressed, loose blush, cream and bronzer), eyes (loose, pressed and cream eye shadow, eye liner, eye pencil, mascara), skin care (anti-aging, oil control, mineral, natural, organic, SPF), bath & bodies (cleanser, scrub, moisturizer, cellulite), and, last but not least, special categories like baked or multi-colored powders, over-sprayed design, custom hot pour, and also fragrances (liquid and solid perfume). Premium Beauty News - Impressive and comprehensive range indeed! Now, can you provide us with some figures on your production capacity? Kathryn Geller - Well I can tell you for example that we can produce about 140,000 lipsticks per week (two shifts). Our total filling capacity for tubes per week per shift is 100,000 pieces. A figure that reaches 140,000 pcs per shift for the filling of liquid lotions, and 50,000 pcs for creams. The powder area where we are certainly among the best performers in the U.S. accounts alone for nearly 50% of our business. We also have nine Dosa Pack Powder Presses with various tooling (capacity on single color, 10 000 pcs per shift; capacity on duo, trio and quads, 5000 pcs per shift), and on the other hand, one fully automatic filling line 2 X twin head Auger fillers (capacity, 15 000 pcs per shift, Auto Plus Insertion, Auto Cap Placement and Tighten, Auto Shrink band application, Auto base label application, video ink jet and laser coding). Not to mention one off single head Auger Filler (capacity, 10,000 pcs per shift). Regarding mascara and lip gloss, we can produce some 50,000 pcs per day (single shift). I must say that we have always wanted to have the ultimate in production lines. Premium Beauty News - Quality is obviously essential! Kathryn Geller - Essential of course! We work with Customers to define their quality expectations, and then we manufacture products that exceed their expectations. The Color Factory does this by qualifying all manufacturing processes with which these expectations can be met. We also verify that each defined characteristics they desire is provided through careful monitoring. We check all raw materials and components to make sure they meet the physical properties required, and to ensure they are free of all microbiological contaminants prior to use. Completed formulas are tested and color matched to the specifications of the Customer. The manufacturing process allows for the Customer to give formula approval prior to filling. The production processes are monitored very closely by production and quality employees. Upon completion, the finished products are evaluated to ensure they exceed the Customer's expectations. Premium Beauty News - You rather prefer working on large volume or do you accept smaller orders? Kathryn Geller - Our manufacturing equipment is too large to accept small orders, however from time to time we break that rule. When someone comes to us with an idea that we believe in, we go to any lengths to help them. Sometimes they turn out to be next year's large account. That being said, the minimum quantity we accept is of the order of 5,000 per shade, but it is true that the company's strategy is more focused on key accounts. We can say that we are now mostly working with ten major groups from the US Beauty sector. Premium Beauty News - Do you operate more on the mass-market segment or the upper-end one? Kathryn Geller - We have very good clients in each sector. We concentrate on the client's needs, not where their products are sold. Clearly, rather more on the upper-end one. At least, we are recognized as such! Every twelve weeks, we present our customers a whole range of new products thanks to the seven people who work exclusively in the product development service. Premium Beauty News - Being a major subcontractor in the US cosmetic sector, you are at the heart of trends. Precisely, what are they? Kathryn Geller - The biggest trend we see is multiple use products. Consumers are savvier than ever and products that are a great value or eye catching and new do really well. We have noticed a very sharp come back, not to say a real enthusiasm for lipstick at the expense of traditional lip gloss. Powder remains a flagship product with the desire to offer diverse and varied palettes. Premium Beauty News - You are mostly working today for the U.S. domestic market.... what are your plans for tomorrow? Kathryn Geller - We are developing new technologies in manufacturing and products not currently on the market that will appeal to the global high end market. Yes, we are mostly focused on the US market. However, the majority of the brands that we manufacture for distribute their products globally."
Brazil: Naturelle is surfing the wave of full service,"Premium Beauty News - Your brand ""Natuflora"", does still exist? Levi Kann - Absolutely! But it is true that as the years went by, the business model of our company totally changed. Today 95% of our business consists in designing, manufacturing and packaging formulas for our customers. Perfumes represent half of our activity followed mainly by Skin Care (20%) and Hair Care (15%). We also do a little lip gloss. Premium Beauty News - Your installation three years ago, in this brand new factory where you are operating today represented a major turning point? Levi Kann - Yes, indeed it marked a turning point for the company! We simply doubled our production and our staff which currently consists of 110 people today. The investment was considerable for us and the cultural change too. Being at first a small family business, this was quite a leap. Premium Beauty News - This must have resulted in a change in your customer base? Levi Kann - No, not really. Our customer base consists mostly of many brands, rather more ""fashion"" focused, and which operate in both midrange and upper range segments. Our main asset lies in the flexibility that we had and that we have wanted to keep. We can manufacture and package many different products and in both small, medium and large quantities. I am used to saying that the minimum can even consist of ""one"" sample! Premium Beauty News - You offer a total full service! Levi Kann - Exactly! Regarding the type of packaging we often provide our advice on the matter but we don't have, strictly speaking, any standard ranges to offer. We buy what the customer wants. In general closures and plastic finishings come from Brazil, pumps outside Brazil. Bottles mainly from Brazil. Premium Beauty News - Development prospects are good, of course! Levi Kann - Rather good, it's true! Especially since the evolution of the Brazilian legislation on taxes, in the past four years has tended to favour full service activities like ours. As often in Brazil, the ""taxes"" issue is probably one of the most complicated and the most worrying of all. Without going into details, it has become more interesting to outsource manufacturing and packaging activities than do them yourself..."
Weckerle do Brasil: A trailblazer!,"Premium Beauty News - The least we can say, is that Brazil is a country you know! Thomas Weckerle - Yes, we know it, but believe me it was not an easy matter, far from it in the mid-1990s to start a business, if only a commercial one in this region. By the early 2000s, we had to face the facts. To be sustainably present, it was necessary to produce locally. Hence the decision to build a first production unit of 5000 sq ft. Obviously, it was the right choice! Because very quickly, we reached saturation. Demand was high. In 2003, we took the decision to build a second plant, then seven years later, we moved in a new factory 80 kilometres from Sao Paulo. Fernando Diamint - Today Weckerle do Brasil Ltda employs approximately 380 people on these two sites and produces some 40 million units per year. We can do almost everything in terms of full-service for make-up, from formulation through plastic injection including conditioning. We produce pencils, lipstick tubes, lip gloss, eyeliners, mascaras, compacts, etc. Premium Beauty News - Mostly for the Brazilian domestic market? Thomas Weckerle - At 95%, yes! We supply nearly one hundred local brands and growth rates are around 15% a year. Premium Beauty News - What are your growth prospects for the coming months? Thomas Weckerle - We are extending our product portfolio to skin care to win new customers and serve our existing customers even better. With this wide range of products and the fact, that we are producing everything in Brazil, I think we can participate even more in such a growing market."
Capsum strengthens its expansion with a new partnership,"After concluding two months ago, a first partnership with Genealogy on the US market and jointly launching their first collection RevOlution™, the French start-up specialized in product design has now partnered with Sudcosmetics. This SME based in the south of France, which was taken over by Laurent Dodet last June, is known for its services offer in formulation, regulations, manufacturing and packaging of conventional and natural cosmetics. ""When I took over the company in June 2011, one of my goals was to make of Sudcosmetics a subcontractor, a source of proposals surfing on innovation. Our partnership with Capsum will give us this opportunity. We will use their innovations in product design to develop specific applications,"" says Laurent Dodet. For its part, as emphasised Sébastien Bardon its CEO, Capsum can fully focus on their expertise. ""Sudcosmetics has an industrial expertise which is very complementary to ours. They know perfectly how to industrialize and condition emulsions, serums, specific products associated to objects (including cosmetic pearls) that we create"". Indeed, Sudcosmetics operates with both a manufacturing capacity of 2,500 tons per year and a packaging capacity of 30 million pieces per year. A team of 40 people including 3 exclusively dedicated to research and development makes up their work force. But the partnership does not stop there and by listening to the two leaders one understands very well that a willingness to co-create is present on both sides. ""We are located close to one another, both companies having their offices in the Marseille area, we are young, we cultivate a dynamics which is specific to start-ups, teamwork and co-creation are thinks we take for granted"" add Bardon and Dodet . This also enables to save money in terms of development and commercial presence, an interesting fact regardless of times."
Arcancil is getting its colours back,"Since it has made its come back on the marketplace at the end of 2007, Arcancil is definitely getting its colours back. After a quick succession of store openings on every continent, the brand is now present in 25 countries and continues to expand its sales networks, with always the desire to outperform in the eye category, its historical strong point. In Brazil, Arcancil which was already present in Sao Paulo, Manaus and Recife with Calèche and other selective perfumeries, will enter Shampoo boutiques in Rio de Janeiro. The same logic of expansion applies for Morocco, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, where gradually Arcancil is increasing the store openings. To support sales growth, and approach its customers again, the brand has just completed its first commercial for its mascara, Cil Cabaret, its flagship line. ""Our goal is to double in three years time our export turnover,"" announced Anne Delleur. With a 28% increase the previous year, and a 36% growth for the current year, the company is well on track to achieve its goal. Arcancil relies in particular on its strong reputation in Eastern Europe and its first successes in this area should enable the company to relocate in Russia, a country which was historically one of its key markets. As for France, in May, the end of the exclusivity binding the brand to the Galeries Lafayette should open up new opportunities for development. To face these new challenges, the brand has reinforced itself with in particular, the arrival in January 2012 of Véronique Biolley who was appointed Marketing Director. A graduate of ESSEC, she spent more than four years in L'Oréal's Consumer Products division, as Head of styling products and then of make-up products for L'Oréal Paris and as group leader for Gemey Maybelline. She then left for the United States, where she worked for Bonpoint the children's clothing brand. Back in France, she joined the Arc International Group in 2005. ""At 36, Veronica has more than one string to her bow,"" explains Delleur. ""The combination of her expertise in make-up product Development, combining technicality and aesthetic sense, and her knowledge of Retail issues will be a major asset in the development strategy of the Arcancil brand in France and abroad."" Indeed, the brand must now demonstrate its ability to grow while maintaining the creative inspiration and high quality standards that gave the company its new breath of life. ""Arcancil Paris wants to continue to embody what it is intrinsically, a true historical know-how, in particular in eye make-up, a brand at the forefront of innovation and trends, accessible to the greatest number of people in France and abroad,"" insisted Delleur. But the great event of the year 2012 for the brand , is the signing of the make-up artist Morgane Hilgers, who, as the international spokesperson of the brand, created the make-up of the video Cil Cabaret and who will take a part in all the advertising operations of the brand, for which she also plays a role of creative stimulus. She is in particular, behind the development of a range of smart brushes for smoky eyes effects. Five years after a successful recovery, this concentration of new talents should enable the brand continue its steady pace and establish its new modern and glamour brand image."
Hourglass carries on its international expansion,"Premium Beauty News - You created your company in 2004, you were just 30. What were your motivations to embark on such an adventure? Carisa Janes - After attending the Parsons School of Design, I started working for the Urban Decay brand and on the launch of their range of products for Generation X, which has since become iconic. In 1997, I created for Body & Soul their line of cosmetics inspired from the 40s and their Hollywood stars and then I founded ISA Design LLC, a consulting firm to support the launch of brands particularly niche brands. Quite logically this led me to the creation of my own company, Hourglass. Premium Beauty News - On what concept did you create Hourglass? Carisa Janes - On ""modern luxury"" and femininity. I wanted elegant, functional products and whose formulas would be tailored to the needs of most demanding skins. Where we are able, We make no use of parabens, phthalates, or perfumes. All our products for the skin complexion contain such anti-aging actives as hyaluronic acid, peptides, plant stem cells vitamins... Moreover, we pay special attention to packaging, its practicality and design. We work in partnership with component manufacturers like HCT Packaging with whom we have developed our lip gloss, Prodigy, with its ergonomic shape or our Lash Lacquer, Film Noir, with its paint-brush applicator. Our eye and face powders are contained in cases fitted with rotating mirrors thus providing an additional comfort of use. Premium Beauty News - Since the creation of Hourglass, what has been its growth like? Carisa Janes - The brand was launched exclusively in 2004 at Barney's in New York. We had an offering of 50 products mainly lipsticks and glosses, foundations, powders and make-up palettes. Distribution remained very selective until 2007 when we entered Sephora and Sephora.com. From 17 stores at the beginning, our presence has skyrocketed since we are now present in 328 stores in the United States (Sephora and other retailers) but also in Canada, England, Germany, Singapore, Mexico , Australia and New Zealand and our range consists of 150 products. We now consist of a team of 30 people. Premium Beauty News - Who are your main competitors? Carisa Janes - Our competitors are such luxury brands as Yves Saint Laurent, Armani, Dior and Laura Mercier. We are positioned in upscale price ranges with our lipstick which is sold at around US$ 30, and US$ 65 for the serum. Our sales are mostly performed in Sephora stores but also increasingly on the internet. Premium Beauty News - What are your expansion plans for the future? What about France? Carisa Janes - We intend to establish ourselves in Brazil and to continue to expand and maintain our values hinged on ""modern luxury"" and femininity. The French market is attracting but we don't have any specific plans in the short term."
Stölzle-Oberglas is gaining momentum,"An Parisian inauguration that was occurring just several weeks after the official launch of the new 200 tons/day furnace and of a new coating line in the Polish plant in Czestochowa. In two years time, leaders of the group will have invested a total of 150 million euros of which 45 million euros in Poland but also in their English glass factory in Knottingley (West Yorkshire) which has a furnace of 120 tons/day dedicated to the perfumes and cosmetic industry. A new lacquering line is being installed too. An industrial offensive that has already resulted in some beautiful creations like the new bottle ""Black Up"" whose originality lies in the 8mm recess on one side of the bottle and on a flat glass distribution. To note also the new home bottles with the Cobalt blue ""Gant"" but also ""Voyager"" and the multi-faceted diamond of the bottle ""Marcel"" from Oriflame... Not to mention the bottles ""Pyramide des sens"" from the Dorin House."
"Hwa Sung, formulas and multi-functions!","The most recent ones, are those from the series Color Brow Tint with Brush end, or the Super Slim Brow pencil, not to mention the Triangular eye brow pencil, the Brow Powder with an NBR Tip and the Color Brow Gel. ""This is a true second nature,"" explains Kim E.H, Vice President Global Sales & Marketing, ""innovation is permanent at Hwa Sung. We never stop asking ourselves again and again the same questions every year, every month, almost every day to continually improve the comfort of use of the products we manufacture for the biggest Korean and global cosmetic brands."" At a rate of five to ten new products a year, customers can not be disappointed. ""But it is not so much at the application level that we innovate,"" emphasises Yumi Kim, Global Sales & Marketing Team Leader, ""but also and mostly in the formulas themselves."" ""Finally we offer a comprehensive solution where the applicator whatever it is, explains Kim E.H, must be in perfect symbiosis with the type of formulas or combination of formulas that we develop."" And no standards but only and always ""specifics"". Indeed, during a presentation of the range of solutions offered by the Korean company, we are not disappointed. There is something to suit everyone's taste and mood. Such a brush combined with such formula as components of a multifunction applicator where, with a simple gesture, one can also access a type of powder or blush whose simultaneous application enables multiple effects... Without forgetting lipsticks also integrated in a set that splits into two or three compartments to access, there too, to one or two formulas which, when applied to the lips, make them look very red or very pink darken or glossy, bright or matt. A real festival of solutions that leave the visitor a little speechless. On the industrial side, the Korean company has a new plant since 1998 in the suburbs of Seoul, runs thirty ""home-designed"" filling lines of which 80% are automatic, produces more than one million pieces a month, employs a total of 70 people and will achieve this year a turnover of USD 20 million. After the wooden pencils that the company will abandon completely in the early 2000s, it will specialize in pencils and plastic applicators in the 80s, actually starting its series of ""two and three in one"" in 2004. Today it also offers, - formulas included - make-up cases with multiple compartments and openings, mascaras, lipgloss in a combination or not... Our main strengths, according to Kim E.H, ""besides the quality of our formulas and our ability to innovate, are our flexibility and speed of implementation thanks to our size. It takes from seventy to ninety days maximum between the start of a development and the beginning of the production. Moreover we take orders as of 5,000 pieces."" The key customer markets are Korea, of course, and Asia in general but also the United States and Europe."
The Body Shop awards its suppliers,"Invited suppliers came from across the UK, Europe, Asia and USA to partake in the event, the second of its kind. It was an occasion to strengthen relationships and to share expectations with The Body Shop teams. ""The Supplier Day provided a business update on the strategy outlined in last year's edition and re-confirmed the direction for the coming years,"" explains Jerome Courtaigne, Sourcing Director of The Body Shop. The gathering also allowed to reconfirm the brand's specificity, in particular in regards to its Ethical and Community Fair Trade programmes and its five Values : Against Animal Testing, Support Community Fair Trade, Activate Self Esteem, Defend Human Rights and Protect Our Planet. ""2012 is a landmark year for The Body Shop to pave the way for a sustainable growth"" adds Jerome Courtaigne. Opening the event, Ann Massal, Brand Director, spoke about the achievements and challenges of The Body Shop and her expectations for suppliers to deliver more innovation. Innovation is one of The Body Shop's five main key performance indicators (KPIs) for suppliers, along with quality, supply chain, sustainable development and competitiveness. It is one of the most important indicators within The Body Shop's Convergence sourcing strategy. The Supplier Day is complemented by another annual event, the Innovation Day, which was also started last year and will be organised once again this July. Philippe Reale, Director of Operations, underlined how suppliers directly contribute to the performance of Operations through excellence on these KPIs, something that The Body Shop sees as the basis for building a robust and sustainable relationship. A much anticipated addition this year was the first supplier awards. A total of eight awards were given to the following: – Best Overall Finished Good Supplier, LF Beauty, – Best Overall Packaging Supplier, M&H Plastics, – Best NPD Supplier, Fleet Laboratories, – Best Value Re-engineering and Convergence Supplier, Laleham Healthcare, – Best Quality Supplier, Soapworks, – Best Improved Quality, S&J International Enterprises, – Best Service Level Supplier, LF Beauty, – Best Improved Service level, Hampshire Cosmetics. After the ceremony, Frederic Ennabli, CEO of The Body Shop, led a very active Q&A session, delivering many insights on the business strategy and future growth. Christophe Guesnet, Chief Purchasing Officer of L'Oréal Group, touched upon the strategic role of suppliers at The Body Shop. He also highlighted the potential for suppliers who perform well for The Body Shop to have business opportunities into the wider L'Oréal Group. According The Body Shop, the Convergence sourcing strategy, which was initiated in 2011 with the very first Supplier Day, has been delivering results to the business through better volume consolidation by core supplier expertise, value re-engineering on core products, innovation for new product developments and continuous improvement on the five KPI. ""The Body Shop wants to reinforce the business relationship with main suppliers with tangible benefits for both parties and to become the preferred customer for the key vendors. This event is a major milestone to better align The Body Shop and suppliers strategies based on mutual understanding and shared goals,"" highlighted Jerome Courtaigne at the end of the event."
Cosmetic subcontracting: Korea wants to export its model more,"A well established industry whose structure and messages - that set the bar very high in terms of quality, sophistication and environmental standards - reflect its importance in the economic system and with regards to the issues at stake in a highly innovation demanding sector. Many Koreans manufacturers have managed to seize this opportunity to create absolute jewels in terms of R & D and manufacturing capabilities. But all of them express the same overall vision in the medium and long term. Faced with Korean and Japanese domestic markets close to saturation, sliders are increasingly switching in the direction of China, and more specifically to sophisticated markets represented by the United States and Europe, in a better position to pay ""Made in Korea"" products. To exemplify this, we took two companies and not the least, the Kolmar Korea and Cosmax companies. Concerning Kolmar Korea, created just over twenty years ago, its scope of activity has continued to grow over the years. So much so that the group headed by Mr. Dong-han Yoon, its founder, can display a consistent business card. With no less than...four production sites, 1,000 employees, a turnover of USD 300 million dollars last year and with 65% of the activity serving the cosmetic sector (with half of it for make-up), 30% for pharmacy and 5% to dietary supplements. A turnover that has literally exploded between 2007 and 2011 with annual growth rates of over 20%; no wonder then that the CEO of the company proudly displays a market share for subcontracting in Korea that he estimated at 38%. When one knows that there are about 400 companies that are assumed to be operating in the same segment in this country of 50 million inhabitants, that's indeed something to be proud of. Kolmar's history, since its inception in 1990, is marked by both patent filing (99 in total), by the opening of industrial sites and by the obtaining of all the possibly available certificates of compliance (CGMP in 1994, ISO 9001 in 2001, KGMP in 2002, Ecocert in 2009, ISO 22716 in 2011). As for the manufacturing plants, the two sites specialized in skin care cover an area of nearly 10,000 sqm and offer an annual capacity of 70 million units. Those dedicated to make-up cover more than 6,000 sqm and have a capacity of 60 million units per year for a wide product range (powders, eyeliners, eyeshadows, lipsticks, mascaras etc..). Not to mention the ""pharma"" unit of more than 20,000 sqm (46 million units) and dietary supplements of more than 5,000 sqm (150 million units). The new plant located in Beijing, more dedicated to skin care and body care, which opened last year ""to access the fantastic Chinese market"", according the words of the leaders of Korea Kolmar, covers 7,800 sqm for an annual production capacity of 45 million units. A commissioning which expresses the desire of the firm to export its know-how outside of Korea. Because the Korean domestic market, where Kolmar has been excelling since its creation and which accounts for 90% of its activity, is almost saturated. Hence for Kolmar, it's time to turn elsewhere, especially to the U.S., Europe and ... South America. The ambitions of the Cosmax company are the same. The business card of the company founded in 1992 is particularly impressive. Over the last five years, its turnover will have recorded a pretty astonishing jump from USD 65 million to 182 million last year! Growth rates of 22%, 31% and even 36% year on year! The company has positioned itself as a total outsourcing company in both the skin care and make-up segment with a 50/50 distribution, which has not changed during this period. Like any Korean company worthy of the name, the R&D is considered strategic enough for the company to have 27% of its employees working there. The company also highlights its ability to create formulas and boasts that 95% of products are manufactured from them. Of course it can also display a full range of conformity certification (CGMP in 1998, ISO 9001 in 2000, OHSAS 18001 in 2007). But also only exports15% of its production, mainly to Japan and Europe. This has to change... The company owns three manufacturing sites in Korea and soon, two factories in China since the second one will be running next September in Guangzhou on 27,000 sqm. An increase in the production tool that should not stop there since officials at Cosmax are already talking of a fifth factory in Asia in 2013... In terms of production lines, the capacity is consistent with 22 lines for skin-care (almost 90,000 units/year), 21 for lipsticks (27,600 units/year), 3 for mascaras (9,200 units/year), 26 for powders (about 44,000 units/year). Its leaders, KS Lee, Chairman, and CH Song, President, also want to deliver a strong message around what they call ""the spirit of the three apples."" The first, ""Eve's apple,"" the apple of morality. The second, the ""Apple of Beauty,"" the one which was given to Aphrodite by the Trojan prince. The third, ""Newton's apple of science"", the one that inspired Newton for the development of his theory of universal gravitation. ""These three symbols hinged on the apple, explain the leaders, reflect exactly our industrial philosophy based on honesty, on our mission to contribute to a life more beautiful and finally on our goal for research and development."" Quit a program indeed!"
Schwan Cosmetics continues to grow,"""The Group's best results in the company's history!"" is the statement that ended the fiscal year of the German Schwan STABILO Group last June. Sales dramatically increased by 66 million euro over the previous year. ""A great performance across geographies, brands and categories!"" we were told by Barbara Bauer-Kropf, Executive Vice President Sales and Marketing Cosmetics at the company's headquarters in Heroldsberg, a few miles outside of Nuremberg. An even more interesting result as it came from strong sales of the Cosmetic Division (+ 25%), all product lines included. During times like this, it is almost impossible to keep up with customer requirements without drastically investing. First on the agenda was an increase in production capacity for plastic pencils with the start up of new production lines. One of the main parts of the manufacturing process, the technology for the production of cosmetic bulk also underwent a complete overhaul. A modernization that not only helped increase the production capacity, but also boosted new formula innovations and impacted the entire environmental process by reducing energy and water usage by over 30%. The third project completed was the successful implementation of SAP. ""A particularly tricky project to implement,"" Barbara Bauer-Kropf noted, ""since it involved nearly fifty internal and external engineers during a two- year period. But it was worth it! With this new software, already used by over 500 employees, business processes can be run more effectively and productively."" And last but not least, the fourth project, the set up of the new company website which contains more than 200 pictures representing most of the group's product references. It is an interactive website with many new features that keeps customers easily informed and is even able to create tailor-made presentations for each individual client. The website is already quite a success, as it currently claims some thousands of visitors per month with the number steadily increasing and connections coming from seventy-six different countries."
A new partner for Geka to strengthen international expansion,"Frankfurt-based investor Halder has signed a definitive agreement to sell its majority shareholding in Geka GmbH to 3i. Halder had acquired Geka in 2007. Parties involved have agreed not to disclose the financial details of the transaction which is subject to approval of anti-trust authorities. Geka, headquartered in Bechhofen, Germany, serves both the mass market and premium segment for packaging in the cosmetic industry. In addition, it distributes cosmetic accessories via its division Victoria. Founded in 1925, the company has a broad patent and product portfolio. Geka is a pioneer in innovation of plastic injection moulding for mascara brushes and mascara packaging as well as a development partner of market leading international cosmetics groups including Procter & Gamble, Avon and LVMH. The company runs production facilities in Bechhofen, Germany and in Elgin, Illinois, USA with an additional sales office in France. The packaging manufacturer employs around 650 staff globally and generated revenues of approximately 100 million euros in 2011. ""Geka's future growth will come from its strength in innovation and its international expansion,"" said 3i in a release. ""The arrival of this new partner can only strengthen the development of Geka in its business, both in Europe and the United States and in new Asian and South American markets, particularly China and Brazil,"" explains Franco Lucá, CEO. A development that took the form of noteworthy industrial investments in 2011 and that will continue in 2012. One of the main events last year for Geka, was the start of its filling line in Bechhofen. ""This year, confirms Franco Lucá, we are building new facility for ten new injection machines, several finishing machines and four injection moulding machines."" Cost of the operation: 6.8 million euros. A similar program is scheduled in the U.S. plant for US$ 2.1 million. Regarding innovations, Geka, always at the cutting edge, should also launch a lot of new products, especially on its preferred segment: injected brushes. ""In addition to expanding our business into the Asian and South American markets, we are looking to enter the cosmeceutical market with 3i's support,"" Lucá adds. ""Geka's innovative strength and long-term partnerships with the leading cosmetics manufacturers put the company in an excellent position to foster growth in its highly attractive and stable market segment. We are convinced that we can support the company's expansion and development by providing it access to growth capital and 3i's international network,"" summarizes Ulf von Haacke, Partner and Managing Director of 3i Germany."
Fiabila: Results for 2011 and an outlook on 2012!,"Premium Beauty News - There has been no signs of a slowdown in your activity these past months and, even more so for the year that just started? Pierre Miasnik - It's true! Our business this year should be just as strong as it was last year. To summarize, and to better understand the challenges to which we are confronted, Fiabila doubled its turnover in two years time! And it is certainly not finished. Nail polish has become the unavoidable make-up accessory. Each passing day confirms this. Just imagine, of the 160,000 colour references included in our portfolio, over 30,000 were active last year! Premium Beauty News - Such growth obviously requires to be able to follow suit industrially speaking? Pierre Miasnik - Of course! As we had already announced some months ago in your newsletter, we have opened last October a new packaging site of 3,500 sqm in France, in Le Perray en Yvelines that hosts an area for filling operations equipped with high-speed lines but also two storage areas, one for containers, and the other one for flammable raw materials. Aim of the operation: increase our overall capacity, but also a desire to offer our customers the best possible service. As for the U.S., we have just acquired a second plant in New Jersey, which will be operational in May this year. Furthermore, an extension for this site will be completed in January 2013. Two joint actions that will, also, enable us to purely and simply double our business across the Atlantic. Third country, India where we are currently completing the construction of our second factory (3,500 sqm). It will be operational in late June. Premium Beauty News - 2012 will also be a special year for your plant in Maintenon! Pierre Miasnik - Yes and this is a major project! We have obtained all the necessary authorisations for the site's extension. The purpose is not only to step up production thanks to an improved productivity, but to also optimize safety conditions by limiting, for example, to the maximum handling in open tanks. Premium Beauty News - Quality and safety...., two obsessions! Pierre Miasnik - They are not the only ones but they are indeed very important! You know, our customers standards have never stopped increasing. Our products have evolved considerably towards greater purity with the use of increasingly safer raw materials for consumers. Our role is of course to provide the product that matches best the desired quality. This results in huge investments not only from an industrial viewpoint but also, in terms of staff. The qualification of our personnel is a constant concern. Especially since in parallel there is a reduction in the number of major global players which means we have to deal with still larger bulk quantities. Highly refined and flawless quality, short deadlines, a wide variety of products, large tonnages, controlled risks... give you an idea of the equation! Premium Beauty News - Your desire to extend to other parts of the world is still one of your goals? Pierre Miasnik - Yes, of course! But it's still a little too early to talk about it. The 2012 year should hold some surprises."
Capsum and Genealogy join forces,"Premium Beauty News - Before we start talking about your partnership, why not take a snapshot of your two companies created respectively in June 2008 for Genealogy and September 2008 for Capsum, How far have you got more than three years after? Aea Marc - Our company, Genealogy which was created by Brian Fox offers in the fields of make-up and skincare a full service offer of products whose characteristics have always something to do with innovation. We have to date a range of more 200 references and create 3 to 4 collection a year. For each client, the offer is customized to best meet its DNA. This can range from the choice of actives, textures, colours including the use of exclusive raw materials, of customized packaging... Our market consists of many niche brands that are looking for differentiating products and who are hungry for new ideas. Our offers always marry aesthetics and beautiful quality. We are strongly established in the United States but also present in Europe and the United Kingdom. In the past 4 years our annual growth ranged between 30 and 150%. We meet the needs of companies that have a strong expertise in marketing and sales with a good distribution but who do not have in-house resources to design and manufacture their cosmetics. Sébastien Bardon - Since its inception, Capsum focuses on the design of products and in the follow-up of their manufacturing. Our field of expertise is microfluidics, a high scientific value ""object by object"" technology which saw the light at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston and which enables to develop, such materials as beads, emulsions, capsules... The process is very qualitative with perfectly controlled and reproducible drop sizes. We work on objects ranging from 10 nm to just a few millimetres. The field of possibilities is very wide. We are in discussion with all the major global luxury groups and are already working with Amore Pacific in Korea and La Prairie. For the 3 years, our turnover has increased by an average of 30% a year and we have, to date, 22 employees. The partnership signed between Genealogy and Capsum also corresponds to an evolution of our offer because we now propose finished products whereas before we were just involved in tailor-made products. For the record, Capsum was a laureate of the 2009 Oséo competition for the creation of the most innovative company and was awarded the label of Young Innovative Company by the French Ministry of the economy. Premium Beauty News - Could we say that Capsum provides technology while Genealogy provides the cosmetic know-how? Bardon - It is one aspect of our complementarity, but it is not the only one. Indeed, as Capsum is a scientific company, we offer breakthrough innovations and Geneaolgy knows how to place them in a use context for cosmetics. Genealogy awakens us to market trends. Aea Marc - We find new technologies and have them match the needs of women. Nowadays, women have developed an awareness to natural ingredients which are soft to their skin, with no chemical material and Capsum's technology does meet in particular this need by limiting the use of surfactants. We make ours innovation, and change it into a cosmetic product. Sébastien Bardon and Aea Marc - We also have a market complementarity, Capsum works with larger luxury groups and Genealogy is very experienced in developing contracts with smaller brands. In addition, our geographic areas are complementary. Capsum is present in Asia and France, and Genealogy in the United States and the UK. Premium Beauty News - How did this partnership start in the first place? Sébastien Bardon and Aea Marc - It all started with a meeting between Brian Fox and Sébastien Bardon which resulted in a common desire for co-creation as part of the product development but not only since we have pooled our forces for the prospecting of customers through a give and take and a joint presence on the trade shows. The teams have in addition also respectively made long stays in both companies to impregnate themselves with the cultures which are very compatible. Innovation being the same watch word for Capsum and for Genealogy. Premium Beauty News - Do you already have some products resulting from your partnership? Sébastien Bardon and Aea Marc - Yes, we have a first example with our joint collection RevOlution™. It consists of beads that are used to convey such values as luxury with caviar, of efficiency through the possibility to encapsulate and deliver high-potential actives which are however often difficult to stabilize, of sensoriality with very sophisticated and visually very beautiful textures. Each creation is designed so that each woman gets a visual, olfactory and sensory experience and can understand what is happening inside a product, and why not even play with it. We have combined in this collection: technology, high-quality cosmetic formulas and consumer experience. The packaging is very elaborated and ensures the transformation of beads into refined cosmetic products. The official launch of RevOlution™ will take place in Bologna during the Cosmoprof, we will then be present at In-Cosmetics in Barcelona, MakeUp in Paris and MakeUp in New York.

Maesa wants to reinforce its activities on the high end,"Taking full advantage of its two R&D and formulation laboratories (one in Paris specialized in beauty products, the other one in Los Angeles specialized in home fragrances) and of its three design studios (Paris, New York and Los Angeles), the group has won several new customers in 2011, in Europe and in the United States too: El Corte Inglés (3 complete lines of skincare, bath products and home fragrances), Superdry (a perfume), Galeries Lafayette (a range of bath products), Hunkemuller (a range of make-up products and perfumes), Decleor, Montblanc, Aldo, Hot Topic, Benefit, Juicy Couture, Ralph Lauren, Oscar de la Renta. Many line extensions were also carried out with the portfolio of existing clients: Zara, Nocibé, Women's Secret, Sephora, L'Oréal, Payless, Victoria's Secret, Kim Kardashian, etc. In the end, the group produced more than 2,000 references in 2011, with an increase - in constant exchange rate - of 8% of its turnover over 2010. A growth which is lower than in previous years (in 2010 the turnover had increased by 30%) but, explains Julien Saada, co-founder and Chairman of the group, ""profitability has been improved."" A somewhat battered profitability after the takeover in 2009 of two U.S. companies. ""For the coming years, our goal is to return to 10-15% profit on equity,"" emphasised Saada. But this will be achieved outside the stock market! The Maesa Group, which was listed in Paris on the Alternext market has, in fact, chosen to leave the stock market at the end of 2011 and to finance its growth with the help of a new financial partnership, namely, the company Edmond de Rothschild Investment Partner (EDRIP). In practice, the group's actions were transferred to a holding (F&B Group) in which EDRIP has a minority stake of 11%. ""The stock market has not helped the group in its development, our acquisitions were made with bank loans,"" explains Saada. So leaders at Maesa preferred to focus on their market and on the long-term growth of the group, rather than on the tedious communications imposed by financial market regulations. To achieve its growth and profitability targets, Maesa of course intends to strengthen itself on the market that made its success: the creation of complete and tailored lines for retail chains, often not familiar with the cosmetic world. And this logically implies winning new customers and developing existing accounts. On this front, the year 2012 has started rather well since the first half should see the launch of the first creations designed for Marks & Spencer, Next, and Kruidvat (with the first fragrance under its own name for the group) in Europe, or for Kohl's in the States United, who previously used to entrusted the develop its own brand to Estee Lauder. ""We have about 80 customers worldwide in the distribution sector, is a lot but there is still some room for further growth,"" believes Saada. Plans are also underway with Zara, Nocibé, or Superdry in Europe, with Payless, Kim Kardashian and L'Oréal in the United States. But the group also wants to attract new luxury brands and reinforce its full-service activity on this market. Indeed, in addition to their packaging and their promotions, brands do not hesitate to entrust Maesa with the developments of whole segments. ""This is a general trend, believes Saada, competitive pressure is forcing brands to concentrate their resources on marketing, operational activities and distribution, which leads to a relative decrease in investments dedicated to development. But as they also have the obligation to market still more products to remain competitive, they rely on external partners."" A market which, compared to retail, has three advantages, namely of high added value, of a lesser dependence to economic conditions, and of potentially larger volumes, but where the group must face a much more intense competitive pressure. Maesa has therefore redeployed its sales force in the United States and Europe and created a Commercial & Marketing Management specialised in luxury brands, headed by Sophie Thiolas. The group is also betting on both the innovation capacity of its design studio (6 people in Paris and a new tool for 3D creation capable of displaying products in a real situation in a context of final merchandising) and on its R&D laboratory in Paris, with a regulatory service and a constant monitoring of new ingredients and new textures. However, no geographical expansion has been planned in the short or medium term, Maesa wanting to focus on its European and American customers. ""But it is clear that China and Brazil have a strong potential which could be of interest to Maesa,"" concluded Saada."
"""From logo to launch!""","On March 18, 1962 Edward Marcus takes the decision of launching his company. At the time, his professional background comes down to some good technical knowledge in the food industry and on some strong commercial assets acquired in the perfume sector. He is the first one at the time in the United States to realize the value of establishing a service company for the filling and packaging of essential oils. Seduced by the name of a street in Brooklyn, he calls his company ""Grafton."" Four years later, Grafton Products activities have sky-rocketed and the company fills each year some 40 million bottles of perfume and eau de cologne. It was not until 1981 that Grafton, at the request of several customers, got involved in filling activities for cosmetic and skincare products. In 1985, the decision was taken to mainly specialize in this segment of cosmetics and Steven Marcus joins what is known now as Grafton Cosmetics. That was ""THE"" great idea! Many small and medium companies were looking at the time for a supplier in the United States, capable of providing them with their full range of colour cosmetics. But not just supply but also develop and create. Grafton Cosmetics' team excels in this area. The company can add to its production tool, the means to print the client's logo on the packaging and that is when emerged the famous slogan, ""from Logo to launch""! But filling and packaging are not the only assets of the firm in Boynton Beach, Florida. Very quickly, Steven Marcus understood the benefits to the company if it went further in terms of innovation and developments of custom formulations. More than packaging, a whole new generation of customers wishes to find a partner company to help them create their own brand around a strong identity. ""Today, our range is very wide,"" explains Marcus. ""Eyes, lips, face... we offer a wide range of classic and mineral products but we can also work on more specific lines. All our products and raw materials are made in the United States."" Grafton has a range of 220 different shades just for eye shadows, and nearly forty for foundations. Grafton Cosmetics offers a range of products for ""women of all colours."" ""Currently 80% of our customers are American, emphasises Steven Marcus, but our share of European customers, especially from England, Belgium, Sweden and France, is gradually increasing, in South America too, not to mention countries like New Zealand, Australia and Japan."" The key assets of Grafton stand in its colour range based on minerals and paraben-free products, its ability to supply small quantities and its capacity for innovation. Latest launches to date, ""LipLuxe,"" a series of seven shades of lip gloss, and mineral lipsticks that literally have a ""volume"" effect on lips for several hours. ""You can feel instantly a tingling and invigorating freshness on the lips as if they were naturally plumped,"" explains Myra Kenigsman Sales Manager/Aesthetician. Each year, following the fashion trends, Grafton launches several collections elaborated by Cheryl Marcus, the Creation and Product Development Director. The mission of Grafton Cosmetics in the beauty industry, is to offer its clients full support in the creation of their successful private label brand with quality products and marketing support. ""Needless to say, Grafton Cosmetics products are never tested on animals,"" the company claims."
Faber-Castell Cosmetics under the sign of growth!,"""And what's interesting,"" explains Stefano Castelletti, CEO, ""is that this growth was mostly achieved with both our new and our standard products. We are progressing on both fronts and we have gained shares on quite a few new markets with our core products, particularly in Europe."" ""A big success for us and our customers was Tint' N' Gloss."" A convenient two-sided product with integrated lip balm developed and produced by Faber-Castell Cosmetics which achieved the German Glammy 2011 and is counted among the best cosmetics innovations in 2011. The main trends on which the German firm could take advantage of at a product level were: the consumer craze for ""Jumbo"" pencils and the success of new paraben-free formulas. In terms of recent successes for the teams of Faber-Castell Cosmetics, there is a luxurious lip formula available as medium-sheer ""Moisturizing Power Lipbalm"" or as ""Some like it Hot"" a rich, saturated, wet-shine lipstick where ""an extraordinary pigmentation provides visual depth combined to a rich moisturizing finish"", explained Stefano Castelletti. The packaging is a PVC-free plastic sharpenable pencil, with a barrel in customized colours. ""A good enough year 2011 and very encouraging 2012 forecasts that can only invite us to continue our investments to meet demand,"" explains Castelletti. A further proof, if needed, that the watchwords at the Group headquarters in Nuremberg remain ""continue to invest in technology"" in Germany and ""increase the value added."" Foreign branches only being designed to supply local markets. ""Not to forget, the most important fact,"" concludes Stefano Castelletti ""the proximity to our customers and their markets, we exhibit world-wide at global and regional fairs. The shows in Bologna, Paris, New York and São Paulo were a big success and we are looking forward to the first event this year, the Cosmoprof|Cosmopak in Bologna to meet our international customer and present our novelties. And of course, to MakeUp in Paris and MakeUp in New York, the two events exclusively dedicated the make-up industry suppliers."""
Florida: Oxygen's new plant is operational!,"The least one can say is that this company has done remarkably well since its creation, just 10 years ago through the impetus of its founder, Philippe Cohen. At the start of 2012, Oxygen has acquired the 'state of the art' in terms of manufacturing and packaging of cosmetics by moving its production tool just a few miles away in a brand new factory hosting cutting edge equipments for R&D, formulation and filling operations. ""This is actually the trend,"" says Philippe Cohen. ""Brands come to us because they know our reputation for developing new products."" More than fifteen people are involved daily in Research and Development in the nine laboratory rooms of the company. The company can manufacture just about anything or almost (powders, mascaras, lipsticks, foundations, lip gloss, as well as skincare creams and hair products). From year to year, thanks to this new production tool, Oxygen has all of a sudden stepped up its production capacity by 300% when compared to the potential of its previous factory. ""The objectives being of course, to better serve our existing customers in North America, precisely at a time when the Made in America is back into force in people's minds,"" emphasises Philippe Cohen, ""but also to give ourselves the means to grow on overseas markets, like Central America, South America and even Europe at a time when, the euro/dollar parity is more favourable. Not to mention our reputation for responsiveness the American way!"""
Oekabeauty: New investments in 2012,"The first tangible results of these developments being the marketing as of this month of January of a whole range of new mascara brushes and new lips applicators like the ""Palm Sensation,"" a patented lip-gloss applicator developed with students from a German university of Design whose main characteristic is to have a very soft and flexible tip enabling a great comfort of application. To note also the marketing of the ""Delashious Brushes"", a series of three different mini fibre-based mascaras brushes. Their very specific size make them particularly efficient to work on ""volume"" and ""nature-like"" aspects. To note again the launch of another new brush, ""Diamond Brush"" also made of fibres which has the characteristic of being ""diamond"" shaped, enabling a perfectly uniform application of the formula while respecting the sought for ""volume"" effects. A series of innovations in fibre brushes which clearly shows the desire of the Oekabeauty management to invest even more heavily on this market in 2012. ""Especially in the development of new assembly machines and in the cutting of fibres,"" we were told at the company's headquarters in Bamberg. A 2012 year which will also be placed under the sign of an increased cooperation of the firm with its partners in formulation to continue to offer the best combinations between brushes and/or applications and the mascara and/or gloss formulas."
Florame: an innovation per year and per segment!,"But how on earth did Romain Ruth, a 33 year old Parisian lawyer specialized in criminal law, find himself two years ago, managing a company with an expertise in essential oils and organic cosmetics, in Saint Rémy de Provence? Certainly because of a genetic passion instilled long ago by his father Olivier Ruth, who had already left the mark of his passage in several successful companies (Le Petit Marseille, L'Occitane) before creating in 1997 the Durance brand, well inspired by the Lavandin de Grignan. This is where the Provence Nature Développement group was born around this idea of terroir and fine raw materials, with the acquisition of Florame in 2002, Collines de Provence (home fragrances and natural cosmetics) in 2004 and of Présent Simple (local traditions and gastronomy of Provence) in 2007. All this has the unmistakable scent of Provence, but not only, as some essential oils come from more exotic lands. Like ylang ylang, geranium or ravinsara, originating from Madagascar where Florame is involved in a development program. ""We have the largest catalogue of essential oils in the world, with products coming from the five continents,"" emphasises Ruth. This is also what motivated his decision: a passion for the product and its production channel that goes from the producer to the point of sale, but also a passion for a sensoriality which is specific to this universe. Not to mention a taste for international challenges, and the pleasure to participate to a family adventure with his father and his brother Nicolas (at the head of Durance). Currently, Florame achieves 11.5 million euros in turnover, equally divided between essential oils and organic cosmetics, and with 85% achieved in France. The brand is distributed through its owned shops and salons in France. Nathalie Rigaud is the one who monitors the brand's international development, already present in 35 countries (Europe, Asia and North America). ""Our formulas are the ones, on the market, with the highest percentages in organic ingredients,"" stresses Ruth who continues to communicate on the basic values of the company: its Provençal roots, its organic nature, its high-quality active ingredients using of a cold pressed extraction or a distillation performed in the traditional way, with AB and/or Cosmébio labels and an Ecocert certification. The R&D and formulation laboratory which has been integrated to the group for many years under the supervision of Laurent Lefaucheur, develops all the new lines. ""We have biological treasures, essential and vegetables oils to develop skin care and toiletries products, perfumes and home fragrances, even organic candles with their bio cotton wicks: our ambition is to market a novel product per segment each year,"" explains Ruth. In 2011, it was the new line Nutrition Intense, with organic essential oils, enriched with organic shea for the well-being of dry and fragile skins. But also a purifying bio spray, an organic sunscreen with an SPF of 50 which does go white when applied and the must have, a USB key that diffuses essential oils using ultrasounds to disperse molecules without heating them. Located on the site of Saint Rémy, the quality department, equipped with spectrographs and chromatographs and headed by Aude Cabrera, validates the quality of all essential oils entering the site (about 140 different for aromatherapy and organic cosmetics), but also of packagings, good practices, traceability, and the results of safety tests carried out for finished products. And eco-design in all this? ""What suits us best are large volumes, like 1 litre size shower gels!"" summarizes Ruth who is slowly but surely developing his company towards the fair and sustainable, with a carbon footprint underway and programmed zero pesticides operations. And because the social dimension of a company ""is not necessarily at the other end of the world,"" he has set up a participation for the employees of Florame. Physician, heal thyself..."
Jackel - LF Beauty fully invests the segment of instrumental beauty,"Premium Beauty News - Obviously Jackel - LF Beauty had all the necessary legitimacy to offer a range of products on this booming new market? Bruno Clamens - Absolutely! Remember that, historically, before becoming a major player in the luxury and beauty industry, Jackel was originally a manufacturer of electrical products for childcare such as, for example, bottle warmers or even electric sterilizers. The childcare segment is very demanding in terms of compliance with hygiene, nutrition, safety and electrical regulations, we are therefore perfectly legitimate in this area. We know how to ""heat"", ""cool"", ""diffuse vapour"", ""recreate a vibration"", ""sterilize"", ""dry"", ""detect"", ""use ultrasounds"" and so on. We took the best from both worlds: our know-how in electrical appliances and our expertise in high-end packaging, in order to offer products which technically and aesthetically meet the expectations of prestige brands. It is really only fairly recently that this activity has been developing strongly under the pressure of increasingly demanding customers, especially in the beauty segment. Premium Beauty News - An annual growth rate of up to 50% is being assumed for the United States alone! Bruno Clamens - But it's not just the United States. Demand is growing strongly in Asia and Europe. This corresponds to two major trends, compounded by the aging of the population: the growing market of well-being and the concept of home beauty institutes. Premium Beauty News - Finally, who are your customers? Bruno Clamens - First of all, of course, cosmetic brands followed by all possible means of distribution (stores, internet, home shopping, etc..). I must insist on the fact that our offering has nothing to do with gadgets. It consists of truly technical products, often quite complex, that must be reliable and offer a real plus in terms of efficiency to the consumer. Premium Beauty News - In fact, in your range, there's something for everyone? Bruno Clamens - The range never stops growing. I must say that the scope of possible uses is extremely broad. This concerns nails with the development, among others, of UV nail dryers, skincare, eyelash care, body care... These instruments may feature various functions like cooling or heating, massaging, smoothing, moistening, facilitating skin cleaning or the penetration of a formula. They often come in support of cosmetic products which can therefore be applied or absorbed by the skin the best possible way."
"Jean-François Harpes, President IL Cosmetics: ""Towards an acceleration of our investment""","Premium Beauty News - Nail polish is always a growth market! Jean-François Harpes - It's the least we can say since the market has recorded a two digit growth in 2011. Although it is difficult to consider these figures in absolute terms, it is clear that the European and US market have been rising sharply. The growth of IL Cosmetics is certainly in correlation to that of the global market, but it is mainly due to the strong momentum which has been generated in recent years within the company. Premium Beauty News - What momentum precisely? Jean-François Harpes - You may recall that in 2010, we had launched a major investment plan of 11 million euros. This plan was originally planned for a period of five years. Given the economic situation and the current growth of the company the pace of this investment has been stepped up and will certainly be completed before term. Premium Beauty News - What are the strong points of your next investments? Jean-François Harpes - Our investments concern both equipments and the workforce. We can actually announce a significant increase in the capacity of the three branches that form our business: 1. Components. Components are critical since they are required to be able to make the bulk. Our total capacity was doubled on the 1st of January 2012. 2 The Bulk. Bulk shades are intended to booming foreign markets and a key factor of success in the third branch: the full-service. The doubling of our production capacity will be effective during the third quarter of 2012. 3. Full-service. The 50% increase of our production capacity will be effective on the 1st of February 2012. Our global capacity will thus equal 800 million bottles of nail polish, that is to say a quarter of the world's entire market. Premium Beauty News - And in terms of workforce, then? Jean-François Harpes - IL cosmetics is not only investing in equipment but we are also focusing on reinforcing our sales, management and marketing teams with a doubling of the current workforce by 2013 as well as a strong emphasis on quality and innovation, two hubs that will see their number of people increase by 50% in 2012. The innovation hub is the result of the symbiosis and dynamics between the marketing and development departments and has an aim to always stay in tune with markets: to capture their needs, understand them and to then translate them into a product response that satisfies the expectations of the end consumer. This implies a thorough and constant analysis of the reasons why consumers choose and buy a product rather than another. Innovation stands therefore as a key driver not only to give us the means to offer new formulas in line with the findings of our consumer surveys but also to anticipate their future needs. Innovation also remains a hub focused on novelty, hence our special collections and new formulations that will be showcased at Cosmoprof Bologna 2012."
AmorePacific bets on Asian growth to enter the top 10,"AmorePacific plans to complete the construction of its new Shanghai Production & Research Centre in March 2013. With 92,788 sqm of land area and 41,001 sqm of building area, the new facility will have an annual production capacity of 7,500 tons and one hundred million units, a 16-fold increase compared to current capabilities. The production will be organized so as to address the needs of both diversified small-quantity production and mass production. The new facility will be used as the main production, research and distribution hub for serving the Chinese market, with the aim to accelerate the company's business in the country, explained Suh Kyung-Bae, CEO of AmorePacific. The group aims to grow its sales by more than 30 percent in China, to reach 1.4 billion yuan (221 million USD) in 2012, compared to 1.04 billion yuan in 2011. The domestic market will also be key in the Korean group's attempt to become one of the top 10 global cosmetics marketers by 2015. AmorePacific expects the Korean market to grow by 9.1% in 2012 to reach 9.7 trillion wons (8.5 billion USD), compared to 8.9 trillion wons (7.7 billion USD) in 2011 [1]. Over the last five years, cosmetics sales in Korea grew at an average annual rate of 10.4%. According to AmorePacific, ""the biggest issue on the cosmetics market in 2011 was the rebound of One-brand shop, which recorded 32.1% growth and showed the highest growth of all cosmetics market channels."" Thanks to ""quick response to consumer needs, increased product types, enhanced quality, and the development of a wide range of items"" this retail channel should carry on growing at a similar pace in 2012. The other most dynamic retail channels are the internet (+11.9% forecasted in 2012) and department stores should (+ 9.6% forecasted in 2012). AmorePacific also foresees strong growth opportunities in the men's cosmetics market, which has been steadily growing at an average annual rate of 13.2% since 2007 in Korea. According to the group, the men's market achieved a 13.4% growth in 2011. ""Products especially developed for Korean men's skin are also doing their share of growth on the domestic cosmetics market. 'Hera Homme Magic Skin Essence,' a moisturizing essence product for men, was developed by taking into account the nature of Korean men's skin with 'high sebum production and less moisture.' This is a steady-seller, recording over 10% growth annually as a unique item among men's cosmetics. It proves that men's cosmetics are no longer simply limited to basic toner and lotion,"" the company explains. However, the Korean market is also affected by the current economic turmoil. ""Due to high inflation, the disposable income of consumers decreased and they demonstrated cautious purchasing behaviour,"" AmorePacific says. As a consequence, Korean consumers tend to put more stress on the real qualities of products rather than on brands. Price sensitivity also increased. ""The 'Value Consumption' trend is forecast to continue for the time being. The polarization of consumption according to income level is worsening, and it seems that it will be accompanied by polarized consumption according to product types."""
L'Oréal confirms its commitment towards Asian suppliers,"More than 380 people were invited to attend the latest edition of the L'Oreal Asia Pacific Supplier Convention, on December 1st, at the Intercontinental Expo Hotel in Shanghai. The long list of attendees represented over 150 suppliers from four purchasing domains (Raw Material, Packaging Material, Contract Manufacturing & Capital Expenditure) across the Asia Pacific region and nearly 60 staff from L'Oreal Asia Operation Divisions, L'Oreal China R&I and L'Oreal Europe Sourcing Center. ""Following last year's L'Oreal Supplier Day in Hong Kong, which was more focusing on strategy and vision sharing, L'Oreal Asia Pacific Supplier Convention, aimed at the down-to-earth interactions with suppliers,"" explains the French cosmetics giant in a release. Speeches were delivered about L'Oreal's operation expansions in the Asia Pacific region and ethical sourcing issues. They were followed by several programs and workshops designed to encourage interactive discussions to progress towards ""common improvements"". The social audit program has been a hot topic in the event due to the suppliers' increasing awareness of the importance of social responsibility. Supply Chain Efficiency & Lean Production program has been demonstrated with a real case from one of L'Oreal's selected suppliers on how to become lean and therefore to bring mutual benefits to the supplier and L'Oreal. Meanwhile, concerning the group's four different purchasing domains, tailor-made workshops have been designed, in particular regarding E-bidding and quality chart trainings for Contract Manufacturing and Packaging Material suppliers, specific programs for raw material suppliers, etc. Finally, the group's Supplier Management Program was introduced to all the attendees. ""This program is about managing expectations from suppliers and from stakeholders. Supplier survey program, supplier scorecard, supplier rating system and supplier incentive program were elaborated in this session,"" L'Oreal says. According to L'Oreal, just a few days after the event, emails and phone calls were received from many suppliers not only expressing their appreciations and congratulations but also addressing their strong interests in different subjects presented in the event. ""To mention one of the vivid cases, one supplier from south of China had tried hard to find solutions to increase production efficiency and reduce cost and waste but with little progress during the past years. Nevertheless, this supplier was glad to witness the program of Supply Chain Efficiency & Lean Production as delivered in the event. They came to L'Oreal immediately after the event and were so anxious to know more about this program and wanted to get a systematic training with the help from L'Oreal."" These workshops and trainings should have a far-reaching influence with regard to the future business relationship between L'Oreal and its suppliers. Taking into consideration the positive feedback from suppliers, L'Oréal considers this kind of events will become a regular exchange platform with them. ""There is no doubt that we have paved the way for L'Oreal's sustainable development and innovations with the full dedications and supports from our suppliers,"" the group concludes."
Purainova: A fine French story in Brazil!,"Premium Beauty News - Yet you did not really have the profile of an entrepreneur who sets off alone on a big adventure? Joël Ponte - It's true! Before this date of February 2009, my professional background in the beauty industry was more the one, a little classical, of a senior manager who, so to speak, ""appropriately"" started his career end of 1986, at L'Oréal as a product manager for Lancôme. In 1989, I was given the opportunity to create the Group's subsidiary in Indonesia. Between 1994 and the end of 1995, I became Deputy General Manager of Lancôme. Then, a new opportunity to expatriation arose, this time in Brazil, where I took in 1996 the General management of the Luxury Products Division. These will surely be remembered as my best years abroad and the start of a continued commitment to this country. In 1999, I returned again to France as Managing Director of the Perfume Division. It was at that time of my life that I made an encounter that will completely change not only my approach of the business but also bring me a little closer to Brazil. The man behind this encounter is named Luiz Seabra, the founder of Natura. A few figures enable to measure the gone through road by a man who created from scratch in 1969 a company to manufacture and distribute cosmetics and whose empire is now worth two billion euros in sales, all this only relying on a single concept, the one of direct sales thanks to the ""busy-bee work"" carried out by nearly a million ""consultants."" These very ""consultants"" who are also able to sell products with dugout canoes in the depths of the Amazon. Premium Beauty News - But most importantly, from this encounter with the founder of Natura will emerge a collaboration that will last several months! Joël Ponte - Absolutely! And this may make a few people smile, but I realized that L'Oréal was not the centre of the world. This was the time when leaders at Natura were reflecting on the way to change the Group's business model especially outside Latin America. This will result in the opening of a Natura store in France in April 2005. In fact, what we had in mind with the opening of outlets was more to have a flag ship shop who would serve as a reference for the brand while developing at the same time a direct sales network. The same strategy will then be developed in Russia, England, United States. But my job also consists as of 2006 in analysing the strengths and weaknesses of the brand. Very quickly, we understand that the strong image of the company, based on natural products, and which is naturally present in the collective imagination of consumers should better match the formulas, the graphics and the design of product lines. ""History must be visible! "" A task that will last three years! Premium Beauty News - Then at the end of 2008, it is the financial and economic crisis. But it is also at that moment that you realize both the potential of the dermo-cosmetic sector and the development opportunities available in this segment, specially in Brazil where obviously women visit their dermatologist to look more beautiful! So, you decide to start out! Joël Ponte - Yes, in fact it's typically Brazilian! Don't forget that the association of dermatologists in Brazil is the largest one in the world after the United States! Yes, I start out in February 2009, on my own, in the creation of my company with a strong idea in mind: use one of the characteristics that make Brazil stand out: the country's fantastic network of mineral spring waters, more than 400..., find the one that best suits the criteria of purity and balance which are keys to the development of skincare lines matching the characteristics of Brazilian skin. And it will be the source ""Serra do Japi."" Premium Beauty News - The name is well chosen, ""Purainova""! Joël Ponte - Well, at least it is perfectly evocative of the almost unique and patented concept that we developed after much thorough research work with the active participation of renowned dermatologists and numerous tests. This initially resulted in three product lines, one line for sensitive skin, two night and day anti-aging products, a line of mineral waters in a spray - including a patent for a mineral water transported by liposomes. End of 2011, we launched a line for oily skin and a line of sunscreens. Premium Beauty News - But it is not enough to just find and produce the perfect product! Il it also necessary to have it distributed to as many people as possible... Joël Ponte - It's a huge challenge that can only be evaluated, as an individual entrepreneur, when your are confronted to it. We had a strategic line and we did our best to stick to it. The one of distributing before all in the network of pharmacies and drugstores. There are 60,000 pharmacies in Brazil. We also have 15 representatives who regularly visit more than 2,000 dermatologists. For our brand Purainnova, the potential, is of about 3,000 to 3,500 outlets. We are already present in 400 of them. Premium Beauty News - And financially? Joël Ponte - From our starting point in 2009, we knew we needed three years to find our balance. This balance will be reached in 2013. We deliberately chose to create our own laboratory and to have our own sales force. This necessarily requires substantial initial investments. But the results are there. The success of our products is undeniable thanks to their quality and to the accuracy of their positioning versus the Brazilian demand, but also because of our price policy."
Brazil-based Mappel increased its full service capacity for the perfume sector,"Premium Beauty News - When visiting your Diadema plant in Sao Paulo, one can only be surprised by the high industrial level of the facilities. Marion Appel - This is one of the keys to our success. Invest..., invest always more to be at the highest level in terms of quality and to provide an industrial response on this perfume and cosmetic sector. This represents an average of over 10% of our turnover every year. And our current investment plan to increase our capacity and meet demand in the perfume sector is a proof of this. The market has needs, we answer them... And we do it by giving ourselves the means. Premium Beauty News - In deciding, four years ago, to open a brand new plant in Diadema, in addition to the other plant that you own in Sao Bernardo do Campo, you have clearly chosen the option of ""total full service""! Marion Appel - Absolutely! The plant in Sao Bernardo do Campo is mainly dedicated to the filling of samples and of different packagings in a dose format. We had to meet demand in terms of full service, in other words, integrate the manufacture and conditioning of formulas, all this with a very practical ""pharmaceutical"" purpose, even (and I am tempted to say ""mostly"") when it concerns products for the cosmetic industry. Hence our investment in this plant in Diadema four years ago for nearly 5 million Reals, a factory we wanted to be at the cutting edge in terms of industrial installations. As you remember, at Diadema, we produce and condition skincare, bodycare and haircare products, not to mention baby lotions, sunscreens, etc. And the whole of it, I repeat, in an industrial background that I wanted ultra-modern, with cleanrooms complying with pharmaceutical standards, manufacturing and blending equipments but also filling and packaging machines that are what technology has best to offer. With our two plants, the one in Sao Bernardo do Campo and the one in Diadema, we have no less than 25 filling machines. Premium Beauty News - A key step currently underway, an increase in the production capacity for the perfume industry that will make of you one of the biggest players in Brazil in terms of full service for the beauty industry. Marion Appel - We can say that we are today one of the forerunners in this area. And just for the segment concerning the production of sample sachets, we can say without hesitation that we currently have more than half of the market shares in Brazil. Our growth in this niche of full service, particularly thanks to this production unit in Diadema proves, if need be, that it was imperative to diversify and meet growing demand. This is obviously what brought uscloser to the strategy developed by the managers of the Ileos group when we decided to discuss the integration of our activities, last year, with their subsidiary Bioplan. And, as you know, to reach an agreement recently. The synergies between both groups are obvious and our mutual expertise can only enrich the quality of our offer to our clients in Brazil but also with the clients we share at an international level and who are seeking to strengthen their operations in Brazil."
Fareva: The new Brazilian plant will be operational soon,"Originality of the concept, following an agreement signed between the two groups last March, Tubex and Fareva, the aerosol cans and then the aluminium and plastic tubes will be manufactured on site in an adjoining building of 5,000 m² under the responsibility precisely of Tubex, an Austrian company, whose turnover this year will reach EUR 150 million, for 1200 employees and which is owned by a group weighing EUR 1.4 billion in turnover for a total of over 6000 people including such companies as Neumann Aluminium, Glanzstoff, Stoelzle, Prefa GmbH, etc. A second EUR 7 million phase planned for mid-2013 will enable to step up the capacity for formulation and the filling of bottles for the perfume industry to 120 million units, that of aerosols to 100 million and that of cosmetic liquids to 40 million. To note also in this second phase, the implementation of a ""cream"" line capable of producing some 15 million units a year. Finally a third EUR 7 million phase planned for early 2015 will enable to increase the ""perfume"" capacity to 168 million units per year, that of aerosols to 140 million, the one of liquid cosmetics to 60 million and the ""cream"" line to 60 million. To note that the Fareva group has also made plans to manufacture in the short and medium-term some roll-ons, sticks, tubes, make-up products, soaps, etc. An operation totalling in three years nearly 40 million euros! At the same time the Tubex company, a partner to the operation, will have produced in the end about 250 million cases per year, 75 million aluminium tubes and just as many plastic tubes. ""To be present where our customers need us"", explains Thibaut Fraisse, Project Manager at Fareva, ""it's really our mission and this Brazilian unit epitomizes this spirit perfectly. Our clients are the major local groups and the large international ones""."
Formulation: Nippon Shikizai invests in France,"After spending in France 6.2 million euros in 2003 in a brand new production facility intended to host the colour cosmetic activity, the company has just commissioned its first machine called ""back injection"", which enables the manufacturing of compacts and/or eye shadows in automatic or by injecting directly up to four different shades and/or textures through the base of the pans. Since October 15th the company Thépenier Pharma Industrie, a subsidiary of the Japanese Group Nippon Shikizai, is able to produce compact and/or eye shadow under this new technique called ""Back injection"". ""Main assets, explains Sylvie Coudray, Sales manager of Thépenier Pharma Industrie, an extensive experience in the conditioning of colour cosmetics, in packaging, the possibility to inject several colours and/or textures simultaneously, the design of extremely varied patterns since it is possible to inject in a hollow imprint, and ultimately, achieve very high quality products, especially products with glitters."" Not forgetting, of course, a substantial improvement in productivity. After acquiring the French company in 2000, the Japanese group is demonstrating its determination to conquer the European industry of colour cosmetics. Colour cosmetics, a segment, that its leaders know well. Founded in 1957 Nippon Shikizai employs more than 230 people and achieves about half of its turnover in this segment. Fifty people work daily in the R&D department. Since the acquisition of Thépenier Pharma Industrie, there has been a great deal of technology transfers between the two companies, especially in the field of the production of compact and fluid foundations, of mascara and lip gloss. The new production unit dedicated to this activity which was built in 2003 in Saint-Langis-Lès-Mortagne, in Normandy, will have cost the hefty sum of 6.2 million euros and investments have not stopped with the acquisition of this new so-called ""Back Injection"" machine. ""To note that in a different domain, explains Coudray, we have also acquired a real expertise in the production of BB creams (BB for blemish balm. A cream that nourishes, soothes, conceals red spots and protects against sun burns. The BB cream has several functions. It hydrates, unifies, refines skin texture and conceals imperfections)""."
Comptoir Sud Pacifique wants to reconnect with its roots,"When she took over Comptoir Sud Pacifique in November 2010, Valérie Pianelli-Guichard was aware that the challenge she was imposing herself would be difficult to take up. The small size French company, sold by its founders to investors operating in the world of high-end perfumery was in a delicate situation after several negative years. ""A series of bad strategic and marketing choices led to a loss in turnover and notoriety"", explains this pharmacist who graduated from the ESSEC before previously working for the Pierre Fabre group. The story of Comptoir Sud Pacifique started in the early 1970s. The brand emerged from the imagination of Josée and Pierre Fournier, a couple fascinated by perfumes and travels. The fragrances they composed at the time from varieties of flowers, of resins, or of fruits brought back from their journeys disturb the codes of the time but gradually increased the loyalty of demanding customers in search of originality and quality. The brand then developed itself using a concept of traditional, creative perfume niche, and opens some outlets in Paris, Le Touquet or Saint-Tropez, and owned up to five outlets in France bearing its name. The outlets also proposed some luggage, toiletries and even beach linen. When in 2002 the founders sold their company, the new owners sought to get the brand out of its cottage industry-like world by focusing more on multi-brand distribution networks. They closed the outlets, dropped complementary lines to focus on perfumes of which they streamlined the portfolio, the number of fragrances in the catalogue being then cut down from 54 to 17. The brand's creations then claiming to be more accessible to a wider audience. But this new strategy turned out being disappointing. The brand lost its followers, without however managing to find its place in the face of its competitors in the selective market. The traditional customer base in search of differentiation no longer seemed to find its share of new products that also failed to attract a new audience. Since she took over with passion the reins of the company, Valérie Pianelli-Guichard's first objective was to bring accounts back into balance. Which was successfully achieved, since with a turnover of 1 million euros, the balance has become positive again, thanks to the good results performed by export sales where the brand achieves 2/3 of its turnover, the United States, Italy (200 outlets) and Germany (80 outlets) being the three most important markets. Operations were also developed in new European countries, like the Baltic States and Ukraine. And projects are underway in Asia. France, which accounts for one third of sales, is of course a strategic market. Comptoir Sud Pacifique currently has 180 point of sales in France, plus department stores (Printemps, Galeries Lafayette), but this network is being rationalized. ""Our goal is to reposition the brand in exclusivity. We want to give ourselves the means to work well with key accounts, in particular by investing in the training of counsellors and in the animation of outlets"", explained Agathe Finaz de Villaine, Marketing manager. Because after this transitional year, the goal is now to reconnect with the brand's DNA to give it a new impetus. ""Comptoir Sud Pacifique is a fun niche brand very much unlike this segment sometimes characterized by an austere, cold intellectual side. It's a brand that plays with ingredients, giving free rein to its customers audacity. In a nutshell, it's the brand of pleasure perfumery"", explains Pianelli-Guichard. The brand's revival will involve the development of many novelties, with first, the launch of a series of five new fragrances on the theme of travel, intended to bring the brand's discourse and imagination in line with its history. Souffle des Indes, the first fragrance of this collection, developed in collaboration with the perfume creator, Henri Bergia, is a gourmand oriental, rich in contrasts between intoxicating spices and invigorating citrus. True to its origins, Comptoir Sud Pacifique is back again on the road that leads to exotic essences and surprising accords. As for packaging, it has also evolved towards a reconnection with the codes of the brand while also enjoying an update. The brand-specific model of steel-like coloured glass bottle remains unchanged but silk screen printing is abandoned in favour of a more sophisticated and more vintage label and an elegant beech cap to top the bottle. The case (Invercote cardboard, worked with the shiny side inside) was transformed. Comptoir Sud Pacifique inaugurated with this launch its new finish: a stitching of mixed turquoise and brown fawn, a nod to its history and a reminder of its former collections of bags and travel accessories associated to the brand. The next step will consist in giving the brand a range of skincare products worthy of its position. The current range consisting of three body care products made of tropical butters with a very summery positioning, is being completely revisited and should be enriched with face care and toiletry products. Finally, a luxurious line of scented candles is also planned. ""The common thread remains the same: the search for surprising and natural raw materials inviting us on a wonderful journey"", emphasises Pianelli-Guichard. The implementation of these various projects should enable the brand to enrich its offering and to dispose of a set of consistent products with, in focus, the reopening of an exclusive boutique in Paris planned in 2013 or early 2014. ""This is the horizon we have set ourselves with. But we don't want to cut any corners, we don't have unlimited means. Our priority is to strengthen the brand."""
Distribution: The FPPS focuses on social issues and training,"At 50 and after a career mostly spent in the world of human resources, Marie-Hélène Morin has just joined the Federation of French selective perfumery (FFPS) [1] as its General Delegate. She succeeds Bernard Tessier who becomes advisor to the President. This employment law specialist is used to collective bargaining. She began her career in 1984 at CGEE Alsthom which later became Cegelec, then as Head of Social Affairs at Davum Armatures, a subsidiary of Usinor Sacilor (Arcelor Mittal). In 1995 she leaves the industry for service providers to integrate Carglass as its Director of Human Resources and then joins in 1996, still as a HRD, the Minit Group who operates in France through two networks of specialized outlets: Mister Minit (230 points of sales), and Montre Service (55 points of sales). As of 2002, she is also in charge of the social relations of the multi service shoe repair branch and becomes the Vice-President of one of the employers' organization, the SRIC (Syndicat des Réparateurs Industriels de la Chaussure - Union of Industrial Shoe repairers). First Priority: complete the cycle of negotiations on the new collective agreement for the selective perfumery. The former agreement was denounced in 2008 by all the employers' organizations who wanted to distinguish clearly selective distribution from beauty treatments. ""The previous agreement in force dated back to 1978 and even included aesthetics schools, but the needs of distribution and the ones of beauty treatments are quite different"", explains the new General Delegate. ""At the end of the notice period of three years, the current agreement will expire October 28, 2011, and will therefore no longer be applicable. Our objective is to reach an agreement before the end of 2012"", she added. It is a total of nearly 17,000 employees who are directly concerned. The other major project is training. ""This is a key issue. The core of perfume and cosmetic selective distribution depends of advice given, and therefore of the training of sales beauty consultants. Of course big names in the business have their own training centres, but for smaller structures there aren't really any adapted solutions."" The main challenge is to find ways of training employees, without penalizing the activity, especially that of small independent structures. ""A reflection has already started, we will resume it with the aim of finding innovative solutions. At this point, all options are open, including the possibility of creating a academy under the aegis of the FFPS. But nothing has been decided yet, the reflection process is only starting again with also an important social component attached to it"", emphasised Morin."
"Coptis: A software saga, to better serve cosmetic laboratories","Premium Beauty News - It all began one day of 1999, you set off on a big adventure, you are only 33 years old. Anne Karagoz - It's true! I start all by myself. The idea is simple but not necessarily easy to implement. It consists in setting up a database of active cosmetic ingredients. At the time, no such thing existed on the market. Premium Beauty News - Why Coptis? Anne Karagoz - Actually, I went through several phases in my quest for a name... It started with Cosmetic Data then Advisance to end up finally with this name derived from a Chinese herb, Coptis. It was simple, spoke for itself, and was evocative too. That's all. Premium Beauty News - The beginnings were difficult? Anne Karagoz - Rather difficult, yes! Because from the concept to the realization of this type of database, needless to say that there was a long way to go! It was of course necessary to develop the entire architecture and interface. We had to contact and visit each of the suppliers of raw materials. Initially, I suggested they paid to be part of this database, but very quickly I realized that this approach was not credible. To insure that a majority of suppliers became members, we had to offer free membership and get the user instead to pay to access the database. Premium Beauty News - How did the suppliers welcome this approach? Anne Karagoz - They were delighted! Anyhow, there was never any blockage, on the contrary. In May 2001, the database contains several hundred of materials. In parallel, Coptis Lab sees the light and soon a few large customers place their trust in us. And I take the opportunity here, to thank them once again. These companies are Guinot, Inter Cosmétiques, Clarins, Cartier... Premium Beauty News - Today, Coptis Lab is your flagship product? But it is not the only one. Anne Karagoz - Coptis Lab is indeed our flagship product. It enables the cosmetic industry to efficiently manage its development projects, to reduce time to market and to improve the quality and reliability of information. Our teams of cosmetic chemists and of IT specialists ensure the continuous improvement of our products through our cosmetic expertise, our Users Club or the direct recommendations of our clients. In addition to our applications, we provide services with high added value enhancing their performance that include a documentary database describing more than 10 000 cosmetic raw materials, developed through partnerships with ingredients suppliers, a Coptis Lab integrated regulatory database elaborated through our regulatory groups and based on our clients' expertise. Coptis Lab is a software specially designed for laboratories specialised in cosmetic formulation. It integrates the different development phases of a cosmetic formula, from the marketing brief to the compilation of the regulatory file. Coptis Lab is also meant for quality control laboratories. Coptis Ingredients identifies and describes more than 10 000 cosmetic raw materials under about thirty headings essential to formulators and regulatory departments (raw material presentation, functional classification, cosmetic properties, chemical nature, main origins, date of placing on the market, solubility, preserving agents, specifications, formulation conditions, applications, incompatibilities, percentage of use, storage conditions, shelf life, INCI names, regulatory restrictions, CAS and EINECS numbers, efficacy and toxicological data...). MSDS, product files and standard formulations are also accessible as electronic files. Raw materials are listed by manufacturer in order to guarantee unicity of information. Distributors are indicated for each country. Premium Beauty News - A success which seems to have even crossed national borders? In any case, in 2008 you have the feeling that you must cross the Atlantic Ocean So much so that now you live over there! Anne Karagoz - It's true! Intuitively, I quickly have the feeling that we need to set foot in North America where there is no offer in this area. Meanwhile, we set up a network of agents in Europe, especially in Italy, Spain and Germany. Our first steps in the U.S. date back to 2009. Today, I'm working there with three colleagues. We are twelve in France. It is really not a problem to manage everything from New York. Premium Beauty News - You are obviously driven by the spiralling evolution of legislation on cosmetics in the world. Anne Karagoz - This is a good spur, indeed, for our customers and therefore for us. And the new cosmetic regulation that will be put in place in 2013 in Europe is not unrelated to this. Premium Beauty News - Any other projects in sight? Anne Karagoz - Yes, a lot!"
Jean-Claude Biguine: 30 years next year!,"Premium Beauty News - It's always difficult for a self made man to escape from his always unusual history! Brian Feinman - Yes indeed, there is no exception! But what an adventure! There is a young man from Brittany, who opens his first hair salon at the age of 22. He starts by designing a very functional hair salon and offers his customers very affordable services. Quickly, he opens his second and third hair salon, and then ten... Premium Beauty News - What defines and influences from the start the Jean-Claude Biguine ""style""? Brian Feinman - The general public trend, easy to wear creations, everyday hairstyles free of stereotypes. Brown, blond or red haired women with long or short, smooth or straight hair, can be found without any distinction in his creations who ride on all strong current trends. Premium Beauty News - But there have been some key milestones in this singularity so specific to Jean-Claude Biguine? Brian Feinman - Yes, everyone remembers of course in 1992 the famous without appointment ""Shampooing/Brushing"" service offer for only 50 francs (less than 8 euros) inscribed in huge letterings on each shop front that will truly democratize hairstyle. Premium Beauty News - It true that at the time the trend was on franchised salons. Brian Feinman - Jean Claude Biguine was clearly one of the forerunners in this field with his first franchised salon in Chambly in 1989. He already owned at the time five other salons under his own name. And in 1990, he launches Biguine Magazine. Two years later, it is no less than 70 Jean-Claude Biguine salons that open up in France. Premium Beauty News - To this acceleration in France matches the first salon openings abroad. Brian Feinman - Absolutely! The first one opens in Italy in 1994. Followed by Japan, Belgium and the United States in 1996. Two years later, Jean Claude Biguine has developed a network of 270 salons in the whole world. India is the latest country to date where we have set foot and where we already have 6 prestigious Beauty Salons where we can already claim a leading position. Premium Beauty News - And with always one step ahead of competitors, it's the launch of Biguine Make Up. Brian Feinman - This takes place in 1998. The year where I actually integrate the company with, among others, the task to launch this range of make-up products. I say ""among others"" since in quick succession were launched ranges of traditional face body and hair care products, aromatherapy and 100% organic natural hair styling, colouring products, accessories, electronic beauty, sunglasses and ready to wear. Incidentally, this line of colour cosmetics launched and distributed by the company Gade Eden hasn't stopped growing with a development rate of its turnover of 5% for 2010/11. This range offers a broad array of products comprising more than 350 references with some product innovations for each season. The quality of design, and of textures, the trendy colours, and a good quality/price ratio all contribute to make it a high performance range. It is sold in the Group's Beauty Salons as well as in department stores like Monoprix (where we rank in fourth position), Le Printemps, Galeries Lafayette and such perfumeries chain stores as Douglas and Nocibé. Premium Beauty News - In fact you have a multifunctional role? Brian Feinman - Absolutely. My role consists among other things, to monitor the development from the conceptual phase to market launch with our industrial partners (testing, formula validations, design, packaging design, setting up of specifications, manufacturing and quality control) as well as promotion, public relations and partnerships. Premium Beauty News - You have innovated with what you call ""manucure et beauté brésiliennes"" (Brazilian manicure and beauty). Brian Feinman - These are two new pleasant and healthy services we offer, to treat and beautify hands and feet. The kit comes in an individual bag. Each customer gets his own nail file and branchwood stick, as well as two gloves or boots pre-filled with a 100% natural creamy formula with a neutral pH containing several actives. The customer just needs to put on the glove and make a hole at the tip of the fingertips with the stick to treat the nails. The skin is nourished, moisturised with a silky feel. The skin and nails also look whiter. The hands are delicately scented. This product, manufactured in Brazil under the Balbcare brand, has a leading position in Brazil. Premium Beauty News - Another innovation in your salons, Glossy Color - the new express service, hair make-up and the opening of a new outlet for the manicure and the beauty treatment of hands and feet! Brian Feinman - Glossy Color uses Dialight the new tone on tone coloration from L'Oréal Professionel. It's an ammonia-free formula that respects the hair fibre. Like a hair ""make up"", Dialight imparts the hair with a Glossy effect that captures the light. Intended for women between 30 and 40, this service is perfect for those who are reluctant to make a first hair colouration, especially those looking for a glossy, very natural result, with no root effect. As for the opening of a new ""Biguine Nails"" outlet in Paris in the 7th arrondissement, it is actually a brand new and very promising concept."
"Amalia Marciano, Pacific World Corporation: ""Many launches in 2012!""","Premium Beauty News - For those who do not know Pacific World Corporation, can you tell a word about your company? Amalia Marciano - Pacific World Corporation subcontracts the manufacture and distribution of artificial nails (Nailene, Fing'rs, Revlon), of Revlon licensed false eyelashes, of cosmetic products for teens and tweens (GeoGirl, Fing'rs and Crayola licensed products) and the exclusive distribution of Bio-Oil (South African anti-stretch marks products).

Many launches are expected in 2012 for all the brands mentioned above. Premium Beauty News - You are launching new products at an impressive pace! Amalia Marciano - In fact, launches never stop because the distribution network is the mass market with some temporary launches (displays) in seasonal departments at Wal-Mart, CVS... artificial nails require a rotation of the different designs every six months. Premium Beauty News - Who are your main suppliers? Amalia Marciano - For cost reasons, our suppliers are mainly located in Asia because margins on our products are quite high (our own margins and the margins of our key accounts). Premium Beauty News - What did you think of this first edition of MakeUp in New York? Amalia Marciano - I really enjoyed the show's set up and presentation. Offers from exhibitors suited my expectations in terms research and requirements. The show was an opportunity to establish good contacts and there is already a follow up on some of them."
Bioware shares the 'made in France' expertise,"Created fifteen years ago, the Laboratoires Bioware are a perfect example of the know-how of French SMEs in the cosmetic industry. The company which employs 20 people dedicated to development and creation and 65 more on the production site belonging to their parent company, produces annually about 700 tons of cosmetic products for the face, the body and the hair. Customers are located in thirty different countries. ""Asia comes first in our customer base, followed by the United States, in spite of the not too favourable euro/dollar parity, Europe, and finally Latin America"", explained Cyrille Telinge, the President. This international success was gradually established through the building of relationships of mutual trust with customers. ""We have patiently earned a reputation for ourselves and developed our customer portfolio, country by country, by offering only 'Made in France' quality"". Bioware first built this reputation on the intransigence of its leaders for quality both in terms of products, and of related services. Because if, for cosmetics, French creativity and know-how are recognized the world over, the country's reputation is somewhat less flattering in terms of customer relations. ""When it comes to full service, what will make the difference is, of course, the quality of developments in labs, but also all the services in connection with the creative process,"" insisted Telinge. ""Our clients come to us because they know that the 'made in France' label will offer them a number of guarantees in terms of quality and creativity, a plus that will make their marketing approach easier. But the satisfaction survey we conducted recently, showed that they were surprised and delighted by all the experiences they shared with us. They appreciate our customer approach which is both warm and formal from a professional point of view"". And customer attention means a lot when many of these customers are not too familiar with the world of cosmetics and need to be reassured. ""They often are pharmaceutical groups seeking to diversify their activities, or retailers - often specialized chains operating in the pharmaceutical and beauty sector - who want to develop their own brands, or companies from the textile sector and for whom cosmetic products are a logical complement to their clothing lines"". Hence, Bioware offers a set of services based on the multiple know-how of its laboratory, of its design studio and of its manufacturing unit. They range from the simple development of formulas to the creation a range from A to Z, including production and filling. But beyond development, Bioware leaders, who have launched their own brand Novexpert, can pride themselves on being able to monitor the entire marketing chain. The company has even developed a real specialization in export operations and proposes to carry out, on behalf of its customers, all the necessary administrative procedures required for the placing on the market, including if need be, product registration. What is new is that Bioware has decided to make this expertise profitable in a different way by the sharing of it. A unique approach! Under the label 'Novexpert Formation', the company offers a catalogue of modules covering all the practical issues to which a SME from the sector might be confronted, from the building up of the cosmetics technical file to the monitoring of the outlets or the International prospecting, including the calculation of development costs. ""As part of this training, it is possible for attendees to leave with lists of potential buyers in France or overseas or of journalists from the health and beauty sector. It is a service that we would have dreamed of having when we started,"" emphasised Telinge."
Schwan Cosmetics: a challenging world!,"Premium Beauty News - As an introduction, what about the company's activity for this 2011 year, ending in three months time? Joerg Karas - 2011 has been a year of milestones for Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics. On May 27, we celebrated the 10th anniversary of our Czech facility and just a couple of weeks ago on September 16, we celebrated the 15th anniversary of our US facility. Throughout the year we are participating in many international shows such as FCE Cosmetique in Sao Paulo, Beautyworld Middle East in Dubai, MakeUp in Paris, MakeUp in New York, Beauty Professional in Kazan and Cosmoprof Asia in Hongkong. When it comes to innovative new products, within the eyeliner category, we have to point out our new StyleMatic, a great next step within the automatic pencil category. Premium Beauty News - Make-up products featuring long-wear characteristics remain a major challenge for the future, don't you think? Joerg Karas - We live in a fast world. The need for convenience and ease-of-use is getting stronger and stronger. This is especially true for women in the work force. That is why make up not only has to reliably last throughout the day but also through special occasions and formulas have to perform accordingly. We consistently achieve the highest performance with our formulas and as a result gain very happy end consumers. This is the reason why we work on formulas that guarantee an extremely long-lasting wear but at the same time promise a very comfortable application feel. The focus varies of course depending on the product form. Premium Beauty News - What products are of concern more specifically? Joerg Karas - For instance, with our high performance products, Sharpenable MT and Liquid Liner, we obtain long-wear characteristics of up to 24h with a consistent finish. Our Mechanical product field offers clear USPs for the most diverse demands within colour cosmetics. Modern application systems allow for a multitude of formula and make-up features, from all-day-long to very colour intense. Premium Beauty News - Does it mean the end of wood- pencils? Joerg Karas - No, not at all. The wood-clenched pencil, also preferred and loved by makeup artists, will keep its strong standing within the Colour Cosmetics world through the smart usage of new, high-tech ingredients and application features on an exceptional high level. Premium Beauty News - International regulatory constraints as well as consumer requirements vary from one country, from one region to another. Not so simple in such conditions to have a product development strategy? Joerg Karas - As a leading manufacturer we are able to know and answer to the multitude of international standards. Matters of compliance are treated with high priority as they are an important part of our customer service. Regarding customer requirements, local climate conditions must also be taken in the equation. Hot climate zones with high humidity put very different demands onto the long-lasting wear of a formula than for example the Central European climate zone. In addition, skin type, the geometry of the eye and makeup habits play a very important role. This is where we have our say! Premium Beauty News - What other challenges must be taken? Joerg Karas - A very good question: after a 24h claim, what other challenges will there be in terms of long-lasting properties? Be assured, we are already exploring successfully several avenues."
Premium Beauty News.com steadily growing,"Actually, in 2008 the gamble was far from being won. Several Internet sites were already offering on line information for beauty professionals. But from day one, PremiumBeautyNews.com chose to be a completely free information website both in English and French. Most of all, with a wealth of experience behind its creators, the website offered the global cosmetic industry, from ingredient and packaging suppliers to retailers, including converters and brands, a rich content in exclusive information giving also pride of place to iconography. As a result: an impressive increase of the traffic. As of 2009, the monthly audience of the website exceeded 16,000 readers (unique visitors) per month [1], improving its score by over 50% the following year to an average 22,241 readers per month. The growth continued with more than 30% in the first half of 2011 and PremiumBeautyNews.com should approach 30,000 readers per month by the end of the year. The annual number of visits [2] has of course increased in similar proportions 274,632 in 2009 (22,886 visits per month), 407,004 in 2010 (33,917 visits per month) and 488,400 visitors are expected for the whole year 2011 (or 40,700 visits per month). More than 815,000 hits were done in 2010 and this figure should be closer to a million in 2011! As a bilingual website, PremiumBeautyNews.com is obviously very well established in France, a global leader in the cosmetic industry. However, readership is predominantly international, with most of readers coming from Europe and North America."
Strand Cosmetics Europe is strengthening itself,"Premium Beauty News - A few words on this new visual identity... Dominique Bouvier - It is brand new. We unveiled it for the first time at MakeUp in Paris last June. It expresses the company's DNA, its expertise, its values. In addition to the graphic design itself of Strand Cosmetics, it is underlined by a line consisting of four colours that reflect our culture, that of a company where creativity, innovation and respect for the human are at the heart of our organization. We have also released for the occasion a ""New Look"" palette where these same four colours appear first in the form of a Etain polychrome foundation. A creamy, silky filled texture of blushes to apply with a finger or a brush, featuring subtly iridescent colours that change according to the light. There is also a powder texture of Hybrid Shadow suitable for any kind of fantasy. Applied dry, the powder melts into a soft and silky halo, applied with water, colour then intensifies. Third reference, a red Twinkly Smoothie that adorns lips with an intense and vibrant colour thanks to its soft and creamy texture. Lips are illuminated with bright and luminous colours. Finally, the Gloss Lipofruit Cassis, finely pearled, illuminates lips with a touch of greediness to achieve sparkling and sensual ""zero defects"" lips. Premium Beauty News - A new logo and new image... but also a new approach in terms of management. Dominique Bouvier - Being certified ISO 9001 for ten years and ISO 22716, we decided to look resolutely to the future by committing ourselves even further for the benefit of our customers. Hence, we are adapting our management system with the integration of two new standards, the ISO 14001 standard for the environmental management and the OHSAS 18001 standard for the health and safety management. We intend to influence the collective performances of the company and to stimulate all the creative forces of our teams to imagine, innovative, reasonable and economic solutions, in line with a changing business environment. A truly responsible dynamic, which gives pride of place to the sense of service. It is with this spirit of renewal in mind that our laboratories created a beautiful new collection, ""Secrets Révélés"" with technological formulas imparted with this additional supplement of emotion and the real-life experiences of our creators, with a range of very sensory make-up ""Heures Précieuses"". To note that our entire mascara offer has been enhanced thanks to new packagings which were tested to optimize the formulas effect. Packagings designed in particularly by the German firm Oekametall. Cases, brushes, wipers, vials were optimized for each of our references and their combination with our formulas help reveal all their benefits. Premium Beauty News - Economically speaking, how was this year 2011? Dominique Bouvier - I must say, excellent! We will probably exceed 16 million euros in turnover. A figure to compare with the 14.6 million achieved in 2008, which was a benchmark year for the company. We will have invested some 600,000 euros in our production tool, particularly to increase our fleet of high speed filling machines. Make-up represents the bulk of our business (60%) followed by skin care products. One small downside however, our export share which has decreased. It was of 42% before the crisis of 2009 and it has dropped to 30%. This is the reason why we will increase our presence abroad next year, by being present on professional events of importance, like for instance MakeUp in New York. Premium Beauty News - You have expressed it in your last newsletter. Codes are really changing. Dominique Bouvier - It's true! At the time of Facebook and Twitter, where transparency is everywhere, we have noticed there was a marked return for secrecy which is cultivated, for intimacy, and elitism. People lock their identity and emotions away to only reveal them to an inner circle. There is a real return to privacy, away from the crowds to enjoy with chosen friends the cosy atmosphere of places unknown to most people. Luxury no longer rimes with ostentation, over-exposure or overbidding, but it has become more discreet and rimes more with experience, expertise, nobility in the choice of ingredients and capitalizing on brands values as well as on the richness of their heritage. In this regard, I must point out, that the new events in which we participated like MakeUp in Paris and MakeUp in New York, which are more targeted, more intimate, friendlier fit perfect in this new trend."

First project in common, the moving in December of Kosmoda in a new 3000 m2 industrial building, always in Offanengo. To note that the two owners, Dario Moretti for Kosmoda and Rogers Hwang for Crystal Claire Cosmetics, also have two similar activities in packaging with Modapack for the first and Crystal International Packaging for the second. Common point in in both cases, a strong expertise in the niche of airless and make-up packaging. Crystal Claire Cosmetics offers a multitude of service levels and manufacturing options, from full turnkey services to basic co-packing services. To be continued..."

Terre d'Oc is relying on its outlets to boost its international business,"Terre d'Oc's first outlet in the U.S., opened its doors early September in New York in the Rockefeller Center on 49th Street in between the prestigious 5th and 6th avenues. A logical step for the French brand of cosmetics and well-being products, after the opening its first store, rue des Abbesses in Paris. ""We are setting foot in the U.S. with a distributor and with a desire to express our concept and values, to give visibility to our brand, before we decide to launch our products in department stores. The opening of a second store is also planned, again in New York"", explains Valérie Roubaud, CEO and co-founder of Terre d'Oc. Like its counterpart in Paris, the outlet in the Rockefeller Center was designed as a showcase for the four product universes of Terre d'Oc - beauty care, make-up, tea, and fragrances - the common thread being the discovery of the world's beauty and well being rituals. The brand is also relying on strong values: ecological (in particular with a partnership with SGD and its Infinite Glass), biological (with certified products), ethical (with special attention given to fair-trade for the sourcing of raw materials) and of solidarity (with the financing of aid projects to the poorest). The brand, which in France is exclusively distributed in the stores of Nature et Découverte, is already present in twenty countries, mainly in Europe, with Denmark, Finland, UK, Russia, Sweden and Ukraine. It is now closely focusing on Asia, and its participation last year to the Cosmoprof Asia trade show, allowed the company to make many contacts and get started in Taiwan, with two outlets, and Korea where a store opening is planned late 2011-early 2012. The project of launching the brand in Hong Kong is also well on track. The opening of its own outlets is at the heart of the strategy of international development of Terre d'Oc. ""We seek to open a dozen outlets internationally this year. In addition to the two outlets in New York, the two of Taiwan, and the one planed in Korea, we will also open our own outlets in Mexico and Ukraine. Not to mention, this fall, the opening of two outlets in Portugal, in Lisbon and Porto, the two first in Europe after Paris"", Roubaud announced. And when the brand will be better known, better established and the concept fully finalized, the idea of expanding the network with the launch of franchises is not excluded. For now, Terre d'Oc will attend the next TFWA Tax Free TFWA World Exhibition in Cannes from 18 to 23 September 2011. ""We are not present yet in travel retail. That said, the show will also be welcoming international buyers from other upscale distribution channels"", Roubaud added."
"Heinz Glas, 350 years! And younger than ever...","Premium Beauty News - A fine example of sustainability this anniversary is indeed? Carl-August Heinz - You can say that again! This anniversary really epitomises what our group does and will continue to do as part of its historic mission of responsibility towards its hundreds of dedicated staff members, but also with respect to the hundreds of customers who trust the Group. Premium Beauty News - You have already expressed yourself on this subject through this website, but it is always important to recall that the Heinz Group currently has little in common with the one of former days. Carl-August Heinz - Concerning plastic operations, our presence is constant and, as you know, has accelerated with the acquisition of our colleagues from Böhm, a 30 million euro business, which we have acquired a few days before our festivities took place. Regarding glassware, the shift was operated in 1999, when we decided to specialize mainly on the high-end segment of perfumery and cosmetics to serve, on all continents, increasingly demanding customers. In twelve years, the choice made paid off! May I recall that we currently have no less than five glass factories with two in Germany (Kleintettau and Pilsau), one in Poland (Dzialdowo), one in Peru (Heinz Glas Ferrand) and one in China (""3"" Star Hangzhou Sanxing Craftwork Glass Co. Ltd), with a production capacity of some 1.5 billion bottles and jars with nine furnaces and 32 production lines, not to mention dedicated decoration workshops in Germany, Czech Republic and China and Lima town. The group will post this year, a total turnover of over 300 million euros. Premium Beauty News - The celebration in Kleintettau was also the opportunity to announce a hefty investment! Again, a real challenge in times of crisis? Carl-August Heinz - Yes, quite true! It's a risk we are taking! This second crisis was predictable and we had taken it into account when we took the decision in December 2010 to invest in a new 60 ton furnace and two new production lines in Kleintettau. But you know, we have been in operation for 350 years and we have had to undergo severe crisis, at least every twenty years. We always managed to recover after each of them. Premium Beauty News - What was the amount of the investment? And what are the other major projects? Carl-August Heinz - It is important to recall that once the decision was taken, things went very quickly. It took only six months to build the new building and install the new furnace with its two production lines for a total of 20 million euros. And the location for a third line is already prepared which will lead to a final bill of 27 million euros. As for other initiatives, they concern our glass factory in Poland where we have rebuilt a furnace which helped increase production by 20%. We also plan building a second furnace in Peru and a third one in China. Premium Beauty News - The ""plastic activity"" is not far behind? Carl-August Heinz - The takeover of Böhm, which was echoed in your website, is part, of course, of this strategy of growing and also consolidating our plastic activities. Its production potential come in addition to the five production sites we already own on this sector and which generate a turnover of over 60 million euros. Premium Beauty News - You have also announced another particularly original industrial project. Carl-August Heinz - Original, certainly, but nonetheless quite serious and exciting! The idea is simple. A glass factory generates a lot of excess heat - also quite a lot at relatively low temperatures. Why not use it to heat greenhouses and produce in our reputedly cold regions some exotic fruits and vegetables in large quantities to supply our markets and grocery stores? Well, I can tell you that this project will see the light. We are supported by the region and the EU to build a pilot-greenhouse of 3,500 m² that will produce about 10 tons of exotic fruits and 10 tons of tropical fish. The cost of this pilot-operation: five million euros. And if we are successful, other greenhouses will emerge around our other glass factories in Europe."
"Philippe Thuvien, L'Oréal: ""Tap into collective intelligence to create value!""","Premium Beauty News - Moving into your new premises in Saint-Ouen in March 2011, was surely an important moment in the life of the group? Philippe Thuvien - Yes, is was indeed an important moment for our community. Whereas before the Corporate and Operational Packaging services were scattered over several sites, all the Packaging teams for Europe, with the exception of Compatibility and Expertise Laboratories, i.e., 160 people, are gathered together on a single platform fostering at the same time collaborative work. Premium Beauty News - How is the Packaging and Development organized at L'Oréal? Philippe Thuvien - The ""Packaging & Development Community"" is divided into three clusters with a ""Corporate Packaging & Development"" Department, a ""Product Development"" and ""Operational Packaging."" But do bear in mind that it is a global organization, which means it's also the same operational structure in Europe, North America, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. Premium Beauty News - What are the main missions of this ""Corporate Packaging & Development"" department? Philippe Thuvien - Our main tasks are to define the group's packaging policy, to coordinate and manage operational teams, define processes and tools as well as performance management. Not forgetting, of course, internal and external research and development of innovative packagings, technical packaging expertise to support operational teams, the compatibility between the packaging and its formula, and finally the creation of new designs with the help of the Areca Agency. Premium Beauty News - What about the two core activities ""Product Development"" and ""Operational Packaging""? Philippe Thuvien - In direct contact with Marketing, the ""Product Development"" teams serve as an interface between the Business, Operational and R & I. teams. In a prospective and definition phase, they participate with the Marketing teams to the setting up of launch plans. They help marketing teams with the product definition. They study the technical and economic feasibility and propose innovative and environmentally friendly solutions. During the industrialization phase, they develop and monitor the follow-up of schedules and the coordination of all the actors involved in the launch, they elaborate and control the estimated production costs and ensure the development and approval of designs. Finally, they monitor and coordinate the value analysis. As for the ""Operational Packaging "" teams, they are in charge of ensuring the technical design of packaging items, of developing technical plans and pre required specifications for the supplier consultations, of insuring the certification of packagings and finished products and, finally, of elaborating and validating the AC/PF specifications. Premium Beauty News - You insist a lot on the concepts of sharing, of cooperation, and finally of trust that must be established internally and, above all, vis-à-vis your external stakeholders? Philippe Thuvien - Collaborative intelligence is fundamental. It starts with the coordination and management of operational teams and by promoting the sharing of experiences and best practices through the organisation of committees, theme days and ""Trades"" seminars, or even with community sites. This also involves what we call ""the animation of the design quality system."" As for our suppliers, we have developed collaborative innovation, shared conceptions and the delegations of certification. A new approach with one of the highlights being, November next, the organization in collaboration with the Purchasing department, for the second year in a row of the Cherrypack operation, during which selected suppliers will have the opportunity to present their innovations to the Group. Premium Beauty News - Innovation is obviously at the heart of this dynamics! Philippe Thuvien - Our role is to be both a source of proposals for brands but also to be attentive to their needs. The enhancement of product performance, convenience of use and sensoriality are fundamental driving forces on which we base our innovation strategies while anticipating consumer expectations, regulatory requirements and integrating ambitious eco-design objectives, without forgetting the needs of emerging markets. Premium Beauty News - You also have a duty of expertise? Philippe Thuvien - This packaging expertise is one of L'Oréal assets with the supply of a real support to operational and innovation teams. Packaging expertise also has a mission of value analysis, of regulatory monitoring and of implementing new regulations as well as our Group's requirements. Premium Beauty News - Design is also an integral part of your approach. Philippe Thuvien - Areca, the design agency brings its contribution to the various activities of the Group and it also works in close cooperation with the Packaging Innovation teams to develop new concepts. Premium Beauty News - Among the ""external"" operations, two have retained attention, the Cherrypack launched last year and, more recently, the First Open Packaging Innovation Challenges in July 2011. Philippe Thuvien - This is indeed part of this spirit of openness and partnership that we want to develop. You have named two but there are others and there will be others in the future. The First Open Packaging Innovation Challenges were launched with three schools: Advancia, a School specialised in business management, ESIEC, a school specialised in packaging engineering and the Strate College, a school specialised in designing. The main highlights which emerged from such an initiative were, to rely on collective intelligence to create value, to promote university-industry rapprochements, and to have innovation focused on the needs of customers and future customers. Each winning idea, being of course rewarded. Premium Beauty News - The next edition of Cherrypack will take place in November? Philippe Thuvien - Indeed, we have decided to renew this positive experience with the Purchasing department. This year, suppliers participating to the operation were selected by a broadened panel comprising members coming from such areas as Purchasing, Packaging and Development, Research and Prospective Marketing. It an opportunity for us to build an exclusive offer to meet the needs of our brands and of consumers."
Fareva continues to expand internationally,"This time it's a deal! The presence of the group of French origin on the other side of the Atlantic is a reality since several days. An essential step for the firm whose head manager, Bernard Fraisse, had always been clear about, concerning its strategic importance. ""We just had to choose the right opportunity to increase our influence on this continent, he explains, in both the pharmaceutical and cosmetic fields. And this production unit has everything it takes to achieve this thanks to its talented teams and its excellent industrial tool."" The Richmond plant will continue to undertake manufacturing and conditioning operations for Pfizer. This take over for Fareva, is part of a true acceleration in the company's international development which now operates in ten countries ""and should, in two years time be setting foot in Asia"", reveals Bernard Fraisse! For now, the other major project is located in Brazil where the company started in July 2010 the construction of a factory whose buildings extend over more than two hectares for the filling and packaging of eaux de toilette and aerosols. An investment divided into three tranches which will amount in the end to 42 million euros and will employ between 700 and 800 people. ""The group Avon is an important partner in this operation, emphasises Bernard Fraisse, since we will be able to guarantee him the conditioning of more than 150 million units per year."" To note that the Tubex group is also an important stakeholder with the supply of aerosols and tubes. ""Certainly a perfect platform too, explains Fareva's CEO, to seize future growth opportunities in the make-up sector of this continent."" A 2011 year also marked for the group with several other industrial investments with for example the commissioning of a second site in Turkey (foaming products and creams), not to mention Russia (foaming products and eaux de toilette) and the start of a second conditioning line for aerosols in Wales."
Kanebo accelerates business expansion in China,"With the aim to strengthen its overseas business, Kanebo Cosmetics is investing heavily in China, the group's top priority overseas. The Japanese cosmetics giant, which has already build a strong presence in department stores and high-end pharmacies, is now targeting specialty stores that are developing at a fast pace, including in China's inland second and third tier cities. According to Kanebo, there are around 200,000 specialty beauty stores in China and they already constitute a major retail channel, in particular in smaller inland cities. In order to tap into this market, the firm will start to sell its products in around five hundred specialty stores in the cities of Sian and Chengdu, and aims to increase this number to around a thousand by the end of 2011. Consistently with this retail strategy, Kanebo is launching Aqua Lunash, a new brand that has been conceived to perfectly fit with the new distribution channel. Entirely manufactured in China, Aqua Lunash targets women in their twenties, with little or no experience of cosmetic products. Scheduled in September, the initial release of Aqua Lunash features a line of 45 items priced from 12 to 210 Chinese yuan. ""Prices will be set at around the 100 RMB mark so as to make the items readily accessible to young women in this age group,"" said the company in a release. The line mainly focuses on addressing complexion dullness issues, that is one of the main beauty concerns of Chinese women. On this occasion, Kanebo will also introduce new counters that have been designed to match with the needs of specialty stores. However, the brand will be available in department stores too."
ADA Cosmetics to distribute Aveda products in hotels,"Aveda, the US brand of natural and organic beauty products, which has belonged to the Estée Lauder Companies GmbH since 1997, has chosen the German company ADA Cosmetics International (ADA) to distribute its products in the hotel business. As of September 1, 2011, ADA will distribute Aveda's body care lines in Europe, Australia and also in Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan. The new partner's product range includes a multitude of high-end, flower and plant-based skin and body care items for the hotel bathroom, as well as for hotel spa and beauty salon. In order to ensure a prompt delivery of orders, ADA plans to consolidate the stocking of the Aveda merchandise quickly and to establish warehousing in the distribution centers of Kehl (Germany) and Hong Kong. As a manufacturer of hotel cosmetics, ADA enjoys a sales network and a logistics structure that allow the group to supply more than 15,000 customers worldwide, mainly 3- to 5-star hotels. In 2010, the turnover of ADA Cosmetics International amounted to 42 million euros. According to Wilhelm Könning, CEO of the ADA group, Aveda's products perfectly complement ADA's own offerings. ""This company's uncompromising and environmentally conscious approach matches our own values and product philosophy very well. Now our selection of 'green' lines has become larger. Our clients will really appreciate that"", he said."
MakeUp in New York to host Studio Make Up,"Premium Beauty News - Launching a new make-up brand : what an adventure ! Jacques Cohen - Studio Make Up was launched following repeated requests from a number of retailers who were looking to private label their own make-up products but who had no ideas of what it involved in terms of constraints and commitments (development of formulas and colours, packaging inventories, development of displays, new product developments, promotions, minimum quantity orders per colour, deadlines, etc...). We noticed that these retailers did not have any real experience in packaging development and that they did not have the necessary personnel to follow a program of products development of a make-up brand. So we decided to create a high-end line both in terms of packaging but also and above all, of textures, and we decided to adopt the product positioning of a ""Professional Make-up Accessible to every women."" Premium Beauty News - In which retail channels? Jacques Cohen - We started targeting the largest retailers per market regardless of their territory. We offer this brand as an exclusive product to retailers or for them to develop under their own private label on their territory, or in co-branding, while offering them the same benefits they would have with a private label (i.e. only available for them), but without the constraints. The Studio Make Up concept was launched in April-May 2010. It is currently in use, in France, Canada, Central America and Asia. In some countries, because of the variety of retailers, Make Up Studio is sold in all the outlets. We have just started in the United States. We are also discussing with several other countries. Premium Beauty News - You visited MakeUp in Paris and you will be participating, through a make-up animation, to MakeUp in New York. What do you think of this new concept of event? Jacques Cohen - For an exhibitor, the concept which was revealed in Paris is perfect: targeted visitors, the size of the event itself. Therefore all visitors will necessary walk past all the stands. All stands are delivered ready to use. The show focuses exclusively on make-up and the cost of it is affordable. For a visitor, the visit can be done in half a day, it is easy to find one's way through it, the visitor coming with a precise agenda can make all his appointments and then do all his follow-ups. Of course, there are some points that will need to be improved, but organizers are already aware of that. I bet New York will be in the same spirit."
Schwan Cosmetics: Always more global!,"Premium Beauty News - Innovation is an integral part of Schwan Cosmetics? Ulrich Griebel - Unquestionably, yes! There are no secret recipes. Innovation is not an option. Even during the 2009 crisis that in the end didn't impact too hard on us, we haven't stopped innovating. Especially in the fields of formulations and application formats that really constitute the heart of our business. Sound industrial implementation remains very important of course, and the development of our international teams as well. And we invest heavily in both areas. Premium Beauty News - Your international strategy seems to have gained momentum? Ulrich Griebel - Well, I would be more tempted to say it has consolidated itself. With the acquisition and continuing reorganization of Cosmolab, we intend to build a much stronger partner for the mass market brands in North America and Mexico. In a nutshell, Cosmolab will focus even more on customer service and product development, whereas the Mexican plant will provide a very efficient manufacturing platform. Premium Beauty News - What is the synergy with the unit you own in New Jersey, near New York? Ulrich Griebel - Schwan Cosmetics USA stays independent. It actually doesn't even operate in the same market segment. It seems like yesterday that we decided to open this plant with just two assembly lines for the production of mechanical eyeliners and lipliners, but 2011 actually marks the 15th anniversary of the company. Meanwhile it has grown significantly, constantly adding more capacity, product and service offerings to its North American customer base. It has actually become the birthplace of many award winning products and is recognized by the entire cosmetics industry as a technologically advanced and innovative partner. A second facility focussing on the production of liquid eyeliners and a comprehensive secondary packaging operation was opened recently in the close neighbourhood. Premium Beauty News - What about Asia? Ulrich Griebel - Clearly, we are strengthening our presence. Our Chinese operation has been a successful first step starting in 2001. But Asia should not be reduced to China only. It's an extremely dynamic region with many different consumer preferences and markets. We will announce a number of decisions shortly."
BeautyFULL Club: the dynamics of a network,"Since January 2010, it is well over 300 people in total who will have gathered at the Café l'Ecluse near the Place Charles de Gaulle - Etoile around the most various topics ranging from challenges for the preservation of the environment to the impact of new EU regulations including the importance of vocational training. From the outset members of the Club also launched several focus groups, one to reflect on sustainable development and the other, in partnership with several Grandes Ecoles, to reflect on several key strategic themes of the time including the training of young people. During the Club's General Assembly, which took place last week in Paris, Charles-Emmanuel Gounod, its President, thanked all the members of the Club for their loyalty ""and this despite the tough economic times the entire industry was going through in 2009 where the aim was primarily to resist an unprecedented financial and economic crisis."" ""But precisely it is during times of crisis that the existence of such a Club makes sense."" he added. Not so simple, in fact, to try and escape from the daily pressure of the market in order to try and reflect together for a few hours, but yet so rewarding! Among the key undertakings made at this General Assembly: to keep and develop this breakfast formula that is so successful, to continue to work with quality speakers and to develop the diversity of issues while seeking to organise an annual breakfast on the economic trends of the industry, trends in the world of beauty, of fashion or design and on the evolution of regulations, while keeping an eye on what is happening in other industries. Second axis for the BeautyFULL Club, activate a close and regular partnership with some Grandes Ecoles by giving them a number of strategic studies that can only serve the entire industry. ""The main partner schools, explained Philippe de Brugière, Vice President, are ESCP, Ecole Boule, ESIEC of Reims, the ENSCI of Paris and the Ecole Centrale de Paris."" And nothing exist nowadays without a attractive website! ""This is almost achieved,"" announced Daniel Saclier, Vice President of the Club. A structured website with both an open space for all visitors (online membership applications, a summary of the Club's activities and some material on the Club's participations) and a section for members (members' personal profiles, a directory, a full presentation of the Club's Breakfasts, advanced research for onsite information, downloads and access to photos and videos). ""Of course, recalled Charles-Emmanuel Gounod, such a club can only exist because of the commitment of each of its member to keep it going and make it grow. It is necessary that each of us relays the club's actions, is actively involved in the development of ideas and participates to the debate that they will surely generate."" A network concept where some European countries are performing better than others. ""Well, precisely, we should pick out the good ideas and good dynamics where we can find them! "" The goal being for 2012, to reach 70 to 80 members! ""Of course, insisted Charles-Emmanuel Gounod, an increase in the number of members can only be the fruit of quality meetings, debates of ideas and the value added brought to the entire industry."""
Ileos acquires Brazil's Mappel,"The agreement, which was announced today, to take a majority stake in Mappel, should reinforce the leadership of Ileos in the manufacture of unit-doses and samples for the cosmetics industry through Bioplan, the subsidiary managed by Ludovic Anceau.. Established in 1970 by Marion Appel, the Mappel company is specializing in the manufacture and filling of unit-doses and samples. Brazilian market leader in its field, the company has 230 employees on two production sites in Sao Paolo. According to Ileos, Mappel posted a turnover of 25 million euros in 2010, with strong continued growth. Managed by Philippe Gelblat, Ileos currently employs 4000 people in 14 locations in Europe, the United States and China. In 2010, the group recorded a turnover of 275 million euros. After this integration, Ileos ""will achieve a turnover of 300 million euros, thus confirming its position as global leader in packaging for the beauty and the healthcare industries,"" said the company in release. This operation will also allow the group to expand its international influence in a geographical area with huge potential. This acquisition fits with the strategy implemented for several years now by the Ileos' management, which aims to support its key customers through the strengthening of the group's its position in high growth areas. ""Mappel offers us the opportunity to develop our know-how and serve our customers in Brazil which has such great potential,"" commented Philippe Gelblat, President of Ileos, adding that Marion Appel would continue to lead the company. For its part, the President of Mappel sees in this partnership a ""significant potential for Innovation and Industrial synergies""."
Cofatech: now targeting make-up,"For this SME specialized in uni-dose samples, which was created by Dominique Lourel, its current CEO, one of the main strategic keys remains constant adaptation to market needs and customers. ""With a strong focus on product innovation and a true complicity with the market and our customers,"" she quickly adds. Innovation, is a watchword in Loudun (western France), where are established Cofatech's headquarters and main production centre. Latest innovations launched in recent months include the ""Walipack"" for the Clarins Fragrance Group, which was the sample selected for the launch of Aura by Swarovski (two samples in one), or the eco refill for Flower by Kenzo, inspired from the Lingobig (the berlingot with a cap), not to mention the now famous concept of the dose in the form of a berlingot who received an ""Oscar de l'emballage"" in 2001 and we all know the success it encountered. ""This is clearly our second nature"", explains Lourel. ""Innovation is an integral part of our vision of the market. It is often the result of an ongoing and desired dialogue with our customers. And also I insist on the fact that it is a true mindset which is inherent to every employee of Cofatech. As a matter of fact, all this gone through road and the growth achieved by the company would not have been possible without their support."" The core markets of the Cofatech firm include skincare products followed by hair products and, more recently, alcohol products, especially perfumes for which a new dedicated workshop was created in 2010. An operation that was part of a broader reorganization and rationalization of production whose overall cost will have exceeded 400,000 euros. ""As for make-up, emphasises Lourel, our presence at the MakeUp in Paris show reflects perfectly our desire to invest more thoroughly this segment, in which we were of course already operating but still relatively discreetly. Especially since this market is increasingly moving towards the notion of full-service, and that we are clearly among the best placed in France to provide such a service."""

Tilo Plöger - In 2010, decorative cosmetics ranked among our most successful markets, recording a 131 percent growth compared to the previous year - mainly through the re-launch and the establishment of the Colours and Deluxe brands. In the fragrances market, our core portfolio of celebrity products has been remarkably growing. The Bruce Willis brand is our best selling fragrance and was the most successful product launch in the whole history of LR. Regarding our personal care products branch, our core brand ""Aloe Vera"" was updated and improved with new formulations and a clear and modern packaging design. This was very well accepted from our distribution partners and our customers. In addition, LR was nominated for the ""Blach Report Event Award 2011"", and within the category ""Lifestyle, Men"" the ""Bruce Willis"" scent has found its way into the final selection of ""Duftstars 2011"", the perfume award of the Fragrance Foundation Germany. Premium Beauty News - And for 2011? Tilo Plöger - In 2011 we are investing around 5 million euros into our headquarters in Germany, including financial resources for research, development and production. Premium Beauty News - The French market was one of your priorities last year. Tilo Plöger - In France, cosmetics and personal care products rank among the best selling product markets. Since years, our sales have remained on an impressively positive trend, with two-digit growth rates, and the full potential isn't tapped yet. Looking at 2011 and 2012 there is room for more. For example in the market of pet nutrition. Furthermore, in autumn LR will launch its own jewelry collection in France. Premium Beauty News - LR Health & Beauty Systems operates in 32 countries worldwide. What about your international development? Dr. Jens Abend - Besides Germany, Greece, the Czech Republic, France and Italy, for example, are countries with a strong market development. In June 2011 we will start distribution operations of our ""Aloe Vera"" brand, and our fragrances and cosmetics in Russia, a very promising market. Then we will also launch dietary supplements in this country. Premium Beauty News - How does LR address sustainability issues? Tilo Plöger - For LR sustainability is a very important theme. For example let's talk about aloe vera. Landowners have to guarantee that they haven't used any kinds of chemicals on their aloe vera cultivation area for at least three years. That's the reason why most of the aloe vera growers let themselves certify by institutes like QAI (Quality Assurance International). At an international level the Aloe Science Council (IASC) awards its seal of approval if strong criteria for cultivation, harvesting, processing, regular checks and high quality are fulfilled. In Germany, SGS Institut Fresenius tests our aloe vera drinking gels, controls batches and compliance to hygiene regulations. Annually, LR is extensively tested and checked in several terms of quality aspects by IASC and the SGS Institut Fresenius. Premium Beauty News - What are your next expectations for LR? Dr. Jens Abend - In 2011 we expect further growth. Several distributional and sales highlights will play a part in contributing to the increase, like the market entry in Russia, the planned launch of pet food supplements and the launch of jewelry. With these new business activities, we open up new consumer target groups and sales channels - milestones for a sustainable distribution success."
"Topline and Cosworld-Primapack, to reach an agreement","This is a coherent operation for Topline who already weighs some USD100 million in sales, employs 2,000 people, runs five factories in China and who has spared no efforts during the last two years to also enter the American and European markets. ""A presence all the more logical, as had explained Charles Chang to Premium Beauty News, last year, since Topline's customers are located in every corner of the word and that Europe remains the largest Beauty market in the world. The opening of European customers to full-service made in China reinforced our decision to take that step. In addition, we have a unique expertise in the cosmetic sector as it covers both filling and packaging operations."" As of the 80s the firm was among the first to work with Asian partners for cosmetic packaging. In the mid-1990s, it is also one of the pioneers to have introduced Made in China full-service in the USA. Then in a few years time, Topline developed an efficient industrial tool. By 1995, the firm opened its first factory in Shanghai, now specialized in metal processing and who manufactures, among others products, the very popular eyelash curlers marketed worldwide by Maybeline, Cover and Max Factor, not to mention make-up cases... Three years later, in 1998, the group integrated the manufacture of cosmetic products, which now makes it possible to produce a whole range of make-up products. In 2000, a new production unit was set up, this time dedicated to plastic injection, which now currently hosts no fewer than 150 presses, not to mention all the finishing equipment to manufacture indifferently, compacts, closures, jars, lipstick tubes lipgloss etc. In 2002 a third unit was created, this time dedicated to brushes, applicators and powder puffs. Finally in July 2010, the company announced the construction of a plant in Mexico and the acquisition of a plastic injection factory, Motor City Plastics in Dundee, Michigan, whose main strong point is bi-injection, and even tri-injection. To note that Topline Products has been recognized four years in a row (2006-2009) one of New Jersey's 50 most performing companies. As for Primapack, Cosfibel's entity, it has performed remarkably well in 2010 with a turnover exceeding 21 million euros. With a trading activity that almost doubled in four years. An increase which is due both to a greater penetration among traditional customers and to gaining new customers under the company's core target which is make-up, but also and above all, thanks to the conquest of new markets in the areas of personal care and other sectors such as spirits (especially Brandy). To note that Primapack relies on three offices in China, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong to ensure, sourcing, operations, the development and monitoring of supplies and quality control. Main fields of expertise, metal and plastic injection, multi-materials, decorations and various surface treatments, stamping, galvanizing and electroplating. Concerning the latest novelties to date in the beauty sector,the complete make-up line for Burberry, the skincare line for Kenzoki, of Kenzo Parfums, Guerlain's mini lipstick, and a lipstick By Terry."
Full service: The irresistible rise of bomo-trendline,"""It's truly the full-service activity that has, in recent years, taken over the company's business, particularly during the last two years"", explained Adolf B. Brodscholl, Managing Director. ""To such a point that near Brno we had to build a dedicated plant in the Czech Republic, that employs about 150 people. An integrated plant that can perform plastic injection and assembly."" As for the range of filled or non-filled products, it is broad, and ranges from eye/lipliners, nail-care pens, mascaras, including lip gloss without forgetting one of bomo-trendline's flagship production: Spacy Art & French Free Ink System Nail Care Products. ""But we also offer a comprehensive range of standard packaging for skin-care,"" emphasised Brodscholl. Industrially speaking, the group currently owns some 96 injection machines (injection and blow injection) located for most of them in Germany at Schramberg Tennenbronn and eleven in the Czech Republic since last year. bomo-trendline manufactures its own tooling and has different filling & assembly machines. Its customer base is still very much German, to 75%, but it also includes Spanish, French, Italian, British and USA clients. But it is also in the field of product innovation that bomo-trendline has done particularly well in recent years with the development as of 2009, of a series of filled capillary Pens intended for nail care products such as the Soft Cuticle, the Perfect Corrector, the Iron Hardener and the Cuticle Remover Gel the latter taking the form of a tube. ""It was a big hit"", admits Brodscholl. ""So much so that we currently produce some millions of them."" This mastery in the manufacture of special applications has naturally encouraged engineers to develop their first, recently rolled out, perfume applicator, the Perfume Pen for man and woman. ""In fact, our business is divided into five core activities,"" explains Brodscholl. ""Standard packaging for the skin care market, standard packaging for the make-up industry, a full-service activity, especially in the nail care professional segment but also for special make-up products for eyes, lips – face. The segment of comprehensive Full Service products and our ability to develop our own packaging and product design and concepts to serve our customers."" But undoubtedly the full-service activity remains and will remain the German group's powerhouse for the next coming years."
"CEW: ""Beauty is not trivial""","CEW France is an association of women with responsibilities in businesses related to beauty. They fund a total of 24 Centres de Beauté - 18 in the hospitals of Paris and its region, and in 6 hospitals elsewhere in the country (Marseilles, Perpignan, Montpellier, Toulon, Grasse and Annecy) - where operate beauticians, trained and supervised by members of the association. By providing support to people with illnesses, the women of the CEW France demonstrate that: ""beauty is not trivial but helps to live better"". On Friday, June 24, 2011, on the occasion of MakeUp in Paris, two events are offered in support to the actions of the CEW France: – at 8:30 a.m. a breakfast debate moderated by the journalist Martine Marcowith, during which a plastic surgeon, Dr Jean-Claude Hagège, a rainbowlogist, Philippe Fagot, and a professional make-up artist, Max Herlant, will cross their opinions on the topic: ""the standards of beauty, continuity and changes in aesthetic criteria"". [1] – at 11:15 a.m. a charity auction to the benefit of the Centres de Beauté CEW of 24 artworks created by students in fine arts with make-up material offered by Faber-Castell Cosmetics, Strand Cosmetics Europe, Farevacolor, ABC Texture and with brushes from DuPont Filaments.

The auctioning will be conducted by Maître Blandine Camper, Auctioneer In addition, the CEW France will celebrate its 25th anniversary at the Fête des Loges in Saint Germain en Laye, reserved for this purpose on the 1st of July 2011 from 18:30 until 1:30 in the morning, the eve of its official opening. A relaxed garden party ""in order to change from the atmosphere of gala dinners and other luxury diners beloved by our profession,"" said the association."
Faber-Castell: A colourful anniversary!,"Premium Beauty News - This is a historic year for the entire Faber-Castell group. An anniversary occurring at a time when the performances seem to be outstanding? Stefano Castelletti - In the traditionally low first 5 months of the current business year 2010/11, all regions succeeded in recording double-digit sales growth. Europe/North America improved due in particular to the good start in Germany, Italy and the USA by +15% (currency adjusted by +14%), and Latin America and Asia/Pacific grew in each case by +37% (currency adjusted by +14%). In the field of competence Premium, it appears that in particular the crisis-related reluctance of consumers to buy luxury products is declining, resulting to date in significant growth of +24%. The ""Playing and Learning"" field of competence was able to record similarly positive trends. With an increase of +26% compared with the prior year period, the product range for children of three years and older once again proved to be an important pillar of the global marketing. The worldwide cosmetics business also developed encouragingly with growth of +26%. The company continues to see great growth potential especially in Asia, and will also concentrate in future on the development of the ""Playing and Learning"" and ""Premium"" (high quality writing implements and accessories for demanding consumers) fields of competence. Our board chairman, Count A.W. Faber-Castell forecasts that we will achieve sales of EUR 500 million in the current business year, naturally accompanied by a further improvement in our profitability. He also likes to repeat a maxim that will continue to apply for the successful accomplishment of the next decade: ""We want to do ordinary things extraordinarily well."" Premium Beauty News - What does the ""cosmetic"" activity currently account for in the Group's activities? Stefano Castelletti - The Faber-Castell company was founded in 1761 and from the mid-19th century developed into the world's premier manufacturer of wood-cased pencils, both graphite and colour. In 1978 the company extended its range and transferred its know-how from the field of wood-cased pencils to a new line of business: colour cosmetics. Today Faber-Castell Cosmetics is one of the leading private-label cosmetic manufacturers for the international beauty industry. Still family-owned in the 8th generation, this year marks the 250th anniversary of Faber-Castell. By now, the production of cosmetic products has earned a dominating share within the manufacturing facilities in the Faber-Castell group. The objective is to become the second pillar for the Faber-Castell group world-wide, contributing a representative share to the consolidated benefit and becoming the premier global supplier of cosmetic pencils, liquid systems and nail care applications. Premium Beauty News - You will be celebrating history and therefore past years... As for the future, what is your insight? Especially concerning the cosmetic segment. Stefano Castelletti - The cosmetic market offers a good growth potential for new and existing products as well as markets. We will continuously adapt our strategies and organisation to make best use of the growth opportunities. Premium Beauty News - The cosmetic pencil is constantly evolving, with many. innovations. At the same time, it is increasingly challenged by other kind of applicators. What makes you confident in the development of Faber-Castell Cosmetics in the course of the next ten years? Stefano Castelletti - With Faber-Castell's background, assets and specialisations we are confident to continue developing and offering technologies, services and products. Like a lipstick, the pencil itself established as classic standard product for every make-up range. Even though, this does not mean that it cannot be enhanced in every aspect from development, production and decoration technology – what we constantly do. And when we look at future make-up trends and new techniques we see many benefits in pencil type application."
"Dieter Bakic Enterprises, always unique!","The German company is successful, in spite of a competitive environment that has not weakened, far from it, and which can take many forms, in terms of competitors, in some of the packaging segment, such as large international packaging companies, dealers, design firms and new players in the ""global full service"" including filling operations. The latest advertising spot, on the French TV, of a famous brand of German cars gives quite a good picture of the image one could have of Germany... ""What a fine style, what a fine design,"" exclaimed Karl Lagerfeld adding ""indeed this car looks quite French!"" The embarrassment in the studio was perceptible until when a technician came whispering at the ear of the fashion designer that the car... was German! An anecdote that could just as well illustrate the road gone through by the teams of Dieter Bakic Enterprises in the beauty segment. Because the Munich based firm held tight to all the values for which the company is known for today in this sector, not only in terms of design, innovation and creativity, but also in terms of efficiency in a sector long regarded as ""very French"". ""The analysis of a market, of a company, of its products, of the selected distribution channel... a number of elements that contribute to lead our client toward the appropriate solution in terms of packaging,"" Dominic Bakic explained. ""But There is more to it! We always try to have a global appreciation of the subject and we want to work in the field of the development of a complete range. In addition, we fully participate in the chances our client takes."" Today, Dieter Bakic Enterprises, employs 80 people in five countries, who are working for 95% of them in the cosmetic sector. A company that owns more than 500 moulds and creates, year in and year out, fifteen new products. Truly a company of its own that has no equivalent elsewhere. ""It's true,"" said Dominic Bakic, ""that there are some companies that we consider our competitors, however, they actually only offer part of our services. Hardly anybody to my knowledge, can boast having such a broad offer ranging from market analysis and brand positioning, to the manufacture of packaging, including the innovation, and the design phase ending with the creation of a coherent range also producing high values."" For the teams of Dieter Bakic Enterprises, a retail shelf space in stores look most often confused and with a lack of 'landmarks'. ""Even if we are stating the obvious"" Dominic Bakic insists ""obviously we need to stand out and still be consistent across all brand elements! Which is not that simple ... What matters is of course to be visible, innovative and consistent!"" And the latest examples of putting into compliance a product line are numerous. ""I can cite, for example, Dr. Baumann, a German company where it was not just about repacking an existing line, but consulting and realising a brand repositioning to a more selective brand, spanning all communication elements."" As for environment in the literal sense, which is one of the market's oh-so-legitimate concern, teams at Dieter Bakic Enterprises have integrated it perfectly. ""We are about to introduce a new concept with that in mind!"" To be followed..."
Full service in cosmetics : Langguth's sound choices,"And, besides which, ""you can't beat the view on the countryside!"" Since actually, Langguth moved two years ago in the small industrial area of Steinach in the Bavarian countryside halfway between Nuremberg and Munich. A fine, brand new and very modern unit hosting both administrative and production premises which are fully overlooking the countryside thanks to tens of meters of huge window bays. Inside, some sixty people work in different workshops dedicated to the production and filling of nail polish for the first one (40% of the activity), to the manufacture and packaging of lipstick for the second one (the second biggest activity), to the filling of mascara, lip gloss and also of loose and pressed powders for the last one. ""In fact we are capable of taking care of everything,"" explains Martin Mader, the CEO. ""We can provide a complete service from formulation to filling including packaging development, packaging procurement and the production of bulk."" The company can rely on fifteen production lines including three for nail polish, two for lipstick and five for mascara and lip gloss. Latest investment to date, a fully automated machine for the filling of nail polish. ""What our customers appreciate,"" Martin Mader emphasises, ""is our flexibility and our ability to process orders beginning at 2,000 and up to more than 100,000 pieces (with one team)."" Mainly focusing on the German domestic market, the company also operates on the Russian market but to date... not directly on the French market!! To be continued."
Florida: A new plant for Oxygen at the end of the year!,"Cost of the investment, over USD 25 million. A decision that will enable this company founded only ten years ago to dramatically step up its production capacity at once. ""Quite clearly with this new infrastructure,"" explains Philippe Cohen, the owner of the company, ""and given the number of new machines dedicated to production, filling and packaging, that we will be installing, our goal is at least to quadruple our capacity over the next coming years."" Main reason for the exponential progression of Oxygen in ten years? ""It's quite logical,"" Philippe Cohen emphasises, ""we proved that we were able to supply the biggest U.S. cosmetics brands not only in due time but also in terms of quality products. And even though we decided two years ago, to build a production unit in the Dominican Republic, we continued to invest in the US territory which was experiencing a depletion of its production tool. Everyone knows that nature hates emptiness. We were there to fill-in the gaps."" By visiting the two current production centres whose areas put together do not exceed 10,000 sqm, one's opinion is quickly made. The current premises are obviously not large enough to host some 400 people that operate machines for the production of bulk and the ones for the manufacturing of powders, lipsticks and lipglosses. And the new 21,000 sqm plant that will see the moving-in, at the start of the Christmas holidays, of both, the whole current production tool and the administrative offices, will be a real breath of fresh air...for Oxygen. ""Make-up still accounts for more than 80% of our business,"" points out Cohen, ""but skin care and hair care activities are also on the rise."" Oxygen's main asset is its research and creation potential combined with a true will for excellence. ""We are very much attached to this,"" we were told at the headquarters. ""This is clearly what makes the difference compared to some of our colleagues who only have a filling activity... So much so that sometimes we refuse a order if we don't feel we control the whole subject or if we have the feeling it was insufficiently studied."" Second asset of the company, its production potential and its wide scope of technical expertise. In the course of the last two years, investments in production equipment have never stopped at Deerfield Beach. Latest to date, the commissioning of two automatic production machines for lipsticks on silicone moulds. As for the R&D laboratory, it comprises more than 28 persons. ""There aren't that many companies around that are capable of providing such levels of traceability and of microbiology tests,"" insists Cohen. ""Our plants are also approved by major U.S. and European companies."" The management explains that ""the main asset lies in the fact that we are able to produce, thanks to the flexibility of our production tool, bulk ranging from quantities of 5 kilos to 500 kilos. The decision taken to produce in the Dominican Republic was a form of response to Asian competitors. We were maybe a bit more expensive but the cost difference is decreasing every month!"" Approximately one third of Oxyen's production is currently exported. ""Indirect export but also direct export,"" we were told at Pompano Beach. And this is probably only the beginning of it... Because the production capacity of the new plant can only but offer the management new challenges and new horizons. To be continued..."
Geka's dynamics,"At the factory and headquarters of Bechhofen, an hour from Nuremberg (Germany), Geka's teams are in full swing. In two months to the day, the new unit dedicated to full service will be about to start in a brand new building of 650 sqm. An operation achieved in the context of a strong progression of sales, which totalled more than 100 million euros in 2010, compared to 93 millions in 2009. The euphoria seems to be the same across the Atlantic in Elgin where, only two years after the putting into service of the group's U.S. plant, the production exceeded 70 million units last year, entirely dedicated to the local American market. As a result, managers are still picking up the pace and have just decided on a 10 million euros investment plan for the twelve months to come. Main objective, increase the production capacity in mascaras in both Germany and the United States, but also reinforce the company's choice of full service integration and also extend, next year, the company's activities in lacquering and metallization, first in Germany and then in the United States. ""On top of that, we intend at the same time, to put more efforts into consultancy services. Our aim is to deliver a value-adding service to our customers by offering them all tests (application, stability, compatibility, etc.), and the documentation and evaluations needed during the development process of a product. On the other hand Geka has a profound experience when it comes to the delivery system and applicator of a product. The important step is to bring everything together: packaging + applicator + formulation. This will enable us to provide perfectly matched products that fulfill our customers' request,"" explains Franco Luca, Geka's CEO. The service approach is also high on the R&D department of the German firm who recovered at the same time the mascara patents from the Beiersdorf group upon an agreement that was reached in just a few weeks. ""It's obviously very important,"" points out Franco Luca, ""because as a matter of fact, we are currently the company that owns the most patents in the world in the field of mascara manufacturing technologies. However, in addition to specific developments, we are also in the process of re-launching Geka's range of standard products with the objective that it quickly accounts for a good third of our offer."" Demand for customised standards is there! The creation of the limited edition by the designer Harald Glööckler, which includes lip gloss, mascara, eyeliner, lipstick and even a nail polish, is a proof of this. ""The fully finished collection was extremely well received on the market and shortly after launching sold out. Our capabilities in terms of decoration enable us of course to give free rein to our imagination."" As for the traditional fibre-made brush segment... ""Expect a few surprises in the coming months with the introduction of a new generation of brushes thanks to a new technology,"" Franco Luca revealed, ""because, again, we haven't had our final say, especially since this market will eventually account for at least 40% of our business."" Finally, the satisfaction is also high for the full service diversification operated by the company. ""Our customers are responding very positively. And even before installing the necessary equipment, we have already started the filling operations for our first customer."""
Aircos introduces its new 2012 Spring/Summer line,"Premium Beauty News - These three ranges are based on themes like air, earth, fire, light... Éric Merville - Absolutely! 'Natural Odyssey' (air and earth), natural, warm and earthy, illustrates a commitment towards simplicity and goes straight to the gist of things. As for airy organic and eco-certifiable textures for eye-shadows and free blushes and the light gloss cream, they must accompany us on our journey to a poetic world. 'Techni-Color' (fire and light) belongs to the world of light and vibrant colours. Two new ranges of glosses (bottles and jars), filled blushes with a cream-to-powder finish, and a 'Terre de soleil' (compact powder) with an SPF 15 will enhance your summer make-up! 'Aqua-Morphose' (water and metal) is inspired by the underwater world. This range unveils on chromatic waves and vibrations, with totally surprising and shifting eyeshadows and gloss textures with stunning special effects. For the eyes, 'Powder & Cream', an exclusive Aircos texture, an ultra-soft and silky compact powder, enriched with moisturizing pearl powders, comes, on the one hand in six marine eyeshadows, with a wave-like effect, or in duet formats. And six more rounded and innovative polychrome eyeshadows, 'Aqua-Morphose', imparted with a touch of elegant glitter, were formulated using more than 50% of ""magic"" nacres: 3 or 4 shades clearly stand out on the eyelid, depending of the light orientation (from a shallow angle or from above) and also depending of the natural roundness of the eyelids. Impossible to visualize on a set picture, only eyelids can speak for themselves! In addition, we have already finalized our next 2012/13 fall-winter collection, for a world first presentation, at the MakeUp In Paris trade show on 23 and 24 June (at the Carrousel du Louvre). Premium Beauty News - You have also strengthen your R&D structure as well as your Full Service activity? Éric Merville - Yes, we have strengthened our R&D department, which will be headed by Nicolas Lieurey, who will control, among others, innovation in the domain of powders, filled products and technical processes using two laboratories (formulation and industrial implementation) with a staff that has actually doubled in two years time. Throughout its make-up collections (2 per year), Aircos already formulates its powder compacted eyeshadows with 50 to 60% of nacres and non-tacky shiny glosses. A technical innovation is being finalized for a premiere presentation in a few weeks. Don't forget that, thanks to our two formulation laboratories and our two specialized sites, we are able to offer comprehensive and specific make-up solutions... From the creation of packs and formulas including the development and production stages, our teams are capable of managing a entire make-up line. This solution, which over-simplifies the whole supply chain, reduces the development time, is surely a cost effective solution with the elimination of all intermediary costs to offer an original and innovative 'made in France' product. By providing complete products with a reduced carbon footprint (the two plants being located within 50km from one another), we are developing our business following a resolutely eco-friendly approach. Premium Beauty News - One of your slogans emphasizes on the fact you are a business partner with a strong industrial bias! Can you tell us more? Éric Merville - Let me give you an overview of what we can offer. In our factory of Romorantin dedicated to make-up, we manufacture and package all kinds of bulks for colour cosmetics (except nail polish). This site which has been granted the following certifications ISO 9001 (2008), cGMP, GMP and OTC (ECOCERT under approval), offers significant production capacities: – 150 tonnes of powder/year. – 60 million of compacted cups/year. – Filling (lipstick): 15 million units/year. – Hot filling (gloss & mascara): 10 million units/year. – Packaging in total: approx 75 million units/year. The industrialization team adapts man-operated flexible lines, but more particularly designs and develops dedicated multi-function, in-house automated lines. Currently, five fully automated lines are running to process simple cups, multi-product cups, with or without accessories, along the various packaging stages, however complex they may be: code marking, batch numbers, labelling, bonding, shrink wrapping (sleeving), cellophane wrapping, filming, etc. For filled products, we also have several equipments: – 1 cosmatic machine with flexible moulds (multi-size grapes with or without engraving). – 1 Weckerle machine (retail format lipstick with a 12 mm mechanism). – 3 filling rotary lines (cups, small size lipsticks with no mechanism or with a 9 mm mechanism, picking). – 1 filling line (gloss & mascara). Finally, we are equipped with a GMP compliant OTC area that can fulfil all customer requirements: from production to final packaging. This new facility dedicated to make-up products with SPF claims will enable customers to develop, with Aircos, their products to serve U.S., Canadian, Australian or Chinese markets..."
Sun Creative Cosmetics: The goal is achieved!,"If you remember: a year ago, almost to the day, the German company headquartered in Nuremberg, Schmidt & Niedermeier, specialized in the production of lipstick tubes, which was in receivership, had finally found a entity to take over its activities. The new owner was the Rusi Cosmetic GmbH group based in Bechhofen. Main objective in 2010 for the buyer, to reach EUR 3 million in sales with a workforce reduced to 30 people. Which was actually achieved! And prospects for 2011 promise to be even brighter, especially in terms of profitability. A company which has come a long way, it is the least one can say! ""Yes it's true,"" admits Omar Rizk, the Commercial Director of Rusi Cosmetics, ""it was far from being a sure bet! But Mr. Klaus Sindel, Rusi's CEO, and his team held tight!"" First step, inject cash, 600,000 euros in total, to invest in both the renovation of half of the standard moulds owned by the firm (and decide to abandon the other half switching from 150 to 75 moulds!), but also in the installation of four new electric injection machines including the revamping of the lacquering and decoration facilities, and finally, in the detailed analysis, at a technical and commercial level, of the strengths and weaknesses in the company's range of lipstick tubes. ""Which will quickly become the springboard, explains Omar Rizk, from which we could resume soundly the business activity."" Quite a long, painstaking job that took several months but which eventually paid off! ""What is also important to note, is that large customers renewed their confidence by placing orders. And we even won some very important projects. It is true that our ability to deliver quantities ranging from 50,000 to 500,000 pieces is appealing, the whole of it as part of a total annual capacity that exceeds ten million units!"" insists Elke Kaiser, the new commercial director of Sun Creative Cosmetics whose appointment has been effective since January 1st, 2011. Another of Sun Creative Cosmetics assets, is its combined mastery of metal and plastic parts. ""We are not that many in Europe, explains Omar Rizk, to be able to offer this dual expertise in the domain of lipstick tubes. And the '100% made in Asia' is a concept that is ageing fast... Good for us!"" Especially since the company also offers some innovative products such as this lipstick tube made of completely biodegradable material... Germany remains the largest customer of Sun Creative Cosmetics but France is not far behind. And the company's ambitions are huge. Since the 1st of January 2011, the firm has hired a new agent in the person of Patricia Vahé Goddard, from the PH Beauté Company."
Ancorotti Cosmetics: A world leader in mascara in two years time!,"It is now official! Ancorotti Cosmetics has just acquired a new 1,000 sqm building just in front of its current production unit located in Crema, an hour away from Milan. The aim of the operation being to relocate the storage of products and to dispose of a new production area in the prospect of extending the scope of production in other areas of colour cosmetics than that of mascara... For the time being the young Italian company has to cope with its development on its favourite segment, mascara, and now, foundation. With 900,000 euros in turnover in 2009 and,... 11 million expected this year(!), the progression of the company is, to say the least, continuing at a rapid pace. ""It was the right move"" emphasises Renato Ancorotti. ""The latest figures on the current demand for mascara worldwide speak for themselves. According to the latest Italian official statistics, the global market is estimated at two billion euros with nearly 800 million for Europe. It alone accounts for more than 50% of cosmetic eye products and for more than 14% of the make-up segment overall. From the production side, of course, a significant part is what we call 'captive', that is to say, produced in house by a number of brands but the remaining part, i.e. the one that is left accessible for companies like ours, can be estimated between 260 and 345 million euros."" As for the foundation segment, its prospects are equally interesting. It could represent globally, still relying on the latest Italian statistics, some 2.3 billion euros. ""The development prospects are therefore quite real,"" emphasises Renato Ancorotti. ""Not to mention the fact that it's our second flagship product!"" Today the Italian firm is able to produce some 3 tons/day of material (foundation + make-up + some lip gloss) at a filling capacity of over 100,000 pieces with one single team. ""But the production capacity is not enough,"" he insists. ""We must of course be able to offer quality and innovative formulas, the whole of it with the required flexibility to meet small orders as much as larger ones."" In a word, ""not seeking to become the largest company but the best!"""
De Bruyère signs make-up license agreement for Lulu Castagnette,"For De Bruyère, a start-up created in 2009 for the development and marketing of licensed cosmetic lines, good news seem to come one after another. After the success of the first Lollipops Make Up collection and the welcome around the Summer 2011 collection, it is the signing of a licensing agreement to develop a cosmetic line under the Lulu Castagnette brand name that rejoices today both Charlotte Catton (a former executive of Parfums Guerlain and of SGD) and Marie Puech, managers of the company. Since its inception, De Bruyère has assigned itself with the mission to transcribe in the cosmetics universe the DNA of brands seeking to diversify their activities into complementary areas to that of their original market. ""Many brands are looking for partners to help them develop their businesses in other distribution channels, but they don't want to lose their soul and are very attentive to quality"", Charlotte Catton explained. Thus, De Bruyère has developed and marketed two lines of private label make-up products for distributors, and launched last year, the Lollipops Make Up line, now on the shelves of more than 150 outlets in France (Lollipops outlets, Douglas, Beauty Success and Trupheme networks), in Italy (Marionnaud), in Portugal (Douglas), in Morocco and shortly in Spain, Russia and Australia. ""Our added value for small projects stands in our ability to manage the entire process, from development to commercial distribution, including production, regulations, POS advertising, marketing consulting, ..."" De Bruyère selects and coordinates the work of the different players involved with the aim to promote European quality. ""For instance, the Lollipops Make Up line is entirely made in France or in Italy"", emphasised Catton. Among privileged partners of the firm, HCP, Chromavis and Fareva for product and packaging development and La Vache Noire for the design. ""I must admit I was pleasantly surprised by the commitment of all the suppliers involved in the development of the first Lollipops Make Up collection, when it only concerned at the time very small volumes."" A situation very favourable to emerging brands which, according to Charlotte Catton, is quite specific to the make-up segment. ""In order to stimulate their brands, even market leaders resort to ephemeral collections resulting in one-shots for suppliers, who have managed to adapt to such production requirements. I also believe that, to counter competition from Asian suppliers, the strong point of European companies lies in their responsiveness,"" she added. In the immediate future, a third collection is underway for Lollipops Make Up. For this brand alone, De Bruyère expects a turnover of 500,000 euros in 2011. As for the Lulu Castagnette line, it will be launched in 2012 with in focus, an initial turnover of 200,000 euros. The business plan was set up with a forecast growth of 400,000 euros in 2013 and 1 million in 2014. Next objective for Charlotte Catton, ""a partnership with a designer's brand for the development of a prestige line, complementary to our other brands."""

Premium Beauty News - A word on your ""Proof of Quality Seals"" Brian J. Fox-Krawczyk - The beauty business has changed radically in the last 10 years and Genealogy is consistently working to progress to meet these needs. We also believe it is worthless to fight against the beauty trendsetters and the public opinion using business practices and ingredients that don't meet their ""cultural"" demands. Thus we created our Proof of Quality Seals to mark our commitment regarding our formulations, our clients' products and the concerns of their consumers. It is all about being creative and saying yes to a challenge, instead of no. The key principles are the following: – Purity: We believe in using ingredients that are safe and effective for people and the environment. – Sustainability: We believe in respecting the gifts from Mother Nature in our formulas and in packaging. – Proof in principle: We believe in clinically proving our marketing claims. – ""Aesthetically field tested"": We believe the best way to test a product is with the most knowledgeable consumer. – USA made: We believe in investing in the future of our country. – PETA approved: We believe no living creature should be harmed for the sake of beauty. – Ecocert: We believe that organic can be elegant. Premium Beauty News - How else do you support your clients? Brian J. Fox-Krawczyk - Actually in a number of different ways: raw material sourcing, library for formula creation, exclusive turnkey packaging concepts. But also market studies et trend forecasts, socio-demographic reports and technical analyses. Premium Beauty News - And industrially speaking, how and with whom do you work? Brian J. Fox-Krawczyk - Within our business model, Genealogy can hand pick the appropriate bulk manufacturing and P.O. filling house for each client project. We all know that each contract filler has its own core competencies in manufacturing. We formulate all of our client's products at our own laboratory, thus owning the formulas, insuring quality raw materials are used in them and keeping our clients out of lengthy R & D queues at conventional fillers. This process also insures formula exclusivities for designated periods of time for our clients. They then travel to the contract filler that we have selected, to scale up the production and to insure the compliance to all our quality requirements. Our strategic bulk manufacturing and filling partners are Nuworld Beauty, Bradford Soap Works Inc. et Innoteq Inc."
Estelle & Thild: the Scandinavian brand that goes international,"The history of Estelle & Thild began when Pernilla Rönnberg started to look for organic skincare products suitable for her two young daughters, Estelle and Mathilde. The difficulty to find what she expected led her to create her own line. The company was founded in 2007 and the overwhelming demand forEstelle & Thild's original children's products quickly led to the launch of a complete skin and body care line for adults. ""We have 33 SKUs, and will launch 3 more in August. We continuously work on product development,"" explains Pernilla. Ecocert certifies both Estelle & Thild products and manufacturing process, but being certified is just a basic requirement for a natural cosmetics line, it does not really help to stand out from the mass. ""For Estelle & Thild as for many other upcoming eco beauty brands, the main challenge is to build brand awareness,"" says Pernilla. To reach her goal, Pernilla Rönnberg mainly relies on a strong brand concept, and then on partnerships with distributors. ""We have had a great success in terms of getting the best distribution channels and shelf space. We work closely with our retailers and do joint marketing."" Pernilla Rönnberg is convinced that consumers of organic and natural cosmetics have new expectations. ""I believe that for the most part natural skin care has moved beyond the promise of purity and safety. Instead products must offer something more than these basic benefits. I believe that the new dynamics need to look closely at promises and performance and innovation backed up with originality, design and exploration. I am convinced that a part of our success is that we have combined the organic content with a fresh design and concept."" Actually, the natural and organic cosmetic customers have transformed very fast and now demand much more than mere natural or organic formulas. ""They want fresh modern alternatives that combine performance, originality and design together with a genuine organic approach."" The Estelle & Thild product range consists of three lines: baby & child, body care and skin care. Currently, the products are distributed in Scandinavia (Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark). In particular, they are available at Kicks - the leading Nordic cosmetic chain - and in selected children's and interior design stores. There are plans for further expansion in Europe and in Asia and the company got a lot of attention and contacts from its participation in Cosmoprof this year. ""Our focus markets are Germany, UK, Italy, France. However, we are very selective in our choice of distribution channels and only go with those which are most suitable for our brand,"" says Pernilla Rönnberg. The most coveted retailers in Europe would be interested in the brand, which should therefore be available in more countries soon."
Fiabila: heavy investments worldwide,"Premium Beauty News - It seems an exceptionally dynamic market implies massive industrial responses? Pierre Miasnik - It's a fact! The global nail polish market is particularly profitable. For our part we recorded very strong growth in 2010 and prospects look even brighter this year. The challenge, in Fiabila's case, obviously consists in coping with this increase in demand by ramping up the production capacity of our various sites but in a controlled manner and without compromising on the quality of our products. As this increased demand is global, actually all our sites are concerned. Primarily those located in the outskirts of Paris at Maintenon, Plaisir and soon in Le Perray-en-Yvelines. Premium Beauty News - Expansion plans in France are already underway. What do they include? Pierre Miasnik - Some are already achieved, others will be completed by the end of the year! To meet demand, we of course invested in some new equipment for mixing and tinting, the goal being to double the number of batches produced. In parallel, we also strengthened our laboratory, accelerated the training of our staff dedicated to production and increased the monitoring capabilities so that the quality level always remains faultless. Incidentally, our delivery times are back to normal, on average around four weeks while not so long ago they were closer to four months. But there is more to it. We are currently doubling the production of thixotropic bases, which will allow us to work with different formulas and better respond to requests for customization. Finally, the highly automated industrial processes that we have developed in the United States are about to be transferred to our unit in Maintenon, which will enable us to further improve the competitiveness of some of our products while securing even more the production process, particularly on a environmental, but also human level with less intervention. Finally, we have just filed a building permit for the piece of land we acquired next to the Maintenon site. It is clear that this plant is purely and simply, going to double in size over the next few months. Premium Beauty News - The demand for packaged products has also grown strongly! Pierre Miasnik - That's right! And, again, it was essential to meet the demand. We started by increasing the number of teams on the lines of our unit in Plaisir, while focusing specially on productivity with the arrival of a person coming from the automotive subcontracting and very much aware of automation processes. But mostly we decided to acquire a second production unit of 4,300m² in Le Perray-en-Yvelines who already had the advantage of having a ""Seveso"" classification and which will be operational June next. This will enable us to double our packaging capacity. Premium Beauty News - The United States form the second main target for your investments! Pierre Miasnik - Don't forget that we settled there eight years ago. Our factory is based in New Jersey and employs about fifty people. There too the demand was particularly strong. So we decided to acquire a plot of land to build a new 5,000 m² factory which will in the end allow us to triple the current capacity. I must add that we are also setting up a new grinding equipment for gels, the same as in Maintenon, to both optimize the quality and increase the production capacity. Premium Beauty News - Third line of investments, India! Pierre Miasnik - And not the least! Same pattern, too! We have been operating in this area for twelve years. The current unit needed to comply with international standards. Late June, a new 3,500 m² unit will be operational. The objective being to actually produced in India with the same standards as in Europe, taking into account, of course, the specific constraints pertaining to the region both in terms of climate and people. Premium Beauty News - The same catchword for all three of them: Quality! Pierre Miasnik - This is indisputable! We are asked higher and higher purity levels. We have implemented even more accurate monitoring tools. Our staff is continuously, trained on new materials and new techniques. We regularly select new materials and new suppliers. Technically speaking, we are relentlessly working to comply with the new European cosmetics regulation due to come into force in July 2013. We are very mindful about the purity of our raw materials and we are still working on the development of new polymers. We have just filed a patent on a brand new product that imparts the nail polish with a better water resistance. Not to mention the new ""gel"" formulas that polymerize under UVs but which are less allergenic than existing products. Premium Beauty News - You have become the masters of colour! Miasnik Peter - In a way, yes! Nail polish is colour! We roll out twice a year 72 trendy shades. We have computerized a portfolio of more than 160,000 of them!"
Asia: L'Oréal's long-term commitment,"Premium Beauty News - So, in retrospect, are you pleased with this very first attempt, last November in Hong Kong? Jacques Sebban - You surely mean ... delighted! Not only vis-à-vis our suppliers and partners but also because of the internal mobilization it generated throughout the group. And this at all levels, be it the Purchasing, Quality, Packaging or Logistics departments. This great ""Supplier Day"" allowed each of these stakeholders to play their part. This had a huge mobilizing effect on us. As for the suppliers who were present in Hong Kong, unanimously I think, they were, both pleasantly surprised by the desire for rapprochement and sharing that we showed throughout the meeting, but also very proactive in their exchanges with us. Besides, it was with them that we set up this event largely based on their wishes. Premium Beauty News - So you will renew the experience! Jacques Sebban - Yes, of course! This ""Supplier Day"" will take place every two years, with alternately, a sort of ""Suppliers Convention"" where topics will be discussed more in depth, why not in the form of round tables. Asia being quite a vast area, these conventions will certainly be held in the North and the South. The next ones should therefore take place in Shanghai and Singapore. Since this major first in Hong Kong last November, we have had a lot of feed-back from several of our departments but also from our suppliers. The Quality department, in particular, is always very much looking forward to such meetings. Not to mention the teams in charge of the Supply Chain and of Environmental issues. Premium Beauty News - In Hong Kong all your suppliers were not present! Jacques Sebban - That's right! We have more than 800 of them located in the Asian area, which as you remember, also includes India and Japan. And we had invited only 180 of them in Hong Kong. But it was a first. And we could obviously not host all of them. In fact, this is also an important point of our approach with them. We wanted the Hong Kong meeting to be an expression of that. Our business relationships should be strengthen and also closer to our mutual concerns. We want to work with confidence and insure that our relationship is in the long term. Convey clear and accurate messages. It is also with this in mind that I created a ""Supplier Relationship Management."" We want to provide our suppliers with more information. The message is clear: ""we say what we do and we do what we say!"" On our side, we have worked to have more experienced, better organized and increasingly professional teams. The cross-cutting nature of our experiences is also important to fully appreciate each sector with its specificities and to intensify our exchanges. At the same time, it is clear that we want to reduce our supplier base. Simply because it seems sounder to build a relationship that would include more consistent challenges and volumes with a stronger commitment coming from both sides. Premium Beauty News - A Win-win situation? Jacques Sebban - Yes, exactly! You know the winner of last year's Supplier Day in Hong Kong, the Beauty Star company, was invited to come to Europe, to the headquarters of L'Oréal group, to meet all the managers. I must add that I feel it is very important to be aware of all the challenges that lie ahead. As you know our group has an ambitious investment program set up for Asia in the coming years. We are doubling the production area in India, we are quadrupling the surface in Indonesia, we are studying a new industrial establishment in China etc. Not to mention increasing the performance of our industrial equipments. The message to our suppliers is simple. It's a question of getting better organized to perform better. For them too, the future looks bright through the volumes that we will be providing them."
"""I focus first on the product's formulation and I want a rational packaging,"" Dany Sanz, Make Up For Ever","Premium Beauty News - Economically, how did the year 2010 go for Make Up For Ever? Dany Sanz - 2010 went very well, it's no secret, everybody knows it. Our efforts have paid off. Our global results were also very good. The year 2011 is looking pretty good too, we have boosted some circuits, in particular the United States with the opening of a ""shop in the shop"" in Sephora outlets. We also plan to revamp our store in New York and to open more stores under our own name, in Los Angeles for example. Premium Beauty News - The main piece of information for Make Up For Ever today is the opening of its first general public store in the Marais, in the central area of Paris... Dany Sanz - And for Paris there are two main news. First, the renovation of our historic store on Rue La Boétie, which will be revamped this summer. The upper floor of the store will allow us to expand our sales area and our training rooms. Then there is the opening this exclusive Make Up For Ever store at 5 rue des Francs-Bourgeois. Premium Beauty News - It is a very ""make-up street"" where are located MAC or Bobbi Brown to name a few... Dany Sanz - It is indeed a neighbourhood of make-up artists. It's great to find ourselves among brands who are like us, that we respect and who have their own aficionados. It is also challenging to be among them. Premium Beauty News - This store, you said, that it would be intended for the ""General Public"". What difference do you make between a Pro store and General Public store? Dany Sanz - 5, Rue La Boétie will again become the genuine pro store it used to be at the outset. Everything happens at La Boétie, it is the cradle of Make Up For Ever with the store, my office, the laboratory, the training rooms... As you know, at the outset of Make Up For Ever, all our customers were in the trade. The general public wasn't even aware of the existence of the store! We were only working with professionals, whether make-up artists, of course, but also dancers, actors, artists... The general public has access to Make Up For Ever products in Sephora outlets, but customers also like to come to the store where they can find all the references. Rue des Francs-Bourgeois will be their dedicated spot, it will the store for our addicted customers. Premium Beauty News - Do you have plans to expand the network of exclusive stores (whether pro or general public) in France or abroad? Dany Sanz - Yes, in Saint-Tropez this summer. This store will be ephemeral since it will be open late spring and will welcome holiday makers from Saint-Tropez and its surroundings during summertime. Premium Beauty News - As regard products: the HD range has recently enriched itself with many new shades. Is it comprehensive now? Dany Sanz - No, it is not and never will be. This range is unlimited. Make-up artists working with HD cameras need specific products at all levels. In 2009, I started by proposing the HD foundation which seemed to me as being the most important product for make-up artists and also a highly specific one to design. The HD line rapidly expanded to include a number of new references: base, powder, we then worked on blushes and concealers. Currently, all our efforts are focused on developing new textures for the complexion. A new foundation is in the laboratory, it is a creamy product, with a richer texture, intended for dry skins. I am also currently working both on extending the shades of the HD loose powders and on our future HD compact powders. Next will come all the colour cosmetics for eyes and lips. Premium Beauty News - You recently launched the campaign ""HD unretouched,"" a campaign that makes Make Up For Ever the first cosmetic brand in the world to present unretouched visuals. Are you in favour of digital retouching? Does retouching enhance the work or the make-up artist? Dany Sanz - I think touch ups are essential in comparison to what consumers, media and brands expect from an image being part of an advertising and commercial approach. The image mustbe challenging and unretouched, it is impossible to achieve a strong enough visual to make it recognizable among a thousand other pictures. But ""No Retouch"" must be considered compared to HD cameras because it is more difficult to retouch a film than an image. We wanted to prove that it was no longer necessary to work on the image in any way, to touch up the make-up. Our ""No Retouch"" campaign began with the making of a film. A bailiff was present during all the film stages to testify on the absence of retouching. Premium Beauty News - Concerning the new Aqua Liner range, it is predominantly iridescent. Why did you initially chose iridescent finishes? Consequently have you also planned some matt versions? Dany Sanz - Within the Aqua Liner range, there are nonetheless three matte versions. To my dismay, consumer demand abroad goes for iridescent. They all want iridescent products! Amidst these pearlescent, I still propose essential shades in matte and iridescent. But be reassured concerning this Aqua range, I'm working on non-iridescent Aqua Cream products, they will be available in 2012. In 2012 we will also present our non-iridescent watercolour blushes. However, trend for the most part is to an iridescent finish and we are forced to meet demand. Premium Beauty News - In 2009, you were excited about the development of specific products for the stage. Is this project still under consideration? Dany Sanz - ""Of course!"" A year ago we launched the Up Light, which is my first work on light. The subject of light fascinates me more and more. I am currently working on new blushes and a new foundation that will be specifically light-reflecting. I am actually planning, late 2012 and early 2013, to exclusively focus on stage products. Premium Beauty News - You're very interested in packaging. Will you launch new products associated to specific packaging? Dany Sanz - I reckon innovations related to packaging are not too exciting, I find it difficult to point out at any real innovation. We are currently in an ecological trend not being quite sure of what to choose, should we go for plastic, paper, cardboard? Premium Beauty News - What do you think of the featureism in packaging such as vibrating, rotating or heating mascaras? Dany Sanz - I want things that work. I focus first on the product's formulation and I want a rational, resistant pack that will last in time by respect to the consumer. I would feel more attracted by new materials but, unfortunately, there aren't any for the time being. Right now, I am very interested in cardboard packs: I find some cardboards extremely resistant, just as much as plastic is! I find this cardboard beautiful and different, a noble and enjoyable material. I'm getting closely involved in the subject as we're on the point of redesigning completely the whole range of Make Up For Ever with some totally new packs. 1600 references, no less! Tools, put aside, still remain 1000 references to place in boxes! We are also going to rework the design of our brushes."
Cosnova Beauty towards new retail concepts and globalization,"Premium Beauty News - What was the outcome of the year 2010 for your business? Javier González - In 2009, Cosnova's growth rate reached 26%. It was an outstanding result in a year of a recession. Looking back at 2010, one's can only say it has been even more impressive. With net sales of 133.3 million euros in 2010, the previous year's annual results have been surpassed by 46%. We had great results with our two brands: Essence and Catrice. Our whole portfolio has grown in a fantastic way. Essence reached a 23.7% market share in volume in Germany in 2010. Nearly one out of four pieces in the German market altogether are from Essence by now. The historical market leader Maybelline Jade is at 15.8 %. However, in value Maybelline Jade remains the leading brand in Germany with a 23.1% market share while Essence ranked third with 9.7% (AC Nielsen), very close to the second brand, L'Oreal, with 10.0% value share. Premium Beauty News - What were your most successful launches in 2010? Petra Schönegger - Our colour category, which consists of many products, grew very strongly. Actually, each year we launch a total of new products reaching up to 50% of all our SKUs. One very successful product launch for Essence was the Studio Nails line, which is a kind of sub-category within the nail-art segment. It consists of stickers in different patterns and designs that can be easily stuck on the nails to get a professional studio quality just in a minute, at home and much cheaper. In 2010, one of our big projects was also the complete relaunch of the Catrice brand, with a high quality approach, new packaging and a selective range of products representing our high competency in the colour segment. Around 65% of the assortment was substituted and we expect to finish the whole relaunch within a few weeks. Premium Beauty News - And what about product innovations in 2011? Petra Schönegger - Essence is launching My Skin, a new skin care line dedicated to young skin needing moisture and intensive care. The My Skin line (9 SKUs in total) consists of cleansing and caring products, as well as special items such as moisturizing masks. The My Skin products will be on counters from the middle of March 2011. Another innovation, Better Than Gel Nails, will be launched in 2011. It's the second launch within our Studio Nails line. Using a special kind of nail polish Better Than Gel Nails gives a French manicure gel-look up to 10 days without the disadvantages of real gel nails from a studio for example. It's very easy and healthier for the nails because there's no need to even or treat the nail surface and to use a UV lamp, it can be applied at home and quickly removed with our remover. Other new decorative cosmetics are on the way: new mascaras, new gel eyeliners and new lip glosses. In the context of the Catrice relaunch we will also bring onto the market series of new blushers, powders, mascaras, etc. Premium Beauty News - Are there new investment plans and/or developments relating to processes? Javier González - We have invested - and will invest further on - several million euros on display stands (our model is called ""Beauty Shop"") designed for the point of sales. We have upgraded all the Essence display stands last year in Germany and other German-speaking countries and the results were so satisfactory that we are rolling out this new displays world-wide by the end of 2011. And in the course of the Catrice relaunch we will also launch a new ""Beauty Shop"" in Europe in 2011. Premium Beauty News - Last year Cosnova has established its first retail shop in Offenbach. What is the outcome of this test? Javier González - Besides the prominent presentation of our ""normal"" cosmetics assortment, this shop serves as a creative laboratory for Essence. It also offers fashion accessories (fashion jewellery, scarfs, sunglasses, etc.) as well as so-called fan-articles (paper blocks, cups, pens, etc.). The Offenbach shop has been a beautiful window and source of inspiration for our company. For example, it helped us to successfully launch Essence and Catrice at Douglas with excellent results. We are looking at a couple of further developments. One of our new ideas is to have an outlet at a high-traffic place in a big German city. Ye, in 2011 we will try some new ideas on the retailing front! Premium Beauty News - Cosnova has gone live with Ulta and H-E-B in the U.S., and with the South-African retailer Clicks. Javier González - We are extremely happy with both countries. Ulta was the perfect retailer to get started in the U.S. where there is a strict separation between mass and prestige retailers. Ulta is inventing something in-between, a bit along the line of Müller in Germany. We are continuing to grow our sales at Ulta and H-E-B, and Ulta will test to double our display space in 2011. We are launching at a third retailer, Fred Meyer, in May 2011. We have also tested last year at Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada, and we will be launching nationally in July. Shoppers Drug Mart is the largest and the dominating retailer in the Canadian market with roughly 1,000 outlets across the country. Clicks was also a great retailer to start with in South-Africa because of its dominant and prominent role in the market. We have launched in most of the points of sale last year and we are rolling out the last 100 outlets this year. We believe after that roll-out we are going to be the number two brand after Revlon in value market shares. For both markets (North America and South Africa), we have created several SKUs targeting black and Latino skin types. A real highlight for us was Italy. Early 2010 we launched at Oviesse, a clothing retailer also owning the department store chains Coin and UPIM. We launched in the three formats in 2010 with truly impressive results. Compared to 2009 we quintupled, our sales in Italy last year. It was eye-opening to see a distribution channel like clothing retailing, which was not a focus channel for us, offering such a tremendous potential. Premium Beauty News - What is the current status of Cosnova's expansion plans in the Middle East? Javier González - By now we launched in eight countries in the Middle East (4 in 2010). Looking at the political situation in the last couple of weeks, we do not expect any negative long-term implications; some countries might open up more to international trade, which could offer future opportunities. In the short term, there could be logistic disruptions, but we are monitoring the situation in close contact with our distributors, and for the time being everything is continuing as planned. We have just launched in Egypt and Yemen, two countries that have been affected by the current political changes, without any significant disruptions so far. Premium Beauty News - What are your expectations for 2011? Javier González - Once again, we expect a double-digit growth. We intend to remain a fast-growing company for the years to come and we see many opportunities waiting for us, geographically speaking but also from the brand point of view."
The Body Shop shares expectations with suppliers,"From costs efficiency to value creation through quality, time-to-market, innovations and eco friendly/natural products, there was hardly any taboos at The Body Shop's Suppliers Day, which was organised by the company's Operations Team last month in the UK. The event gathered 35 existing or potential suppliers involved in trade sourcing (finished goods, packaging and accessories) from Europe, Asia and North America. The objective was to strengthen relationships and to engage suppliers with the company's strategy as well as with its vision and values. Philippe Reale, Director of Operations, opened the day around the theme 'Lets build the future together' with many references on key factors from the past about end-to-end process (from raw/pack materials until products in hands' consumers). This event allowed The Body Shop teams to re-emphasis its individuality and uniqueness in business, and reinstates the strategic role of its suppliers around the brand's five pillars: Against Animal Testing, Support Community Fair Trade, Activate Self Esteem, Defend Human Rights and Protect Our Planet. Moreover, The Body Shop team shared challenges and expectations to ensure that brand's sourcing strategy will be the fuel for business growth and a competitive advantage with few best in class suppliers being established for strategic technologies/products. Jerome Courtaigne, Director of Sourcing, concluded the day on a positive tone ""The day was very successful with a lot of inputs coming from both sides, a strong engagement of our suppliers and very clear expectations about the ways to improve our business relationship."" With more than 2,500 stores in over 60 markets, The Body Shop is the leading natural and ethical beauty brand worldwide."
Farevacolor: 13 million euros of pure creation in three years time,"Premium Beauty News - Actually, Farevacolor is a very young business! Anne Challe - Yes, Absolutely! And these days, it's worth noting! The creation of Farevacolor only dates back to three years. In 2007, the Group Fareva took over a factory located in Savigny le Temple, formerly owned by Beiersdorf. The goal was to develop a subcontracting and full-service activity in make-up. The cosmetic market itself (skincare + make-up) represented 42%, out of the EUR 830 million achieved in turnover by the Fareva Group last year. The sub-contracting and full service activity in make-up accounted for EUR 13 million in sales. Premium Beauty News - 2008 and 2009 were obviously not the best years to start a business! Anne Challe - Yes, and we had to hold fast! But soon enough we had the confirmation that the creation of an entity like Farevacolor was suiting needs of both the French and European market, with a service offer ranging from simple outsourcing to real full service, not only industrially speaking but also in terms of R&D and creativity. Our offer is comprehensive with our catalogue of standard products in the segments of foundations, powders, lipsticks, lip glosses, mascaras, etc. Pencils being so far, the only segment where we are not operating. Because our ""innovation"" unit, is very active it enables us to offer each year several thematic collections with the assistance of our make-up artist, Isabelle Pain. Premium Beauty News - Many investments in people and equipments! Anne Challe - From the outset and all technologies included, the group provided itself with first rate equipments. Since then the pace has not slowed down and we invest as and when our clients' needs evolve to be at the best required level in all cosmetic segments (foundations, powders, lipsticks, lip glosses, mascaras). If the unit in Savigny le Temple is equipped with highly automated lines it also has dedicated workshops in small areas to produce small and medium size series. The teams of the Fareva Color entity includes about forty people working in five departments: Marketing, R&D Laboratory, Packaging procurement, Sales and Projects. All of them are specialists in their field, dynamic, motivated and competent! Regarding production, it is undertaken by the factory with some staff dedicated to cosmetics. Premium Beauty News - Innovation that requires original packaging solutions? Anne Challe - Yes of course, and this both through our partnerships with packaging professionals, but also through our synergies with the Fareva Group. You surely understand that I can't tell much more but it is clear that the group's expertise in the segment of aerosols is a card that will come into play appropriately. Let me remind you also that Farevacolor manages autonomously its packaging needs. The main objective being to develop the full service activity. But we are not just focusing on packaging. We are also constantly reinforcing our skills in the organic sector. Premium Beauty News - What is your objective in terms of turnover for the two years to come? Anne Challe - Between 25 and 30 million euros in 2012!"
Eye makeup is key to Arcancil's rebirth,"The challenge was worth taking up. When in 2008, Anne Delleur, 32 and a former Marketing manager at L'Oréal, joins the Institute Caméane and the young team who acquired the Arcancil Paris brand in 2006, she already knows that she has in her hands the destiny of a little-known jewel. Founded in 1935, Arcancil is one of the oldest French brands specialized in make-up. Over the years it had built itself a strong reputation, but a victim of the financial difficulties of the Laboratoires Valdor, its former owner, it disappeared from the shelves in 2005. When Arcancil is back in perfumery outlets in the late 2007 it has to start from scratch again. ""It's the relationship with distributors that suffered the most,"" explained Delleur. ""Even before the cessation of business of the the Laboratoires Valdor, successive stock-outs, a lack of timely supply had led to the delisting of the brand by its key customers in France."" In November 2007, the team of the Institute Caméane pulls off a coup with the launch of Kohl Kajal, a kohl in a stick presented in a matte black case and embellished with black satin ribbon. The product is immediately acclaimed epitomizing at the same time the brand's rebirth. With Kohl Kajal, Arcancil Paris managed to create a new make-up gesture in line with a strong eye trend, very popular in France and abroad, that of smoky eyes. ""Arcancil has always been a very much eye make-up-oriented brand, with a strong token of recognition in the segment. Therefore it's quite naturally with this product category, and particularly with the kohl that we proceeded to the relaunch of the brand."" Another one of Arcancil Paris strong point is the use of high intensity pigments. An obvious choice for the Cabaret range, that offers eight perfectly coordinated harmonies [1], with shades that do not fade, even on eyelashes and darker skin tones. ""That's probably why this range is also so popular among black and mestizo customers"", explained Delleur. ""We are launching new shades to suit all women whatever their skin complexion and also taking account of skin and climate specificities, in order to innovate with make-up formulas necessarily meeting specific needs. With its covering power, our foundation, Matitude, enables to perfectly unify the skin complexion even under extreme heat and humidity conditions."" The potential of these ranges of shades designed to meet the most diverse expectations is all the more important since Arcancil Paris has a high quality image at an affordable price. In parallel with these innovations, Arcancil has kept offering historic products that have helped built the brand's success: Compact Mascara, bottled eyeliner, as well as all the customers favourite shades. For Arcancil it is a winning return. ""Since the relaunch of the brand we have never reported any loss. For the three past years, our growth rate has always exceeded 30%. On the last half of the year we are still on a 35% trend."" This success, the brand also owes it to the loyalty of its customers and its awareness. The priority for Anne Delleur is now to consolidate the distribution network in France and abroad. Today, the Arcancil Paris products are distributed exclusively in France at the Galeries Lafayette and through the outlets that had backed up the brand's come back on the market. Among them, the Institut Inaya, the specialist in ethnic products from Saint-Denis. ""Our partnership with Galeries Lafayette is very satisfying and allows us to be present in 70 stores, and we also sell on the Internet. But our objective in the end, is to find a partnership that would allow us to be present in cities of less than 100,000 inhabitants. Our objective is to regain Arcancil's previous level of distribution which was of 500 to 1000 outlets."" An ambitious goal, but up to the expectations of the brand's potential that currently ranks fourth in Galeries Lafayette sales. An ambition also driven by a real presence on the ground and the ability to meet the expectations of distributors. ""Our success is also due to our ability to provide an optimized inventory management of the brand to the outlets. To control appropriately the supply chain also means guaranteeing faultless inventory management in each of the brand's point of sales and a perfect quality of service for customers."" The ambition is the same overseas, representing approximately 65% of sales. The brand is already present in twenty countries where it often enjoys very strong awareness, especially in South America, North Africa, the Middle East, and of course Europe. The Arcancil Paris brand is no longer distributed in Asia, but its participation, early November 2010, to Cosmoprof Asia in Hong Kong has helped establish very promissing contacts in the three countries where the brand was operating before, namely Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea. In Brazil, Arcancil Paris is distributed in a dozen cities with the help an commercial agent. In this country as in other countries, the brand did not hesitate to develop specific ranges, suiting skin complexions and specific consumer needs. ""Knowing how to meet the exact needs of customers is one of our key assets,"" emphasised Delleur. ""In Europe, for example, most women are looking for a natural make-up result, which led to the success of the Nude. This is fare from being the case in many countries in the Middle East where bright colours and covering textures are in great demand. We must therefore adapt ourselves and we can afford to, because we are make-up experts."" Paradoxically, this gave Arcancil Paris a chance to emerge reinforced from this period. The relaunch of the brand to new distributors also involved the obligation to attract new consumers. ""We focused our efforts on recruiting young consumers of 30 to 45 years of age who had an knowledge of the brand through their mothers.""Again, eye make-up products (eyeliners, mascara,...) were at the heart of the reconquest strategy. They were updated for this target and Kohl Kajal was the brand driver. But the demand, from former customers always loyal to the brand, has remained strong. It is the distance selling activity implemented to meet there demand that made it possible to maintain a link with those of our customers who no longer could rely on a distributor. These are precisely the customers that Arcancil now wants to win back."
"Eastman: ""the cosmetics market is a priority""","Premium Beauty News - What does Eastman represent today in the world of packaging for the cosmetics industry? Valérie Bouvignies - Eastman's plastic fibers and materials are key products our customers rely on to make products people use every day. Headquartered in Kingsport, Tennessee, USA, Eastman had 2009 sales of US$5 billion and has approximately 10,000 staff worldwide. On the plastic side, Eastman used to be the leader in the area of polyester chemistry and has recently refocused on specialty plastics, which include both copolyesters and cellulosics. Copolyesters whose main features combine aesthetic (transparency and thickness) and mechanical properties and excellent chemical resistance have a natural fit in the cosmetics and personal care (CPC) segment and are known under the brand name The Glass Polymer. The Glass Polymer includes a larger family of grades that can be used in Injection moulding, extrusion blow moulding and injection stretch blow moulding. Common applications are jars, caps, perfume caps, bottles. The Glass polymer is available on CPC sub-segments like skin and body care, fragrances, and colour cosmetics. The CPC segment is one of the priority markets for Eastman. The team is active all along the value chain where we strive to meet market needs, in particular with the introduction of new grades. Premium Beauty News - What were your main achievements in product developments in 2010? Valérie Bouvignies - Talking about new developments,Eastman launched a new grade in 2010, the CN. This grade is dedicated to injection moulding and specially developed for cosmetic needs. It is a new generation of PCTA, which complements the existing range with significant breakthroughs. It has a high level of clarity, a very neutral colour. It enables to run extremely thick parts with minimum thin marks, and no crystallization nor blush at gate with as always the same mechanical and chemical resistance properties copolyesters are famous for. Its easy processing also makes it very attractive for processors and represents a major change in comparison with traditional copolyesters. In a nut shell we could say, this grade has the best of copolyesters properties in a single resin. Premium Beauty News - You have implemented a specific strategy for the make-up industry with the help of an American designer. Valérie Bouvignies - The fact of having a brand and a brand image which are recognized in the continuity requires to have it evolve continuously. To achieve this, Eastman, chose to stage the CN market launch and to enhance this innovation through the design of packaging concepts. Eastman initiated the partnership with the designer Marc Rosen in 2009. Marc first worked on jars concepts and then in 2010 presented the"" the Art of clarity ""through 18 packaging concepts for the make-up segment. The concepts designed by Marc Rosen became reality thanks to the commitment and motivation of partner transformers who participated in creating them. Among those manufacturers are Leidel Corporation (USA), Pieriplast (Peru), Axilone (China), Plasmetik (China), Jackel (Hong kong) and Albea (Brazil). Premium Beauty News - Does your group intend to invest more in this sector? Valérie Bouvignies - The CPC is a fast moving market on which we permanently invest in. They may relate to specific innovations in the cosmetics market or concern more global issues, such as reducing the environmental impact. Premium Beauty News - What are the main strategic regions for Eastman in the world. Does France still represent an exception? Valérie Bouvignies - Asia and emerging regions like Latin America are obviously strategic on the CPC segment. However, Europe still remains a strategic region as a primary spot for innovation and we mustt not forget that perfume and its legendary luxury brands are always associated to France"
The new ambitions of Alkos Group,"Premium Beauty News -Why did you choose Alkos Group? Florence Lefeuvre - I love comebacks! But it's the human dimension of the adventure that motivated my choice; Gérard Gieux and Dominique Vautier had no trouble in convincing me of the exciting character of this new post which suits perfectly my experience. In addition, Intercosmétiques and Sagal [1] are known for their industrial expertise, and their levels of services. So far, these companies have remained relatively discreet about their performances, I will do my best to communicate to the marketplace the image they deserve and enhance their product offering. I wanted to rediscover the thrills of exiting challenges by integrating a business plan with a comprehensive function in which I could develop my gifts by fully dedicating myself to the progress of teams and of the activity. Contribute to the development of the only ""Made in France"" pencils is a prospect that I find very exciting. I am going to rediscover a new factory and will do my best with the teams in place and newcomers, to help the company reach the place that it deserves on the market in France and overseas. Premium Beauty News - Your experience in make-up, skincare, and pencils was a strong asset to tackle this new challenge. Florence Lefeuvre - Let's say I have acquired a real expertise in the assessment of textures and that I learned to develop an active listening on the needs our clients brands, helping me therefore to meet their expectations. Premium Beauty News - Did the recent appointment of Dominique Vautier (former Manager of Chanel's plant in Chamant) at the head of the group influence your decision? Florence Lefeuvre - Indeed, I met Dominique Vautier whose reputation of professionalism and industry expertise I already knew about. We actually share the same development vision for the group. Our backgrounds and respective profiles are perfectly complementary. The significant work he has already achieved at an industrial level, especially for the beautiful pencil plant in Boulogne-sur-Mer, will soon bear fruit. Premium Beauty News - What is the importance of pencils in the market of colour cosmetics? Florence Lefeuvre - It's a product that has developed itself significantly. Its appeals obvious to both, the consumer (they are the most affordable of make-up products) and to brands, they are very profitable references with high rotations, specially on the lip axis."" Premium Beauty News - And what are the goals of Mr. Gérard Gieux, the Group's main shareholder? Florence Lefeuvre - Gérard Gieux is recognized in the industry for his innovations in the packaging company Cosmogen, but he is also a passionate entrepreneur. He embarked on this adventure, just before the crisis and has had some problems starting. So, at the start of this year, we're in a more serene atmosphere, the beginning of a story, that of the setting up of a group, with all that it entails in terms of work analysis and cross structuring, focused on the development of Full Service. The objective of Gérard Gieux and Dominique Vautier is to build a sound and well structured group offering a full range of cosmetics and make-up products (lipsticks, lipgloss, gloss, balms, foundations, etc.), plastic and wooden pencils, skincare creams, facials and hygiene products; cleansers, lotions, soaps, sticks, all of them ""Made in France. Premium Beauty News - How do you see the future? Florence Lefeuvre - The group needs a commercial harmonization and to improve the value added of its products through marketing, in particular of make-up. I am confident: teams are solid, factories are running well and we have many beautiful textures to promote! So see you soon on the Alkos Group's stand at Cosmoprof!"
"Barbara Lavernos L'Oréal: ""Making good purchases implies knowing goods!""","Premium Beauty News - 38 factories worldwide, a Purchasing department comprising today 600 employees, a budget of several billion euros ... a beautiful machine! Barbara Lavernos - It's true that when I arrived at the Group's Purchasing department in 2004, the purchasing function was taken care of by dedicated teams spread in the plants with all the advantages but also disadvantages of such an organization. We wanted to implement a two-person management organization, with one person who would be focusing on suppliers and the other one who would be dealing with all our internal customers (marketing, research, production ..). And when I say suppliers, if I chose for instance, packaging, I mean a specialised buyer for each sector. So I have specialists in glass, plastic, paper and cardboard, machines, and this, in every major part of the world where we are operating, in Europe, the United States, Brazil, China, etc. Of course, there are some strategic countries in packaging where we do not have any manufacturing facilities, such as Korea, or Japan, where we also have a buyer on the spot. On the other hand, for Africa and the Middle East, purchasing activities are coordinated from Paris with buyers in every major country in the area. What is important is that the Purchasing managers also have a complete vision of the final product. In fact, they are real ""Sourcing Centres"" with an aim to optimize the supply chain. Premium Beauty News - These centres must handle fortunes! Barbara Lavernos - It's true! We have Lead buyers who manage portfolios of between 50 and 150 million euros! Which certainly is considerable but on the other hand reinforces their responsibility. It is true that we have significantly strengthened the teams in recent years. Just for packaging, out of the 150 employees present today we hired 40 of them in 2 years time. Premium Beauty News - What are the stakes? Barbara Lavernos - They are huge. Simply imagine: L'Oréal renews each year about 1/3 of its products. In fact, it implies that we could potentially change all our suppliers every three years! But there is nothing to worry about, we are loyal people. I take this opportunity to recall that we do not want to account for more than 25% of our suppliers' sales, in order not to weaken them or risk creating situations of interdependence, which in the end, wouldn't be a good idea neither for us nor for them. ""Purchase"" issues are particularly strategic. For this reason, we took advantage of these organizational changes to create SRM [1] transversal functions, but also key functions in control and economic analysis, global dashboards and scorecards. Today, we are able to have a clear vision of our relations, at a given moment, with either one of our suppliers, with a global vision. And not to mention the permanent interactivity that such a tool allows us to have with them, especially as part of our calls for tender, the whole of it constantly showing due regard to the strictest codes of ethics. Premium Beauty News - What about full service? Barbara Lavernos - If you're implying by that, ""are we going to rely more and more on subcontracting?"" The answer is no! We have our own factories, and a program has been set up to build new production sites for the three years to come. Our factories allow us to produce while being close to our consumers. We consider it a relevant model, and we are keeping it. Currently, there is a tendency towards automation. For some very specific domain, such as pencils, we resort to subcontracting companies that allows us to take advantage of their expertise. Premium Beauty News - The Cherry Pack event you organized last year was the high point of this relationship that you wish to establish on a long-term basis with your suppliers? Barbara Lavernos - In a way, yes! This operation, which took place wonderfully, is a perfect example of that. We had selected five suppliers and we offered them to present their latest innovations. This meeting was the occasion for a number of exchanges, so we will renew the experience this year. The next meeting is scheduled for late 2011. Premium Beauty News - Presenting exclusive innovations to L'Oréal may be considered sensitive by some of your suppliers. Barbara Lavernos - I see what you're referring to! Indeed, we have maybe had in the past what could have been perceived as an arrogant attitude on this point. But be assured, it's not the case. Innovation is at the heart of our business. L'Oréal and Innovation are one. So we're very aware of these issues. And initiatives such as the Cherry Pack are taken very seriously and surrounded by all necessary guarantees in terms of confidentiality and intellectual property. In addition, the new organization, which has been established in recent years, is also a guarantee for our suppliers. There are no more dilution of responsibilities in our departments, dilution that could result in some bad practices. Premium Beauty News - Are other initiatives underway? Lavernos Barbara - Yes! Six months ago, we decided for example to set up a Solidarity Sourcing program monitored by a department of its own, headed by Chéa Lun. The purpose being to dedicate a portion of the Group's purchases to disadvantaged communities and to associate our suppliers to this program. These actions that we want to undertake on the basis of an ""ecosystem"" pattern for disable persons, for people in so-called ""difficult"" neighbourhoods but also more generally for populations living in areas of the world that are somewhat markedly lagging behind, as well as small businesses (less than fifty people), etc. We are aware of our responsibilities in this area and our approach is indeed part of a long-term commitment. More than a hundred projects are already under consideration."
Alkos: birth of a group,"The ""new"" Alkos Group is clearly focusing on ""providing all the services of its three entities to the actors in the Beauty, make-up and personal care & hygiene segments."" A reformatting that aims at attracting a market increasingly adept of full service and seduced by the French Touch not say Made in France. 35 million Euros in sales and just a little under 400 people, the Group Alkos currently relies on three distinct activities. – a first plant in Angers, dedicated to the creation of formulas and the filling of skincare and make-up products, with Intercosmétiques ( 21 million Euros in turnover), – a second plant in Chartres with Sagal, specialized in the manufacturing of soaps and deo sticks (3.5 million Euros in turnover) – and the Alkos plant for the manufacture of cosmetic pencils in Boulogne sur Mer (10 million Euros in turnover). ""It has become essential,"" explained Dominique Vautier, CEO, ""to bring all these activities under a single banner, the Alkos Group. Especially when you know that our offer is quite consistent with the changing beauty market where demand for full service offers continues to grow."" The pencils business is the group's main asset. Alkos operates a recent plant in Boulogne-sur-Mer (9000 m2 of buildings), built from the ground up in 2003, can produce annually about 28 million units of pencils as well as different applicators or conditioners for eyeliners. The unit also proposes formulation services. ""Plastic or wooden pencils still represent our core business,"" emphasised Nathalie Dessirier, Marketing Manager. A true know-how, this pencil manufacturing activity since it dates back to 1784 ! Yes, you read correctly 1784, the year when a company named Conté invented the insertion of a graphite mine in a wooden cylinder. But it was not until 1961 that the first cosmetic pencils emerged. An activity that really took off in 1996, year of its takeover by Gérard Gieux, leading to the creation of Alkos Cosmétiques a entity of its own that eventually decided to go it alone, and separate from the group of origin. And it was in 2008 that Gérard Gieux acquired Intercosmétiques and Sagal, with the aim of building in the end a real industrial group to supply the beauty market. ""You could say that today, this has been done,"" explained Vautier. ""And the plant in Boulogne-sur-Mer is an integral part of this dynamic both in terms of the new industrial and commercial organization than in terms of product innovation."" A reorganization that resulted in the arrival of newcomers to reinforce the teams at all levels. several new planning, quality and maintenance managers, a new plant manager, Jean-Paul Mariani, and a new controller and a new sales assistant. It's actually the same buzzing environment with the two other entities, namely Intercosmétiques and Sagal, specialized for the first one, in the creation of formulas and filling activities (skin care and make-up), in Angers, and for the second one in the manufacture of deodorant sticks and scented soaps, in Chartres. By a happy coincidence, these two entities will celebrate this year, their twenty-fifth and thirtieth anniversary. With 30 people and a historical presence in the manufacture of high-end soaps, Sagal ranks high in the list of French companies specialized in this niche market, the biggest activity being the filling and supply of deodorant sticks (70% of the activity). ""The soap market is experiencing a real second youth with the emergence of gift boxes containing true soap collections,"" confided Grégoire Hantz, Sales Director. A a result, an increase of over 10% in 2010 on 2008 (base year). ""As for the stick,"" explained Hantz, ""it has remained a product experiencing strong growth and for which we have become throughout the years an increasing source of proposals in terms of formulation."" As for Intercosmétiques, the entity dedicated to the creation of formulas and to filling activities in Angers, the turnover of the skincare business (20 million units per year) is now on an equal footing with the make-up business (18 million units). The factory condition creams, gels, milks, lotions, oils and balms. The make-up activity is limited ""for the time being"" to the manufacture of lipsticks (30% of the activity), lip gloss (20%), but also of foundations, mascaras and eyeshadows. ""We have a real expertise in hot filled processes,"" insisted Hantz, ""without forgetting our capacity for airless packaging. We also have a reputation for providing a real quality of service, particularly in for meeting deadlines."" Formulation is another strong point of Intercosmétiques. ""We are far from being mere fillers, since 70% of our business is driven by our ability to formulate and innovate in terms of formulation."" ""It is clear that with such a tool,"" explained Vautier, ""we had the means to become a major European player in formulation, filling and, more generally, in the universe of skincare and make-up. It then seemed only natural to pool our forces. In concrete terms, the Alkos Group is strengthening its offer on turn key projects for which, its ability in managing the development of innovative solutions, the implementation of breakthrough packaging solutions and the conditioning of complete lines, are undoubtedly a number of key assets. And we mustn't forget the fundamentals which are quality of service and product quality, because the finest product in the world still has to arrive on time at the point of sales, with also the required level of quality."" From these industrial complementarities could only arise a full range of products with both a specific offer and full service. ""It took us a year to develop it,"" explained Nathalie Dessirier, ""but eventually we reached our goal!"" Starting with a new segmentation: Alkos Pro, Alkos Pro Natural, Alkos Limited et Alkos Colors. ""Alkos Pro, is about achieving results with a formula and gestures. We combine products to obtain a result. We use innovative textures. Alkos Pro Natural, is all about natural and organic textures. With Alkos Limited, we offer ephemeral collections meeting the market's expectations. Finally Alkos Colors seeks to offer a palette of colours/textures sufficiently representative to create a cosmetic line with reduced development times."" Upcoming highlights for the group, the Cosmoprof show, which will be the opportunity to present three new series: ""Aloha, a summer make-up collection"", ""Summer Vibe"" and ""Fruit"" Delights""."
Soupletube unveils an eco-responsible growth project,"Premium Beauty News - Soupletube enters a new era! Francis Beaugrand - Raymond and Yves-Marie Tricard, after developing the group for over forty years, succeeding to their father, in successfully recentering its activity on the fast growing sectors of tubes and plastic bottles and by also selling the historical activity of aluminium tubes in 2006, probably had the feeling that times had come to let a new generation take in charge the management of two topical major issues: markets globalization and the challenge of eco-responsibility. Their priority was to divest the Soupletube group to a new shareholder who would have a good knowledge of the industry and would be able to continue the group's development while respecting its corporate culture and identity. Premium Beauty News - What is your background and who are the new shareholders? Francis Beaugrand - I have spent twenty years as manager in the Pechiney group and then at Alcan Packaging Beauty in aluminium processing and packaging, which gave me a chance to perfectly understand the operating rules of large international consumer brands but also of the more selective ones and their expectations. I then headed Veriplast Consumer Packaging, which had just been taken over by an investment fund. I thus became familiar with the operating mode of investment funds, characterized by high speed decision making and rigorous management. I then sought to convert these experiences into a more personal project. The takeover of the Soupletube group gave me this opportunity, and involved the creation of a round table. I looked for investments funds wishing to participate to my project while still agreeing to let me play the role of majority shareholder. I am delighted with this association with Paris Orleans and Tim Mezzanine, two partners who will be able to accompany the group in its organic development and external growth. Premium Beauty News - How is Soupletube doing today? Francis Beaugrand - 2010 was a transitional year, characterized by a situation of market recovery after a very difficult previous year which had spared neither the industry nor the group (de-stocking, delayed launches, customers experiencing difficulties...). The mass market and in particular the dental sector performed pretty well and it also was a busy year for the selective segment. We presented our project for Soupletube to major brand owners and launched a new sales dynamic which was very well received by the market. We have every reasons of being confident for 2011 and expect a sustained growth for the first half, with a number of launches and increased orders originating from all our markets. Premium Beauty News - A few figures? Francis Beaugrand - Soupletube is a small ""Global"" multinational group featuring both, guarantees in size and structure allowing to provide excellent services to supply chains of major international or global clients, but also responsiveness and proximity in order to also serve more selective or local brands. Our turnover in 2010 reached 55 million Euros. We employ 480 people in Europe in four factories, three in France (Lisses, Bayonne, Oyonnax) and one Belgium (Chimnay). Our positioning, perfectly represented by our new logo, is original on the market, where operate very large globalized manufacturers and small family owned companies confined to local markets. The new logo wants to convey Soupletube's new ambition. Green, colour of vitality, embodies our attention to sustainable development. Grey, colour of technology, evokes our commitment towards innovation. The expanded ""S"" demonstrates our versatility and our will to expand internationally. The whole is framed in square edges symbolizing our professionalism. Premium Beauty News - What are the group's development priorities? Francis Beaugrand - Our priority is obviously to generate organic growth, by implementing the principles of operational excellence synonymous with performance in terms of quality and service. This approach is supported by a strengthening of our production capacity to offer our customers the flexibility and quantities they need to achieve all their multi-market launches. We are also focusing on product innovation and will be launching many novelties, some of them disruptive, in the next two years. Finally, we are always on the lookout for any external growth opportunities that could arise from emerging markets to locally support our key customers in their growth. Premium Beauty News - One of the strong elements of this strategy is hinged on environment related concepts! Francis Beaugrand - When I took office at the head of the group, I wanted to implement an ambitious plan to limit our environmental impact and to comply with eco-citizen values but also economic efficiency. I believe indeed it is vital for a packaging manufacturer to anticipate regulations and future customer requirements. A dedicated team analysed in detail the subject which led to the creation of a 2011-2013 Triennial Soupletube charter of Eco Responsibility comprising very ambitious commitments; it will be possible to check their implementation and current achievements for those of our customers who like assessing the performance of their suppliers in this area. Premium Beauty News - What are these commitments? Francis Beaugrand - Let's start with a few figures: – a reduction of 250 tons in our annual consumption of raw materials – a reduction of 20% in our annual consumption of energy and water – a reduction of 50% of consumables for our daily operations – a 20% reduction of fuel for our logistics Not to mention, by 2013, the fact of disposing of a full range of tubes and bottles made from recycled raw materials to offer the market a 20% reduction on the average weight of all our products. Premium Beauty News - There is innovation too! Francis Beaugrand - We invest annually more than 5% of our turnover in R & D and Innovation. Our development plan which was set for the 2011-2013 period is based on three main themes: – A decrease in the use of materials and recyclability (weight reduction of capsules and collars, use of laminated and refined complexes, generalization of the offer to use recycled materials (PCR) for tubes, bottles and caps, suppression of solvents). – Protection of formulas (reinforcement of the barrier effect for formulas used in colouring and food, adaptation of distribution solutions to help reduce oxidation). – Improve the value added of our clients' products and brands (new types of finishes, design of new forms of caps and collars and applicators to enhance the practicality of use for the consumer). Premium Beauty News - Finally, you want to offer additional services! Francis Beaugrand - We want to go beyond mere customer satisfaction and offer the market innovative services in the world of packaging to facilitate designing, development and industrialization. This involves the supply of small quantities of decorated tubes and bottles to undertake consumer tests or pre launch products presentations. This also requires modelling and sampling, not to mention consumers or distributors perception tests for new packaging projects."
"Now in France, soap has its Institute","Premium Beauty News - What is the weight of soaps on today's cosmetics market in Europe? Laurent Bousquet - The European production of soap would exceed 850,000 tonnes. It has been decreasing from 1 to 2% a year since 10 years in favour of liquid soaps. There are two categories: household soaps that belong to the sector of detergents and toilet soaps that belong to the cosmetics sector. These markets correspond to different trade organizations, but it is difficult to separate them. Soap would account for over 20% of the bath and shower products market in Europe and the United States. Premium Beauty News - An old story that the one of soap? Laurent Bousquet - Quite old, indeed! Soaps are the oldest known surfactants, obtained from the reaction of a base on a fatty substance. Their story began more than 5,000 years ago but their exact chemistry is only known since 1823. As for the first synthetic surfactant it appeared in 1916. Their use became widespread as of 1945 to the detriment of soaps. Despite its age, soap can address our current concerns. Indeed, its manufacturing process can be friendly with the environment. There are some saponification techniques that use neutral oils or refined fatty substances thus allowing making soap without any rejection and thus no pollution. Soaps are also biodegradable. They are easily removed in sewage treatment plants and have very low toxicity if released into the environment. Finally, soaps rely on renewable resources. All animal and vegetable fats can potentially be transformed into soap, even if it is necessary in most cases to combine them with different oils or fats to obtain a commercially interesting soap (consistency, volume of foam). Between 2000 and 3000 oil plants exist on the planet, not to mention all the oilseeds. Premium Beauty News - Therefore, soaps are sustainable products? Laurent Bousquet - They have the potential for that. Even if today, for economic reasons, South-East Asia has become the world's leading producer of soaps. These soaps are derived from palm oil, to the detriment of primary forests; and they also require the use of a lot of fossil fuels to be shipped all over the world. A number of shorter circuits are emerging again, based on sometimes very ancient traditions: saponification derived from olive and laurel oils in Syria, shea butter in Mali or Guinea, argan oil in Morocco, locally manufactured through a cold process. Premium Beauty News - Soaps are sometimes criticized and blamed for drying or irritating the skin. Laurent Bousquet - Contrary to popular belief, soaps are well tolerated by all skin types. They are in particular responsible for a fairly low rate of allergies. If they are sometimes accused of drying or irritating the skin, it is also because they are not always formulated and manufactured in the prospect of modern needs but in a purely economic logic or with the use of obsolete technology. Premium Beauty News - So, finally, is it really a product of the future? Laurent Bousquet - Yes. When we'll realize the extent of global pollution and the toxicity related to the manufacturing process or to the use of synthetic surfactant, and when synthetic surfactants become more expensive to manufacture than soap because of rising oil prices and the widespread of ""carbon taxes"". This is the reason why I imagined the creation of the Institute of Soap. Premium Beauty News - How must one proceed to become a soap ""specialist""? Laurent Bousquet - The needs are extremely varied and there is no specific training focusing on soap. However a training exists in the field of fatty substances and chemists all have heard of saponification. Companies need trained personnel in manufacturing, packaging, testing, especially with the gradual introduction of Good Manufacturing Practices. Training can therefore take the form of modules, which are inserted in the initial professional training. Equivalent needs exist in continuous training for employees with a position or under reclassification. To note that a number of micro-enterprises are emerging in the field of soap, using simple methods of saponification with a cold process, widely available on the Internet. This activity is similar to craft, and people involved are eager to benefit from qualifying courses. Many regional structures close to economic actors can promote these courses : COSMED, the University of fragrances and flavours (Université Européenne des Senteurs & Saveurs - UESS), etc. Premium Beauty News - Is the research component important for the Institute of Soap? Laurent Bousquet - Whether the training is individual or in a group, support will be offered in terms of funding, research and selection of partners and for the project implementation. Topics are already planned, such as the ones in line with the goal of: – promoting soap like a environmentally friendly product. (E.g. Characterization of biodegradability in different sectors), – ·promoting soap as a sustainable product. (E.g. comparison of the ""carbon"" cost of various personal care products and soaps), – ·promoting innovation and economic development. (E.g. studying the incidence of soaps on microbial growth). It is also the case of a number of topics related to research and development of new oils. Premium Beauty News - This will surely require a significant effort in terms of communication? Laurent Bousquet - Yes and obviously we will need a dedicated website, and our participation to trade shows will have to be considered with different partners. Finally, the creation of an event intended for the general public on the soap, its history and its uses will also be a great help to promote the benefits of soap compared to other hygiene products. Premium Beauty News - Who are or will be your partners? Laurent Bousquet - We are targeting all companies in the sector: manufacturers, brand owners, raw material suppliers and importers. There are also some experts. Several advisers, companies or structures already operating in this area may well become interesting partners. On the training side, many existing training courses already include modules related to soap. Several laboratories have already expressed their interest to collaborate in research programs in France but also with countries around the Mediterranean. And then there are also some important collectors and many people who once considered the creation of a Museum and who will be an important support during the general public day in particular."
Strong growth for Primapack in 2010,"The Cosfibel Group's subsidiary in charge of developing standard, primary or specific packaging (lipstick, mascara, make-up cases, perfume caps or closures for spirits, ...) has achieved a strong growth in 2010 with a turnover exceeding 21 million euros. The trading business of the Cosfibel Group almost doubled in four years. According to Jean-Luc Haulet, Deputy Managing Director, this increase in recent years is due both to a greater penetration among traditional customers and winning new customers under the company's core target which is make-up, but also and above all, thanks to the conquest of new markets in the areas of skincare and other sectors such as spirits (especially Brandy). ""To manage to increase our turnover from a little more than 12 million euros to over 21 million euros in four years,"" stressed Haulet ""has only been possible because of this diversification"". 2010 will also be remembered with a 200% increase in the number of new clients! To note that Primapack relies on three offices in China, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzhen that takes in charge the sourcing, the development and delivery monitoring as well as quality control. Main field of expertise, metal and plastic injection, multi-materials, decorations and various surface treatments, stamping, galvanizing and electroplating. As far as the beauty sector is concerned, good examples of launches to which the company participated in 2010 include: Burberry's complete make-up line, which is encountering a huge success among professionals and consumers, the Kenzoki skincare line, by Kenzo Parfums, Guerlain's mini lipstick and a By Terry's lipstick. As for projects to come, they are numerous. ""We have filed a patent for a refillable pen and another one for nomadic cases,"" added Haulet. ""Which confirms that we are indeed in line with our vocation of being first and foremost, designers/creators."""
Aircos: objectives are achieved!,"As anticipated by Eric Merville, Aircos' General Manager, in an interview published by Premium Beauty News last September the turnover of its company increased by 50% in 2010 over to the previous year. The annual sales of the French firm specialized in the manufacture of cosmetic products and packaging thus nears 16 million euros. ""A performance that is not only due to the sector's recovery after the 2009 crisis but also to a real increase of our market shares!"" now explains Eric Merville. More than 40 people were hired by the company in just two years! Goals for 2011: internationalization, particularly focused on Northern Europe. Let us look back in time... Aircos relies on three main activities: plastic injection on its site in Ardon (130km South of Paris), formulation with two laboratories in Boulogne Billancourt (near Paris) and Romorantin (230km South of Paris) and manufacturing and packaging, also in the factory in Romorantin. ""Fortunately we had invested heavily in 2009 on the site of Romorantin,"" emphasised Eric Merville. ""This allowed us to cope with the extraordinary growth of 2010! A site, as you know, which has a production and packaging capacity of more than 110 million units per year."" As planned, 2011 will be the year chosen by Aircos to develop its activities on gloss and lipstick segments. ""But we are also working on new manufacturing and packaging processes for powder products,"" adds Merville. The total investment planned for this year will exceed 750,000 euros with, among others, plans to increase the production capacity. As for our Full Service activity, it's still on the rise. ""As I already stated previously, we are giving ourselves the means to become full-service specialists. This is clearly a centrepiece of Aircos' development for the years to come. We master all the different components of make-up. This know-how allows us to provide our customers with the full responsibility of the product, including of course the packaging part."""
Heinz Glas: construction of a new furnace,"The decision was taken just a few days ago. The Heinz Glas group (EUR 280 million in turnover in 2010 including 220 million for the ""Glass"" activity) is going to build new furnace dedicated to the perfume industry, in Kleintettau on its German site. The investment representing more than 25 million euros. The new furnace will have a capacity of 40 tons/day and to start with, will supply, two IS machines. It will be commissioned in January 2012. An investment that will also be complemented with a strengthening of the industrial tool in terms of finishing with the introduction of a third vacuum coating bell, a new lacquering line, a new automatic screen-printing line and a new automatic tampo printing line for a cost of about 2 million euros. To date, Heinz Glas has no fewer than four furnaces in Germany, two in Poland, two in China and one in Peru. A series of decision that take place at times when the Germany-headquartered group has literally pulverized its objectives in 2010 with a turnover that soar from 230 million in 2009 to 280 million! It is mainly on the ""glass"" activity that the group will have achieved the best results, particularly in France, thanks to such successful launches as the new bottle for Opium and Belle d'Opium by Yves Saint Laurent, without forgetting of course, Ricci Ricci by Nina Ricci, So Elixir and Vanille Noire by Yves Rocher. In addition to this announcement, Heinz Glas also announced the appointment of Rudolf Wurm to the position of Commercial Director for Heinz-Glas GmbH, in replacement of Horst Hempfling who was offered new challenges within the company. Rudolf Wurm will be assisted by Jörg Fehn who will operate as the Assistant Sales Manager more specifically in charge of areas like North America, Northern Europe and the Middle East."
Ancorotti Cosmetics: 12 million in 2011,"For Renato and Enrica Ancorotti, the founders of Ancorotti Cosmetics, the adventure started a few months ago is definitely a success. ""It started in 2008, explains Enrica Ancorotti, a year to be really remembered as a pivotal year for us, made of major changes and important decisions. Because it is truly our passion for the world of beauty that led us to create this new company specialized in the production of mascara. During the 2009/2010 period, it is clear that we encountered quite a few difficulties, but also a lot of satisfactions, especially thanks to our customers confidence."" In any case, the year 2010 was dynamic enough to enable the company to exceed its objectives with a turnover of EUR 5.5 million in the end. A year during which the production capacity per team was of 1,900 kg allowing the filling of some 60,000 units/packagings. ""In 2011 we are planning to ramp up the capacity to 2900 Kg per team, explained Enrica Ancorotti, allowing the filling of 90,000 units/packs."" The projected turnover for 2011 is of EUR 12 million. To note that 95% of the turnover for 2010 concerns the sale of mascara (bulk and full service). The remaining 5% concerns the marketing of other eye products. ""In 2011 we will concentrate the same way we did with mascara, on the other two products that help increase customer loyalty and are among best sellers in the world, namely foundation/concealers and lip glosses/liquid products for lips."""
"Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics: ""Success begins with the consumer's demand""","With an increase of 7.1% between June 2009 and June 2010, the management of Schwan-STABILO [1] has every reason to be satisfied with the evolution of the turnover of the group's Cosmetics division during this ""turbulent"" period. The cosmetics division is growing at a higher rate than the rest of the group [2], and the current fiscal year could be exceptional! ""195 million Euros in turnover for the Cosmetics division alone instead of the 180 million foreseen between June 2009 and June 2010 ..., It is true that this really was a surprise,"" we were told at the group's headquarters. It was such a surprise that the program set up to reduce staff and working hours which had been implemented to last at least until the end of 2010 had to be postponed as of the month of March and the group even had to rely on more temporary workers than it had anticipated. ""2010 will remain as an extraordinary year for our business,"" states the Schwan-STABILO group in a recent release. ""The main segments responsible for this increase obviously still are cosmetic pencils for eyes and lips but also and mainly the outcome of the research and development work carried out by our engineers to improve the application of these products and their resistance, not to mention all the eco friendly developments of products still featuring identical qualities."" Another source of satisfaction,the integration of the U.S. firm Cosmolab (300 staff, USD 40 million in sales expected this year) in the scope of the group following its final acquisition last spring. ""Now we are able to be present on some midrange niche markets that were not accessible to us due to the remoteness of our European plants, but also mainly because of the higher-end positioning of our products."" Finally, the group's strategy to improve its industrial footprint and to establish business partnerships in every corner of the world is also bearing fruit. China, in particular, can only act as a strong growth driver. Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics is first of all an impressive research and production tool the headquarters and soul of which being located a few miles away from Nuremberg, in Heroldsberg. Cosmetic sharpenable pencils (227 million units produced during FY 2009/2010), mechanical plastic pencils, (122 million units), applicators with all types of liquid substances and mascara (42 million units), and other miscellaneous products (16 million), hefty production figures, the least one can say. International market shares that continue to grow (currently 48% of all products) with the United States being the leading market, totalising more than 140 million product units sold, followed by Europe (125 million units) and South America (70 million), Asia (43 million) and the rest of the world (29 million). ""Market Success does not start with the product itself, underline people in Heroldsberg, but with the demand from the product's user himself. It Is essential for us to focus on the consumer with a differentiated understanding of target groups, a product development that responds to the requirements of individual market segments, an openness toward new market potential and the ability to develop it exactly at the right moment. Dynamic markets call for fast action. Speed is crucial."" Apparently, the 2011 collection is no exception to the group's reputation in terms of innovations. Without going into too many details, we can name the METAL MANIC line which features in particular the FUNK2, a water-based liquid ink with a fine brush applicator that allows creating both fine or thicker lines, and the TOUCH 4, a creamy eye-shadow with silicon gel-based formula, and a non oily texture that is absolutely smudge and crease proof and stays on and on."
Baralan relies more than ever on its assets,"With 30 million euros in sales expected this year, the Baralan group will be ending 2010 in progress compared to the previous year. The Baralan group now employs a staff of 105 people and comprises five separate companies. In addition to the traditional design and distribution activity of standard packaging in Europe, the group features Labor Plast Moulding (plastic injection), Gloss Tech (surface treatment, coating, metallization), Inovo Design and Arrowpak in the United States. Standard glass bottles constitute the main market of the packaging activity itself, and include the bottles for conditioning nail polishes, which still represent 65% of Baralan's turnover! On this segment, the Italian company offers the bottle but also its accessories, including of course, the closures equipped with their brushes. To be noted in this regard, the announced release, early 2011 of new products for skincare and make-up. ""On this market of standard glass bottles,"" confessed executives at the headquarters in Milano, ""our assets, compared to large global players in the glass industry, still remain in a wide variety of choice and our swiftness and quality of service."" With forty five agents in the world and a very strong presence to all international exhibitions dedicated to the beauty sector, Baralan continues to rely on the strength of its network and the broadness of its range to reach all segments of a large and diversified customer base."
Witoplast: Two new production lines for plastic tubes,"Twenty million euros in turnover, 230 people, Witoplast which was founded in 1992 for the production of bottles, has become thanks to its production lines for tubes since 1998 only, a European heavyweight in the production of flexible plastic tubes, mono-layer, multi-layer co-extruded and laminated (the latter being more widely used for toothpaste through ABL or EVOH barriers for more cosmetic-type products). Largest producer in Poland, the firm generates more than half of its turnover from exports and owns twenty injection moulding machines to manufacture its own caps and closures. The company is also equipped with highly efficient decoration machines that can also print, up to seven colours in screen-printing, and up to eight colours offset as well as hot-stamping. It also has its own dedicated workshop for the manufacture of extrusion blow moulds. Fully automated lines still make it possible for some employees to work ""off-line"" in a somewhat independent way, to produce small batches required for orders coming from France. According to Christian Chirinian from Chirine International, its partner in France, Witoplast is currently completing the installation of two new production lines for plastic tubes. At the start of next year, the production capacity of the firm based near Warsaw will thus totalize seven lines in operation, enabling the company to produce about 150 million PE tubes per year. To note also within the bottling department of the firm, the commissioning of several machines to manufacture PET bottles with the use of NISSEI equipments. They will operate in parallel to existing extrusion blow moulding machines for multilayer bottles intended primarily to serve the food industry in particular ketchup and mustard. ""We are business partners of Witoplast, since several years in France and we can say with no hesitation that service, quality, swiftness of action and proximity allow us to be a supplier many of our customers can rely on,"" underlines Christian Chirinian, who also is a business partner of South Korea's Hana via Linea-Chirine (Airless Systems). ""We offer a full range of standard tubes, explains Christian Chirinian, whether it be in diameter 19 (labial, with a cannula or standard), diameter 25 (screw on), in sizes of 30, 35, 40, 50 and 50 elliptical (to screw on or with a service cap and finally bi-injected for the elliptical model). Sleeves for capsules and seals for the heads are also available. This gives us the possibility of offering printed tubes from 5 to 320 ml."" Latest novelty to date, the offset printing technique called: ""Full body printing"" which enables full printing on a white (or transparent) sleeve of bright colours without resorting to the use of a colour injected sleeve (thus reducing costs) while printing right up to the interior of the shoulder, a surface which is hidden by the cap. This technique can be applied to all existing diameters from 19 to 50 mm. Note that technicians at Witoplast are currently working on a new printing technique called ""high resolution"" and on a new 16 mm diameter breakable tube. Launches of which are planned late 2011."
Hermann Koch: 8 million euros invested in four years!,"New products It's a strong change in management process that Hermann Koch has been experiencing, during several months. [1] Through the impetus given by its new CEO, Christian Lützenrath, it is a big part of the organization and industrial objectives including the product range which are being rethought. The first objective for the German converter specialized in plastic injection, extrusion and blow injection, is to innovate and offer new products to the customer market. Main production, still today, with 75 per cent, a full range of jars of many different sizes mainly PP-made. ""We have decided, among others things,"" explain Melanie Krempel and Susanne Heinrich at the Marketing and Innovation Department, in Coburg, ""to create several new standard lines combining jars, but also bottles with new design."" A decision which paid off with the new line Sipario introduced for the first time this year. And it only the beginning of it. Each year will see a new line emerge. ""We are lucky enough to have a solid industrial tool,"" points out Christian Lützenrath. Indeed, Hermann Koch is equipped with 80 injection machines ranging from 25 tons to 320 tons, among which six are electric and three bi-injection machines (all of them Arburg), 15 blow-moulding extrusion machines including a four print Magic which can produce some 1,200 bottles per hour, ten screen printing machines and eight hot stamping machines. Not to mention seven compression machines that allow to produce Bakelite-made products."
Faber-Castell Cosmetics: significant growth in 2010,"Premium Beauty News - Finally your cosmetic branch came out pretty much unscathed from the 2009 year, so gloomy for the global economy! Stefano Castelletti - Yes, indeed! But it has little to do with chance. It is also the result of a thorough work, which was carried out industrially by automating at the most, by increasing the efficiency and the effectiveness of our processes This obviously makes us much stronger now that demand is skyrocketing. Premium Beauty News - Recovery is not the only cause for the strong growth you will be recording in 2010! Stefano Castelletti - No! There are three main reasons for this increase. Growth of course which is the consequence of larger orders coming in from our customers reflected from the restocking from trade, but there is also a strong demand for our new products such as Pure Liptint and Tint' n' Gloss which encountered quite a lot of success with current customers but also new ones. And that's in fact the third reason for our growth, the arrival of new customers. Premium Beauty News - What are these new customers attracted by? Stefano Castelletti - Clearly by our innovations and marketing concepts, in particular also with the lead we took three years ago in the development of products in line with new environmental concerns. With Truly Natural we were the first ones to offer a range of Ecocert certified products in 2008. We already had been granted the FSC certification and the German BDIH certification. And now we also offer NaTrue compliant formulas. In 2010 we presented an Organic Nail Care concept also in compliance with Ecocert and BDIH. And we will be continuing our efforts with Earthbound the new Ecocert organic concept for eyes and lips, formulated with a gentle and natural ingredient that is grown exclusively from organic sources and harvested in accordance with the supplier environmental and fair trade charter. This is in line with our philosophy, principles and responsibilities since sustainability, fair trade, people and environment are part of Faber-Castell's core values. Premium Beauty News -But this is only one part of your strategy? Stefano Castelletti - Yes, only a very small part. We are placing great value in the multi-functionality of our products, but also on the ""long lastingness"" aspect of our formulas. This aspect is still a strong trend on the market. But we are also trying to find new ways of extending our pencils applications to other uses in the world of make-up. Wooden pencils are not left behind, on the contrary. They are receiving a great deal of attention especially in terms of new decorating techniques like the innovative 3-D graphics with elevated touch. In this regard we will soon offer a technology that we're in the process of acquiring and which will make it possible to propose a customised decoration for almost every pencil. Premium Beauty News - On the subject of your latest marketing initiatives, you have just signed an representation agreement for your products in Italy with Ancorotti Cosmetics. Stefano Castelletti - That's right! I am proud to announce this new milestone for Faber-Castell Cosmetics. This strategic partnership is an ideal combination for both of us, made of expertise and creativity and allowing us, we are convinced, to develop and offer innovative and attractive products. Premium Beauty News - Should you produce more in your existing plants or consider new industrial facilities in other theatres of operation? Stefano Castelletti - That is indeed a topical question, and a question which needs to be thoroughly considered too! It is obvious that we adapt ourselves and that we will adjust our production capacity to market growth. As a family-owned company with a long tradition we believe in long term business development and partnership with our customers."
SGD Asia Pacific: 15% annual growth for the past 12 years!,"Premium Beauty News - Actually, the presence of SGD in the region dates back to longer than the opening of your plant! Cyril Ruiz Moise - Yes. Before being present industrially, commercially speaking, we were already, in the region as of 1950. The plant's current location dates back to 1998. Then it all went very quickly. The factory was granted its ISO 9001:2000 certification in 2003. Three years later, we set up our decoration workshop and we began to really tackle cosmetic markets. In 2008, we set up our first ""gray"" room for the ""cold end"" and decoration section. In 2009, we obtained the following certifications: SA 8000, ISO 9001:2008, SFDA Shanghai Office. And finally, 2010 saw the commissioning of our Class 100000 clean room. Premium Beauty News - A few figures? Cyril Ruiz Moise - Yes, gladly! SGD Asia Pacific in figures has currently a coverage in sixteen countries of Asia, representing about 250 clients served and 250 million bottles! Premium Beauty News - What made the difference during these past twelve years? Cyril Ruiz Moise - Actually, we were committed in reproducing here, all the technologies and levels of quality we already had in Europe or South America. The same clean rooms, the same control procedures, the same specifications, the same quality levels, the same certifications (ISO, Pharmacopeas, GMP etc..). Our efforts in terms of decorative capacity will have also weighed heavily, not to mention our capacity in standard moulds (a hundred of them!), ranging from 5 ml to 1 litre and our flexibility. May I remind you that we have a high-performance lacquering line (45,000 pieces/day) not to mention our eight hot stamping machines (52,000 pieces/day) and our eleven screen printing machines (60,000 pieces/day). Of course, and this is the advantage of being part of a group, we also take advantage from the entire offer and synergies of the SGD Group, from our latest developments in sustainable development, and finally from the ""Infinite Glass"" (from 100% recycled glass) ... Premium Beauty News - What are the three keys of your success? Cyril Ruiz Moise - I would summarize by saying: Quality, Time to Market and Local Expertise! Premium Beauty News - Is environment as an important issue in Asia Pacific than it is in Europe or in the US? Cyril Ruiz Moise - Absolutely! Obviously the trend is more recent, but it is even more important to be able to address it now. And, as you know, the Group has a number of concrete solutions. It is a necessity. The ""Infinite Glass"" is one of the solutions. But hinged to this concept, there are real industrial challenges like for instance, hydro-based lacquering, preservation of water resources, treatment of industrial waste, etc."
L'Oréal takes care of its suppliers to multiply by four its production capacity in Asia!,"Attending L'Oréal's Supplier Day Asia Pacific, more than 350 people, coming from 140 companies producing raw materials, packaging, machines, including almost all of the Group's sub-contractors operating in the area. Main targeted and achieved goals: share the group's vision in Asia for the next decade to come and reward the work carried out by a number of suppliers during the past three years. Twelve of them received a reward. Orchestrator of this big show the Asia Pacific Sourcing Centre of the L'Oréal Group. ""A great initiative very well organized, informative, professional and friendly..."" These were roughly the comments that punctuated, here and there, conversations among the community of supplier concerned by this meeting. On the afternoon of November 9th, on the eve of Cosmoprof Asia, participants attended several speeches including those of Frédéric Heinrich, Director of Operations, Jacques Sebban, Director of Sourcing Asia Pacific, Christopher Guesnet, Corporate packaging purchasing Director, not to mention the introductory video by Jochen Zaumseil, Vice President General Manager of the Asia Pacific zone, also followed by that of Barbara Lavernose CPO World, and by other trades in Operations and stakeholders in Research and Innovation. ""In fact,"" we were told at L'Oréal, ""this half day of presentations, information and meetings was the result of a strong demand expressed by our suppliers after a big survey we had conducted a few months ago. The organization of such an event was one of the main expectations expressed by suppliers, in order to reward the work carried out jointly, to explain the group's strategy and to outline a vision as clear as possible on the needs to come with, at the end, an open and direct questions and answers session between business partners."" Attendants learned that the L'Oréal group's challenge in Asia was represented by an impressive figure, the arrival of 500 million new consumers in the next ten years to come. The figure is resulting in a direct impact on the group's production capacity which should then be multiplied by four during this period! All the Group's factories in the region will be concerned, namely the two existing plants in China and those located in Indonesia, India and Japan, a total of five. To note that the group is taking this opportunity to build a brand new factory in Indonesia which should be operational by mid 2011. At the same time, L'Oréal is launching a hefty program to extend the capacity of the factory located in India. ""Furthermore, the group is already looking for new sites to increase its presence in China, India, and the ASEAN,"" underlined L'Oréal's executives in front of an audience obviously delighted to hear such a program. Business is business! Icing on the cake for the 140 attending suppliers, the classification of results rewarding the best of them and this in all areas of the container/content activity, without forgetting sub-contractors to the sector for the following axes: quality, supply chain, innovation as well as a global price of excellence. 12 suppliers were singled out. And this year the global award of excellence was granted to the packaging company Beautystar."
B.Kolor: shifting into higher gear,"Premium Beauty news - Your presence is noticeable! If only because of your willingness to be attending all major trade shows in the world. Mario De Luigi - The stand is actually the visible part of the iceberg. This is the result of a daily work of questioning, of creativity and innovation. B.Kolor has achieved giant's steps in recent months to elaborate and develop new materials, new skin touches, new sensations, the whole of it in harmony with current market needs. Premium Beauty nnews - And those needs, what are they precisely? Mario De Luigi - The world is going in two fundamental directions that are opposite yet at the same time complementary: on the one hand there is a tendency to get closer and more respectful of nature through the use of elements that the planet can autonomously regenerate and on the other hand, there is daily progress in technological developments that are functional to the life of human beings. The latter does not exclude the former, the technological objectives respect nature as creation and as evolution of systems that were devised over the years. A new energy that is acting as a propeller towards a healthier, more comfortable and trouble-free future. Rhythms are changing and the quest for global well-being tends to replace the purely material research. Levels of well-being and well-looking are now a gobal well-being which tends to replace the purely material research. Levels of well being and well looking are now construed to match specific individual needs. Premium Beauty News - So this is a complete new range of products. Mario De Luigi - Yes, it is a range of cosmetics which have been produced using the maximum vegetable contents possible with up to 100 % natural results. A post organic evolution that intends to raise the concept of nature where human beings would draw from everything the planet has to offer and which the planet itself could renew regardless of the will of man. Inside this range of cosmetics, we have «Vegan», a collection for those who changed this concept into a philosophy of life. It is earmarked with respectful and meticulous care for detail. «Biotech» is a highly-scientific functional organic range, a combination that ensures performance comparable with the best engineering innovation has to offer. A very important section in our company because for the last six years we have worked very hard in this area to obtain exceptional products. But there are also «Cheminature», «Perfomers», «Effect», «Stay» and «Glam glass». It is much better to see and touch them than speak about them. Premium Beauty News - Your presence abroad continues to increase. Mario De Luigi - Quite true! We have approached many new territories in the world, following our one-small-step-at-a-time philosophy. Today we can consider ourselves as an international reality. Given the specificity of our products and the success they encounter, requirements are huge and within reach. We don't want to miss these opportunities and believe me, we won't!"
"Tim Eaves, Quadpack: ""150 million euros by 2015!""","Premium Beauty News - What is your recipe for success? Tim Eaves - It would be no exaggeration to say we have become almost unavoidable in the personal care packaging industry. This is simply a question of numbers. Out of the 75 people currently working at Quadpack, 50 are involved in business development. These specialists are continually in direct contact with the market, to understand requirements and source all the latest of innovations that could provide our customers with effective, original and quality solutions. Only a half of these 50 staff is dedicated to sales and marketing; the other half is involved in operations, which covers highly specialised areas such as development, sourcing, qualityassurance and logistics. Premium Beauty News - And what do the remaining 25 do? Tim Eaves - The rest carry out supporting functions – and they are each just as essential and just as talented in their own areas. Our success is driven by the motivation and enthusiasm of our workforce at all levels. Everyone's contribution is vital and appreciated, and everyone works hard. And believe me, there is plenty to do! We are currently present in 11 countries and our customer base continues to grow. You know that historically Quadpack is the result of a business partnership of three companies: one based in Spain, one in France and one in the UK. We were already in essence an international operation. And so, from the outset, we naturally established ourselves in the United States, then in Israel, Poland, Turkey, Australia, Germany, Italy, etc. Premium Beauty News - And the flagship partner in your portfolio is Korea's Yonwoo. Tim Eaves - That's right. We have an excellent partnership. Yonwoo represents more than 50 per cent of our business. It is an extremely dynamic and successful company, where the day-to-day driving force is Innovation, with a capital 'I'. Don't forget that this company currently generates more than US$140 million in sales and annually produces some 450 million products, of which a great part is aimed at supplying the airless market, where Yonwoo can be considered as one of the undisputed world leaders. This leadership will undoubtedly strengthen in the months to come, as Yonwoo has announced a production increase of 40 per cent. However, we also source from other companies in other regions of the world. There is China, of course, where we have just broadened our presence, but also Europe. Premium Beauty News - You speak of sourcing, but you are also very proactive in the research and development of new products or concepts? Tim Eaves - You're right! The term 'sourcing' is over-simplistic, because we have always been concerned with, and are increasingly involved in the design and even the manufacture of the packaging solutions we sell. Our responsibility goes well beyond a simple partnership. And, as a matter of fact, more and more often we own the intellectual rights. Premium Beauty News - You just took a majority stake in the company Spirit. Tim Eaves - That's right! Spirit is a well-established company in the gifting and promotional market. Acquisition of Spirit allows us to offer a broader range of products and services. Premium Beauty News - With Yonwoo as a main partner, people tend to label you as a specialist of airless and high end products. Tim Eaves - This is only a small part of the picture. On the one hand, we operate in many other areas of beauty packaging and, on the other hand, our aim is precisely to extend our influence in what is commonly called 'masstige'. It is true that we are one of the leaders in the airless segment and we pride ourselves on the excellence of our products in this area, but our range is extensive and continues to grow, in glass and plastic jars and bottles, in dispensers and closures and, now, also in make-up. Premium Beauty News - Is make-up a segment where you have ambitions? Tim Eaves - Absolutely! You may have noticed it this year with the launch of several products, including a brand new heated mascara that uses a double-headed applicator to achieve long and elegant eyelashes. One end of the applicator has a professional mascara brush; the other end has a heated wand especially designed to smooth out clumps, shape eyelashes and maximise volume. Premium Beauty News - Anything else in the pipeline? Tim Eaves - Yes, of course. Our sourcing office based in South Korea is already developing some very innovative solutions with various manufacturing partners and some of these will be presented at the second edition of the MakeUp in Paris show next June at the Carrousel du Louvre. Premium Beauty News - Can you venture a forecast regarding the turnover of Quadpack for the next five years? Tim Eaves - Reasonably, yes! 150 million euros!"

Alcan Packaging Beauty changes name to Albéa,"Alcan Packaging Beauty today announced its new company brand name. Acquired by Sun European Capital, a subsidiary of Capita Partner, in July 2010, the specialist of cosmetic packaging, changes name to Albéa. ""The semantics of Albéa evoke the word 'beauty' and symbolize material embellishment, referring to our core business. The letter A at the beginning and at the end of the name reflects its openness,"" says the company in a release. The company also changes its logo, opting for a cell-shaped image ""directly inspired by the protective honeycomb and its natural potential for expansion."" ""It represents our protection of and great care for our customers' products and all the markets we serve, as well as our focus to support their development worldwide,"" explained Francois Luscan, President and CEO of Albéa. The new Albéa brand will be rolled out globally during the next 6 months. The group's new website is under construction and will be available at www.albea-group.com"
Coty strengthens its makeup business,"Already rich with a broad portfolio of licenses (including Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, Cerruti, Chloe, Jil Sander, Marc Jacobs [1]), the prestige division of the Coty group, who also holds the license of Calvin Klein fragrances, has announced the development and commercialization in 2012 of a full makeup line for the brand. Without revealing the concept of the range, Bernd Beetz, Coty's CEO, already announced its willingness to ""push the boundaries of the colour cosmetics category as we know it."" Coty has also announced the purchase of 100% shares of Dr. Scheller Cosmetics (DSC) from Russian group Kalina. With to its Manhattan mass-market brand, DSC is a leading make-up player in Germany and its acquisition allows Coty to reach the second place on the German market. Kalina had already sold DSC's industrial capabilities to Weckerle. Following DSC's buy out, Coty's market share on the make-up segment in Germany will rise from 7% to 17%. In total, make-up should amount to 25% of Coty's sales. The group also intends to use DSC's existing distribution networks to boost its other make-up brands, including Astor, Rimmel and Esprit Cosmetics. In recent weeks, rumours have grown concerning Coty's possible acquisition of US nail polish manufacturer OPI. With a 6% market share of the U.S. nail polish market, OPI would allow Coty to strengthen its business on this fast-growth segment, while refocusing its positioning on high-end products. According to Bloomberg, Coty is emerging as the most likely buyer for an amount that could reach about one billion US dollars. These various announcements are part of Coty's development programme, which must lead the group to achieve a turnover of 7 billion U.S. dollars by 2015."
Dupont is present on all fronts of perfumery and cosmetics,"DuPont's engineers have managed to breathe new life to their famous Surlyn resin, which had already caused quite a stir when it appeared on markets in the late 1980s. Among the developments that can demonstrate those latest successes arethe new overmoulded Surlyn glass bottle launched by the pair Bormioli Luigi - Pibiplast, without forgetting the design by VPI of this amazing transparent collar impregnated with fine bells of lily. One can also mentions the cap and collar designed by Rexam for Balenciaga's latest fragrance: the amber pale juice is conditioned in a prismatic bottle with a ivory looking collar moulded in Surlyn and crowned with a cracked porcelain cap, also in Surlyn recalling ancient vases of the 18th century. And several other innovations are in the pipeline... The American chemist is also introducing new grades in its DuPont Selar PA range which will ensure a high barrier for packaging meant to contain solvent-based products such as some waterproof mascaras or nail polishes. Not to mention this new synthetic fibre, Natrafil, which can replace the traditional goat hair used the manufacture of make-up brushes ..."
Maesa takes full advantage of recovery,"After a particularly trying 2009 year from every point of view, (economic crisis coupled with drastic restructuring of the U.S. entity in the wake of the acquisition of Zorbit Resources), the young group that designs and manufactures lines of beauty product and scented products, as well as customized packaging is seeing the future under more favourable auspices. Main highlights of the first six months of 2010: several new contracts with global leaders in distribution (Payless ShoeSource and Zara), and an increase in capital underwritten almost entirely by U.S. managers which lead to a reinforcement of equity of 3.4 million euros. Furthermore, shareholder officers (Jill Belasco, CEO USA, Sean Brosmith, Creative Director, USA and Scott Oshry, President of Maesa Studio) have joined the two founders at the Board of Directors. ""In 2011 we are going to continue our growth on key accounts,"" explain managers, "" and we are going to continue improving our profitability through the control of overhead costs. We will also continue our restructuring both in the United States, with the relocation, as of January next into functional premises designed for our business and also in China, where a new Managing Director has been appointed to strengthen our industrial partnerships and increase our margins."" Latest achievements undertaken by Maesa include, the redesign of Zara's perfume department, the creation of an exclusive branding for Icing by Claire's, the design of the beauty category for Payless ShoeSource, the development of a brand of thematic body products to simulate the sales of private labels at Carrefour's health and beauty department, the development of the first fragrance diffuser bearing the name of the car manufacturer Renault, the manufacture of Sephora's Christmas packaging lines, the development of a box of scented candles available in three different fragrances for L'Oreal Professional, the development for Target of a range of products with high added value at competitive prices, and finally the design for Costco of gift boxes with high added value and low prices with scented products coming from Anthousa the American brand of high-end home fragrance products."
IL Cosmetics is strengthening its investment plan,"One year ago, by announcing an investment plan for an amount nearly equalling half the 2009 turnover (23 million euros), out of which 6 million euros to be invested by 2011, IL Cosmetics seemed to be ignoring the crisis. Actually, the group was investing in both its traditional market, nail polish, and in mascara, eyeliner and gloss, segments, keeping in mind a ""full service"" approach. Today, facts seem to prove him right. Not only has the nail polish market soared, but demand on new make-up segments is also very strong. Premium Beauty News - Is the growth in 2010 confirmed in your company's figures? Eric Wimmer - Absolutely! The group's 2010 turnover will have grown by 25% compared to 2010 for the global activity and even by 35% for the ""full service"" activity. When you know that the overall market of nail polish rose by 10% in Europe, it gives you a better understanding of our performance. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, how do you explain this performance? Eric Wimmer - When analysing different consumer countries, we notice that Germany is probably the European country that experienced the strongest increase in nail polish consumption. Well it is precisely one of IL Cosmetics' key markets, where the group achieves 80% of its turnover in Europe. It is the market where operate the largest European retail brands. Some of our clients have seen an increase in their sales of up to more than 50% this year! Premium Beauty News - Consequently, the pace of your industrial investments has not weaken ! Eric Wimmer - It is not weakening, on the contrary it's even accelerating. It's no longer 11 million euros but 15 million we are about to invest in men, premises and equipments. We all know that the market cannot grow indefinitely at the same pace. However our analysis, shows that: – we have recovered market shares since our progression is of 25% against a market progression of only 10% – we have a important development potential in areas where we have so far not been operating insufficiently, for both historical and strategic reasons. Remember that 80% of our turnover is generated in Europe! The world is vast, and we will be in a position to explore it much more once we are ready. We firmly believe that we can only sustain our business growth if we control it. This is why we have tried to avoid spreading our markets geographically but also our production sites. All our production sites are in different buildings, isolated from one another, but they are all located at Bettembourg, a commune in southern Luxembourg. This helps us take full advantage of all synergies available between the different teams and equipments! What I can tell you is that we are soon going to have available a additional built area of 5000 m2 at the same location of our factory in Luxembourg. For 2011, our sales forecasts in terms of progression exceed 25%!"
Rexam celebrates the 50 years of its plant in Le Tréport,"The adventure begins in May 1956 with the creation of the company Plasverre within the premises of the glassmaking company, Henry Desjonquères at Mers les Bains. However, plastic transformation starts it autonomous development at the very beginning of the 1960s, with the birth of YDEV (Yves de Vaucorbeil to replace the Plasverre entity) in the town of Eu, with the aim to bring together in one single place, three different manual assembly operations (cellophane wrapping, pumps for shoe care products, valves and push buttons). To this must be added decoration of plastic parts and moulding of rubber components. At the time, forty people are employed. The end of the 1960s is marked by the installation of the first plastic injection automatic press. In 1970, activities are centred on valves and push buttons. The new share holder changes to Saint Gobain Desjonqueres. With the new subsidiaries of the Group specializing in dedicated activity, YDEV specialises in assembly processes. In 1980, YDEV becomes S.O.F.A.B. (Société Française d'Aérosol et de Bouchage - French company of Aerosol and Capping) and takes in charge the control of the entire capping activity of Saint Gobain Desjonqueres. As the valve, pump and cap activity is growing, it moves on to Friville-Escarbotin in 1983. In 1987, the Bic Group takes over S.O.F.A.B. for the marketing of perfumes to mass distribution markets and expands its activities to Le Tréport. Two years later, emerges a now famous product, the Sofistic's, consisting of a 1.2ml pump bottle for the distribution of perfume samples. The 90s will record the transfer of the entire activity to Le Tréport and the development of a number of products that contributed to the site's reputation. The ISO 9001 certification will be obtained in 2005, then Bic sells Sofab to Bowater while the construction of a site dedicated to healthcare activities is undertaken in 1999. Finally, the 2000s will see the switch to S.O.F.A.B. Rexam, and then Rexam Dispensing Systems and finally in 2002 the emergence of the healthcare activity. Launches of new products follow one after another and two separate activities - Personal Care (beauty) and Healthcare (health) - are created. The Le Tréport site now hosts the Personal Care and Healthcare activities of the Rexam Group's Plastic Packaging Division . With over 600 employees and 4 manufacturing facilities spread over 25,000m2 - mini products, cosmetics, perfumery and healthcare - the site at Le Tréport has earned itself a reputation for its expertise in assembly and plastic injection. It is currently in France, one of the most important industrial sites in terms of injection moulding machines (over 100). In the domain of healthcare, the industrial site of Le Tréport has specialized itself in advanced dispensing systems for drugs such as spray pumps, metering valves providing a continuous flow, applicators and complete systems for ENT, pulmonary, and dermal treatments. Currently offering Class 8 clean rooms, workshops in controlled atmosphere and/or machines under laminar flow, the plant produces according to GMPs in the spirit of requirements set up by pharmaceutical companies for the drug itself and its container as well."
"Françoise Montenay, ""Beauty can help achieve a better living!""","Premium Beauty News - A bit of history first... When and why did this idea of creating this association emerge? Françoise Montenay - Beauty Centres start with the CEW, a trade association for reflection and action created in 1986 and which brings together women decision makers from the Beauty world. It is itself an offshoot of the American women's organization bearing the same name, founded in 1954. The ""C"" letter of course stands for ""Cosmetics"" (all members carry responsibilities in the beauty business, upstream or downstream from the chain that constitutes the perfume and cosmetics industry). The ""E"" letter stands for ""Executive"" (within the brands and companies serving the beauty industry, and at different levels of management, its members take a part in the creation, spreading and influence of Beauty in France and across the world). Finally, the ""W"" letter stands obviously for ""Women"" since all members are women and what women! By offering free beauty treatments within hospitals, our Beauty centres offer a interlude of serenity and comfort through the remarkable work achieved by beauticians. This allows patients to ""come to terms"" with their image and fight better against illness. Note that in addition to Beauty treatments, we have set up olfactory workshops in several hospitals and CEW volunteers (neurological rehabilitation, adult oncology, geriatrics) by specialists of olfaction and with the support of the IFF (International Flavours and Fragrances). By using a variety of odours, patients who have suffered various injuries find the way back to their memory (""Smell to Remember"") or to taste. Premium Beauty News - What kind of care is provided? Françoise Montenay - Since the creation of Beauty Centres in 1992, the number of care offered is steadily increasing. (facial hair removal, nail polish, make-up, manicure etc ...). And the most popular care are manicure, pedicure, massage, make-up beauty tips... Premium Beauty News - What are the next steps for the Beauty Centres and the CEW? Françoise Montenay - Actions undertaken by Beauty Centres can only increase. We have many projects under way and a large number of requests. Like any organization, we obviously need funds. I take this opportunity to thank all our donors for the invaluable help they offer us every year. And I can only invite all men and women who want to contribute to this exciting, rewarding and restorative task to join us. Concerning the CEW, as you know, we often hold events in the form of round tables, meetings or debates in a spontaneous manner, like for example, a ""brands-creators-distributors"" round table to explore avenues on the future of perfume, or of meetings on the occasion of an event such as, June last, MakeUp in Paris, where our members were delighted by their visit to the show and its make-up animation performed by the make-up artist Max Herland. Our next debates will focus on make-up and beauty on the web. Premium Beauty News - Next year will mark the 25th anniversary of the Association. Françoise Montenay - Yes absolutely! The highlight of this event will be the organization in June 2011, during the second or third quarter, of a big meeting in Paris, which will give us a chance to honour women who have marked the profession and put forward our image of women leaders who have an opinion on the future of our industry and share it."
Beauty Success targets 10% market share in France,"Beauty Success, the third network of selective perfumery in France with regards to the number of points of sale, behind Marionnaud and Nocibé, and the fifth as regard as purchasing capacity, is confirming its dynamism. The company has recorded an increase of its turnover by 5.8% in the first quarter of 2010 (7,2% as at August 31, 2010), against an overall market growth of 3%. It should be remembered that in 2009 the company had performed the strongest growth of its sector with a turnover up by 7.17%, against a market declining by -1.4%. [1] Philippe Georges, CEO and co-founder of the retail network, intends to continue on this dynamic. First step: a new visual identity, along with a new signature, unveiled last May. The next phase was to be presented to the network of franchise partners at the company's 16th National Convention which was held in Cannes from the 20th to 23rd of September 2010. After the front shops are put in line with the new visual identity, the network is actually planning an evolution in the concept of its outlets. ""We are going to conduct some tests to review the layout of the outlets, this project will be stated in 2011,"" explains Philippe Georges. The dynamism of the brand reflects itself in the continued expansion of its network which can now rely on 260 perfumeries [2] among which 2/3 of franchises. Fourteen new stores were opened during the first semester (including 10 franchises) and we should continue on the same trend, allowing the network to approach 270 outlets by the end of the year. According to its CEO, ultimately, the potential of Beauty Success is of 400 outlets in France in order to reach its 10% market share target. Proximity positioning is the main reason to this success. The network is in fact primarily located in small towns generally neglected by other competitors. The company has even developed a new store format, the 'Boutiques Beauty Success', specially designed for catchment areas of 15000 to 25000 inhabitants. ""This allows us to maintain or create the distribution of prestige cosmetics in areas where they no longer existed or had never existed."" While a traditional Beauty Success perfumery has a sales area of 100m2 and retails at least 50 to 150 brands (i.e. 6,000 to 12,000 references), the format of 'Boutiques Beauty Success' comprises outlets with a sales area starting at 50 m2 and retailing 12 to 20 brands (i.e. 2,500 to 5,000 references). A smaller store format which nonetheless does not neglect customer service. ""Each of our outlets, including shops, offer cosmetic treatments. This is essential, especially in areas where no other offer exists,"" underlines Philippe Georges. Similarly, whatever the size of the outlet, the company strives to present a balanced offer between popular brands, thus ensuring store attractiveness, and smaller brands that allow differentiation and create a brand spirit, with sometimes regional variants, when a quality offer of local products exists, like for example in Brittany. ""Our results are the consequence of the recognition of the service we provide to consumers. We have exceeded the two million threshold of loyalty card holders. It is also the consequence of local and individual investment of each of our partners, and the result of collective work within the company. Not forgetting, of course, the effects of our implementation strategy, marked by the diversity of our locations: downtown, shopping centres, rural areas and seaside resorts."" Philippe Georges believes, that in fact, all this is perfectly expressed in the new visual identity of Beauty Success. ""A good-humoured atmosphere, well-being and even happiness that we aim to provide our customers with, through welcoming, our services and advice given."" As part of the development of its services, Beauty Success will launch its online store at the end of the year, with the main objective of attracting new customers to its outlets. ""The advantages of an online store, with 24 hours a day and 7 days a week accessibility and availability, should enable us to continue to retain existing customers and win new ones. But the website was primarily designed as a recruitment tool to serve points of sale."" Beauty Success already has a perfume shop in Tahiti and one in Reunion, and 7 outlets in Morocco as part of a master franchise. International development of the brand is clearly in focus, even though if for the time being its CEO considers it is still too early to give an appropriate answer. ""We know we will be in demand because our model may be relevant in some countries. So we are starting to prepare ourselves internally for this eventuality, but we do not yet have structures to take that step. Having said that, we will soon be able to put ourselves to work."" On this subject, as on others, people at Beauty Success known how to keep feet on ground. ""To expand overseas means to adapt to different practices, different cultures and different expectations. It does not just happen."" Nothing in the short term, therefore, but the teams at Beauty Success are learning and are preparing themselves."
Arcade sets foot on foreign shores,"First step for Arcade, the South American continent where it produces, since the beginning of this year, some of its technologies in Sao Paulo. Then will come the turn of Asia, with a new implantation to come. Arcade is the company who invented in the mid-1980s, the famous ScentStrip®, a system, in theory so simple, consisting in partly applying fragrance on the flap of a sheet of paper using the microencapsulation technique. A fantastic promotional tool to release perfumes in the form of an insert in newspapers around the world was born! In just a few years, the turnover of Arcade will explode. But engineers at the American firm had no intention of stopping there as they launched, over the following years, equally clever systems such as DisCover®, LiquaTouch®, Beautiseal®, Kiss-A-Peel®, LipSeal® and most recently ClearTouch™. ""Of course,"" explains Philippe Ughetto, Senior Vice President International, ""the more we find new products, the more people envy us! But it is very difficult to copy us on the register of quality."" ""We have become over the years the champions of full service. We are entrusted with the entire project. We take in charge, design of course, printing of the insert, the card or the sleeve, the sample manufacturing, the encapsulation and/or filling and, above all, the perfect positioning of the product on its medium. A medium which must also fully integrate itself in the manufacturing line of magazines worldwide and insure perfect product rendition."" A real technical challenge where dozens of technical processes and manipulations come into play. To achieve this, Arcade currently owns two plants in the United States, which together employ 270 people, and several industrial partners who, for Europe, are involved either in printing the medium, or in applying the final touch to the product (filling and/or labelling/positioning and finishing). Major customer markets are, the perfume industry and then the cosmetic/make-up industry. ""A expanding segment, of course,"" admits Philippe Ughetto, ""but particularly challenging and competitive where we need to be constantly creative."" Latest idea which has emerged this year, the Interactive Sampling, a very clever system allowing perfume and cosmetic companies, through a dedicated website, to offer their customers the possibility to directly order via Internet samples of perfumes or cosmetic products. To be continued ..."
The Body Shop wants to get closer from the market,"Premium Beauty News - What does The Body Shop represent today? Alexander Borwitzky - The Body Shop's designated core businesses are cosmetics and body care, though the main focuses are the classic bath and body products. The company operates over 2,500 retail stores worldwide in more than 60 countries through franchise or fully owned shops. In Germany, The Body Shop runs 83 company-owned stores and 11 franchise shops. The Body Shop defines itself as the leading nature-inspired and ethical beauty company. Premium Beauty News - What would you define as your main assets in the current economic climate in Europe? Alexander Borwitzky - Firstly, The Body Shop as a manufacturer's brand with its own retail store chain has the benefit to directly communicate with its customers. Our retail staffs are the best ambassadors of the brand and they are able to convey our value system into the market. This is a big factor of success and an advantage in comparison to classic manufacturer's brands that cannot draw upon direct customer contact. Secondly, the so-called ""truthful difference,"" that our company represents. The Body Shop is motivated and powered by the ideas of Anita Roddick, its founder. Since more than 30 years, the company has shown a highly successful combination of an effective business model through its ethical value system. The Body Shop's values and commitments - i.e. the combination of innovation, high quality, fair price-performance ratio, inspiration from nature and a strong social commitment - mark our difference in the competitive environment. For instance, 100 % of our bottles are made from ""post-consumer-recycled"" material. And, wherever possible, The Body Shop avoids secondary packaging. This is what customers observe and appreciate. Premium Beauty News - Marketing processes also need to be adapted? Alexander Borwitzky - Actually, The Body Shop's marketing structures are being decentralized. Our aim is to be as close as possible of the market. As far as pricing and product portfolios are concerned, the decision level will be located in several decentralised specific regional-markets. We are organizing ourselves according to small market clusters, such as Germany and Austria. Of course, The Body Shop remains a global brand with centralised product development and marketing strategies, but the implementation of these strategies has to be managed and adapted as close as possible from the customer. Premium Beauty News - Your latest launches seem to be marked by a greater sophistication of the offer. Alexander Borwitzky - The Body Shop concentrates on becoming even more innovative. Especially mentionable is the new product series: Nutriganics. It is an Ecocert-certified, complete, natural skin care range for the thirty-something designed to fight the first signs of ageing (around 15 euros per product). We also launched a new type of products in the segment of antiperspirants. The innovative DeoDry series were developed without any aluminium salts! They are based on a naturally occurring volcanic mineral (Perlite), which guarantees a very high effectiveness. Premium Beauty News - What are your main expectations for the coming months? Alexander Borwitzky - As far as Germany retail sales are concerned, we expect a stimulation of the economic situation within the second half of 2010. Our key target is to expand our network and to open new shops. We already open 4 new stores in Germany and 6 other should open by the end of 2010. In addition, the company has successfully started online sales through the www.thebodyshop.de. This new distribution channel make The Body Shop becomes accessible to customers living in areas where the opening of new shops wouldn't be economically reasonable. The Body Shop is also testing sales in pharmacies in Germany. Our aim is to increase the penetration rate of the world's leading nature inspired and ethical beauty brand."
Lipstick and lipgloss help Aircos extend its offer,"Premium Beauty News - If we quickly go back over the main stages of Aircos' growth, the whole only dates back to fifteen years. Éric Merville - Actually, Aircos' activity dates back to more than 40 years but it's only in the early 2000s that the company takes its current form around three core activities, namely: injection in our site of Ardon (130km South of Paris), formulation with two laboratories, one in Boulogne Billancourt (suburbs of Paris), and the other one in Romorantin (170km South of Paris) and manufacturing and packaging, also in our factory of Romorantin. As a matter of fact, it is through these three perfectly mastered activities that we are able to offer a truly customized product. Premium Beauty News - Consistent investments were required? Éric Merville - Approximately 500,000 euros per year on average, excluding large industrial investments such as the updating of the site in Romorantin, in January 2OO9, at a cost of some two million euros. But it was worth it! In eight years, the staff of Aircos jumped from 75 employees to 150! The turnover which had already reached €11 million in 2008 will be nearing €17 million this year! Premium Beauty News - Even so your company is evolving in a harshly competitive environment? Éric Merville - Yes, but there is no secret. Our customers are paying more and more attention to market changes and their brand positioning. In this regard, they need industry experts. This is the reason why our core business is focused on cosmetics by developing a tool suiting their needs. The production unit in Ardon is air conditioned and automated. The factory hosts 35 state-of-the-art injection moulding machines, including 3 dual-injection. But we can also design and implement in-house specific machines and automated systems to continually improve the site's performance. This industrial building which is ISO 9001:2008 certified includes marking operations and has a clean room to design ""pollution protected"" parts. Our formulation laboratories in Boulogne-Billancourt and Romorantin enable us optimal responsiveness in our proposals. And we continue to invest in this area to strengthen our skills and our ability to respond. We can manage a project from its first concept to its most advanced design. Our integrated analysis laboratory enables us to manage all microbiological testing, we can thus guarantee independence and responsiveness. Finally, our new factory in Romorantin, which is ISO 9001:2008 certified, GMP compliant, currently under Ecocert approval with an OTC production area allows us to perform all types of filling, our industrialization team designs in-house automated systems to optimize our packaging process. This plant has a production and packaging capacity of over 110 million units/year. Premium Beauty News - A area where one must constantly innovate? Éric Merville - Innovation has always been the driving force in Aircos's development, the R & D department which is integrated, has two main functions: conduct studies applied to customer specifications, but also identify and anticipate changes required for the future of our profession. With a reinforced R & D team, we are in a position to work on tomorrow's textures and colours. In September we will invite our customers to discover our 2011/2012 autumn-winter ranges. They are called ""System 80"", ""Requiem"" and ""Ultra Glam."" And, as you know, lipsticks and lipgloss are entering our cosmetic range as of this autumn. Premium Beauty News - A real ""full service"" business? Éric Merville - This them, which is haphazardly addressed by many people, encompasses realities we have been dealing with for years: actually in the field of make-up, we master all its components. This mastery allows us to offer our customers full product responsibility. Brands need strong answers to meet market demand: cases, pallets, jars ..., Our teams know how to come up with appropriate solutions for the projects they have been entrusted with. The combination of our know-how enables us to perform multi-product pallets, in addition, thanks to our experience in the field of injection, a number of assembly are processed automatically. We have what it takes to be full-service specialists and it is clearly a cornerstone in the development of Aircos for the years to come. Premium Beauty News - And what are the next steps? Éric Merville - Broaden our lines of products, as I told you. But also expand our influence abroad. Exports only accounts for 20% of our business. Which is not enough."
"""We want Brazil to be our second market,"" Anna Chaia, (L'Occitane Brazil)","Premium Beauty News - What are your expectations regarding the development of L'Occitane's business on the Brazilian market? Anna Chaia - By July we opened 10 stores in Brazil, where we are now totalling 55 stores (15 franchises and 35 own), but by the end of our fiscal year in March 2011, we will have 70 stores. Our goal is to triple the size of the company in Brazil within 2-4 years. We're more accessible than Dior or Clinique but more expensive than Natura and Boticario. Actually, we hardly have any direct competitor. We're accelerating our investment in the country, hence demonstrating that we really believe in Brazil. Premium Beauty News - In contrast with the recent downturns of the European and US markets, Brazil showed a double-digit growth rate in 2009. Does that mean your company will heavily invest on this market? Anna Chaia - Yes. We will begin investing in the team – in particular in the management and in store staff training. We recently moved our office in Sao Paulo, which has a training centre for our stores. Additionally, about 80% of the leadership team was renewed. The second important investment will be in the media, mainly printed media, both magazines and newspapers. We have selected Ogilvy to be our partnering media agency in Brazil. Premium Beauty News - Retail outlets are also receiving increased attention. What about your strategy in this area? Anna Chaia - Today L'Occitane is targeting the A and B classes. Indeed we want to conquer the consumer of the B class in Brazil and our expansion plan is extending to secondary cities such as Londrina, Joinville, Caxias do Sul, Salvador, Campinas, with a third store, Belo Horizonte, where we have plans to open a third store too, Fortaleza, with the opening of a second store. We have opened or fifth store in Rio de Janeiro. Recently, we have reopened a new store at Sao Paulo's Shopping Iguatemi, and we are about to inaugurate a store at Centre Norte, and another at Shopping Tambore. In the coming years, we plan to open new retail channels through franchises and authorized stores, but also e-commerce and pharmacies. We are experiencing a high speed expansion pace. Retail is our DNA, combined with the expertise in beauty. We have implemented a training program for or sales teams to offer a personalized service for customers of our 55 stores across the country. L'Occitane currently has the lowest rate in staff turnover (9%) in the retail business. Shop assistants and back-office staff benefit from career plans, as well as bonuses. Premium Beauty News - In which Latin American countries does L'Occitane also operate? Anna Chaia - As far as Latin America is concerned Brazil is our only subsidiary, and we work with distributors in Argentina, Colombia and Ecuador. The idea is that Brazil becomes our bridgehead for the southern cone, within the next 3-5 years. Premium Beauty News - Is there any outlook for L'Occitane to build a factory in Brazil? Anna Chaia - No. In the short term it is unlikely. The products are manufactured in Manosque, in Southern France. The ingredients come from the same region, and it is very difficult for the company to replicate this consistent structure. As a consequence, 100% of our products sold in Brazil are imported. Of course, we therefore have to pay customs tariffs, varying according to product categories."
Pola to enter Indian skin care market,"As other leading Japanese cosmetics groups, Pola is developing its business outside its home market with a focus on emerging markets.

Stölzle upgrades its English factory,"Carried out over the last eighteen months in the teeth of the recession, this upgrade has introduced state-of-the-art decoration machinery and increased by over 50% the size of the decoration facility; installed a new furnace, and a brand new Customer Centre. Johannes Schick, Stölzle Glass Group (STO) CEO and Chairman of the Board of Stölzle Flaconnage Ltd details for Premium Beauty News the main assets of the Group's new strategy. Premium Beauty News - The Knottingley site has a long history? Johannes Schick - A long history indeed! Glass has been made on the same Knottingley site for over 130 years, and Yorkshire glass making dates back to the seventeenth century. The area originally provided everything that was needed for glass production: coal for power, raw materials and both canal and rail transport. In the nineteenth century it attracted a number of glass producers. In 1871 a bottle factory was founded in Knottingley by two cousins of the Bagley family. Over nearly a century, a number of changes occurred in the Bagley Company, including the production of a range of decorative glass that is now highly collectable. Then in 1962 Bagley's was taken over by the Jackson Glass Company of Knottingley. In turn, Jackson's became part of the Rockware Glass Company. In 1994 the Bagley factory was acquired by Stölzle Oberglas AG of Austria, who formed a subsidiary company, Stölzle Flaconnage, which began production in 1995. Over the years modern techniques have been added to the traditional glass making skills. Today, Stölzle Flaconnage has around 300 employees and specialises in the production of glass containers for high-end spirits, perfumery and personal care. The company has a reputation for high quality flint, or clear, glass, and, on two of its production lines, for Feeder colour. Originally operating with four lines of IS single and double gob machines, a fifth production line was added in 2008 to meet rising demand. By the end of 2008 all five lines were working to near capacity. Premium Beauty News - It's also concerning decoration that significant investments were achieved? Johannes Schick - By the end of 2008 it was clear that, in order to attract a greater market share, the decoration facility required major investment. It not only needed state-of-the-art machines but also a complete reorganisation of the layout. This was the point at which the global financial crisis began to impact and forced the reduction of bottle production. However, the decision was taken to continue the planned investment in the decoration facility Acquisitions and installations in the decoration facility include: – A new annealing lehr, – Techno 6-colour automatic printing machine, – Two spray machines capable of spraying 28 bottles per minute, – Automatic etching machinery, which provides a high quality finish with highly competitive pricing, – A hot foil stamping system, – Heat release transfer for multi-colour decals. In addition to the new machines, in order to meet the latest legislation on reductions in smoke particulate levels, and to anticipate future legislation, it was necessary to install a new chimney with filter, another major investment. The installation was effected during the summer of 2008. Prestige glass is all about visual quality. The cold end of the glass production area has been extended to allow for the introduction of an additional number of automated checking machines, thus increasing quality control. The decoration facility has also been greatly expanded. Premium Beauty News - A new furnace has also been installed? Johannes Schick - The expansion and modernisation of the decoration factory took four months. After completion, a major site upgrade of the glass moulding factory and administration areas was instigated. This has included the building of a 150 ton new furnace. The construction of the new furnace took 42 days over the Christmas period and entailed the closing down of all production. The new furnace was fired up on the 4th January 2010. Soon all five production lines were once again in operation. The IS machines operate with a combination of double and single gob, producing between 55,000 and 100,000 bottles per machine per day. Annual capacity for the factory is 81 million pieces. The final part of the site upgrade was the creation of a modern Customer Centre where clients can discuss design, production and decoration possibilities and view samples of STO's output Premium Beauty News - An upgrading which obviously took into account environmental constraints! Johannes Schick - Absolutely, during the upgrade, the environmental aspect of all the developments has been carefully considered. Stölzle Flaconnage has always recycled its own waste glass in its production, a certain percentage increases the malleability of the moulding process. In order to preserve the clarity of the glass, the amount and source has always been strictly controlled. The company is currently carrying out a major investigation into an industrial re-integration of waste glass in bottle production that will utilise a wide range of waste glass to produce an acceptable cosmetic flint glass. Premium Beauty News: The Group has opened two new sales offices? Johannes Schick - Two new sales offices were opened this year, one in Beauvois en Cambresis in France, and the other one in New Jersey, USA. These have joined the existing offices in Vienna and Moscow. Altogether, STO services clients from more than eighty countries."
Jackel joins the Li & Fung Group,"Actually, by taking over the Jackel group, the Li & Fung group, does more than reinforce its strategy for a total control of the supply chain in the beauty sector. Li & Fung has already dramatically strengthened its position in the cosmetics industry with the buyout of Hong Kong based Cgroup Ltd a few months ago, then with the creation of LF Beauty - specialized in promotional items and packaging, point-of-sale advertising and full-service. But with Jackel, it acquires an industrial tool located in Southern China, near Hong Kong, where managers from Jackel had already heavily invested in recent years. Indeed, the Jackel Group is running no less than 6 plants in China including two fully owned plants a few hours drive from Hong Kong, one for plastic injection (PCM), the other one for filling cosmetic / perfumery products, JV Cosmetics. Li & Fung claims to be a global leader in the supply chain management, with more than 1,000 customers, US$ 14 billion in sales and over 14,000 employees operating in forty countries. In 2007, the Li & Fung had firstly bought CGroup HK Ltd (June 2007, secondary packaging, full service, promotional items), PB Beauty, UK (August 2007, private labelling of cosmetic products), then Imagine PoS (January 2008, point-of-sale advertising) and RT Sourcing (August 2008, primary packaging). Last July, the group announced the creation of LF Beauty. Practically, LF Beauty has Sales offices in Europe (Paris, London), in the USA (New York, Dallas), and in China (Hong Kong, Shanghai), an important R&D laboratory for formulation in the UK, including product development and sourcing teams, project management and quality insurance teams for its various production facilities (Hong-Kong, ShenZen, DongGuan, Shanghai, etc…), filling units (England, China). Organized in networks, LF Beauty teams manage thousands of suppliers and industrial partners, from the product's development to its production (where materials and components are sourced from various suppliers) and its final delivery. Furthermore, LF Beauty can take advantage of Li & Fung global network, as the group is operating in forty countries worldwide: a strong and unique asset with a sourcing sector in constant evolution. As far as it is concerned, Jackel's business profile is consistent: US$ 130 million in sales. An industrial activity focusing on several poles, plastic, metal (zamac and aluminum), glass, surface treatment and, of course, the filling of cosmetics and ..., for the past two years, of perfume. This strategy of upstream industrial integration initiated by the Jackel Group in the early 2000s will have developed itself like clockwork. The creation of Jackel France, precisely in 2000, and its exponential growth had surely something to do with it considering the healthy order backlog for packaging and requests to come in ""full service"" from the French Beauty industry. With the takeover of Jackel, the Li & Fung group will be controlling directly or indirectly (factories of business partners) not only an important industrial tool in plastics, metal, surface treatment and to a lesser extent glass, but above all a powerful tool in perfumery and cosmetics formulation and filling. Jackel's Full Service activity had begun in 2003 in the United States with the Elizabeth Arden Group, and then Victoria's Secret and Coty. The industrial integration in the filling segment in 2006 with the buyout of JV Cosmetics boosted this activity. The plant can process both cosmetics, personal care products, perfume and OTC products. Regarding make-up, Jackel offers a full range of forty formulas including a ""standard"" range, ""les Classiques"" a ""mineral"" range, ""Les Minérales"". Main customer markets, the United States and Europe. Jackel's buy out is part of seven deals that Li & Fung recently signed in particular in the fashion and fabrics industry. ""The deals will further solidify our market share in their respective areas and will contribute positively to our bottom-line in the long run,"" said Mr. Bruce Rockowitz, President of Li & Fung (Trading) Limited."
LVMH growth will come from Brazil too,"LVMH - Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy - the world's leading manufacturer and retailer of luxury products, has reached an agreement to acquire a 70%, controlling stake in Sack's, the leading online retailer of fragrances, cosmetics and toiletries and one of the leading company in the whole specialty beauty distribution sector in Brazil. The acquisition of Sack's will mark Sephora's entry into the Brazilian perfumes and cosmetics market, one of the largest and fastest-growing beauty markets worldwide. In 2009, while the world was still struggling with the consequences of the financial crisis, the Brazilian market grew by 16%, according to the ABIHPEC, the Brazilian Toiletry, Perfumery and Cosmetic Association, who also forecasts a double-digit growth for the next five years. ""Brazil and, to a larger extent, South America are very promising countries for luxury goods. LVMH has been present there since 1973 and holds a leadership position in prestige beauty as well as in other segments of the luxury market. The opportunity is formidable,"" commented Antonio Belloni, Group Managing Director of LVMH. Sack's will serve a springboard to Sephora, the chain retailer of high-end cosmetics, which is owned by LVMH, to develop its local business, online and over time in stores. ""Sephora, which is the leading online beauty retailer in the USA, will bring its experience, acquired in international markets and online beauty retailing, to help develop Sack's business and increase its penetration among Brazilian beauty shoppers,"" says LVMH. Mail and online orders are important retail channels for cosmetics in a country such as Brazil. It is the preferred channel of leading Brazilian cosmetics makers, Natura or O Boticário. Founded in 2000, Sack's carries over 270 brands, including the most famous ones, and its client portfolio comprises more than 830,000 customers. Sack's is one of the top-three most frequently accessed pureplay e-commerce sites in Brazil, with 4 million unique visitors each month. Mr. Carlos André Montenegro, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Sack's and his partners, Albatroz Participações and Mr. Marcelo Franco, will continue to hold a 30% stake in Sack's. According to LVMH, the current management team, led by Mr. Montenegro, will remain in place and Sack's will continue to be based in Rio de Janeiro."
Shiseido's fragrance division to distribute Annick Goutal in the USA,"Paris-based Annick Goutal Parfums and Beauté Prestige International (BPI), the US arm of Shiseido's fragrance division, have entered into a multi-year agreement for the marketing and distribution of Annick Goutal's scents and skincare products. The US market has always been Annick Goutal's first export market, with a very selective distribution. The brand is currently carried in several prestige-level department stores in the US, including Barney's, Bergdorf Goodman, Bloomingdale's, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue. ""BPI's proven strategy of growing distinctive, high-end fragrance brands in limited distribution channels seems a natural fit for Annick Goutal Parfums, and we are well-positioned to maximize the brand's significant potential in the US market,"" says Nicholas Munafo, President of Beaute Prestige International USA. The new distribution agreement will be effective as of July 1st, 2010. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed."
"Misha Riveros-Jacobson, Rexam Personal Care: ""We have the broadest offer of the market!""","Premium Beauty News - To start with, tell us more about the Personal Care division! Misha Riveros-Jacobson - Formed in 2007, this division is primarily a supplier of packaging solutions with a worldwide production capacity. It is the business partner o many cosmetic products manufacturers (perfumes, care) and in hygiene and household products. It is one of the three business units under the Rexam Plastic Packaging umbrella. It focuses on three markets: Cosmetics, Toiletries and Household Care. The turnover of Rexam Plastic is about 1.2 billion UK pounds, equally split between the three divisions: Personal Care, Healthcare, Closures. The Personal Care division is one of the market leaders in perfume and lotion pumps and closures for perfumes and cosmetic creams. We are also the leader in the field of perfume and lotion samplers and in non-aerosol foam pumps. We are leaders in lipstick cases, and second in make-up cases. As for Household Care applications we are the leading manufacturer of custom high volume products with special expertise in innovative package design and engineering, multi-shot moulding, in-mould labelling and a full range of value-added capabilities for the global custom injection moulding business. Our clients include prestigious brands such as Procter & Gamble, L'Oreal, LVMH, Unilever and others, located throughout North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia. We have the ambition of becoming a powerful worldwide supplier of packaging solutions that builds brands while maximizing their profitability. Finally, and I probably should have started there, we are of course part of the Rexam group. whose turnover is around £ 4.8 billion, with a staff of 22,000 across 105 manufacturing facilities in more than 20 countries. Premium Beauty News - On your arrival at the head of the Personal Care Division, what were your observations and the options you chose? Misha Riveros-Jacobson - Immediately, it became clear to me that we possessed a unique industrial asset, consisting in the offer of global and integrated technologies that met the needs of our three markets. We must therefore take full advantage of this tool and transversally maximize technology synergies in order to fully satisfy our clients operating in one or more markets. It is no longer a matter of just selling the pump, or the closure or just make-up..., it's actually a question of understanding and taking into consideration the individual needs of our clients in order to offer them global solutions meeting their expectations on their favourite markets. This new market approach has led to a re-organization of our sales teams by clients. In order to provide them with a global offer of technologies, a single privileged interlocutor is chosen to meet their different needs in their different markets. The last point being that we needed to innovate more and capitalize on our Research Centre in Chicago, which remains a perfect example of its type, to develop with our clients innovative packaging solutions. Innovation is the driving force behind our business and we have continued to offer innovative solutions to our clients. For example the launches Glossy Days, a new collection of eight patented lip gloss applicators, each of them featuring its own visual and tactile advantages. In addition, we have just showcased our Nea Airless at Luxe Pack New York. Premium Beauty News - A few words about this new Airless. Misha Riveros-Jacobson - In anticipation of increasing demand for lotion dispensers providing high-performance protection, Rexam relied on its dual expertise concerning neutral pumps and airless pack for the launch of the new standard Nea airless line: a pack offering dual protection for fragile formulas. The heart of the Nea Airless is the Nea engine itself, first introduced in 2008 at Luxe Pack Monaco. Designed without elastomer, the Nea atmospheric pump is fitted with a glass ball and a spring placed outside the closing chamber, which assures metal-free formula flow, complete neutrality and protection against formula discoloration and incompatibility. The pump is engineered for smooth actuation, precise dosage and high suction force to handle today's most viscous and sensitive products. We offer this new airless solution in a 30ml, 50ml and, soon, 15ml version and two designs (large, lockable actuator, with- or without cap), and with global, end-to-end, support and service. The Nea Airless is easy to top-fill under atmospheric conditions on high-speed lines - Thanks to our patented SnapOn® technology. Complete high-end decoration, such as hot stamping, silk screening or vacuum metallization, is available. Premium Beauty News - Your global industrial presence is obviously quit an asset! Misha Riveros-Jacobson - A very big asset, indeed! Our presence in Asia, Latin America (in particular Brazil with its fast growing economy), Europe, Central America, the United States can only help us grow significantly in our clients major markets. Premium Beauty News - Yes, but you were appointed at the worst time of an economic crisis unprecedented since fifty years. Misha Riveros-Jacobson - Personal Care was impacted by a slowdown in the fragrance and cosmetics market in both the US and Europe resulting in a significant drop in volume. The stabilization of our results in the second half was the consequence on the one hand of strong demand for foam pumps, following the H1N1 outbreak, and secondly on improved demand for lotion products as well as some new product launches as clients' confidence returned. In general, clients worked to smaller batch sizes and shorter order commitments whilst retailers reduced stock holding and expected suppliers to be more flexible and to be able to cope with any fluctuations in demand. We acted swiftly to the drop in demand with cost saving initiatives, including plant closures, plant restructuring, headcount reductions, salary freezes and furloughs. Premium Beauty News - In this race for excellence, Rexam Personal Care seems to have changed gear in recent months, like for example through your communication. Misha Riveros-Jacobson - I'm quite pleased this is noticeable. You've probably also noticed the publication of these ""infomercials"" with the first wave concerning the ""Art of Spray"" and you will very soon see the second wave on the Protection and distribution of fragile formulas. All this gives you a chance to see our desire to express ourselves on cross-cutting topics concerning issues our clients are very much aware of. Not to mention the systematic release, upon agreement of our clients, of communiqués on our achievements. We have also started attending trade shows, the next one being MakeUp in Paris."
"Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics: ""We are trend forecasters and advisors for pencils""","Premium Beauty News - Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics has become a major player in the Beauty industry worldwide. Barbara Bauer-Kropf - Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics is market leader in volume and revenue (with a global market share of 40 %) for cosmetic pencils and produces around 400 million units globally.

Barbara Bauer-Kropf - The Schwan-STABILO group is a family-owned company with a long history. Founded in 1855, the company is now run by its fifth generation. With the first eyebrow pencil in 1927 - in the beginning surgical marker pens, the company's expertise in writing instruments was applied to a completely new sector – cosmetics. Since then, innovative developments from Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics have consistently had an impact on the industry, for example the direct moulding process.

Barbara Bauer-Kropf - We can easily be in Paris within an hour! Our sales team consists of only native speakers that can be at the customer's office the next day and actually travel to Paris every other week.

Linhardt ready for the battle,"Two new Managing Directors, Monika Kopra-Schäfer since 2005, and Christian Schubert, are the successors in office, since 2009, to Walter Schlicht who retired in February 2010. The company has reorganized itself around three poles, ""Cosmetics"" with Hans Eckhardt, ""Pharmacy"" with Sebastian Bumm and ""Food / Non Food"" with August Wanninger since 2008. At production level was also established the ""TPM and Team Work"" concepts which involve all the actors taking part into in production from one end of the line to the other... Finally more than ever, emphasis is placed on international development and innovation. The company is strengthening its commitment in Egypt which goes back to 2007 with its local business partner (New Hover) and is also stepping up its efforts in France with the appointment, in 2009, of Philippe Rudowski to head Linhardt France. As to the ""innovation"" approach, it is paying off! In 2009, Linhardt launched its famous ""Multiflex"" tube, which was singled out the same year at the German Packaging Awards and the World Star Awards, and currently, it's the release of the ""Orikuka"" tube, fitted with a clever protective and tamper-evident system, without forgetting the ""Dispenser Tube"", and more recently, the ""MedicPen"". ""It's true, we convey mostly a pharma image"", admits Monika Kopra-Schäfer, Managing Director, ""while in fact, in percentage of sales, cosmetic products are in the lead with 41%!"" An image pertaining of course to the company's history. ""One must remember that more than half of all aluminium tubes used for pharmaceutical purposes in Germany come from our factories,"" she says. A pharma image anyway, which can only be a plus to reassure clients coming from the beauty sector, especially since the quality and cleanliness criteria are becoming more and more identical. But Linhardt is also operating in the Food industry (26% of turnover) and on the very specific segment of rigid aluminum ""cigars tubos"". A niche market which is part of the production of aluminum ""rigid containers"", workshops that managers have dynamized even more by developing a new aerosol can of a diameter of 45 through the implementation of a new production line capable of producing some 200 pieces per minute. ""It's one of the first thing we got down to"", explains Monika Kopra-Schäfer. ""It was absolutely necessary to reorganize both, production and sales to be more in tune with the evolution of our customer market."" No sooner said than done… Each of the three plants became, for the first one in Viechtach, a competence centre for transforming aluminium products, the second one in Hambrücken, a competence centre for plastic and the third one in Pausa, also a aluminium competence centre. Then came the implementation of the ""TPM and Team Work ""concepts to improve productivity, where a team working on a line is responsible for the entire line. In addition, sales teams are divided into three poles, Cosmetics, Pharmaceuticals & Food / Non-Food. ""It obviously a matter of hearing and understand what the market wants,"" insists Monika Kopra-Schäfer. Finally, the entire company is directing its efforts toward innovation. One of the high points of these efforts was the development and marketing in 2009 of the ""Multiflex tube"" which allows, through its technical design, to cover the famous weld seam running conspicuously along the tube, hence providing 360° printing possibilities. The current production line is capable of producing about 30 million of them per year. Over the months, Linhardt's development teams have successively developed the ""Dispenser Tube"" in partnership with the Rexam Group (including a Multiflex version to be released in the coming weeks), then it's the roll out of the ""Orikuka"" new tube with its an ingenious protection and tamper evident device integrated to the sealed ring and cap, making it very easy to open with a simple twist of the cap. A product that will also soon be used by the cosmetic industry. Finally the MedicPen is already developed. ""It's a clever combination of an ancient technology mastered by Linhardt (that of felt markers),"" explains Monika Kopra-Schäfer, ""which enables us to propose a particularly efficient applicator for sophisticated medical products and with all the more reason for cosmetic products"". With an expected turnover of EUR100 million in 2010, with a workforce of 1,000 people and a production capacity of 550 million pa of aluminum tubes, 180 million pa of rigid cans, 210 million pa of plastic tubes and 30 million pa of Multiflex pipes, the German firm intends to remain among the front runners of leading European producers in aluminum and plastic flexible tubes. ""To achieve this, we spend about 11 million euros per year in the production tool (approx. 10% of turnover). We also firmly believe that workforce sustainability is a strong asset we are very proud to maintain with on average, a ratio of 10% of our workforce on apprenticeship,"" she says. As for the pharma, image it will probably be less and less corresponding to the reality of Linhardt's evolution. The cosmetics industry already representing 41% of sales, with an expected growth this year of 8%. ""This is another reason why we want and we must be more present in France"", she says, ""our activity in this country only accounting for 8% of sales. Our new Multiflex tube should help us."""
Piramal Glass creates a European subsidiary,"The Indian glassmaker announces the creation this month of Piramal Glass Europe, which will be headed by Mr. Sandeep Arora. The company will be headquartered in France, 16 rue Paul Bignon in the town of Eu (in Normandy, department of Seine-Maritime), at the very heart of the so-called ""glass vallée"", a cluster of companies specialising in the production of luxury glass bottles. Dominique Bonhomme will be in charge of Sales/Marketing and Development and Emilie Crusel of the logistics. An important milestone for the Indian glassmaker whose Director General, Mr. Vijay Shah, was announcing last January that "" perfumery and cosmetics already accounting for 39% of Piramal Glass' activity would reach 55% by 2013 ""."
Schmidt & Niedermeier becomes Sun Creative Cosmetics,"The new foundation was officially done on 1st March 2010. For the manager of Rusi Cosmetic Packaging, Klaus Sindel, this recovery is consistent with a business combination of two complementary activities. Indeed, Schmidt & Niedermeier's activity is centred at about 80% on the production of upscale lipstick tubes with a very low activity in other segments like mascara, lip gloss and eyeliner. And, precisely, the core business of Rusi Cosmetic Packaging is largely focused on these other products including 70% for mascara. ""Which means that together,"" says Omar Rizk, the new Sales Director, ""we're probably among those in Europe who can offer the widest range of possibilities for metal / plastic processing in these segments."" First step for the buyers of Schmidt & Niedermeier, to change the name and to continue the company's business (which had never stopped) by directing, according to them, its activity towards what it does best, namely the production of upscale metal-based or lacquered lipstick tubes. ""For the name, we already have the answer"", says Omar Rizk. ""We will now call ourselves, Sun Creative Cosmetics. As for the plant itself and its production tool, we are currently reviewing thoroughly the subject, getting rid of the obsolete equipment to keep only the top machines, be it, press transfers, injection machines or the equipment in the workshop dedicated to surface treatments or decoration"". Of the 90 people which were employed for a turnover of € 2,4 million achieved last year, only 30 people remain today with the aim of reaching € 3 million in 2010. ""We are sure"", says Omar Rizk ""that Sun Creative Cosmetics is resuming its activities just at the right time in a European market who wants to be able to rely on a real industrial know-how, close to clients, in upscale transformation of metal for the manufacture of lip sticks tubes"". The new managers at Sun Creative Cosmetics have built a five-year plan to reach the goals they have set. ""The first of these goals"", we are told at Nuremberg, ""is to be profitable at the end of 2011""."
"Intercos: formulation, nothing but formulation","""We will very quickly obliterate 2009 even if in the end concerning Intercos, we don't have much to complain about. Our global strategy for a presence in Europe, the United States and Asia has paid off. There is a possibility for some thirty groups operating in the Beauty sector to become one day or the other one of our customers. We already supply twenty six of them. And this is no coincidence. We bring them, innovation, mastery and powerful production output, a priceless presence on their main fields of operation worldwide. And I can already tell you that fairly quickly, we will surely be industrially operating in Brazil,"" says Dario Ferrari, Intercos' CEO. ""As for 2010"", he underlines, ""we are certainly not expecting any miracles. It will just be an average year for our profession"". According to Dario Ferrari it's a perfect time to keep up with standards and the new showroom set up, like every year by the teams at the headquarters of Intercos in Agrate Brianza, near Milan, is an perfect illustration. "" Our core business"", Dario Ferrari insists, ""is and will always be research, development and production of innovative, surprising and original formulas, with in particular many special effects. This is what we are emphasizing on this year. Regarding packaging, we present solutions to our customers and it is up to them to decide "". The tone is set upon entry of the showroom! A huge fresco made of dozens of empty tumblers adorns the first welcome sign, followed a few yards further by another panel studded with clear plastic bags filled with colored powders ... A good way of reminding people who might have forgotten it that Intercos is first and foremost a fantastic machine to design formulas for make-up and skincare. And the visit we are about to begin, through a wonderful maze at the very heart of the fantastic world of color, touch and beauty, will leave us, strictly speaking, ""speechless""! ""We have established projections for 2011-2012"", explains Arabella Ferrari, Marketing Director Business Unit Colour ""based on current market and consumer trends to give women today, what they desire for tomorrow. And we propose that for women all over the world. It's a true technological revolution based on real scientific breakthroughs that must provoke new emotion, enticing the senses and visibly enhancing skin surfaces, the whole with levels of performance never-reached before and in an unequalled world of light and colour"". – First collection showcased at Intercos' premises in Milano: Skin Awakening . A highly efficient collection designed to wake up face, eyes and lips. The goal is to give the skin a new appearance through light.

Colours won't fade or set into fine lines, keeping a just applied finish at all times. ""Furthermore"", continues Arabella Ferrari ""the design and performance of each product has been subject to a 360 degrees evaluation. This universal search for beauty has resulted in the most diverse cosmetic range ever designed. Products' characteristics in colour and performance meet the requests of each geographical market. We have categorized formulas according to the major regions, ensuring ease in selecting and identifying the perfect product for the target consumer"". Formulas for Europe Thus, for the European market, teams at Intercos worked on a large variety of concepts for the face: – the Ideal Skin concept for an impeccable finish and an extended comfort – Bronzing Dream to dream of the sun all year round, with a healthy sun-kissed and polished complexion. – Naked Perfection , best breathable formulas ensuring imperceptible and weightless colour for flawless, perfected results. – Virtual Definition to obtain a radiant, satin-luminous and ultra smooth skin.

""Classics have never been so strong,"" explains Arabella Ferrari about this segment – Lip Renew , a moisturizing formula combining care, colour, beauty and sophistication – Live Shine a translucent colour and pure shine offering long lasting comfort and reflective finishes. For eyes: Lash Protagonist , for longer, fuller lashes, twisted and intense, color fantasy, a graphic, sophisticated and elegant line, and Eye Pearls , a vast interpretation of light with the twinkling reflections and metallic effects. Thus Intercos adapted its ranges to different regions, with for exemple, for the the face of North American a Virtual Skin for an advanced flawless finish and undetectable, skin refining light effect. And for the lips, Rouge Warrior for brilliant and true colour shades hour after hour. For Asian faces, Intercos proposes Angel Skin , with a strong care attributes (pure whitening and elevated sun protection), for a flawless, lightened and brighter skin, etc. ""Quite obviously"", insists Arabella Ferrari, ""we are driven by our belief and commitment in safe and sustainable products.

Stölzle-Oberglas: an offensive strategy!,"Stölzle-Oberglas' growing ambitions in the perfumery and cosmetics sector are nothing new… ""It's true"", explains Johannes Schick, CEO. ""But if we took our time is was mostly to upgrade our production tool. And, as you know, our industry is a heavy industry. We therefore undertook to reorganize our production tools in dedicated and well adapted sites taking advantage of a glass factory in Poland, bought in 2001 and, of course, of the other glass factory we acquired in England at Knottingley near Leeds. Today our tools dedicated to beauty are divided between Poland (1/3) and England (2/3) for automatic manufacturing but also Austria with semi-automatic processes in our Baernbach plant and, of course, always our site for nail polishes and cosmetics at Koeflach"". ""But above all"", insists Johannes Schick ""we had to reinforce our technical and commercial organization to share a Group-like offensive spirit and be as competitive as possible in the targeted perfumery and cosmetics segment, ie, masstige"". In addition to the three furnaces of 100 tons/day to 140 tons/day and the twelve production lines, the Austrian glassmaker also runs two finishing workshops in England and Poland where a lot of money was invested in recent months. ""Overall"", says Johannes Schick, ""and if you also sum up all the other investments carried out for furnaces, manufacturing equipment, cold ends and decoration workshops, our effort can be estimated at 40 million euros"". The Prestige & Beauty division will achieve this year a turnover of 70 million Euros on a total sales figure of 150 millions, including pharmaceutical activities. ""To achieve this, we can rely on five strong points"", underlines Johannes Schick: ""the fact that we are fully integrated from mold manufacturing to finishes, with over 150 people fully involved in all types of finishing techniques, a fully upgraded production tool; our ability for fast decision making; the fact we belong to a financially solid private Group and also the fact that we can offer other packaging opportunities given the strong position of the Group and of its owner, Dr. Cornelius Grupp, in the production of aerosols and flexible tubes"".

Linea Glam and Chirine International: a common strategy in Europe,"The Linea- Chirine duo has already begun to operate. Mauro Zulianello and Christian Chirinian, the two managers know each other well and have shared the same stand at Cosmoprof Bologna. Main field of action, plastic packaging in all its forms with, as a strong point, exclusive marketing of products manufactured by the South Korean company, Hana, mainly specialized in Airless and Airtight containers. The firm based in Seoul (15 million dollars in turnover, 120 people) decided, at the instigation of Linea Glam created late 2009 by Mauro Zulianello, to intensify its marketing strategy on the old continent where it was virtually absent. ""What is important"" says Mauro Zulianello, ""is Hana's capability for R & D. Its managers invest each year nearly 20% of the turnover. Innovation is everywhere. "" ""While simple in appearance, the level of technicality is nonetheless very high in Hana's product range"", says Christian Chirinian. Latest innovative product to date, the Dual Airless Dispenser, a particularly clever airless system with a dual compartment insuring an excellent restitution of two blended products. In fact, it's a simple but yet very clever mechanism allowing the delivery in identical quantities of two opposite products in terms of viscosity. ""Our assets also lie in the level of customization of our products, thanks to a complete integration of all decorating, galvanizing and coloring processes"", explains Mickey Moon, Commercial Director at Hana Co., ""in airless but also lipsticks or compacts""."
LR Health & Beauty Systems reassert its double-digit growth target,"Premium Beauty News - How do you explain your success in such a difficult economic climate? Tilo Plöger - The core businesses of LR are dietary supplements and cosmetics. In these segments LR presents itself as a retailer and a brand manufacturer with a great number of labels. In contrast to the classic trade business we don't see any growth limits. We define five factors of success. – First of all our product portfolio paired with the quality reputation of Made in Germany goods. We are the only network-company, which manufactures mostly all products in Germany and also our major suppliers are located here. – Secondly our portfolio international celebrities. We work closely with prominent people, we integrate them in our marketing concepts and they become an important part of it. LR and Coty are definitely the two companies which have the most celebrities under contract, especially in the range of perfumes. – Thirdly our marketing and commission plan. We cooperate with 300,000 partners, whom are paid by our incentive system. This incentive programme sets standards in the industry, and year by year we are able to motivate many new partners to get into the act and stick to it. – The fourth factor of success is our unique automobile concept, as a part of our incentive programme. Today, we have over 4,000 Volkswagen (Polo) and many hundreds of Mercedes Benz on the roads, and we could introduce Porsche in addition last year. Our car policy is a further point of successful implementation of the main principle Made in Germany that leads to an intense solidarity between our partners and LR. – Last but not least our sophisticated service and education concept. The training of our partners is a top priority and one of the important factors of success, too. Premium Beauty News - What have been your more prominent product innovations over the past 2 years ? Tilo Plöger - We operate as a brand manufacturer and concentrate on innovations and re-launches under the umbrella of our standard brands. Of course we continuously adapt and reposition our concepts in order to be better than the market benchmark. First of all, let's mention the launch of our new line of decorative cosmetics over the past two years. We expect to sell 10,000 to 15,000 units to our partners, this would turn LR into the largest retailer of decorative cosmetics in Europe. Additionally, we have developed an all new perfume concept, not only on the qualitative scientific side in regard to a better scent adherence but also we can allocate scents to certain skin typologies and offer each costumer their optimal and tailor-made perfume. Within the scope of our celebrity concept we have developed a high selective anti age skincare range of products for men with Marcus Schenkenberg. Also, I want to note our Aloe Vera product innovations in the dietary supplement segment - a growth market par excellence. In the coming weeks we will launch novel probiotic dietary supplements (two patents) with support of high reputed and internationally known Prof. Dr. Clancy. Furthermore, we have redesigned the whole dietary segment (concepts and formulations). Premium Beauty News - How does an increased ecological awareness and health consciousness impact your strategy? Tilo Plöger - Our core business is health and beauty from the in- and outside, and that's why for us an increased ecological awareness and health consciousness is essential. We benefit from our ability to quickly readjust and optimize products very promptly. Within 18 months we remove parabens and mineral oils from all our products. Without time delay we formulate and bottle our perfumes according to the latest IFRA-guidelines. Moreover, we accomplish very strict safety assessments and tests to exclude possible cutaneous reactions and allergies. Health concerns and harmlessness of our products are our key priorities prior to ecological awareness. We recently begun to focus on improving the sustainability of our packaging. In this matter, there are different opinions about what's environment-friendly and what's not. Our distribution channels allow us to go almost completely without secondary packaging. Watching packaging trends closely, we differentiate on price segments. Relating to the higher price segment we can specifically work on themes like biological degradability, carbon footprint and so on. Premium Beauty News - What about LR in France? Tilo Plöger - With more than 25 % of growth in 2009, LR in France becomes a major actor of the direct selling industry. With new ranges of colour cosmetics and make-up, LR completely matches to the expectation of the French customer and French trend; for instance with the new men skincare range, ""M. Schenkenberg"". France stays the country of fashion and beauty. LR is well positioning, offering as for perfume or for cosmetic middle range products but also high range products. Those can be really compared to high range products sold in the French market from high fashion houses. On the other side, the natural aspect of the product is more and more important for the French consumer today; certainly with few years late compared to Germany. This is in fact a real advantage for LR in France, because we can immediately offer high quality natural and health care products. Here we can take profit of the 25 years of experience and success of LR in Germany. In the next five years, LR in France will become a real reference in the direct selling industry. Premium Beauty News - Please, give us an economic prospect. What do you expect from LR the upcoming 2-3 years. Tilo Plöger - Today, we operate in about 30 countries worldwide and it is assumed that we develop one new country annually. We can anticipate - compared to our positioning in the competitive environment - a respectable two-digit growth in sales yearly. We achieved a 20 to 25 % growth the past months and expect a comparably growth rate in the future. Those challenging targets are supported by a full pipeline of innovations until the end of 2011. Additionally, we will expand existing product groups. As said before, we don't see any growth limits. Mainly in the dietary supplement segment the needs of customers will continue to rise to buy well explained alternatives to classic pharmaceutical health care products. Our distribution channels guarantee and include detailed explanations of our products. This service can't be fulfilled by the classic trade business. Furthermore we think about to get in new branches of businesses which fit in LR."
Global fragrance industry reorganizes its network of associations,"Once the reorganization is complete there will be four Regional bodies under the one global IFRA brand covering North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. These four Regions will be represented on the IFRA Board as Association Members and have voting rights divided according to their respective market share. The rest of the votes will be split among companies that are currently IFRA members (Firmenich, Givaudan, IFF, Robertet, Symrise and Takasago International). As a consequence of this reorganization, national associations wishing to join will no longer have to pay dues to IFRA. The key obligation for membership will be to comply with the IFRA Code of Practice and in particular the IFRA Standards. On the other hand, they will no longer receive funds from IFRA's member companies, who will now only fund national associations through an IFRA's central funding mechanism for projects with global implications. ""Globally the fragrance industry invests approximately USD 14 million per year across its research and association network. This realignment will concentrate resources enabling a more effective response to the growing societal, regulatory and scientific issues being faced by the modern fragrance industry,"" said IFRA in a release. As part of the restructuring the European Flavour & Fragrance Association (EFFA) will concentrate exclusively on flavours. The eight European national associations [1] have now joined IFRA as Association Members. Meanwhile the Fragrance Materials Association of the United States, better known as FMA, has formally agreed to begin doing business as IFRA North America. The next phase of the reorganization will be for the Latin American and Asia-Pacific members to formally establish their two Regional Committees completing the global branding of the regional bodies under the IFRA name and logo. ""Rebranding our global association network under the IFRA name and logo will help us communicate more consistently the core values of IFRA worldwide,"" said Jean-Pierre Houri, IFRA Director General."
Chromavis to acquire 100% of Durlin,"Chromavis, a world's leading operator of B2B cosmetics and its management team are about to buy 100% of Durlin France, worldwide leader in the development and production of nail polishes and products, from Bergerac NC, a subsidiary of the French state-owned company SNPE. The agreement was signed in Paris on April13th, 2010. Chromavis, which is headquartered in Milan's urban area, was founded in 2008 from the merging of Clavis and Gamma Croma. As far as it is concerned, Durlin France holds 56% of Durlin East Europe (headquartered in Poland) and 49% of Durlin Asia (headquartered in Thailand). The company boasts about 17 millions euros at consolidated level. The plants are located in the Bergerac area (South West of France), in Ciechanòw (Poland), and in Bangkok (Thaïland). Durlin supplies the major actors and the more prestigious brands of the cosmetics industry. ""With this acquisition, Chromavis consolidates its presence in the reference market, reaching an overall turnover foreseen for 2010 of over 85 million Euros, with an Ebitda [1] of about 15 million Euros,"" said the company in a release. Through this transaction Chromavis is completing its range of products to cover a wider area of the cosmetics sector. According to Bernard Msellati, Chromavis' CEO, the acquisition of Durlin confirms the company's strategy to strengthen its international presence. The closing of the operation is forecasted on June 4th, 2010"
Geka carries on innovation strategy,"Premium Beauty News - What about the year 2009 for Geka? The Did the year 2010 begin in a better way? Franco Luca - 2009 went very well. Geka had a better performance compared to the market. Geka's market share increased around 3 percent. We did very well in Central Europe and the USA. Our company's philosophy is not to publish any figures. I can only say that in the first quarter of 2010 we achieved our targets. We are seeing again a positive trend on the market right now. Maybe the market is recovering. Premium Beauty News - What are the main events for Geka this year in terms of investments? Franco Luca - End of 2009 we invested in a new silk screening equipment. This year we will further invest in our factory in Elgin, USA to increase our capacities. Also we are investing in a lot of new products which we will present in Bologna. We are investing in labor equipment to give better consultancy and service. We want to further expand our competence in other applications than mascara. In particular in surface treatment with a new technology that enables customers to differentiate themselves and their products with the same tool at very low investment costs. Premium Beauty News - At Cosmoprof Bologna, you are going to present two new products. Franco Luca - This is true. First, the new SupremeRUBY, with clean lines, transparent material, and a practical form. It has all the characteristics of a true classic. The quality is further enhanced by the extra thick walls of the injection-moulded bottle. The 8 ml bottle is ideal for a wide variety of cosmetic formulations, mascara or lip gloss. As part of the RUBY Block Building family, the cap can be paired with the different Geka Style applicators in practically any desired combination. Premium Beauty News - And also the brand new DefinitionLINER… Franco Luca - A steady hand, some practice and the right applicator - that's what it takes to apply eyeliner with perfection. But while nylon applicators guarantee precision, they often feel too hard on sensitive lids. Alternatively, brush applicators are soft, but using them requires some real skill. That's why Geka created DefinitionLINER. This flocked eyeliner applicator combines the advantages of both types: soft as a brush, yet as precise as a nylon applicator, they are generally easier to use, easy to control and easy to guide. Thus, DefinitionLINER is a two-in-one applicator for pros and pros-to-be: by handling the applicator differently, users can adjust the line thickness precisely."
INCA: the philosophy of a fully integrated company,"Premium Beauty News - You are a very old Italian company that very early integrated the concept of full service. Currently, how are you industrially structured? Sergio Faverio - The Company was established in the late 40's in the small village of PortoValtravaglia, North-Western Italy, in the beautiful area of Lake Maggiore, next to the Swiss border of Lugano. Since the very beginning, INCA grew working on the ability to manufacture cosmetics and packaging, updating its know-how together with technologies and materials. Nowadays, INCA has developed its activity on three sites: the headquarter and the main production site are in PortoValtravaglia and it includes INCA Packaging company, specialized in the design and production of aluminum and plastic packaging, and INCA Cosmetici specialized in the production and filling of color cosmetics. There is also the French based company, Capinter, near Nantes, specialized in the production of aluminum components. Overall we can rely on over 25.000 m2 of manufacturing area, a team of over 200 people and a turnover of about 25 million euros. And yes, you are right, one of the very unique characteristic of the group is that INCA is a fully integrated company who owns in-house the majority of all the variety of production processes nowadays available in the business. This gives us a very unique knowledge and expertise. Premium Beauty News - What have been industrially speaking, the Group's major developments during the last few years? Sergio Faverio - In the past two years INCA has focused its efforts in improving the efficiency and the rationalization of its production facilities. At the same time, both packaging and cosmetic departments, introduced new and updated production and managing processes. In addition, we improved our ability to engineer new developments in both plastic and metal processes focusing on new metal forming and plastic stamping processes, together with the use of all the most up to date materials, finishing treatments and assembly technologies. All this can be clearly identified with some of our latest developments. Some of them are already available on the market and others are currently in progress and will be launched later on this year. On the other hand and on the side of what just mentioned, following the same path, we are also installing a small production site in India, proud to be supported on this new project by a prestigious local player. The Color Cosmetic division follows the same general directions and philosophy of the Group. Lately, our ability has increased – due also to the strong demand – in the way we support the developments and the management of full-service projects meant for different business areas, from the small niches to the mass markets and private labels. Premium Beauty News - You mainly operate on European markets? Sergio Faverio - Our turnover is concentrated 50% in Italy and 50% spread between France, the rest of Europe and the USA.

We are very proud of the trust and confidence our clients give us. This push INCA to a continuous search for improvement, targeting quality, efficiency and customer service, always investing in innovation. Premium Beauty News - A few words on the strong points of your company in terms of new products, and about your presence at Cosmoprof Bologna! Sergio Faverio - For sure we can proudly say that we are among the best quality players in the aluminum and plastic manufacturing on the market. Having a look at our collection of customized products, the customer can understand that passion, know-how and experience are supporting us in realizing so many different articles and finishes. We are able to satisfy the latest trends of the market by developing, for example, a trendy violet surlyn cap or a wild gold lipstick case or an elegant single-block aluminum shoulder always aiming to the best quality and to a perfect functionality. Overall, we can offer such a wide range of purchasing options , from a simple collar to a perfume cap, from an empty lipstick package to a complete make-up line including bulks-formulation and filling, for market's niches or start-ups, for mid and high-end or masstige brands and private labels. The Cosmoprof in Bologna will be a fantastic opportunity to present the INCA group and to show our latest developments."
Ancorotti Cosmetics is accelerating,"Premium Beauty News - Just a short flashback. The adventure starts in May 2009. Renato Ancorotti - It only took a few weeks to change an ordinary building situated in one of the industrial estates of Crema (Italy) to a unit at the cutting edge of technology for the mascara manufacturer. Everything went very fast thanks, of course, to our experience, but mostly to our customers confidence. May I remind you that the plant is located on a site covering 3000 m2, including 2600 m2 dedicated to production and the remaining 400 m2 serving a laboratory and sales and marketing offices. From the start, Enrica and I had anticipated our progression! And we were right! Because in spite of the crisis, Ancorotti Cosmetics nonetheless managed to make more than one million euros in turnover for mascara during the first six months, and since the beginning of 2010, our orders recorded a sharp increase and we are expecting to make nearly five million euros in turnover. Premium Beauty News - Such a progression requires equipment! Renato Ancorotti - Indeed. And here, we have what it takes. Currently our production capacity is of 1400 kg per day (140 000 pieces per day and the implementation of 5 machines) which will reach next June 1900 kg per day (190 000 pieces per day and 6 machines). And when I say ""day"", I mean ""8 hours"" production which leaves us, as you can imagine, a consistent margin of progression. And we have already planned to double our production capacity within two years with 3800 kg per day: a strike force of not less than 12 machines. The whole plant has been designed from the outset, to absorb future capacity increases. We are also currently installing on our biggest production machines an automatic system for charging raw material; this sophisticated equipment, working in a close loop, composed of carbon steel or stainless steel pipes will be operational next June. We also bought a latest generation new automatic filling line for mascaras and other liquid products which can make particularly sophisticated designs and patterns in two colors in the same container which is provoking genuine enthusiasm from our customers. Outputs for this machine are also quite impressive since it can produce on manual charge, over 24000 pieces daily in one color (i.e. 50 pieces per minute) and 5000 bicolor pieces daily and when on automatic charge and for a single color, performances are increased to 38000 pieces daily (80 parts per minute). Last but not the least, an assembly machine multi pack (5000 pieces) and a labelling machine (8000 to 12000 pieces depending on sizes). Premium Beauty News - In the coming months and more particularly at Cosmoprof Bologna and MakeUp in Paris, what novelties do you plan unveiling? Enrica Ancorotti - We would like to save the surprise for our customers for these two events, knowing that we'll introduce new textures and new finishes derived from new technologies."
Shiseido taps into professional hair market in China,"Shiseido is commencing sales of professional hair products in Shanghai and Beijing via its wholly owned subsidiary, Shiseido China Co. The Japanese cosmetics giant is proposing two brands to China's hair salons: the Shiseido Professional brand, which is currently marketed by Shiseido in Japan, Asia and Oceania; and the Joico brand, which is marketed by Shiseido's wholly owned subsidiary, Zotos International, in the United States. Shiseido is aiming for approximately 700 hair salons for these products in the two cities of Shanghai and Beijing by the end of 2010 and plans to expand to 2,500 hair salons by 2014. Shiseido is considering the professional business as the second pillar of its growth in China, after cosmetics. The company - which aims to increase its international operations to 50% of its turnover by 2017, against 35% currently - wants to become ""a global player representing Asia with its origins in Japan. China is obviously a key marketplace for the success of this strategy, and Shiseido is working to strengthen its China business by targeting an average annual growth rate of 20%. The cosmetics market in China is anticipated to reach about 200 million cosmetics users in 2015, from 100 million in 2010. Needs are expected to increase simultaneously, further accompanying the desire to make oneself look more beautiful in all aspects from skincare and makeup to hairstyles. Earlier in March, Shiseido has launched its new DQ brand in drugstores in China as a ""third sales channels"" after department stores and cosmetics specialty stores and is aiming 600 outlets for the brand in 2010. Shiseido now intends to tap into professional hair segment and to establish a solid presence in high-end and luxury hair salons. The Japanese company will promote its research on Asian hair and also intends to disseminate information of hairstyle trends originating from Tokyo and as well as training programs for hair stylists. The professional segment accounted for 7% of Shiseido's overall sales in Japan and overseas in the fiscal year ended March 2009, which is second in size after the cosmetics business. According to Shiseido, the market for professional hair products in China was estimated to JPY 90 billion (EUR 725 million / USD 972 million) in 2007 with one million salons, and the segment is maintaining an average annual sales growth of 10%, which is roughly on par with the cosmetics market. Shiseido claims to place emphasis on the steady development of brands rather than on rapid salon expansion. In order to providing training and educational programs to hair stylists, the company has established Shiseido Beauty Studios in Shanghai and Beijing in November 2009. The studios offer Shiseido's original hair stylist training program, including education on hair-related theories and a follow-up of basic techniques, while also aiming to strengthen hairstyle proposal capabilities as well as to develop the spirit of Japanese omotenashi (hospitality)."
G. Pivaudran signs the packaging of Hermès' latest fragrance,"Premium Beauty News - We will soon be able to count European metal converters of the Beauty industry on the fingers of one hand? Marc Pivaudran - It is true that crisis has done deep damage, probably irreversible for some of us. We've had our share but we are pulling out of it. This drop of almost 50% between 2008 and 2009 was unimaginable. As you know, we had to reduced our workforce to 180 people on two production sites in Souillac (stamping and surface treatment/assembly) while keeping our expertise. The U.S. market has been in the past a tremendous powerhouse for the development of G. Pivaudran representing up to 50% of our activity (30% today!), but the crisis on the continent has obviously impacted us more than others. Premium Beauty News - Is crisis the only factor responsible this drop in the metal industry concerning beauty packaging? Marc Pivaudran - No, of course. It is clear that we have been subject as everyone else, for several years, to a slow but increasing erosion of our margins under the pressure of a customer market always demanding better price conditions. Asian competitor are obviously not helping us. And our industry is always asking for more investment and technology. Transfer presses, and with all the more reason, the lines for surface treatment are expensive and quality has a price. And in any case, must be paid for! Not to mention the compulsory investment in terms of environment which led us for example to equip ourselves, early 2009, with a machine capable of achieving double anodizing treatments in optimum environmental conditions. Premium Beauty News - A fine example of quality product that design for Hermes is! Marc Pivaudran - Quite true, a fine example! May I remind you that it is a glass bottle dressed with a very thick metal stirrup. To achieve this We had to push aluminum to its very limits during the press forming process, but also adapt and develop associated surface treatments which are polishing and anodizing. This beautiful object is a true novelty, in terms of design but also by the gestural, and we are extremely proud to be associated to it with our partner IPack. Premium Beauty News - Is metal still in fashion? Marc Pivaudran - If you have a look into our order book for the months to come, undoubtedly yes! I think our growth this year will be over 30% and we have a number of new projects. This restart is accompanied with the arrival of a Director of Operations and Continuous Improvement, who took office mid-March. I must also say that our ""innovation"" process has never slowed down and we have some concrete things to offer our customers who are of course very eager to take advantage of. By the end of the year, we will be able to show some of these leads, especially for surface treatments and new technologies for material deformation."
Regi: a new factory in august 2010,"According to Vittoria Cicchetti, CEO of Regi International, whose turnover has seen since 4 years a 20 to 30% constant yearly growth, building a new factory ""is another vital step in the development of Regi in order to meet increasingly growing customer demand."" The yet recent current plant, that produces bulk and which also includes the R& D laboratory and offices, and another factory near Crema for conditioning and powder compaction, are already not sufficient to meet demand. Furthermore, the operation will enable the firm to group all its activities on a single location. Especially as the ""full service"" activity is in constant growth and requires the installation of new complete lines. Founded in 1994 by Vittoria Cicchetti herself, the firm has developed soberly in recent years. ""An option which is no longer a requirement today, she says, insofar as we have consolidated our bases and as our products are unanimously acknowledged by a large number of European customers, particularly in Germany and Northern Europe, but also by American customers. France remains a young market, the last to have been approached, but where there is an undeniable interest for our products and a strong development potential"". ""Some of our products have also won several awards in Europe over the last 4 years, which encourages us to constantly develop new ideas and formulas. Passion for our work leads us more than ever to constantly develop our business, relying on our know-how and keeping our standards of creativity, versatility and responsiveness which are for us the appropriate answer to meet market needs and therefore a foundation for a strong partnership with our customers,"" she adds. On the occasion of the Cosmoprof tradeshow in Bologna, Italy, the company which distinguished itself, by being the first to launch on the market mascaras with scientifically acknowledged eyelashe lengthening properties, will present a brand new collection, Antidote, ""a genuine beauty prescription, with the help of which to look beautiful also means to feel fine""."
Estée Lauder launches Origins in China to fuel growth,"US cosmetics giant, Estée Lauder, has selected the Parkson Department Store in Shanghai to launch the Origins brand in the People's Republic of China. The cosmetics maker expects to open four more doors in Shanghai and Beijing by June 30, 2010. Origins is a plant-based line of skin care, makeup and aromatherapy products, which was introduced by The Estée Lauder Companies in 1990 as a high-performance natural skin care, powered by nature and proven by science. Origins' products are formulated with plants, natural and organic ingredients and 100 percent natural essential oils. According to the company, the Origins' natural background should match with current expectations of Chinese consumers. ""Chinese consumers are passionate about skin care and natural ingredients, so Origins will be very relevant to this market,"" Carol Shen, General Manager of The Estée Lauder Companies in China, said. ""In fact, the main ingredient in one of Origins most popular anti-aging collections, called 'A Perfect World,' is White Tea, an extremely potent antioxidant which comes from the mountains of the Fujian Province in southeast China."" ""China is strategically important for our company and we expect that Origins will help fuel our continued expansion here,"" commented William P. Lauder, Executive Chairman of The Estée Lauder Companies, who was one of the founders of the Origins' brand. Estée Lauder first entered China in 1993 and in 2005, the group opened a research and development centre in Shanghai. China is one of Estée Lauder's fastest growing markets. In fiscal year 2009, the company's sales in China grew nearly 30 percent. It is believed that in the next decade, China's beauty market could rival the size of the market in the United States. Other Estée Lauder Companies' brands sold in China are Estée Lauder, Clinique, La Mer, MAC, Bobbi Brown, Aramis and the licensed brands Tommy Hilfiger and Donna Karan. The products are sold in upscale department stores and perfumeries in 33 major Chinese cities. The company has also launched e-commerce sites in China for Clinique, Estée Lauder and La Mer. On the occasion of its debuts in China, Origins has partnered with ""Million Forest,"" a reforestation project organized by The Climate Group, United Nations Environment Programme and China Green Foundation, to help preserve the trees and habitats of the Gansu Province. Origins will plant a tree for every product purchased in China through June 30, 2010, from its ""A Perfect World"" and ""Make a Difference"" collections. The launch of Origins in China was also commemorated by a symbolic tree planting near the Origins counter inside the Parkson Department Store in Shanghai."
Bormioli Luigi: the end of the tunnel,"Premium Beauty News - At last! The crisis is behind us! Felice Nardiello - Not so sure! Anyway, we couldn't fall any lower! As for 2009, Luigi Bormioli ends up the year with sales down 20% compared to the previous year. Which is a lesser evil compared to other sectors which have experienced worse situations. You know that we rely on three areas: glass bottles, tableware and more recently, carafes for spirits. In fact, it's just as if we had gone back to the 2006 turnover. Imagine the shock! Premium Beauty News - What about the beginning of 2010? Felice Nardiello - Better, of course! Much better! But we must remain cautious. The proper indicator being however the number of new tools currently being produced. In good years we produce approximately 150 yearly. Last year, we only produced 80. Since the beginning of this year, we have 110 under way. At the height of the crisis, we had stopped two ovens. One was restarted in September. For the other one, if the recovery trend is confirmed, it should be operational again by the end of this year. We expect an increase in our turnover of 15% to 20% in 2010. Premium Beauty News - What made it possible for you to resist? Felice Nardiello - Several things. On the one hand our flexibility and our ability to respond quickly to market demands. On the other hand, our brand new plant in Milan the production tool of which turned out to be very well adapted to the constraints of crisis in terms of cost prices. The fact also that in 2009 we started to diversify successfully in the new segment of carafes for spirits where we aim to achieve a turnover of nearly 5 million Euros in the next three years. Premium Beauty News - And innovation in this context? Felice Nardiello - It's striding along! All directions are taken advantage of. And we will surely be able to market products you don't even expect, to improve glass resistance, while adding new barriers and aesthetic properties to it."
"Coster: ""historical recovery""","Premium Beauty News - The sharp drop of the market at the end of 2008 and early 2009 was followed by a timid recovery in September 2009 to end up with a historical recovery since November. What's your feedback? Claudio Contini - It is true that we went through an extraordinary period, from all points of view and in the literal sense. Personally, I had never seen that before. Imagine that for the aerosol filling machines we didn't book any orders during the last 3 months of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. Consider that during the same period orders on pumps, valves and spray caps had fallen by some 20%. It is only as of May 2009 that a hesitant recovery occurred. It increased significantly in June and then September. Eventually, and thanks to the strong rebound in October, November and December 2009, we ended the year with a reduced decrease of our turnover. What was unusual during that period was the huge drop of what I call ""consumables"" and the very long period during which we booked no machine orders. We had truly never experienced such a situation before. Premium Beauty News - With disparities depending on the countries where you were operating? Claudio Contini - The situation was better not necessarily in the countries you are thinking about. In our case, we performed well in the United States, South America and … France. A country where we even increased our market share, thanks mainly to the L'Oréal Group and the Fareva Group with whom we strengthened our positions. On the other hand, Germany, Holland, Spain and the UK suffered a lot, like Greece, North Africa and of course Russia, where no one was buying anything in the first half of 2009. Premium Beauty News - What about the Asian area? Claudio Contini - As you may remember, we have invested in a factory in India in 2008, with the aim to bring local production to a level comparable to an European one, with the same standards of quality and service, but still profiting from the ""best-cost country"" advantage offered locally. The domestic market was healthy, but the factory was also supplying Middle East and Russia and therefore it suffered from the crisis. Concerning our factory in Malaysia, may I remind you that it is mainly positioned on the spray-caps manufacturing for the insecticide market. Premium Beauty News - What is your outlook on the coming months? Claudio Contini - Very difficult to say. We still need to be very cautious. The de-stocking phase is temporarily over and we are now obviously benefiting from a really strong recovery, but it's hard to say what will happen next. Premium Beauty News - During these last months your investments were mainly focused on the pharmaceutical sector! Claudio Contini - That's right! The pharmaceutical production structures in Italy are focusing much of our efforts with, in particular, the putting into service, last October, of a state-of-the-art clean room. Of course we are still remaining very active in the beauty sector, mainly in the mass market. Premium Beauty News - Spray-Cap manufacturing has really become one of your key specialties! Claudio Contini - A recognized specialty: Coster is maintaining its global leadership in this area! Among our latest developments we are quite proud of the new special actuators for Garnier and Gillette deodorants."
Biokolor Make-Up wants to transpose to skincare its success in make-up,"Mario De Luigi, one of the founders, comments for Premium Beauty News the latest news about this company that appealed to cosmetics brands like with make-up formulas incorporating a high level of skincare, smooth powders, mascaras with intense brightness and colours, lipsticks where comfort is as important as matteness and colour variety, comfortable and smooth glosses… All of this with a total self-funding of investments, both in research and development and in terms of industrial tools. Premium Beauty News - Ten years already? Mario De Luigi - Yes already! Time just flies! It is hard to imagine that at the time, we started business, about ten kilometres from here in a tiny workshop with a team of four people, making foundations and emulsions. It's at the same time a very short and very long period. But the result is there. Thanks to our efforts, Biokolor Make-Up has earned a reputation in the field of creation and production of formulations for the cosmetic industry. Not many secrets to achieve this but a lot of work, creativity, concern for quality, (whatever the quantities), novelty in formulas and flexibility regarding market demands. Premium Beauty News - In spite of the crisis? Mario De Luigi - Well, I might surprise you, but so to speak we didn't feel its effects. This is probably a sign of our good health. Our sales remained unchanged in 2009 compared to 2008, and 2010 has begun very well. Premium Beauty News - In 2010 you will participate in two major events: Cosmoprof Bologna and MakeUp in Paris. What will be the highlights? Mario De Luigi - The main highlights will be new types of emulsions, new types of powders with new textures. What characterizes probably best Biokolor Make-Up is the high level of research involved in product development. The mascara activity also benefits a lot from this, which allows us to offer ranges appealing to our customers because of their intensity in colours, brightness and natural look. We also always have had the will to introduce in our recipes formulas incorporating a high level of skincare. Regarding Cosmoprof Bologna, we will showcase a lot of novelties in emulsion, but also very nice surprises concerning powders and skincare under the functional but also visual aspects. As for MakeUp in Paris, it's a brand new concept of Business to Business event where we will really be in a position to ""stage"" our know-how. It's really innovative and we are currently figuring out the best way to stage our products. Premium Beauty News - Environment, eco-certification, development of natural products are part of your research and developments universe. Mario De Luigi - That's right! We have always believed in that! For over five years, we have been working on organic products, especially on fully plant-based products and we currently have a wide range of certified products. Undoubtedly one of the largest existing on the market. There is a team working daily on these topics at Treviglio. In this area, we will present specific lines where new technologies have been applied to improve sensoriality making these natural products even more comparable with performances of high end perfumery products. Premium Beauty News - Skincare is also a developing area at Biokolor Make-Up! Mario De Luigi - We have just put the finishing touches to a series of products called ""no surgery"". Very effective products for wrinkles and for a fresh facial skin tone. And of course, we are also developing organic and eco certified products. Today at Biokolor Make-Up, skincare and make-up are addressed the same way."
Faber-Castell Cosmetics: « under the sign of competitiveness and innovation »,"Premium Beauty News - After a harsh year 2009, what about the economic situation in 2010? Stefano Castelletti - For the time being we have every reason of being satisfied with the current pace. Demand is sustained. As for the year 2009, we have nothing to complain about. We will have reached roughly the same figures as those recorded in 2008. Certainly, throughout the past year, we had to adapt to a particularly tense market in terms of volumes and prices. Specially on prices incidentally! We have continually improved, over this period, the performances of our production equipment to make them more flexible and more competitive. At the same time, we have continued to invest in innovation which remains one of our main keys to keep on progressing in our market. Some of the highlights of this innovative approach, the launch of pencils complying perfectly with new environmental requirements (Ecocert certified). Premium Beauty News - The origin, not to say the very soul of Faber Castell, still remains the wooden pencil! What about this product? Stefano Castelletti - The wooden pencil still accounts for more than 50% of our business. Obviously, you haven't heard the last of wooden pencil. We will prove it this year by marketing a variety of new pencils innovating in textures implemented (new formulas) but also decoration. Within the next 5 years we will also see the appearance of superior formulae suited for plastic cased products as well as liquid products which will of course challenge the share of wooden pencils. Premium Beauty News - All these novelties will be the strong points of your presence this year at both, Cosmoprof Bologna and MakeUp in Paris? Stefano Castelletti - At the moment nobody exactly knows how consumer behavior will shift or change in times after the recession. Certainly individuality is on the rise which means an exciting time with a lot of creativity and profiling also in design. Under the slogan ""Express Yourself"" we are going to present our latest innovations in packaging and fomula, three different concepts that add glamour and uniqueness to cosmetic pencils: – C'EST CHIC: Sophisticated products with funky surface design – visible and touchable. – HOT STUFF: Vivid make-up colours and formulae with ultimate staying power. – HIGH ENERGY: A careful selection of ingredients and their high concentration spell magic to make-up. Premium Beauty News - Your industrial presence is concentrated in Europe with the German factory and South America with a plant in Brazil. What about Asia? Stefano Castelletti - We successfully produce stationary products in China and we have established factories in Indonesia and Malaysia. In our opinion the Asian cosmetics market is in process of an important evolution that we are observing. The Latin American market has stepped beyond evolution and have experienced strong growth recently. Premium Beauty News - There is much talk about full-service, but in fact it's a daily practice for you! Stefano Castelletti - There are a lot of different interpretations of full service due to the open supply chain for cosmetic products. At Faber-Castell we traditionally manage vertical integration in manufacturing. It's our business, our vocation."
Pibiplast: offensive strategy on make-up,"Premium Beauty News - Eventually, the takeover in 2002 of the Bomal company, which was specialized in the make-up segment and located in Robbiate, turned out to be a good idea? Giorgio Bosi - Figures speak for themselves. At the time, the company was employing 21 people, it has more than doubled the figure since it has now a staff of 45. The plant in Robbiate can currently rely on 25 injection machines, 10 blow molding extrusion machines and 4 air-blown injection machines. Not to mention all the equipment used for finishings. The facility can produce a full range of packaging for make-up, that is to say, not only twenty million mascaras per year, but also lip-gloss, eye-liners, lipstick tubes. And the turnover generated by this activity currently weighs 10 million Euros (it was half less when we acquired the company) compared with the 24 million made by the entire Pibiplast Group. Stefania Bosi - I must add that we obviously have no intention to leave it at that. Clearly our aim is to double the turnover within the five years to come. We are currently giving ourselves the means to achieve this goal. Under my direct responsibility, we have strengthened our marketing and sales presence in this area and we are about to obtain some quite interesting commercial results around the world, particularly on the European market. Premium Beauty News - Which doesn't mean you have been neglecting the other division body care / skin care! Giorgio Bosi - Of course not! The Correggio facility remains a model of its kind that we are constantly bringing up to date each year. It currently incorporates 40 blow-moulding extrusion machines, 10 blow drawing injection machines and 25 injection machines. The 3,000 sqm workshop dedicated to finishing includes no less than 11 serigraphy printing machines including 5 with up to six colors, plus 2 five-color offset machines, 2 pad printing machines (up to 6 colors), equipment for infra-red varnishing and one machine to insert retractable sleeves. Over the next three years, the Correggio facility will expand by 60% and the program for the next coming years plans to build 5,000 sqm more in addition to the already available 9,000 sqm. Our advantage in this Body Care / Skin Care segment remains in the fact it's backed-up by this production capacity, but that it can also relies on its versatility and its adaptability. Premium Beauty News - These extra 5,000 sqm should allow you to merge your entire group on the same site? Giorgio Bosi - Not exactly! We believe in the specialization of our sites, and Correggio must remain focused on the production of Body Care / Skin Care and Robbiate on make-up! We would rather concentrate our logistics operations for ""products"", which are currently 15km. away, near the Reggio Emilia highway, for obvious efficiency reasons and to improve our industrial logistics. Premium Beauty News - Italy remains Pibiplast's largest market? Giorgio Bosi - Yes, it's true, the Italian market accounts for 45% of our business, but our country is closely followed by France and the rest of the EU."
Mascara Plus: to handle growth,"A real saga the Italian way, the story of this company created by David Chant, a former executive from L'Oreal who specialized in formulating and manufacturing mascara. A true talent, which incidentally obliged him to wait patiently for a year, the necessary time for him to be released from the restraint of trade clause, before he could set off alone on a big adventure in 2002 with the help of a small network of subcontractors. After two years spent alone in Turin, our man starts to structure his business internally and settles in the actual existing plant on the outskirts of Milan in 2005. A pivotal year where the firm displays a turnover of EUR 400,000. Four years later, the figure exceeds EUR 3 million and the production capacity of 25 tons / month is no longer sufficient. ""And we have specialized solely on mascara and we are staying on it! No question of getting involved in other products. We are already finding it difficult to supplying. Why diversify?"", insists David Chant. The reasons for success? ""Precisely this specialty, says Alistair Beavan, Director of Operations, and of course the quality of our products. Incidentally, one is the result of the other"". And then there are a few tricks like the double brush mascara developed by the Italian firm with a special machine installed in Asia but belonging to the company. The brush can lengthen, define and give volume to eyelashes at once. ""There is above all the acknowledged qualities of our formulations,"" underlines David Chant, ""which allow us to position ourselves at all levels of the market."" To meet strong market demand, the firm has equipped itself, last October, with a filling and labeling line capable of processing 30 000 pieces / day. Investment cost: EUR 200,000. ""And we have no intention of stopping our efforts, says David Chant, since we have plans to purely and simply double the production workshop by the end of 2010""."
AptarGroup begins strategic realignment,"US-headquartered AptarGroup, a leader in the dispensing system industry, is undertaking a strategic realignment of its businesses under three market-focused business segments, namely: beauty and home products, food and beverage, and phamaceuticals. The AptarGroup will be consequently reorganised in three business units: Aptar Beauty + Home, Aptar Food + Beverage and Aptar Pharma. ""By realigning our businesses in a way that is completely market focused, we will make it even easier for customers to do business with us,"" explained Peter Pfeiffer, President and CEO. The AptarGroup said this realignment should be fully operational in 2011. As part of the strategic realignment new visual identities were developed for Aptar's three segments and for the corporate enterprise. Pfeiffer added that each segment identifier has a unique colour. The new identity is centred on the group's name and the names of its subsidiaries such as Valois or Pfeiffer should be replaced by Aptar Beauty & Home and Aptar Pharma. Analysts welcomed Aptar's realignment considering it would help the company to focus on its end-markets."
Sourcing: Cosfibel to reinforce its global network,"To reinforce its expertise and accelerate its developments in boxes (cardboard, leather, MDF, metal ...) and luggage, Cosfibel has incorporated the teams and the suppliers network of a Chinese company. This way, the Group strengthens its human skills and owns locally, two strategic industrial tools: two sample rooms (sampling workshops), one dedicated to boxes in Shenzhen and the other one to luggage in Dungun. Main advantage according to Cosfibel: monitoring the sampling process which influences at the same time, control of industrial development and of costs. ""The key factor for success in promotional items is,with the price, appropriate sampling in record time, a proof that manufacturing is controlled, with the expected price and quality. When we are capable of developing the samples, this means that all stages in the development process are validated,"" explains Stanislas Peronnet, Director of Operations for Cosfibel group. According to the group, design and validation of the industrialization of its products guarantee the development of complex studies with very high quality requirements. Cosfibel in Southern China, it's a total staff of 25 employees in charge of development and quality control. Even if China, the historical partner of the group, remains its largest supplier, Cosfibel is continually identifying new sources, in particular for both proximity reasons, both for the sake of flexibility, sustainability and to reduce products' carbon footprint. In North African countries, Cosfibel has already established partnerships for boxes and cases in Morocco and Algeria. The group has passed a new milestone by signing a partnership with two plants (metal parts) in Tunisia. In Europe, the group has developed textile business with Turkey and is exploring new avenues in Romania. Another example, Cosfibel UK, the English subsidiary has undertaken locally the production of boxes on behalf of a client, Beverage, and thus has provided the fastest and most appropriate solution to meet the customer's request. As for Cosfibel US, the subsidiary works with cardboard makers in Mexico."
"MBF: ""Flawless quality has become our Bible""","""Two years to be remembered"" is how one can qualify 2008 and 2009 at MBF Plastiques [1]. Since, the firm based in Oyonnax, in the South of France, has designed one after the other One Million by Paco Rabanne, Ricci by Nina Ricci, Scarlett by Cacharel and L'Eau Mega by Viktor Horsting & Rolf Snoeren. Launches that somewhat toke one's breath away by their innovation in marketing or technical feat or both at the same time. But in all cases, products which clearly attracted consumers. Premium Beauty News - One has the feeling that MBF has made a real come back in the luxury segment? True or false? Jean-Michel Fouilland – Yes and No! We have always been in high-end packaging for perfumery and cosmetics. We have never ceased to be. May I remind you that MBF signed in the early 1980s, Yves Saint Laurent's first Opium, who was in its own way a true revolution for the sector. And along the same line we designed, Magie Noire (Lancôme), Kouros (YSL), Maxim's, Choc, Énigme, Rose Cardin (P. Cardin), le féminin Eternity (Calvin Klein), NOA (Cacharel). Then it is true that as of the early 1990s, the company was wearing two hats ""luxury packaging"" and ""technical parts"" with, in particular the creation of an industrial site dedicated mainly to the production of service caps. It's probably from that time that our image became somewhat blurred. Premium Beauty News - Until the early 2000s when a repositioning occured! Jean-Michel Fouilland - That's right! We decided to make a stronger come back in the segment of perfumery and cosmetics packaging. A dedicated Sales team was set up. Without a break, the manufacturing unit of industrial parts is converted into a production hall dedicated to the manufacture of mascaras (air-blown injection, assembly and decoration). In a few months, the effects are felt immediately. In 2000, it's MBF who designs the new Givenchy for men. Then in 2002, Omnia by Bvlgari, followed in 2004 byAqua, also from Bvlgari. A period also corresponding to what will become a real know-how for MBF, in other words mastering the design of sophisticated spray-caps. It's also at the same period that we created image overmouldings on a make-up remover for Lancôme in 2005. And then follows men's Armani Diamond in 2006 and then women's Ultra Violet by Paco Rabanne. A creation which highlighted all our know-how in the making of a very cost effective spray-cap: from three manufacturing molds thought of at first, our engineers managed to only design one! Premium Beauty News - This is probably one of your main assets: finding what will make the difference! Jean-Michel Fouilland - Well, that's what made the difference so far. Surely a state of mind. From a brief, strive to find what will help design the part at the lowest cost and best quality level possible. We are dealing with process innovation. Automation, robotics, Choices in terms of multi-injection, all necessary industrial choices to be considered. ""Flawless quality"" has become our Bible. And believe me, it's not always that simple. Look at the Viktor & Rolf and its pear composed of nearly 12 pieces assembled automatically. A real puzzle of injected technical parts in order to dispense the product by applying pressure on both sides of the brand logo itself. Even the bi-material ""Ricci"" cap, made from PP densified and PP Homo was not that simple with its collar in two parts including a ""ribbon"" with an invisible bond line and its finishing achieved with vacuum metallization and shiny varnish. Premium Beauty News - Mastering the design of spray-caps has become a real specialty! Jean-Michel Fouilland - We had this opportunity in the early 2000s and over the years our knowledge has considerably improved. To such a point that we have ended up designing some nozzles for actuators because of cost control issues and technological know-how. One thing leading to another, we were asked to design dispensing systems for even more accomplished products. The Viktor & Rolf probably being one of the most sophisticated one we had to design. And this is probably not finished. Premium Beauty News – And what about crisis? Jean-Michel Fouilland – We took the blow like everyone else, but maybe not as severely. Our industrial choices proved to be the right ones and the fact we refocused on our high-end real technical know-how is paying off today. We certainly finished last year down on 2008 but almost at the same level as 2007."
"I.L. Cosmetics, from nail polish to make-up","Premium Beauty News - Éric Wimmer, you have been heading for the past few months IL Cosmetics, a company specialized in the production and filling of nail polishes, mascara, eyeliners and lipgloss. Industrial investments currently under way at the Luxembourg historic site are substantial! How are they going to impact the layout and organization of the site? Éric Wimmer - Indeed, investments under way are substantial! In a previous article published in your newsletter, we had announced 11 million Euros in five years, including six million by 2011. As for the industrial site, may I remind you that it is divided into three distinct facilities: two autonomous buildings, the first one for the production of nail polishes, the second one for the production of make-up and a packaging facility, dedicated to all our products. The total filling capacity for nail polishes ranges from 30 to 35 million units per year. For the other make-up products it was about 20 million units in 2009, with a 30% growth scheduled in 2010. This obviously has an incidence on the site's organization. Some ofthe investment planned by 2011 is dedicated to the construction of a specialized building for the production of all our make-up products (Luxcos). This will allow us to increase our filling capacity for nail polishes in the existing and consequently exclusively dedicated building (Interpack). This specialization will help us reach our goal which is to double our sales within 4 years. Premium Beauty News - Until the decision for diversification occurred in the early 2000s, the history of IL Cosmetics was intimately linked to that of nail polish. Éric Wimmer - Absolutely! As you know, there aren't that many players in the nail polish segment. Because it's a very technical and demanding industrial sector. A bit of history is necessary here... Before the 1915/1920 period, women used to apply on their nails different kinds of products, one of them made of a plant, henna, displaying a brown / orange color. For years, they settled for polishing their nails to make them shiny. Hence the still currently used expression in English, of nail polish. The end of Second World War brings the use of varnish as we know it today. A Charles Revson (who later on founded ""Revlon"") teams up with a painting company, Mass. & Wallenstein and markets the first dye and nitrocellulose-based nail polish. The making of premium nail polish is much more complex than you might imagine. Because the enamel must actually meet a number of criteria: correct application, brightness, drying time ... At the time, quite a challenge for the engineers. the dye must be ""fixed"", the colored pigments must remain in suspension. Nowadays, as you know, you can even add PET sheets based glitters and the choice in colors can extend infinitely. Premium Beauty News - Advances in terms of drying times reveal a lot about progress achieved in this industry! Éric Wimmer - It is a very good example! Lifestyles have changed, women today are active. They can no longer afford to spend too much time for the application of their polish which must then dry in 1 to 3 minutes. Durability on the nail is also an important criterion which may reach 5 days. Premium Beauty News - I.L. Cosmetics is one of the few, if not the only manufacturer of nail polishes, to have diversified itself in make-up. Éric Wimmer - That's true. We master techniques inherent in the development of a complex product such as nail polish: mixtures, dispersions, colors. So we can put this technical expertise to good use for other products such as lipgloss the complexity of which stands in color setting and mastering its application and mascara, with in addition mastering emulsions."
"Thomas Jonas, MWV: ""All set for 2010""","Premium Beauty News - Against all expectations, it appears finally that 2009 was a decent year for your Group! Thomas Jonas - Quite true! And that applies to all areas under my responsibility, namely pumps, trigger sprayers and cardboard processing. The second part of the year was good with a very strong last quarter. Needless to say that we also benefited from very strong demand for dispensing systems of antiseptic products against influenza. Even though the potential for spread is currently very low, we really have the feeling that a new consumption pattern has been set and that consumers have started using these products routinely, particularly in the United States. This is an extremely competitive and capitalistic segment in which we have been investing for many years, and we now have a strong position. In addition, perfume pumps and even more so, cosmetics pumps finally performed well throughout the year 2009. I would also like to add that, in this perfumery segment, the end of 2009 also marks a milestone as our group in the United States was legally considered as the inventors of the transparent dip tube. To note also the marketing of our new mini-trigger sprayers. Premium Beauty News - Airless seems more than ever to be on a roll! Don't you think? Thomas Jonas - Obviously! This technology is fully adapted to new consumer demand and to the development of greener and more protective cosmetic products. As I already had the opportunity to tell you here, a few months ago, we are still increasing our research effort in this field and we are, commercially speaking, doing very well with our system working perfectly. You know that concerning this area, we have decided to dispatch our production tool in key areas of the world where we are already operating industrially, i.e. North America, Spain and China. We will continue to innovate in airless in 2010. Premium Beauty News - You just mentioned your industrial presence at the four corners of the globe. China is obviously at the heart of this strategy! Thomas Jonas - Yes, of course! And contrary to received ideas, we have out there, in Wuxi near Shanghai what is probably the most modern production unit in the world. The site, incidentally, looks more like a genuine ""industrial campus ""than a plant, strictly speaking. We are centralizing over there all our know-how in the field of pumps, trigger sprayers, airless and cardboard processing. Above all, everything is ultra-automated! A presence on this continent that we anticipated to cope with what is known to be a permanently booming market."
"Plastic industry and cosmetics, ""the essential solidarity""","Several speeches were held alternately between the two professions during the one day event organized by the Centre de Formation de la Plasturgie (Training Center of the Plastic industry) et du Centre Européen de Dermocosmétologie (European Center of Dermocosmetology). Among the addressed topics: cosmetics and their formulation, plastics and packaging, interaction between content and container, the value of packaging and innovations, design and new features offered by packaging. A roundtable was also organized between several players in sustainable development concerning issues on eco-design, biodegradability, recycling and regulations. Icing on the cake, demonstration workshops and products from the cosmetology and plastic industry were also displayed to attendees. According to Gérard Goujon, CEO of PRP Création and President of Allizé-Plasturgie Rhône-Alpes, ""This one day event is definitely a starting point for greater cooperation between these two trades and it should enable them not only to change the plain supplier/customer relationship, but also suggest together new means to explore and share experiences. The first question to ask is truly, what can we achieve together? We must exchange, find, suggest, think. We must also be united to defend ourselves together, suggest together, create together, be involved with a real right to vote on our future."" According to Dominique Bouvier, CEO of Strand Cosmetics Europe and President of the European Center of Dermocosmetology, the purpose of such a dialogue is also to find answers: ""facing regulations, groundless concerns on the safety of our products, the trend on organic and sustainable development, the power of brand owners, media campaigns harmful to the industry, changing attitudes, consumer habits, globalization, players in the plastic and cosmetic industry have no other choice than talk, exchange, share!"" ""The end customer is the same: the consumer. The decision makers are the same: brand owners, who expect from us industrial cleverness, practical ingenuity, solutions, innovation. Let's remove barriers and start inter-trade cooperation based on mutual respect, sharing of values, information, equity of contributions, transparency,"" she adds."
Louvrette carries on with its industrial revolution,"Premium Beauty News - Founded in1964 by Gerd and Dieter Erlhöfer, Louvrette soon became one of three leaders in the European market of make-up cases. In 1994, it is the shift for the production of jars, particularly with the first thick wall jars, and today with new lines incorporating smooth bottles, airless bottles including their closures. Fabian Erhölfer - Like any company specialized in plastic injection, we obviously had to adapt to the globalization of markets in the cosmetic sector. And the shift operated at the time, in the mid 90s by the management team was necessary. Make-up cases which was the core business of the company, was no longer viable confronted to Asian countries. It was absolutely necessary to find something else. Currently, the production of jars accounts for nearly 80% of Louvrette's business and that of make-up cases for more than 20%. Obviously the changes operated in the mid 90s were salutary for three reasons. Firstly, because we have acquired a unique expertise in the design of jars of all shapes (cylindrical, conical, rounded, etc..), In particular multi-print, then because it allowed us to widen our offer with the production of a combined range of bottles, airless bottles and closures (bottles in 150, 200 and 250 ml, airless in 15, 30 et 50ml), finally, because all the investments made, particularly during the construction of the new plant in 2007, allow us to consider with confidence future developments also including the segment of make-up cases that we have not abandoned as a part of the production is very likely to be transferred back to Europe. Premium Beauty News - In which case, this would be in a way, a return to one's root? Fabian Erhölfer - In a way, yes. But if you compare the technical and industrial background, Louvrette presently has little to do with what the company looked like in the 1980s. We have significantly increased our technical level and optimized our production. The new plant, built in 2007 with an investment exceeding 1.8 million Euros, is a perfect example environmentally speaking. We use a very small percentage of chemicals in our production. For waste treatment, we rely on companies specialized in recycling. No harmful emissions are released into the atmosphere during production of plastic parts, thanks to a sophisticated air filtration system. Of course, we have installed a wastewater filtering system. Manufacturing generates no heat nor noise or smell. Of course, we reuse, whenever possible, cores which are directly transformed into pellets to be reused into machines. For the cooling of machines and tools, we have invested in a hot and cold air recycling system, which allows us to achieve energy savings of 80% and reduce CO2 emissions. Our investment plan for machines includes replacement of obsolete equipment with high energy consumption by latest generation machines with reduced energy consumptions. We have just invested in an electric injection molding machine. 2010 will be the year of ISO 14001 certification for Louvrette and we are very seriously considering the possibilities of replacing fossil polymers with plant based polymers among others. In terms of design, we can offer products that will integrate our standards or develop specific packaging. The design of our standard packaging varies depending on customer demand, it is timeless and functional. So each brand is free to customize its packaging with colors, finishings and decorations that we offer them. For that purpose, we strive to take account of trends and prevailing creativity. As part of our new Customer Design, we help our customers from designing to product launch and put all our experience and know how to good use: product designing, quick prototype design, 3D, designing and industrial manufacturing of tools by ourselves. Premium Beauty News - Jars, bottles, closures, cases ... you are both in the universe of care and make-up. An area with increasing innovation. Fabian Erhölfer - Quite true and we will be active in this segment of innovation in 2010. I can already tell you, without giving any details, that we are working with other partners on the design of an airless jar that will be really innovative."
The new ambitions of the European Dermocosmetology Centre,"Premium Beauty News - This last summer, you were appointed as new President of the European Dermocosmetology Centre (Centre européen de dermocosmétologie - CED), which is based in Lyon. You are declaring a strong willingness to boost this organisation. Dominique Bouvier - Action was needed. I took the decision at that time with the difficulties that you can imagine, I mean that I am already strongly committed to the management of Strand Cosmetics Europe, within the harsh economic context of 2009… At the same time, it was also important to motivate the CED members in order to crack the whip of the organisation's activities, and thus to promote the assets of the Rhône-Alpes region in the cosmetics business, in particular its industrial capabilities and university laboratories. Indeed, the cosmetic science is closely linked to the health sector, which plays a major role in the economy of the region. What we need is to strengthen the association's image through a common and visible project. Therefore we have to insist on the strategic vision of our association, in particular with decision makers. Premium Beauty News - What concrete actions are you planning? Dominique Bouvier - We have already entered into an agreement with the SFC [1] in order to organize a one-day preview of the IFSCC [2] in Lyon in 2014. You may think it is a distant event, but actually it is not. For us it is an opportunity, with the aim that this day be the highlight of this global event. We must work immediately in order to attract the world's most renown scientists with an ambitious and relevant programme that will highlight all the competences of the region's universities. Premium Beauty News - What are your main assets? Dominique Bouvier - There are other associations, like the Cosmetic Valley or Cosmed, that make a very good job… So is there room left for another association? Yes! Of course yes! Our main asset is our cluster of universities, with its researchers and scientists. There is room left for us as a pole of excellence in the field of research in cosmetic science. We can assert ourselves strongly and differently through the concept of science for the sake of cosmetology. We need to develop a strong image that will be recognized worldwide. I believe it is possible, as far as we rely on the quality of our graduate schools and universities. Eventually, the three main axes of our communication are: – Rhône-Alpes or Lyon – Human skin and health – Science and expertise Our three main working axes, which are to be further developed are: – science / research – upstream and downstream synergies – internaional / eexports Furthermore, the next regulatory changes, that encourage to consider the product as a whole, with both a content and a container, implies that we are able to work with our colleagues of the plastic industry [3]. All the kinds of operators that contribute to the conception of a safe and reliable product, upstream and downstream, from the design up to the sale, can join the project. And we are increasing the number of our potential members in the Rhône-Alpes region through the enlargement of scientific competences that are required in order to make this ""dream product"". Premium Beauty News - Can you talk about yourself? Dominique Bouvier - My professional background is simple. I am a pharmacist, I graduated from the University Lyon I in 1974, with a speciality in biology. I had a first professional experience in a hospital then in a medical laboratory. In 1980, trained in industrial pharmacology, with a speciality in cosmetology, at the IPIL [4] with professor Marie Claude Martini and professor Jean Cotte, and I acquired the company Strand Cosmetics Europe in 1981. I have been heading Strand's directory in June 2008. Only projects and the pleasure to achieve them together with a devoted team motivate me. My values are those I developed in the practice of collective sport."
Cosmolab about to join Schwan Stabilo Cosmetics,"Following the filing of voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code by its parent company, Specialty Packaging Holdings (SPH), Cosmolab is about to be sold to All4 Cosmetics, a subsidiary of Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics, of Nuremburg, Germany. ""SPH and its subsidiaries [1] will continue to conduct business as usual during the Chapter 11 proceedings while they undertake to sell their assets,"" the company said in a release. The group has already announced the sale of the jars and closures assets of its plastic injection moulding subsidiary, Cosmetic Specialties, to private equity firm Asparron Capital to create Cosmetic Specialties International. As far as Cosmolab is concerned, SPH announced that all of the operating assets to All4 Cosmetics, a subsidiary of Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics. ""All4 Cosmetics is prepared to continue business operations in Lewisburg [Tennessee], continuing Cosmolab's long history as a leader in the manufacture of colour cosmetics and cosmetic pencils,"" the company added. According to Michael Musso, Chief Restructuring Officer for SPH, ""Schwan-STABILO is one of the most respected companies in the industry. We believe this acquisition will strengthen both companies and provide their customers with the highest quality and most innovative products available. We are also very happy that All4 intends to maintain the operations in Lewisburg, Tennessee, continuing to serve our valued customers without interruption."" SPH need to get Court approval of a process to market these assets, and All4 Cosmetics' offer is subject to competitive bidding by third parties during the Chapter 11 auction process."
"Philippe Benacin, Inter Parfums: ""2010, the post-crisis year""","Premium Beauty News - A few words about Inter Parfums and the economic environment of the latest months. What is the outlook on 2010? Philippe Benacin - Against all expectations, the year 2009 wasn't that bad eventually. Remember that in 2008 our turnover exceeded 264 million Euros and that, in 2009, it will be on a trend of just over 252 million Euros. The drop is relatively limited, especially as our business in 2008 had profited from very positive opportunities in terms of launches. In addition, last year finally ended up on a very good trend. In terms of strategy, the group is significantly strengthening its prospects with: – creation of a new development strategy with the preparation of a complete line of make-up under the Burberry brand name. This line, the launch of which is planned during next summer, will facilitate a better visibility of perfumes at a retail level; – diversification of the portfolio materialized next fall by the signature of a license agreement with the luxury brand Jimmy Choo. As for this year, it promises to be full of new quality initiatives and should help our sales exceed 265 million Euros, an increase of over 9% in constant currency values compared to 2009, with in particular: – a line of fragrances for women and men, Burberry Sport in February; – a line of fragrances for women, Oriens by Van Cleef & Arpels in March; – a Burberry make-up line in June; – lines of women's fragrances under the brand names Lanvin and ST Dupont in July; – a line of men's fragrances under the brand name Van Cleef & Arpels in September. Premium Beauty News - The crisis has not yet finished causing damage upstream of the sector, taking into account, among other factors, de-stocking policies which never seem to end. Philippe Benacin - Well, good news concerning de-stocking policies, they are over! Our stock levels are extremely low and the year 2010 will be totally different. We will be ordering again! Premium Beauty News - What about this license agreement with Montblanc? Philippe Benacin - With leading positions in writing instruments, watches and leather goods, a promising development in women's jewelry, an active presence in more than 70 countries, a network of 350 owned stores and high requirements on quality design and products, Montblanc has a potential for growth in fragrances and derived products. This partnership with a hundred-year old luxury brand acknowledged worldwide, reinforces the development prospects of our group in the segment of selective perfumery. Premium Beauty News - This is undoubtedly one of the peculiarities of your group, total subcontracting, industrially speaking. What do you think is the balance to find between subcontracting in Europe, and more particularly in France, and Asia? Philippe Benacin - Quite true! And by the way, the induced jobs represent, in my opinion, at least 600 people. As for the breakdown, it is clear that the filling is a 100% achieved in France, the purchase of components is done mostly in Europe (70% to 75%), not much in the United States and finally, very little in Asia (except for zamac). This is largely due to the fact that our business is essentially focused on the perfume segment. A configuration which changes of course a little with Burberry's new activity in make-up, especially concerning packaging where Asia has clearly taken a strong position. But remember that Italy remains a major player in the area of cosmetic ingredients. Premium Beauty News - Will your arrival in the make-up segment also extend to other brands you own? Philippe Benacin - In principle, no! This is justified with Burberry considering what the turnover of this brand accounts for within Inter Parfums (EUR 160 million). Remember that our second brand has a turnover of 40 million Euros. But I would like to underline that, on a marketing point of view, make-up is definitely a powerhouse for a brand. A drive that must not be neglected."
Qualipac: the three axes strategy!,"Premium Beauty News - What were the main reasons that drove you to have the Qualipac group move in these three directions? Pierre Hémar - Simply enough, industrial logic confronted to the logic of changing customer markets. It was obvious that to remain among the front runners of preferred suppliers to global key players in the beauty industry, we had to be also operating on the main continents where they were going to grow. It was also necessary to offer them everything they required in terms of ""full service"", which we were fortunately able to offer in addition to our industrial know-how in plastics processing, with our expertise in all areas of packaging, accessories, thanks also to our privileged ties with world's top glassmaker: Pochet. Premium Beauty News - A few strings were missing to your bow, right? Pierre Hémar - Quite true! Industrially speaking, we were not involved in the manufacture of high-end parts made of zamac even though we had been already relying on Asian subcontractors for twenty years. That is why we decided to build, from scratch, this new plant in China to process this material. We were not operating in South America, particularly Brazil, which remains and will remain one of the most dynamic markets in the Beauty universe. We took over Ipel, with a factory which also allows us to develop a real expertise both in the make-up area and for a ""high-end"" lipstick mechanism. Not to mention that the Brazilian plant will also inherit from all of Qualipac's know-how in terms of finishing and assembling techniques, thus developing its offer. May I also add that our presence in China both in plastic and zamac processing could also lead in the coming months to aluminum processing. Premium Beauty News - A technical and geographical reorganization that didn't stop you from accelerating the upgrading of your French factories? Pierre Hémar - We don't have the choice! No one in the European industry has the choice! Durability of production tools in Europe could only be and can only be achieved through automation and innovation. That's what we have been working on and will continue to work on. Latest example to date, the complete automation at Auriplast, thanks to robots, of the assembling on the frames of parts meant to be galvanized. And we will proceed the same way with the disassembling post, once the parts are treated. A ""small"" operation which will still cost nearly 5 million Euros! Not to mention significant investments achieved for the setting up of specific assembly lines, such as the one which allowed us to design the latest Hugo Boss for which we provide, by the way, a truly comprehensive service including taking delivery of bottles, automatic assembling of the base and repackaging of the whole for shipment, offering a new service to the customer. But there is also innovation. Which is constantly driving us at all levels of responsibility. We are the only ones currently able to offer a ""genuine silver"" galvanizing, the aspect of which will not alter with time. Our engineers have also managed to block metal oxidation using passivation. I can also tell you about our new dispensing jar. 2010 should not disappoint you. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, let's talk about this year! What are your expectations? Pierre Hémar - Circumspect! But we can only be optimistic after a particularly trying previous year where everything combined to weaken our profession. Declining volumes, falling prices ... everything was on our way. We ended the year at - 15%! At the start of 2010, volumes are back a little bit. On the contrary we are still experiencing price levels totally incompatible with the health of our businesses. This will have to change! Of course, this situation forced us to further improve our productivity (which has been the case!) and the flexibility of our production units, but you cannot ask us to have top technology and invest while our margins are collapsing."
Choosing metal to tell a story,"Premium Beauty News - Massilly was already active in the luxury segment. What are the changes with ""My Box""? A new marketing approach, new targets? Hervé de Rivoire - Massilly has a long history in the metal packaging sector. Our business in its current industrial configuration exists since 1959 (we have just celebrated our fiftieth anniversary!) but the group's origins and its presence in metal goes back to 1911.The group has a turnover of €220 million and employs 1350 people across the world and through 24 companies. Our activity in boxes and promotional packs has actually always offered solutions to the perfumery-cosmetics sector and we designed a few years ago beautiful cases for Sephora, boxes, for Yves Saint-Laurent Parfums, Biotherm and for a few other brands less recently. In the wine and spirits sector, we designed promotional canisters for Ballantine's among other brands. We launched the ""My Box by Massilly"" division at the last Luxepack. This new entity provides a dedicated offer with premium cases and boxes for brands. In addition to having industrial resources (see below), it offers a new marketing approach with a new sales team. Our booth at Luxepack reflected this change with the presentation of our new website www.myboxbymassilly.com, a new visual chart and simulation samples dedicated to premium markets. Twenty premium decorations were showcased. Premium Beauty News – Apart from some famous examples, especially with Jean-Paul Gaultier and Calvin Klein, metal appears to have slightly declined in the perfumery and cosmetics packaging sector. During your business meetings, how is this material perceived today by brands? Hervé de Rivoire - Above all, brands try to positively surprise and astonish their customers. The promotional packaging sector for end of the year festivities, Mothers Day, etc..., remains dynamic and most brands traditionally present a gift pack usually containing an eau-de-toilette and a bath product. Metal is still very topical. It remains a very qualitative material when it is finely wrought. It can be beautifully decorated thanks to the offset process using up to 6 colors. We can use mat or shiny lacquers to give a depth of field aspect or play with optical effects. With the embossing process we can increase the visual impact. Metal is an excellent media for brands having a particular story to ""tell""! Premium Beauty News – Did this new strategy call for specific industrial investments? Hervé de Rivoire - In our European factories (in Burgundy and Wales) We have the proper tools to offer a wide range of boxes and cases with cylindrical and square shapes. We are thinking of expanding this range in order to adjust with the current trends in shapes. We are on permanent watch with our printing ink suppliers to offer new decoration finishes. The Massilly group annually invests an average of 7% of its turnover in the industrial tool. Premium Beauty News – Shouldn't' the success of My Box by Massilly partly rely on Asia in terms of industrial tools? Hervé de Rivoire - We carried out a market study, end of 2008 - early 2009, on our clients expectations. They want to surprise and innovate. The promotional pack they are looking for must follow the same direction. We can print on boxes of standard shapes and our European entities have a leadership in that domain. If brands want to go beyond the visual impact, Asia has tremendous advantages to offer: we can then work on the most daring shapes, by associating for example, metal with other materials, this was very trendy in 2008 (metal and faux leather, metal and plastic, glued fabric, etc..). Metal can be wrought, cut with an openwork design to unveil the product. This can be achieved within very attractive time limits,. ""My Box"" offers a dual approach: an European offer for standards, an Asian offer for innovative shapes. What also emerged strongly from the study we undertook, is our customers expectation to rely on an ""industrial"" service even if production comes from Asia. Our customers are not just looking for a purchase/resale offer; they want industrial support throughout project development and quality monitoring once the goods are delivered. This is where ""My Box"" stands out by providing our customers with this industrial rigor which has been illustrating the products of the Massilly group for 50 years. We can also offer storage space in our French and European production sites which can also contribute to optimal service. Premium Beauty News - A new year begins. What goals have you set yourselves to improve the marketing of your products in the beauty sector? Hervé de Rivoire - We want to be in a leading position within 5 years. In addition to the contacts already established with some perfum and cosmetics brands, we will, this year, carry on our communication and canvassing actions, in addition to our participation in the following shows, Pack&Gift, Emballage, Luxe Pack and probably in an unusual way, at MakeUp in Paris."
Shiseido bets on overseas markets,"For Shinzo Maeda, Shiseido's president, there is no alternative to growing abroad, mainly in China and Asian emerging markets. The company can no longer wait for the waking up of the Japanese market and actually does not believe its home market would ever bring the dynamism that international competition now requires. ""Japan is a mature market with a decreasing population,"" Mr Maeda explains. Shiseido wants to increase the share of overseas markets in its turnover from 35% today to 50% by 2017, with the aim to become ""a global player representing Asia with its origins in Japan."" During the year 2009, Shiseido has expanded its sales channels in Egypt, Morocco, Laos and Azerbaijan. Shiseido's strategy for overseas development features three main axes: – ""Innovating the Shiseido global brand"" with the aim to integrate the image of the brand as high quality, highly functional and global prestige cosmetics along with strengthening communication capabilities. Additionally, efforts are being directed toward improving the counselling skills of the brands approximately 9,000 Beauty Consultants worldwide, excluding Japan. – ""Development of the City Concept strategy"", whereby the world's major markets are considered as city-based rather than country-based units, and whereby management resources are concentrated on target cities. – ""Expansion of operations in new and emerging markets."" Measures for innovating the Shiseido global brand include initiatives such as augmenting the product line-up, remodelling the functions and design of counters and strengthening the customer service skills of Beauty Consultants (BCs). The company underlines the importance of BCs' training in order to expand in-store share in mature markets. According to Shiseido, BCs must communicate brand value and deepen the relationship with customers, ""which the brand has cultivated over the years in the Japanese market underpinned by omotenashi (hospitality) activities."" In certain countries, such as Switzerland, the new strategy implied to being able to manage business via direct operations, and company announced last month that it would took over its sales agent in the country, As other for many major players, such as French cosmetics giant L'Oréal, Shiseido considers China and Asian emerging markets as the areas with the main potential for growth in the next years. ""Asia, and particularly China, will remain the engine of our growth enabling us to achieve our goal of globalisation by 2017,"" says Shinzo Maeda. According to Beijing's official statistics, the Chinese cosmetics market should grow from 60 million users in 2009 to 200 million by 2015 and 400 by 2020. With regard to China, Shiseido anticipates a growth of more than 20% of its sales over 2010-2011, a figure to compare approximately 15% upwards expected this year. The company's share of the Chinese market would be around 10%, similar to Procter & Gamble and L'Oréal, its main global competitors. The Japanese group intends to capitalize on the good image and the high quality reputation of its products in Asia, where the group enjoys 50 years of experience. However, its Shiseido brand, which has been sold only in department stores and at specialty retailers in China to date, may remain too expensive for most of the Chinese population. In order to increase its market share and to tap into the increasing demand, the company has scheduled the launch of a new line of ""affordable luxury cosmetics"" in March 2010. Under the name DQ, the line will be put up on the shelves of around 600 drugstores in major cities like Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou in the first year. ""Although the channel currently comprises roughly 10% of the market, it is continuously achieving double-digit growth and is expected to grow further in the future,"" the company says in release. After their debuts in China, DQ-branded products should be introduced in other Asian countries that the Japanese group considers as a natural extension of its home market. Shiseido, which intends to be present everywhere in Asia, started the activities of its wholly owned Vietnamese subsidiary in December. Historically, Shiseido commenced sales of its prestige products via a distributor in Vietnam in 1997. As competition is becoming more intense, Shiseido made the decision to establish a new company in order to further enhance its presence in the market by developing marketing activities. In addition to its high-end Shiseido and Clé de Peau Beauté brands, the Tokyo-based manufacturer intend to expand regular users of its products through developing the Za brand targeting the expanding middle-income group in Asia. Shiseido had carried out the best results of its history in 2007-2008 with an operating profit of 63 billion yens for a turnover of 723 billion. However, its turnover dropped by 4.6% and its operating profit of 21.4%, over 2008-2009. With its Three-Year Plan (FY2008 - FY2010), the company pledged to get back to record results as of 2011-2012."
The ambitions of Piramal Glass,"""Impressive"" is the only word one can think of when enumerating the number of furnaces and production lines of the biggest Indian glassmaker specialized in perfumery and cosmetics. Piramal Glass only owned in 1984, two furnaces dedicated to pharmaceuticals and its turnover at the time was barely reaching a million euros. Yes, you did actually read, one million euros… compared to the billion dollars achieved this year by the group, which is also active in pharmaceuticals, life science research, financial services, real estate and production of glass containers, 40% of which being dedicated to perfumery and cosmetics [1]. Another figure speaks for itself: Piramal claims to be the world's leading producer of bottles for nail polishes, i.e. one billion bottles per year! Who can top that? Especially when you know the group was not producing a single bottle in 1998. By the way, Piramal Glass' growth rate this year will be of +15% compared to 2008. A story worthy of a country's booming economy. ""That's right, confirms Vijay Shah, Managing Director. Our progression has been particularly rapid and we are on the right tracks to meet the highest quality standards for perfume and cosmetic bottles"". A quick glance at the industrial tool shows that managers at Piramal group spared no efforts concerning industrial investments since twenty years. First plant, the one of Kosamba, India, which has no fewer than six ovens. A first one of 25 tons / day to produce Type 1 glass with three production lines, which will incidentally, see its capacity rise, within six months, to 40 tons / day with the addition of another line. A second oven of 40 tons / day with four production lines for antibiotic bottles and nail polish bottles. A third oven of 75 tons / day (amber glass) with three production lines which will be dedicated, within one year, to perfumery and cosmetics. Finally, three other furnaces of 35 tons (4 lines), 65 tons (5 lines) with a capacity that will be increased to 100 tons / day in July, and the last and most recent one, of 100 tons / day (five lines) with a dye feeder. This first plant also has an array of workshops dedicated to finishing (screen printing, lacquering, hot stamping, glass etching, installation of retractable sleeve etc.). Second plant, the one in Jambusar, also in India, which has a first furnace of 245 tons / day (6 production lines) dedicated to pharmaceuticals, and a second furnace of 125 tons / day (white glass, 6 lines) for the food industry, perfumery and cosmetics mass market. Then, the plant in Sri Lanka's where the production capacity of the furnace was simply doubled 18 months ago to step up to 250 tons / day (5 lines), the production of which is mainly for the local market and the production of containers for spirits. Finally the fourth production plant in the U.S. (erstwhile Wheaton Glass) taken over in 2005 and which now has two furnaces of 100 tons / day each with a total of 8 production lines, 60% being dedicated to perfumery and cosmetics. Not to mention two finishing units. Over 120 million euro investments in three years. This is the total investment of Piramal Glass in three years time, including some 50 million in the United States and 70 million in India and Sri Lanka. ""Today, explains Vijay Shah, perfumery and cosmetics account for 39% of our business. It will represent 55% in three years"". ""In the world, the global market for glass in perfumery and cosmetics is estimated to 2 billion dollars, says Vijay Shah, and we believe holding 5% of the market. Our clients are: Elisabeth Arden, Estée Lauder, L'Oréal, LVMH, Yves Rocher, YSL Beauté, Shiheido, Orlane, Cofinluxe, Coty, PNG... We are subject to very thorough and regular audits at all our plants. Our efforts in cosmetics and perfumery are supplemented with the presence of in-house design studio."" ""Our ambitions? They are quite simple: to become one of the top 3 key players in the perfumery and cosmetics industry. We're on the right path! """
Cosmeco : specialized in dummies for lipsticks broadens its offer,"57 injection machines, 44 finishing machines a dozen assembly machines ....! Who can that be? A French SME, Cosmeco, created by Michel Poignant and now headed by his son, Alexandre [1]. A SME displaying nonetheless, sizeable industrial strike force and technical skills! Starting point for the firm and still remaining today a main specialty: dummy testers for lipsticks. To do so, the firm has been working for over thirty years with an Austrian injector, Wampl Plastic, whose factory is twenty minutes away from Zurich and who has a flawless reputation in the field of injection of colored parts. "" Dummy testers still represent 60% of our business"", says Alexandre Poignant, Cosmeco's COO. Second string to the bow of the firm, another industrial partner, a German one this time, the AHA company, which is known for mastering the manufacturing of large capacity pump dispensers. But AHA is also acquiring a solid reputation in the injection of parts partially composed with plant derived material. All this in connection with Bower Ag, a Swiss company that has been developing and marketing for the last few weeks industrial products derived from wet biomass, including plastic granulates, under the brand Agriplast, of PP, PE, PS, ABS type, made with 50% of plant fibers. ""And that's not all, underlines Alexandre Poignant, since we have become as of last year exclusive representatives in France for products designed by the Korean company Joycos which manufactures airless containers, jars, mascaras, tubes, make-up cases, in particular airtight cases"". "" It is clear that we're considerably diversifying and broadening Cosmeco's field of activity, with both the catalog of the Korean company Joycos and the offers from the German and Swiss firms, AHA and Biowert Ag "", insists Michel Poignant. ""You can easily guess that demand for this kind of products half of them made from bio material continues to grow"". The process developed by the Swiss firm is at least very original, simply because it finds its origin in the grass cut by farmers within a radius of five kilometers around the factory. With 5000 tones of forage, annually, it is possible to produce some 500 tones of plastic granulates 50% of which is composed of plant fibers (the rest being PP, PE, PS or ABS). Main constraints: raw material must be moist and should not contain any pieces of wood or other impurities. The length of the cut grass should range between 4 and 8 cm. According to Alexandre Poignant, the main advantages of this raw material used to produce injected parts are ""a very competitive price, improved stability of the shape, stiffness and abrasion resistance of formed parts, plain color - which can be a real plus - an almost non-existent smell due to a high degree of purification of fibers, but also the reduction of the weight of the finished products and, most of all, the possibility of waste disposal with no left over residue, by the means of combustion or biological degradation"". ""The product catalog from Joycos, is surely today the most comprehensive one regarding ranges of airless containers, and its ability to manufacture airtight make-up cases suits exactly market demand,"" underlines Alexandre Poignant."
BeautyFULL Club: a dynamic program for 2010,"Premium Beauty News - Not so easy to develop a new club during crisis times Charles-Emmanuel Gounod - It's true and you're right. However, the BeautyFULL Club proved quite resistant to the economic storm that shook and is still shaking our sector. I remind you that the sector's activity has never decreased so deeply since the 1930s. And it's probably why an initiative such as the BeautyFULL Club was really needed. Actually, what a better time than these dire times for professionals of the beauty sector to gather themselves, discuss, and having a better view of the future? Today, we have around sixty members. And they are very motivated: just consider the success of our information breakfasts. There are many companies interested in joining us. Our concern is to balance the number of members from the supply side with members from the customer side. Premium Beauty News - Actually the year 2009 was quite chaotic for the beauty sector Charles-Emmanuel Gounod - Yes, but I'd like to insist that, in such a context, our members are even more convinced of the usefulness and the relevancy of a club like ours. And our programme for the year 2010 can demonstrate this point. More than ever, we have the will to be the main meeting point of our sector. Premium Beauty News - So let's talk about this programme Charles-Emmanuel Gounod - The club's website is now fully operational and our members can use discussion forums. Of course, we plan to organise and even accelerate the frequency of our breakfasts (almost one per month) and to organise several lunch-debates. Regarding other actions, we also plan: – A wider opening toward young professionals and the new professions, through the creation of a junior membership for those less than 35 year-old, in order to bring them competences and allow them to stand by a high level professional network. In this context, we are considering to cooperate with several graduate schools. – The creation at the end of 2010 of a BeautyFULL Club Award with an award ceremony honouring creative and development teams."
The European ambitions of Topline Products,"Four years in a row (from 2006 to 2009), Topline Products was acknowledged as being one of the 50 best performing companies in New Jersey. And last year Charles Chang decided to extend the influence of his company to Europe by opening an office in Paris. Premium Beauty News - If we look into the story of Topline, we end up understanding that you anticipated what appears today as being one of the biggest shifts of the beauty industry worldwide, namely the strategy of beauty brands in having almost completely recourse to subcontractors. Charles Chang - True, I very quickly had the feeling that perfumery and cosmetics brands would more frequently resort to this type of sub-contracting. This was in the nature of things. Because the first vocation of these companies is to create concepts, products, promote them and market them. If they can find an efficient organization allowing them to reduce constraints related to production and logistics. Why should they do without? A pioneer, yes! We were as of early 1980s, one of the first few companies in the world to work with orient in the cosmetic packaging containers. In the mid-1990s, we were the pioneer of introducing quality filled cosmetics from China to the US market. Premium Beauty News - What has changed over the last few years is that this range of services has even coupled with an offer in terms of complete standard lines, including formulations. Charles Chang - Absolutely! And this is what has propelled us to where we are today. A company able to perform a complete full service offer with a true creative vocation. May I remind you that we own more than 25 patents in the United States and worldwide. Premium Beauty News - Some of your product innovations have helped you build your reputation. Charles Chang - That's right! We even received prestigious awards. I can name the ""Dual Hinged Compact"", a Topline patented product adopted by L'Oreal, but also the Infaillible Lipstick tube/ Lip Gloss duo also designed for L'Oreal, Max Factor Loose Powder Jar with Brush for P&G, not to mention the French Manicure Pen for Sephora. And we are also proud of being the first full service supplier for Estée Lauder with the supply of a complete make-up palette made in China in 2003. Premium Beauty News - To achieve this you need an industrial tool? Charles Chang - The tool itself is not enough! You must focus on performance each time. Innovation springs from, both the development of our formulations, or of course, from packaging and distribution systems. As for the industrial tool, it is sizeable. As of 1995, we opened our first 100% owned factory in Shanghai, now specialized in metal processing, which manufactures, among others products, the eyelash curler for Maybeline, Cover Girl and Max Factor, not to mention metal compacts. Also in 1998, we integrated the production of cosmetic ingredients. We are now able to make complete line of colour cosmetics. In 2000, we added a new production unit, this time dedicated to plastic injection, which now has no fewer than 150 presses, not to mention all the finishing material to manufacture indifferently, compacts, closures, jars, lipstick tubes lipgloss etc... It operates with some 1,500 people. In 2002 we opened a third facility dedicated to brushes and powder puffs. And today we can produce everything, or so. Premium Beauty News - Your customers were mostly Americans? Charles Chang - At the beginning, yes essentially! But things have changed considerably in recent years. Firstly, the companies in the beauty industry have become global companies. We can no longer say that such and such group is now American, English or French ... Factories are everywhere, as are marketing teams and the demand has become global too. Our customers operate all around the world, and their names are L'Oreal, Avon, Estée Lauder, Lancôme, Sephora, Mary Kay, P&G, Inter Parfums, etc. Insofar as our offer also includes quality standards asked for by these same brands, they turn to us. This explains why we had to open last year, a European base in Paris, headed by Jean-Robert Bonneil, who has an experience of more than 15 years in our sector and has a very good knowledge of the market and its European operators. Our presence in Europe is, of course, fully justified because on the one hand our customers are global and operating here, on the other hand Europe remains the largest market in the world for beauty. The growing acceptability of the made in China full service by European consumers has confirmed our choice to tap into this market. Furthermore, Topline has a unique expertise covering both packaging and product"
"""Our industry must focus on innovation,"" Ulrich Griebel, Schwan STABILO Cosmetics","Premium Beauty News - What are Schwan STABILO Cosmetics' main assets today? Ulrich Griebel - Schwan STABILO remains the global leader in cosmetic pencils. This is not such an obvious fact, because the current market is totally different from what it was 5 or 10 years ago. Basically, there are more players. But we started very early to expand our regional base to international sites. We produce where our markets are the most dynamic. It is a well-tested strategy. We currently have six sites abroad. The latest to date, which was founded in 2008 is located in Mexico. It's a very important market, since it represented just a short time ago the largest Latin American market. It has since been surpassed by Brazil, where we have been producing successfully for some time now. Our strategy has proved all its efficiency, particularly during the crisis last year. Given that economically speaking, Latin America is on a strong upward slope, the crisis has been much less severe there than in North America or Europe. This is also true for Asia. Schwan STABILO thus profits from a good situation on the international stage. We certainly feel the effects of crisis, especially in the United States, where even large companies yet well established and stable, specialized in consumer goods and marketing products having nothing to do with the segment of luxury goods, had to cope with a decrease of 7 to 8%. Schwan STABILO managed to maintain its position. We ended the last fiscal year with over 180 million Euros in turnover. Of course we undoubtedly recorded a 2% decline in comparison with the previous year, but we were also able to consolidate our financial data and financial base through an appropriate liquidity management and we are currently enjoying a more advantageous and safer situation than a year ago. So much for the broad lines. Our core operations remain unchanged (we are in this respect undoubtedly very regular, persistent and resistant): cosmetic pencils. These include traditional wooden pencils, cosmetic pencils to sharpen with a plastic cap, slim size mechanical pencils and our liquid eyeliners (fluid products) in the form of cosmetic free ink and ink eyeliners. Not forgetting our mascaras, which is a sector with a very positive development in recent years and which is on the brink of becoming an integral part of our core business. Premium Beauty News - What were the last main industrial investments? Ulrich Griebel - As I said, we successfully opened a new production site in Mexico last year. A production plant for state-of-the-art plastic injection, and dedicated to new technologies (such as 2K technique), and worth 6 million Euros, was also founded in Weissenburg (Germany). In addition, we are fully involved in the development of decoration processes. An approach that represents quite a challenge, since ""raw"" pencils offers little scope for variation. It is therefore especially important to create clear differentiations and to provide added value to cosmetic pencils through innovative designs or visual and haptic effects. Furthermore, we have heavily invested in the area of liquid products (liquid eyeliners). There is an array of new models (such as ""Dip-Pens""), a large number of inks, newly developed shades and a lot more. Another field of action and a considerable challenge was the one concerning reformulation of cosmetic formulaes in order to satisfy current legislation. I am referring in particular to D5 (Decamethylcyclopentasiloxan). A well-known basic raw material used in large quantities, particularly in cosmetics where it is still authorized, but will probably be banned in some countries, as of next year. In this context, we were able to suggest outline solutions going even beyond the simple substitution of D5. In addition to the first approach consisting in the replacement of D5 by a suitable component, we managed, using D5-free ingredients, to enhance products characteristics. At the same time, we also solved the issue concerning PVC-free packing materials and are operating on the market with these products. This point is also solved. If you consider all these compliance issues which also have an effect upon various laws, and they were quite a few of them in the past 2 years we have obtained, indiscriminately, good solutions, we are already active on the market with our products and thanks to them, we will surely win some market shares in 2010. Premium Beauty News - What were Schwan's most important launches of the year 2009? Ulrich Griebel - Actually, 2009 didn't give us the opportunity for new processes, but it will be much more remembered as a year where many unsolved issues where ended up, such as the D5, I just spoke about, the future of which in the branch was already uncertain for 3 or 4 years, destabilizing the cosmetics industry and regularly generating policy changes. Up to now, there were no good answers, but we addressed many topics of this kind in 2009 in order to devote ourselves now serenely to innovative and promising themes. Premium Beauty News - Don't you think that the current economic context might hinder efforts toward sustainability? What objectives your group has set in the environmental area? Ulrich Griebel - There's no doubt about that. The start-ups that gradually imposed themselves on the market and more specifically in the segments of organic cosmetics, sustainability and environmental friendliness are certainly still present. But the strong trend that emerged 1 or 2 years ago which was behind the strong interest regarding this topic has currently dropped. In this regard, we notice a back to basics trend. However, on the other hand, we notice that companies that were already operating in this sector in the past and who have been following these issues for several years, remain active. They continue to grow even in times of crisis, maybe more slowly than before, but they are growing and we assume that in the medium and long term, topics focused on environment will have fully or more easily imposed themselves. In this segment, Schwan STABILO's development is proven, but there are no major changes. We have for instance, a wide range of Ecocert certified products, in other words we can now offer our full range of pencils to sharpen as natural cosmetic products and also as products certified according to Ecocert standards, not just with one single texture, but with many more in a various number of categories. At the same time, we are also developing the sectors of mascaras, liquids eyeliners and mechanical pencils. Premium Beauty News - In your opinion, what trends will strongly impact the cosmetics sector within the next years? Ulrich Griebel - I think we should make a distinction here between the near future and what may impact the industry far beyond. What 2010 has in store for us is already clearly visible. Competition in this sector is likely to be tougher than ever. All brands, all manufacturers are struggling market shares. We notice in some markets that the segment of luxury goods, which was almost spared during all the economic cycles, in recent years, seems this time more impacted. Moreover, there is no certainty that consumers will return to old traditional consumption patterns once the economic crisis is over. Therefore, there may well be a chance that the retail sector generates gaps within segments, resulting in a significant increase in pressure on distribution channels as well as a much stronger pressure applied by distribution channels themselves. Between providers and brands, we are witnessing an unrestrained price war. Undoubtedly, this struggle, is currently ruling the whole industry! Premium Beauty News - What message would you like to pass on to the whole beauty industry at the end of 2009? Ulrich Griebel - To be quite honest, my message is quite clear. Price competition, battles to win market shares through product discounting are, in my view, conceivable, but in the medium and long term, the all-important issue will be to know how to attract male and female consumers in stores. Here again, it seems clear that consumers of both sexes will only enter stores if they are sure to find captivating, exciting and thrilling products. If they are just less expensive, then we will witness, in the short or medium term, a withholding of purchases and a buyers' strike. Customers will no longer buy a product simply because it's cheaper or more convenient, regardless of the brand. Industry must pick up the thread of innovation to fill again with wonder new consumers of both sexes. Price war can only be an interlude. Premium Beauty News - As a conclusion, what would you expect for Schwan STABILO Cosmetics in the year 2010? Ulrich Griebel - We expect a stabilization next year. Changes will definitely take place. Changes between some segments, changes in supply chains, changes in customer relations, but all this will stabilize itself in 2010. The landscape will probably be somewhat different in some places and I think we will then reach a new base enabling us to move forward in the direction of promising key themes focusing on products concepts, customer orientation and innovation. Interview by Dr. Kerstin Lötzerich-Bernhard (December 2009)"
International Lacquers becomes I.L. Cosmetics,"With 11 million euros of investment in five years, nearly half the annual turnover of his company (23 million Euros), including six million by 2011, Jean-François Harpes, CEO and owner of International Lacquers (IL), seems to be unaware of the crisis. Actually, market figures are self-explanatory. The market of nail polish has increased steadily between 2008 and 2009 (8% in Germany). In present times, such dynamism is almost sheer provocation. The famous ""lipstick effect"" seems to have also fully impacted the nail segment. And icing on the cake, the situation is the same for mascara, lip gloss and eyeliner. Areas where, precisely, Jean-François Harpes has diversified his business in 1999 and 2003 by creating successively a filling / packaging unit, Interpack, and a production unit for make-up products, Luxcos. ""This diversification matches IL's desire to provide customers with a wide range of products in full service, thereby enhancing its philosophy of value for money. Actually, the supply chain system manages projects from their initiation to their final delivery, which allows a step by step monitoring and an appropriate answer to each client,"" he says. This diversification allows IL to rely on a 50/50 distribution of its turnover with the help of make-up, in the next five years, while enamel still currently accounts for 80%. ""Make-up, says Jean-François Harpes, is already on a six million euro trend in turnover by the end of 2010"" Under these conditions, International Lacquers could no longer bear the same name. "" From the beginning of 2010, we will change the group's name to IL Cosmetics and keep International Lacquers for enamels, Luxcos for make-up and Interpack for packaging with a supply chain approach"", Jean-François Harpes says, ""which doesn't fundamentally change things a lot since our customers were already widely using the contraction of our denomination"". At the same time, IL reinforces both its quality and technical team, and sales team, and will be certified ISO 9001 at the end of next year. ""The Full-Service axis will be more clearly identified at the beginning of next year, but IL Cosmetics will continue to invest heavily in the production with the goal to shift from 300 million to 450 million units of nail polishes and 20 million to 40 million units in make-up!"" IL Cosmetics hopes to double its production capacity in the nail polish, mascara, eyeliner and lip gloss segments. With strong assets on a dynamic market, IL has made what is necessary to supply it, in particular the mass market where the company has a real expertise."
Leoplast: the bioplastic axis,"Leoplast's managers were required a lot of courage to let their company take a completely new course. Nonetheless, their company, based in the area of Turin, dealing in plastic injection and specialized in cosmetic packaging, entered into the era of bioplastics in 2004. ""Courage, I don't know, he explains, but will, surely! Anyway we had no other choice. There was a chance that our traditional markets slipped to Asia. Our costs were becoming prohibitive. It was absolutely necessary to find new ways and most of all pull out one day, of resins derived from fossil fuels, petrochemical plastic"". Leoplast's good fortune was to be situated at the heart of the most active area in Italy (Piedmont), in terms of organic farming and environmental issues. There's even a polytechnic centre in Turin specialized in the study and processing of agro-plastics with whom Leoplast collaborates. Five years later, the Italian firm converts about 12% of its products in vegetal plastics and 10% in regenerated plastic. ""These figures may seem meaningless, but in fact it's extremely encouraging, says Graziano Reggiani. Simply because only the smaller players in the industry made the shift first. Larger players are starting to wake-up."" And it's quite a concern ... seeing the big ones waking-up. Because investments involved require necessarily larger markets than the small or medium quantities only ordered by the more modest players in the market. Also a good way to make more competitive a technology and products whose costs may still seem prohibitive (+ 30% to 40% on average). In five years, the ground covered, technically, by the Italian company was considerable. Because transforming plastics from plants is far from simple. The choice of Leoplast focused essentially on 100% vegetal ingredients derived agro-materials. The cycle times are slower, production waste is more important, ""materials"" are subject to ""shrinkage"" after injection, problems related to static electricity, mastering transformation temperatures etc.. Not to mention the narrowness of the suppliers market for raw material that still comes down to two or three major players. ""Today we have our business well under control"", explains says Graziano Reggiani. Since 2007, the company markets a full line of make-up (lipstick tubes, compact, eye shadow) which is 100% Ingeo based (polilactic acid). Leoplast, even launched recently a mascara with a bioplastic brush and stem and a glass vial. To note also, in joint venture with Socoplas, another Italian plastic bottle convertor, the marketing of a bottle with its closure (made by Leoplast) in PLA and cellulose acetate. Confident in the future? ""More than ever, insists Graziano Reggiani. We really feel that the market is starting to react. And we have a comfortable lead""."
Axilone triples its capacity in China,"Since last July, Axilone, Ileos Group, has given itself the means to triple its production capacity in China by making operational a new building of 16 000 sqm. Main activity of the plant, the production of lipstick tubes and caps (metal and plastic) for perfumery and cosmetics. The ambition of the French group is to become a major player in the global industry of lipstick tubes exploiting fully the synergy of metal and plastic. In order to achieve this, Axilone has just released a new mechanism of 11 mm in diameter much more efficient. In addition to its factories in China, Spain (specialized in metal stamping), Axilone also owns two more factories in France, in Auray and Guidel (caps, compacts), with a acknowledged expertise in the field of bi-injection and Surlyn and PCTG processing."
Intercos seeks always more creativity,"""Nothing will be the same anymore and we must be more than ever creative and efficient in terms of products ... more responsive also to quickly respond market requirements"", explains Dario Ferrari, for whom this crisis, however, occurred at a time when the industrial position of Intercos was ""totally stabilized worldwide"". ""Our industrial tools are operating perfectly, which is not the case, the least we can say, with many businesses in the sector where the equipment is often obsolete. We are solidly established in the United States where our capacity doubled last year. In Europe, and especially in Italy, where we surely have one of the most modern production unit in the world. We will surely be operating in Brazil in the coming months, a country where we are already very much in demand. Finally, we are reaping the benefits of our presence in China, where as you remember, we currently have four plants. For our customers is means security. This part of the world already weighs more than 10% of our industrial turnover and I think that with the kind of growth rate we are experiencing, it could represent half of our industrial activity in seven years "". For this reason, it is in this part of the world and from this region, according to Dario Ferrari, that many things relevant of the cosmetic world will be at stake, if only the huge market that it represents and the competition it will cause between suppliers from all parts of the world. ""This is one reason, he says, that led us to think over our strategic and commercial approach by creating as of next year, a new division, Smart Beauty, with the aim of offering complete standard lines ( including packaging), very innovative and with attractive prices ... Clearly, we want to tap into the market of competitors dealing in packaging and promotional items"". But Dario Ferrari underlines that Intercos's first asset ""remains and will always remain in the ability to find and develop new formulas."" And at this level, the Italian company does not appear to lack imagination. ""Next year, we will again market nearly 150 new products. Our activity is also very sound in the universe of pencils where we will continue to strengthen ourselves, and our development strategy on the skincare segment is particularly promising with new products and designs planned for next year""."
MWV continues to grow in airless and reinforces its production in Mexico,"Premium Beauty News – Broadly speaking, it seems that crisis has not too much impacted MWV's performance. Why? Thomas Jonas - Unfortunately crisis has not spared us by sheer magic! However, we reacted very quickly and we immediately adjusted our industrial tool to the new market reality. As you remember, my responsibilities cover at the same time the whole dispensing part, namely, pumps (perfumery / cosmetics, personal care, etc..) for all applications and the pistol activity (triggers), but also the cardboard processing activity. And on the whole, it's true, we will undoubtedly be one of the few companies in the universe of packaging to record better results this year than in 2008! The main reason, beyond reorganizations, is the diversity of our business portfolio. The very strong demand related to H1N1 influenza with soap pumps where we are leaders, and taking market share in the European cardboard market or in cosmetic pumps, has helped us counterbalance the downfall experienced by the Perfume industry this year. We also notice that some new market segments are attracted by the pump, which allows our customers to reinforce the functionality of their packaging and therefore the value perceived by consumers. Premium Beauty News - Of course people speak a lot of theincreasing demand for airless systems, with a market expected to double in the three next years. This must help quite a lot to boost the business you inherited from the Keltec company, when you took it over three years ago. Thomas Jonas – Quite true! The ground covered in three years time, is impressive. The whole production part, initially at Keltec in Holland, was dispatched and redeveloped in several sites worldwide to be closer to the needs of our customers. Spain, of course, where we have a historic factory in Barcelona, then Asia and now Mexico. Each of these units is set up on the same model in terms of production capacity to cope, you are right, with strong demand. Our ability to produce globally our airless systems offers flexibility to our customers for their launches, and this is one of our specificity. The Research and Developments Center for Airless stayed in Holland, where there is a very creative team. Premium Beauty News - Your airless range is like no other Thomas Jonas – Actually, our technology is built around the Rolling Bellow that combines several functions in one single piece, thanks to its unique design. There is no metal spring, which eliminates some compatibility problems. The Luna and Pearl lines that range from 30 ml to 150 ml, offer an excellent evacuation rate and are easy to fill. Premium Beauty News - Everyone is currently working on new airless designs. Particularly for new shapes. Of course it is your case too? Thomas Jonas - Indeed! And some of these novelties should be created next year. Moreover, I insist on the fact that the Rolling Bellow technology is suitable for the development of new shapes."
Toly wants to be a major player in airless !,"Just a short flashback ... Five years ago, Toly only owned one factory in Malta. Today, the Toly Group has four manufacturing plants and nine sales offices worldwide. Toly's manufacturing plant in Malta employs some three hundred people and operates forty-five injection moulding machines. Investment in the Malta plant is constant; just last August Toly announced plans to construct a new ultra modern eco unit. Toly's Chinese plant in Shenzhen, which opened four years ago, currently employs two hundred people and operates some nineteen injection moulding machines, primarily producing compacts and various caps and closures. In India, Toly has set up base in a new manufacturing facility, which opened at the end of 2008. The plant, located in Dehradun is the first Western packaging supplier in the field of make-up and today consists of a hundred employees and eleven brand new injection moulding machines, producing closures and caps, lipstick tubes and Kajal pencils. Last but not least is Toly's fourth manufacturing plant. Located in Korea, it specialises in the production of airless packaging. This area of the Toly Group, known asTAP- Toly Airless Packaging consists of seventy employees and thirteen injection machines. Airless, a niche market, in which Toly has every intention of becoming one of the market leaders.""One of the component in terms of innovation"", explains Andy Gatesy, CEO,"" implies new airless concepts and new shapes. And to play with shapes, there is only one solution, you must use systems with a pouch"". This is one of the reasons why the Korean factory was recently equipped with a new assembly line with pouches. During various presentations throughout the world, the company was able to recently display containers very different in shapes and sizes like airless jars, mini airless systems, slimline airless, double-wall airless, a new airless closing system, etc. .... An expertise which will also include pump manufacturing and assembling. Mascara and lipgloss, a segment for which the Group has announced the construction over the coming months, of a production unit for vials, in its factory in Malta. ""Knowing that we will outsource the production of brushes to industry specialists"", says Andy Gatesy,"" we will also work with suppliers in Taiwan and Korea to offer an extensive standard range, and we still have a strong alliance with our Japanese partner Sinwa"". The company is currently working on a new range of applicators which will be launched in 2010. Several development strategies that must not let us forget that the firm is always very active on traditional areas such as make-up boxes. It has designed this year some 25 new standard lines including an eco-friendly range with a 50% composition based on wood fibres. Not forgetting a whole range of new palettes for Dior, Sephora, Yves Rocher, Jemma Kidd etc..."
"SGD Asia: ""managing growth""","SGD in Asia is worth EUR 30 million in turnover, a furnace with a 60 000 tonne capacity per year to supply five production lines, 800 staff and a double-digit growth. Some data to better understand what Cyril Ruiz Moise, Deputy General Manager, VP Sales, modestly calls ""managing growth"". The plant owned by the SGD group in China produces both glass for the perfumery and cosmetic industry (50%) and pharmacy. Three lines are dedicated to the perfumery and cosmetic segment, the production of which is sent to Asia (80%) with China as preferred customer. ""China is a country where local brands are starting to grow strongly"", says Cyril Ruiz Moise, ""this explains the growth rates we are experiencing, bearing in mind that, all the same, we were starting from scratch in 2006, when we decided to give a perfume-orientation to the factory"". In particular, the brands of the Jahwa group, some of them having an international vocation, brands for which SGD Asia supplied a wide range of bottles. ""It is true that this growth might surprise many, admit people at SGD Asia, but is important to note that our tool still has strong reserve capacities"". Latest investments to date, in 2006, the workshop dedicated to decoration, the equipment of facilities used for finishing techniques in clean atmosphere and the implementation of quality control tools. Main orientation in 2009 for the Asian entity of the French glassmaker, to focus on more standards, with a brand new range just unveiled in Hong Kong during the last Cosmoprof Asia."
"Jackel: the ""full service"" offer is a key axis!","Premium Beauty News - Jackel has significantly improved its full service offer. The scope of your business now goes far beyond packaging. Vanessa Lecomte - Our formulation and packaging activity began in 2002 with our first plant, JV Cosmetics located in the area of Guangdong (Southern China). It was dedicated to makeup. In 2007, we moved the factory to Zhangmutou, still in southern China, to broaden our activity to the formulation of skin care products and packaging of OTC products and perfume. Until September 2008, this activity was primarily developed on the U.S. market - less reluctant to Made in China labels - thanks to the impulse given by our client Elizabeth Arden, who relied on us for the production of a large number of blockbusters and promotional references. In September 2008, we opened ourselves to the European market in particular by improving the quality of our formulations. The outcome is that today we have a catalogue of about forty classic and mineral formulations. Premium Beauty News - What is your offer in the universe of makeup? Vanessa Lecomte - A wide array of formulations ""by Jackel"". On the one hand, the classics: lipsticks, gloss, mascara, eyeliners, eye shadows (cream, mousse and powder), concealers, illuminators, foundation, complexion correctors, blush, cooked blush, bronzing powders, loose powders, pressed powders and eyebrow powders.

Launches: Bormioli Luigi's know-how,"Each year, Bormioli Luigi illustrates the variety of its competences through a simple idea: showcasing the latest launches of prestigious products in which the company participated Premium Beauty News has selected some of the most illustrative examples, with the explanations of the glassmaker on its work. The latest addition in Boss' woman's perfumes collection is simply called Boss. The feminine interpretation of the design is clearly intelligible by the shape of the bottle, where a series of jewels are put in a line, contoured and enclosed by a shiny metallic band, which encapsulates the precious content. The chromatic contrast between the cold metal finishing and the warmth of the bottle is entrusted to a coloured glass, whose shading goes from rose to orange. The overall outline of the creation consists of a tall, geometrical bottle developed upon a small and squared base. The facets that sculpt the shape of the gems are smooth and clean, well defined by sharp edges. The first jewel at the base of the bottle is solid, meaning that the glass fills it completely. This accomplishment presented several issues to overcome for the glassmaker. ""Such a tall and narrow shape easily tends to incline, jeopardizing the stability of the bottle. We needed to limit the usual dimensional tolerances used in the field, assuring the complete verticality of the bottle,"" Bormioli Luigi explains. ""Furthermore, the finishing adopted, namely the metallic band which contours the profile, winding the glass through the base, was a threat for the stability of the bottle. Considering that the design required a smooth glass profile, where no recess could be added to host the metal, and knowing that the tolerances involved in the metal stitching are larger than in glass blowing, the precision of the making had to be absolute, preventing any failure."" A logo engraved onto the metallic band and then a plastic stopper representing the same ornamental motifs featured in the bottles complete this nice and original fragrance bottle. Line: Hugo Boss Customer: P&G Prestige Beauty Sizes: 30 ml; 50 ml; 75 ml Year of launch: 2009 The new fragrance in Baldessarini range, which claims to be strictly reserved to men (not women, not boys), keeps a orm of consistency with the brand's prior creations. An imposing and sober bottle is the imprinting of the Baldessarini signature. The shape is traditional, marked by the adoption of a black glass, only enriched by a golden plate showing the engraved logo. Under a technical point of view, the dig wide room at the centre of the main wall is forcedly absolutely plane, in order to perfectly fit with the metal plate. The combination of sharp edges and dark colour of glass, turning into intricacies, pushed the glassmaker to develop some original techniques to detect glass irregularities and defectiveness, in order to ensure the highest level of quality. Line: Baldessarini Customer: P&G Prestige Beauty Sizes: 50 ml, 90 ml Year of launch: 2009 True is the latest addition in American Eagle men's fragrances range. Immediately at a glance the look of the bottle reveals the consumer it is targeted for: the young and sporty, dynamic man. The bottle, with a strong aspect, is a rectangular container where the pureness of glass melts with the cold energy of the steel and the technical yet enjoying touch of the black rubber. ""This making presented many constraints,"" explains Bormioli Luigi's staff The manufacturing starts from a heavy mass of glass, ""whose behaviour would suit more rounded shapes; nonetheless this bottle features very small details to be carved in the glass surfaces, namely the rough side wall"". Actually, the squared yet embroidered shape imposed the adoption of a complex and tricky moulding system. ""This ensures the exact interpretation and cleanliness of the edges and facets, in order for the special silver spray superposed to achieve a mirror-like effect, through the inside of the back glass panel"". Indeed, what Bormioli Luigi calls a ""remarkable achievement"" allows the back, sprayed silver panel, to stay opaque, while allowing the inside of the same panel the shiny reflection, through which the dark grey front logo to actually be seen twice: on the front panel where the screening took place, and, through the inside back panel, where it's full reflection can be seen clearly, as if through a mirror. The bottle is finally completed by a black logo standing on the glass face and it is topped by a round and imposing stopper, made of a chromed body coated with black rubber. Line: American Eagle Customer: American Eagle Outfitters Sizes: 60 ml Year of launch: 2009 A few years after the launch of the first fragrance for woman, Costume National is presenting its first fragrance for men, simply called Homme. The bottle design recalls the original shape of the feminine one. However, the bottle profile is taller and roughly squared. It seems that the designer, starting from the base of a squashed parallelepiped whose edges are well rounded, had pushed the centre of the bottle with his thumbs, keeping its perimeter with the other fingers. The result is that the two glass faces are coherently deformed, the front one concave and the rear convex. The thin mass of glass used allows appreciating the continuous varying camber of the edges, crowning in an absolute original design. No parting lines are visible. The bottle is then personalized with a simple yet elegant platinum logo, and topped by a small chromed cap, almost in an effort to keep a minimalist styling. ""A similar shape is very far from the normal capabilities of the equipments, and it took a lot of the man skills to have the glass blown with aesthetical coherence inside the bottle. Very often indeed the apparently simplest shapes are the most hard to reproduce in glassmaking,"" says the company. Line: Costume National Customer: Beauty San Sizes: 50 ml, 100 ml Year of launch: 2009 The first men's fragrance from the Spanish fashion designer follows one year later the launch of the woman perfume. The look of the bottle melts traditional shapes, namely the glass container, with different materials and styles, giving origin to a well recognizable product. The glass container is an imposing rectangular bottle, with a thick and regular distribution of the glass at the base and along the vertical walls. The geometric inspiration of the creation is enhanced by a metal plate inserted into a glass recess, just above the logo of the designer, the latter also being engraved in the main facet of the bottle. The glass is sprayed all around the base in an emerald green, gradating to total transparency towards the middle of the glass shape. The bottle is eventually topped by an outstanding cap, chromed and glittering. ""During the production of the bottle, many cares had to be paid in order to respect the strict tolerances the housing of the plate required. This particular was quite intricate to solve in relation with the weight of the mass of glass we were working with."" Line: Custo Barcelona Customer: Idesa Sizes: 60 ml, 100 ml Year of launch: 2009 The new fragrance in Grigioperla line, the men's brand from the renowned Italian lingerie house for woman, turns up in a bottle characterized by the dark green colour of the glass contrasting with the platinum accessories. The bottle has a oval shape, where the sides are cut and defined by plane facets. The rear wall features a number of sharp engraved lines, looking like a piece of garment. On the smooth front wall, the logo of the brand is silk screen printed in platinum. The bottle is crowned by a chromed dispensing system that leans on a well-matched support hiding the glass shoulder. The whole is made of a few and essential lines, aiming a sober elegance. ""Original solutions were applied to enable the tooling opening, due to the presence of dig shoulders and sharp vertical edges. The respect of strict tolerances was another constraint that proved the ability of our skilled glass technicians,"" claims Bormioli Luigi's staff.

MWV announces production of Melodie pump in Mexico,"MeadWestvaco (MWV), the group of American origin specialized among many other activities, in the production of dispensing systems, sprayers (pumps, dispensers, trigger sprayers, etc.) announced that a production line for its low profile Melodie pump would be in operation during the first half of 2010 in Mexico. In addition, managers at MWV said they were quite satisfied with the commercial development of their snap-on model Melodie Clikit IP (IP stands for Plastic Injection) which seems to clearly meet market requirements for customer oriented solutions. The Clikit IP does has the advantage of actually being a pump ""dressed with plastic,"" the ferrule of the actuator and the spray pump cover being manufactured with the same plastic can be decorated and customized at will with all finishing techniques available for plastic, including the sublimation technique. ""We are witnessing a real craze from customers for this new pump"", explains Laurent Bourgoin, VP Sales and Marketing Europe Fragrance at MWV. Perfume brand owners have already shown a keen interest in this innovation and have begun tests on their filling lines. A pump which, according to managers from MWV, could very much account, in the mid term, for approximately 10% of total sales of perfumery pumps worldwide. Another development axis for MWV, the launch of a version of Melodie with an Europa 4 screw ring. ""There again, it is meeting market demand for a more environmentally-friendly pump, i.e. which can be unscrewed by the end consumer to allow dissociation of the pump from the glass bottle"", explains Laurent Bourgoin. Finally, the group also showcased at Luxe Pack Monaco an even wider range of extensions for inserts ranging from 9.3 mm to 36.7 mm including telescopic extensions which of course answer market demand for customizing the lengths of extensions in spray-caps. This innovation allows cost effective customization and at the same time reduction of the development process. Also note in the group's catalogue, an extension in its airless range (Aria Airless and Prelude Airless) as well as the marketing of two mini-trigger sprayers ""Mini-Trigger"" very ergonomic for bottles intended to contain, for example sun care or hair care products;"
DuPont celebrates its innovations,"The Luxe Pack show in Monaco was an opportunity for DuPont to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Surlyn, its featured polymer. This year, DuPont has extended the capabilities of its overmoulding technology, Surlyn 3D, (the 3 Ds standing for Design, Decoration and Depth) to provide greater freedom to the designers of inner and outer perfume containers or packaging of cosmetics products and body care products. People at DuPont explain that ""In addition to new shapes and colors, new material combinations are possible to improve barrier properties and chemical resistance according to ingredients and application. This will allow customers to create packaging providing glass-like transparency, luxury decorative effects and increased consumer safety and convenience that simultaneously reflect brand identity and achieve product differentiation"". Among the many examples of implementation of Surlyn showcased at the DuPont stand: the very airy line of the new Kenzo Amour designed by Texen. Starting out clear from the bottom of the bottle, the white lacquer gradually becomes thicker towards the top of the bottle, where it reaches maximum opacity. In contrast, the cap, which is opaque at its base, becomes increasingly translucent until it is totally clear at the top. In other material, and among the leading products using DuPont products, the new standard mascara packaging line from German manufacturer, Oekametall which uses DuPont Biomax PTT1100 (PolyTrimethylTerephthalate), a new bio-material. It is a polyester-type resin with a renewably-sourced content and performance similar to polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). ""With a very glossy surface explain managers at DuPont, this product offers excellent resistance to common formulations for cosmetic products""."
Aesthete creates Aesthete Lab and teams up with Open D for MAD,"For Thierry de Baschmakoff and the Aesthete team, historically a creative agency dedicated to the design of luxury products, it actually represents two new starts. First start, the creation of Aesthete Lab, a creative agency dedicated to brands looking for a privileged partnership. Second start, the creation with Laurent Caucé, CEO and founder of the group Open D, of a new agency, MAD (Massive Artistic Direction), who will accompany clients in their product development to the point of sale, and who will work both on selective projects and in the mass distribution sector. Thus, each partner hopes to benefit from the other partner's networks, Laurent Caucé from the excellent implantation of Aesthete in luxury markets, and Thierry de Baschmakoff from the international network of Open D and its presence in the Health & Beauty sector. Premium Beauty News - Like many beautiful stories, your new adventure began with a meeting! Thierry de Baschmakoff – Truly a meeting that occurred at the right moment. Aesthete could no longer just remain on the segment of luxury products design where, precisely, Laurent Caucé needed to extend the influence of his agency. May I remind you that regarding this historical business core of Aesthete, we are still one of the few agencies mastering techniques as varied as glass, leather, watch-making, new materials, which allows us to manage projects globally , from the drawing board to the finished product with a methodology ranging from brand analysis, volume design, graphic design, prototypes and technical service. Laurent Caucé - This is obviously what attracted my partners and myself. So we were able to very quickly elaborate with Thierry the outlines of what could become a business partnership. A few words on Open D... We operate since 2002. At the time, the idea was quite simple: create an agency specialized in Design Merchandising and Retail in the cosmetics and perfumery segment. In fact, develop ourselves where other design agencies did not venture since they did not go beyond the stage of ""product"" designing. As for manufacturers specialized in POS or store layouts, they had, to say the least, an overly industrial idea of the subject, not creative enough. And I must say that facts have proved us right. Three years later, in 2005, we opened our first branch in Dubai. In 2006, Barcelona. In 2007, Singapore and, in 2008, New York. Next step ... in 2010, with Shanghai. In 2008, we created a packaging department, Open pack, which proved itself useful in 2 years time and recently merged with Aesthete to create MAD. Today, Open D is worth some 10 million Euros in turnover with a workforce of 70 people. Our clients are L'Oreal, Procter & Gamble, Coty, Diageo, Inter Parfums, Richemont, LVMH… The company relies on three key activities: the ephemeral furniture (30% of turnover), permanent furniture (50% of turnover) and commercial architecture (20% of turnover). Premium Beauty News - And crisis ? Don't you fell its impact? Laurent Caucé - Yes, of course. But by intuition and chance we diversified ourselves into other segments than cosmetics and perfumery, like spirits and alcohols and now, tobacco. Spirits and alcohols now account for 35% of our turnover. They only represented 2% of our turnover just two years ago! Premium Beauty News - This partnership between you, Thierry de Baschmakoff and Laurent Caucé, takes the form of two separate entities: Aesthete Lab and MAD. Laurent Caucé - Thierry de Baschmakoff remains at the head of Aesthete Lab and will act as an Artistic Director for MAD. For my part, I will bring my contribution as a strategic advisor for Aesthete Lab. Premium Beauty News - And for MAD, what is precisely its purpose? Laurent Caucé - Being an entity of the Open D group, MAD can rely on an international network to address regionalization issues (Europe, Asia, Middle East, United States). The agency will help clients to define their marketing strategy and product development to the point of sale. It can work as much on high end projects as it can in the mass distribution sector. Premium Beauty News - And Aesthete Lab ? Thierry de Baschmakoff - Aesthete Lab is a creative agency dedicated to brands looking for a privileged creative partnership. It works in a process of artistic direction that can go from a mission for product designing to interior design or communication."
HCP to strengthen North American operations,"HCP Packaging USA, Inc. - a subsidiary of the HCP Packaging group, a leading designer and manufacturer of packaging for the cosmetics, toiletries, skin care and fragrance industries - has announced its intention to open a new factory in Mexico. According to HCP, the manufacturing unit will occupy a 60,000 square foot (18,288 m2) facility located in Reynosa city's Villa Florida Industrial Park, in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, approximately 15 minutes from the US border. Manufacturing capabilities will include injection moulding, injection blow moulding, UV lacquering, vacuum metalizing, as well as decoration and assembly. HCP Reynosa is expected to be fully operational during the first quarter of 2010, and will employ approximately 130 people. HCP also announced that John Leitner has been appointed Plant Manager. HCP intends to transfer a portion of its activities from its Hinsdale, New Hampshire and Shanghai, PRC facilities to the new factory. This announcement follows the appointment of Mrs Laura Nowatzki as HCP's Vice President, West Coast Sales and Marketing. Laura Nowatzki graduated from the University of California, in Santa Barbara, with a BA in mechanical engineering and has previous packaging development and quality control experience at a number of West Coast cosmetics companies, including Smashbox, Guthie Renker, Hain Celestial Personal Care Division and Rock and Republic. Additionally, Laura is also an Instructor of packaging design and development at Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising, in downtown Los Angeles. Laura Nowatzki is responsible for managing all sales and marketing activities on new and existing accounts in the area west of the Mississippi River."
Geka Brush to prepare a new technology for 2010,"An expected consolidated turnover of EUR 100 million this year, for a total workforce (including foreign subsidiaries) of 680 people, the German firm, Geka Brush, has truly become in recent years a heavyweight in the beauty industry, in particular in the field of mascara production. It is true that the segment is still expanding with a growth rate, despite the crisis, that will exceed again this year 10%. ""But we owe this position"", explains the CEO, Franco Luca,""first to our know-how, our ability to innovate and the industrial organization which was patiently set up over recent years"". A tour at the heart of the historical factory of Bechhofen is enough to convince you. About 80 injection machines running at full speed and approximately 12 automatic lines assembling at impressive rates multiple parts of, may it be, mascara or lip gloss. As for innovation, it can be seen everywhere, along with an injection moulding machine or with an assembly machine. ""You know that we were the first to launch the Moltrusion® technology for moulded brushes"", underlines Franco Luca. ""We can say with no hesitation that we hold today about 60% of the global market for this type of product. This is not a coincidence. Our teams have worked hard on this concept. We have just released another innovation in this field with the new brush designed for the new mascara 'N° 7 of Boots'. This does not mean that we are neglecting the traditional brushes. Because we have not finished yet! Some surprises are coming up in the next few months. People might again be talking about a new technology related to plastic!"" As for the German group's expansion abroad, in recent years, it has not slackened. The high point being, just one year ago, the opening, of the new plant in Elgin, in the United States near Chicago. ""A start up at top speed"", explains Franco Luca, ""corroborating. our choice to produce locally. We already expect a dozen lines in operation by late 2010"". A positive experience which will surely be followed in the longer term with a similar decision for China, ""also to supply the local market"". A territorial expansion coupled with a desire to provide an even wider and efficient service. ""That's what motivated our partnership with Ancorotti Cosmetics"", explains Franco Luca. ""An efficient cooperation which already allows us to work together on two launches to come"". ""To be and to remain THE leader in our industry by producing the very best, this is one of our key ambitions."" Luxe Pack Monaco will be an opportunity for the company to unveiled the very latest launches of the company. - Push-Up Brush: ""Perfectly fascinating"". Delicate, soft, symmetrical - that pretty much describes the moulded Push-Up Brush and its patented design. Its vertical and horizontal bristle configuration allows for the smooth and extremely precise application of mascara formulation. The tip of the brush gives an extra ""push"" - it can be used to lift and shape even the tiniest lashes. Indeed, even the lashes on the lower lid and in the corner of the eye can be enhanced beautifully. Another advantage: The new Push-Up Brush can be combined with any of the packaging available in the Geka building block system. - Glamour Touch Brush: ""Remarkably confident"". This mascara brush has got more than just the hang of things. Its spiral-like design makes for great results in terms of eyelash length and curve. And it is also particularly suitable for mascara formulations containing glitter particles, since this applicator brush transports and applies these particles smoothly and evenly. The Glamour Touch Brush is available in both moulded and aluminium versions. And it can be combined with any packaging from the Geka building block system. - Lollipop Sampler: ""Surprisingly imaginative"". Practical, sassy, unique: created by the multi-award-winning designer Dieter Bakic - the Lollipop Sampler is primarily intended for advertising new products at low cost. Its unusual shape makes it a real eye-catcher without any outer packaging. But this product is much more than just an attractive display item: the Lollipop Sampler offers a multitude of options for product personalization. Packed in a one-away disposable blister pack, it makes an ideal give-away. But other areas of application - such as lip gloss - are also possible. The Lollipop Sampler is patented and available exclusively from Geka Brush."
Portola Tech: Bounces back,"This is one of the breaking news of this fall. The Portola Tech company owned by the Portola Group moves up a gear by simply doubling the production areas of its two plants in Czech Republic and China and above all…by starting a brand new factory in the United States to replace the obsolete historical one. Total cost of the operation, 5 million dollars. An industrial entity that made quite a comeback! In November 2008 the Portola Group, one of the largest producers of closures for beverages (3,000 people, 260 million dollars in turnover, 14 plants), due to financial difficulties, is sold to the U.S. investment fund, Wayzata. The Portola Tech entity (35 million dollars in turnover) specialized in the segment of cosmetics (caps and plastic jars) on the contrary is doing well but is part of the deal. At this time, the firm had the particularity of producing both thermoset and plastic injected products. ""Today, we have every reason to be glad about it,"" says Dan Carter, Vice President of Sales. ""With the arrival of new investors, we now have the means of our development policy, not only in the United States but also worldwide and especially in Europe"". No sooner said than done.... The new management team decides to simply double the size of the two plants in the Czech Republic and in China, respectively from 3,000 m2 to 6,000 m2 for the first and 5,000 m2 to 10,000m2 for the second, by providing in addition, state-of-the-art injecting equipment. As for the historical American factory, it was moved out and sold and all its equipment was re-installed to be re-used, this month, in a brand new factory of 6,500 m2. An industrial investment strategy coupled with a new product-based approach of the market of cosmetics as the Group has also decided to begin producing makeup boxes and lipstick tubes. A huge step forward which completes the existing range of closures and jars. ""It is, of course, the plant located in Czech Republic, explains Jean-Luc Narcisse, Director of Sales in Europe, that becomes the Group's European unit par excellence"". Note that the firm now offers in its range of jars and closures an equivalent proportion of standard products and specific products. Targeted turnover of Portola Tech in 2010: 40 million of US dollars."
"«Crisis creates opportunities» Raymond Sinnah, SGD","Premium Beauty News - The current crisis is unprecedented in your business! Raymond Sinnah [1] - Quite true! Can anyone recall a similar period when the market for manufacturers in beauty packaging collapsed from 20 to 40% depending of the segments, in the first half of 2009? ""This is a first"" and we are all impacted by this crisis. And although there are currently some signs of recovery, we have to admit we won't find a more ""comfortable"" situation before several months. 2009 is obviously a ""special"" year . Our activity has been strongly affected by stock clearance from retail market. Today, we can estimate that this stock clearance is partly finished at this stage of the chain. But this is probably not true on the side of our direct customers, perfumery and cosmetics brands. We will still have to put up with the effects caused by the bursting of this ""bubble of overstocking"" that occurred during the 2007/2008 period. You must remember that while we were bearing the brunt of this historical drop, the consumer market only decreased by 5% in volume in France. Given this situation, we are obviously forced to deal with it very carefully. Premium Beauty News - How much leeway do you have in this case? Raymond Sinnah - It is obviously small. You must remember that we are in a heavy industry with huge continuous industrial tools, furnaces that do not stop or restart just like that. Like most of the industry players, we have ""shelved"" some of the production tool. We have also anticipated the rebuilding of a furnace. SGD has taken advantage of the low activity to speed up several projects in the areas of cleanliness, quality, productivity and innovation in order to better prepare economic recovery. We are on segments of ""specialties"" requiring both to be faultless in terms of quality and to be also competitive. SGD continues its strategy of differentiation through innovation, and you'll discover in a few days at Luxe Pack Monaco [2], one of the fruits of this innovative approach, especially in terms of environment, around our ""Verre Infini"" (Infinite 'Glass), with the help of several other manufacturers in the packaging industry. Premium Beauty News - Fortunately, your business is not impacted the same way in other parts of the world where you are industrially operating! Raymond Sinnah - Absolutely, China and Brazil are in that case. They are great growth engines for SGD. The end market over there experiences trends of + 5 to 10% per year. We have recently invested in Brazil in a complete unit dedicated to decoration (silk-screening, lacquering and glass etching) to enhance our offer. Brazil was the only glass factory owned by SGD that was not equipped with a decoration unit. Premium Beauty News - Evolving laws continue to weigh on the packaging sector. Don't you think? Raymond Sinnah - As far as glass is concerned, even though you always need to remain updated with changes, everyone agrees that it is a material known for its qualities, its harmlessness and its stability. This is not the case for other materials. Concerning REACH, the glass material is exempt."
Weckerle opens a conditioning unit in China,"The German company Weckerle Cosmetics has opened this month a filling unit for cosmetic products in China, 200 km from Shanghai. A new milestone for Thomas Weckerle, CEO, and his team after the takeover last year of the manufacturer Dr. Scheller Cosmetics AG, which had already helped Weckerle Cosmetics become one of the leading companies in Europe for full service. ""The Chinese unit is dedicated to the Chinese domestic market,"" says Thomas Weckerle. The catalogue of products and services displayed by the firm is particularly abundant with of course the full range of lipsticks (including the famous sticks with dual-components or Weckerle's double injection exclusive technique), and also pencils, lip glosses, eye shadows, foundations, pressed powders, mascaras, nail polishes etc., and of course, all the possibilities associated with packaging. Note the new technique known as ""multimoulding"" proposed by Weckerle Cosmetics thanks to a new machine developed by engineers from the firm. Geographically, the German group is now operating in many parts of the world, either industrially or commercially: starting with Germany of course, but also France near Fontainebleau (where a new automatic gloss and mascara filling machine has just been installed), without forgetting the United States, Brazil and now China. The current popularity of these products will lead very shortly, to the entry of organic cosmetics in Weckerle's catalogue."
Cartografica Pusterla buys Cartonnages Cazelles,"The Italian company Cartografica Pusterla whose historical factory (100 million folding cases per year) and headquarters are located inVenegono Inferiore,near Milan, has just taken over the French manufacturer of assembled cases, Cartonnages Cazelles, located in Cherré near Le Mans ( EUR 9 million in turnover, 55 staff). Thanks to this acquisition, the Italian group headed by Mr. Giuseppe Meana sees its consolidated turnover jump to 36 million euros for a total of 240 staff. Cartografica Pusterla consolidates its position in France where it already owned the company Coffrets Créations specialized in the production of covered cases, whose plant in Oradour-sur-Glane offers an annual production capacity of over 5 million cases of the automatic and semi-automatic type, as well as their possible packaging. ""What is interesting, says Giuseppe Meana, is the perfect synergy between the two companies regarding their clients. In addition Cazelles also has a good mastery of thermoforming. Take two medium-sized companies, the meeting of the two makes a solid entity."" The Cartografica Pusterla group also operates in Romania with the company Dacica Teca established in 2004, to meet growing demand for hand-made cases. ""The assembly workshop in Bucharest offers a reduction of risks and time linked with the development of the products. Our organization has no intermediates and the whole phase dedicated to product study and development is provided by our technical and commercial teams, French or Italian,"" Giuseppe Meana adds. However, in order to guarantee the highest quality standards, the production phases requiring high technological content (offset printing, hot stamping, embossing) are still performed at Cartografica Pusterla. ""The capacity to achieve the pilot lot production at Coffrets Création reduces or eliminates, for our clients, the need for long and expensive trips"". The other assset ographic proximity: Bucharest is only 2 / 3 hours flight from Milan or Paris and 4 / 7 days of road transport""."
New business model for HCT,"""It has taken us three years to implement our new business model"", announces James Thorpe, Managing director of HCT Europe and HCT Asia. Originally, HCT's activity was mainly focused on designing innovative packaging for the cosmetic industry and subcontracting manufacturing services to high quality partnering factories in Asia. Today, the group runs its two factories dedicated to plastic injection, and a metal processing and electroplating plant, in addition to a filling factory. The group now has a workforce of more than 1,000 Asia based staff as well as several Sales and Innovation Centres across the globe. HCT is poised to sign a final agreement for acquiring a manufacturing unit producing brushes and applicators. The new factory will help the group to complement their existing capabilities and then to offer their customers high quality multidimensional solutions, from start to finish. ""We feel that diversifying our business in these associated areas will allow us to offer our customers valuable savings in time and cost.

Action group launches boycott campaign against Ahava Cosmetics,"The so-called Stolen Beauty campaign was launched on the occasion of the Cosmoprof North America annual tradeshow, which was held from July 19 to 21 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Yesterday, bikini-clad Code Pink activists rallied with signs and chants at the Ahava booth inside the beauty industry's event and call on the Israeli company to end what they denounced as ""its exploitations of the occupied West Bank"". Code Pink says that Ahava's products, which are produced in a manufacturing facility located in the West Bank, are misleadingly labelled as ""Made in Israel"". Indeed, Ahava has situated its main manufacturing plant and showroom and employs 120 staff at the Israeli settlement Mitzpe Shalem in the Palestinian West Bank near the shores of the Dead Sea. Code Pink] says Ahava ""is involved in and profit from the occupation of the Palestinian West Bank"". In the past two months, the action group has already staged three demonstrations against Ahava in Israel and New York. Through the boycott campaign, Code Pink] wants to pressure Ahava to end its practices as well as to pressure the Israeli government to end ""violations of international law against Palestine and its people"". Code Pink also plans to educate consumers about Ahava."
"Alain Chevassus, Cosfibel: ""proximity and creativeness to deal with the crisis""","According to Alain Chevassus, CEO of Cosfibel group, ""Crisis has really settled in! Sales have dropped - 10% in the best cases - 20% in the worst ...! We are taking the blow like everyone. It is time to save up"" Consequences: cost reduction at every level of the Group ""Cosfibel will not be attending Luxe Pack in Monaco, indicates Alain Chevassus, even though this was a difficult decision to make because this show remains a must"". But Alain Chevassus wants to remain optimistic. ""Crisis will have helped setting the record straight"". He believes that crisis has changed consumers, as well as the whole industry that depends on it, calling for ""primacy of local service and creativeness"". Alain Chevassus also considers that the industrial world is starting to split into two main categories of actors: ""on one side big manufacturers capable of producing large quantities and on the other side, the multiplicity of other manufacturers, we also belong to, flexible, fast, creative and multifunctional"" And to seduce new consumers you must adapt yourself. ""Promoting events will make the difference, underlines Alain Chevassus. We must be able to answer local demand..."" Hence a network oriented strategy for creativeness, manufacturing and commercial proximity. Urban network®. Client minded, the group is weaving an urban network, in other words, it is moving closer to its clients in urban areas, to answer their needs in terms of product presentation and promotion in their outlets. Via this network, Cosfibel provides comprehensive services: from contacts and order taking to distribution through design, technology and logistics. All necessary steps related to prior ranking by major groups and their headquarters, but also by independent clients careful about safeguarding their identity. ""This working model answers two challenges, explains Alain Chevassus. With the emergence of large metropolitan areas that generate new centres for decision making, it is necessary to support local services, to meet orders at this level. So, Cosfibel's organization enables to help a local client when the need is local and an international client when necessary. In addition, being close to clients saves time! The ability for responsiveness and flexibility are some of the main assets of Cosfibel"". In this context, is service also synonymous with Full Service? ""Yes, undoubtedly,"" underlines Alain Chevassus. ""Today we can also offer Full Service thanks to the partnerships we have and to the ones we are implementing"". Since 2000, year when the group was created, network is growing: Brussels, Paris, Barcelona, Madrid, Düsseldorf but also Sao Paulo, New York, Shanghai and Hong Kong. In 2008, Cosfibel has also settled in London and Moscow. Today Cosfibel operates in 11 major cities and the group plans to be present in 50 cities within five to ten years."
Autajon to inaugurate two new plants at the beginning of next fall,"The Autajon group who just completed the takeover of the Belgian company Bopack [1], specialized in the manufacturing of adhesive labels, a third of the production supplying the perfume and cosmetic sector, is on the brink of inaugurating, in October, in the United States, a new factory that will produce folding boxes for perfumes and cosmetics. The new site will offer a13 000 sqm area against currently 7 000 sqm. A second event is scheduled early fall in Germany with the inauguration of the new factory in Landerer subsequently increasing the manufacturing area from17 000 sqm to 24 000 sqm. Total investment, according to the group, ""between 24 and 30 million Euros"". Today Autajon has a turnover of 370 million Euros, employs 2,800 staff and has 22 production sites around the world. The success of this French company based near Montélimar is undoubtedly a model to be followed. Perfumery-cosmetics, pharmacy, wines and spirits, confectionery, chocolate, tea, coffee ... The Autajon Group covers today nearly every segment of the label and cardboard packaging sector. But perfumery-cosmetics still remains the first market of the company representing almost 40% of its turnover followed by pharmaceuticals (20%). External growth, spearhead of the French firm since 1995, has helped the group become one of the European leaders for converting folding boxes. ""Our aim is to become leaders in each specialty"" explains Gilles Poncato, Sales Director of the group. ""One can say our objective is well advanced in Europe in the segment of folding boxes designed in particular for the Beauty & Health sector. And we are almost there with labelling. The takeover of Bopack is of course a fantastic opportunity to help us achieve this goal. Bopack is a great specialist in adhesive labelling in Europe, if not the specialist with excellent knowledge in digital printing, not to mention the fact that the group is well positioned in the manufacturing of cylindrical covers or sleeves"". Another line of investment in recent months for the Autajon group: environment, with the implementation of carbon footprint calculation for the Montélimar plant to be carried out afterwards on several other plants of the group."
Yves Rocher wants to expand its retail network in Canada,"French cosmetics maker and retailer, Yves Rocher, announced yesterday its intention to extend its presence in Canada through store franchises. This follows the announcement made a little more than a month ago that the company was introducing in Canada its new brand image, logo and store concept called the Atelier of Botanical Beauty. So far, aside from a few tests in the early 1980's all of Yves Rocher stores in Canada have been corporate. However, in the 80 countries Yves Rocher is present, roughly 75% of its stores are either franchises or run by agents. In France, it is one of the most popular cosmetics franchises with 550 stores. ""Because the brand was not as well known in Canada, we wanted to grow it ourselves first and ensure the success of our stores before providing Canadians with the chance to purchase a franchise,"" said Stephane Duval, Director, Stores, North America. Duval came to Canada a year and a half ago from Italy where he also implemented the franchise strategy. Yves Rocher has been in Canada since the mid-eighties and Canadians can purchase its products via catalogue and the Internet across the country and through stores in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick. The company aims to cover the entire territory and to expand its stores from Newfoundland to British Columbia. All franchises will be in the new Atelier of Botanical Beauty concept, which has an objective of generating 15% more in sales versus the previous Yves Rocher stores. In France, where the Atelier has been implemented in several test stores since the end of 2008, it is generating an average +20% increase, and in Canada, the first Atelier, which opened at the Montreal Eaton Centre at the end of May, is maintaining a +35% increase in sales versus last year."
Heinz Glas: series of good news,"Heinz Glas whose work with several major brands has often been awarded, in particular during the 2008 DuftStars (the German FiFi Awards), has recently seen the work achieved throughout development and production of the last Lacoste line, publicly honored by his client, Procter & Gamble. A even more prestigious award when you know that the German glassmaker not only produced the bottle but also mastered the whole project. As good news never comes alone, the glassmaker confides that many orders placed by clients for big upcoming launches should settle the group as one of the leaders among high-end global glassmakers. The German glassmaker is confident that end of 2009 and beginning of 2010 will just be ""amazing"". It took more than ten years to get there. Karl August Heinz, boss and owner can be proud of what was achieved. As can be Dr Ulrich Nebe, CEO of the group who has also worked hard to place the industrial tool to the highest level. He will, undoubtedly remain as one of the major actors in the industrial growth of Heinz Glas in the last decade. ""Of course we are suffering like everyone else but we are holding on and we will hold on!"" For Thomas Kneitz, Heinz Glas International's newly appointed General Sales Director. ""Crisis is hitting hard, very hard , but the Heinz group is resisting quite well, maybe better than some of our colleagues."" There are many reasons for this competitive advantage. But the main one is all the industrial innovations carried out in recent years that rendered the glass factory more flexible and competitive. ""Focusing on organization and innovation also pays off every day. We have become a reliable glassmaker who always meets its commitments and proves every day that innovation and mastery are part of our culture."" And as he underlines, ""Our triple positioning in perfumes, mass-market/medium range/high-end also helps."" Main industrial investment in 2009: the complete renovation of the 120 ton oven at Pisau's glass factory. ""The timing for this renovation was appropriate,"" explains Thomas Kneitz, ""because of decline in demand. This will give us a chance to restart precisely along with the first tremors of the recovery"". But when will the market start turning around again? That's a very good question. ""Very difficult to say"", admits Rudolph Wurm, Perfumes Sales Director. Nonetheless the German glassmaker is all set with a strike force of 9 ovens: four of them in Germany, two of them in Poland, two of them in Peru and one in China, and with a production capacity of 468 tons of glass per day. Of course, because of the crisis, the managers had to temporarily stop the brand new oven of 50 tons inaugurated in 2007in Kleintettau, But it means even more available output when the day comes ...! Industrial efforts have been constant since 2003, with investments ranging between 24 million and 36 million Euros annually. The peak was reached in 2007 with a figure of nearly 37 million. Investments both in ovens, bottle producing machines but also and especially in workshops dedicated to finishing. ""This is where we have really changed our approach,"" explains Thomas Kneitz. ""We had to become highly efficient in all finishing techniques. And I mean all of them. This forced us to invest massively in state-of-the-art lines for metallization and finishing but also automated lines for pad printing. We are capable of doing everything or almost, from glass etching to metallization, lacquering, pad-printing, pasting, labelling, hot stamping, and even laser etching. And our customers keep asking!"" The upcoming launches will be indicative of this trend. Eventually, a very important element in the scientific device to control products manufacturing, a brand new testing laboratory established in Kleintettau last year with four full-time employees. Another strong asset on which, these last years, managers at Heinz Glas' have relied on, internationalization. After Poland, China, came Peru. The latest ""master stroke"" to date, because the potential of development in South America, Brazil as a leader, is confirmed every day. Of course admit managers at Heinz Glas', ""it is not always easy to manage a technical team several thousand kilometers away, but with perseverance, we get by!"". As for China (1000 employees out of Heinz group's 3000 employees!), the upgrading is almost completed."
Natta moves on in the cosmetic sector,"The French company based at Berd'huis in Normandy which, so far, subcontracted for several companies specialised in plastic processing, is doing more and more business with the major operators in the perfume and cosmetic industry. Natta's main assets: – A production workshop with about fifteen presses (centralised power) ranging from 25 tonnes to 200 tonnes equipped with digital robots. – A real know how in the transformation of PPMA, Surlyn, PCTA, PA (from thin inner walls to very thick parts..., from small series to several millions parts). – And foremost the possibility to design in a week's time a prototype mould for evaluation (presentation of true production material with a mould of a few thousand Euros) or in two weeks time with an all-automatic prototype mould to help validate the project but can also be used for the assembly machines. « Our in-house research department, explains Bruno Partrat, Sales manager, allows us to meet the technical requirements and deadlines of our customers. And our know-how (experience in this sector for over 10 years) and the size of our company gives us a chance now to meet the needs of the market key stakeholders by offering reactivity and competitiveness essential in this time of crisis. In order to remain reactive we always keep 20 % of our production capacity available to instantly meet requirements »."

Li & Fung Group creates LF Beauty,"Two years after having entered the perfumery and cosmetic business in addition to its previous activities (textile, personal care, mass market products),Li & Fung is announcing its intention to become a key player in this industry. In 2007, Li & Fung firstly bought CGroup HK Ltd (June 2007, secondary packaging, full service, promotional items), PB Beauty, UK (August 2007, private labelling of cosmetic producs), then Imagine PoS (January 2008, point-of-sale advertising) and RT Sourcing (August 2008, primary packaging). This strategy of know-how development through external growth will now be concentrated in a single entity, as Li & Fung's cosmetic business will be gathered under the name LF Beauty by July 2009. Thus, two years proved to be enough for Li & Fung to clarify its strategy, organise its know-how and become a global supplier on the entire supply chain of the industry. In practice, LF Beauty now features sales staff in Europe (Paris, London), in the USA (New York, Dallas), and in China (Hong Kong, Shanghai), an important R&D laboratory in the UK, including a product development and sourcing teams, project management and quality insurance teams for its various production facilities (Hong-Kong, ShenZen, DongGuan, Shanghai, etc…), filling units (Angleterre, Chine). Organised in networks, LF Beauty teams manage thousands suppliers, industrial partners, from the product's design to its production (where materials and components are sourced from various suppliers) and delivery. LF Beauty will develop a customer-centred model. From the primary container to PoS advertising, and ""full service"" activities, promotional items and assembling activities, LF Beauty operates by combining know-how and customer oriented project management. Now, Li & Fung's new entity is carrying on its market covering strategy, and specialising its various units on each segment (a luxury division, a mass-market division, a direct sales division, etc. ...). Furthermore, LF Beauty benefits from Li & Fung international network, as the group operates in forty countries worldwide: a strong asset while the sourcing sector is constantly evolving. Questioned about the specificity of LF Beauty, Guy d'Auriol and Yan d'Auriol, former founders of the CG Group HK Ltd, and current heads LF Beauty, say: ""LF Beauty is a valuable partner for world's leaders in the beauty industry, from creativity, to industrial development, quality insurance and logistic. Thanks to our constant presence on the field and the various control procedures that we have implemented, we can guarantee a top compliance level to our customers. Furthermore, belonging to a group such as Li & Fung provides us with the resources we need to serve our ambitions and those of our customers."" Bruce Rockowitz, President of L&F Trading adds: ""the beauty business is the most recent in our group, but we are expecting a strong growth in this sector that we are ready to support through new purchases, with the aim to become a key player""."
OEKAbeauty's activity grew by 15 % since de beginning of the year,"When many packaging suppliers on the cosmetic and perfumery segment currently show drops in turnover, sometimes close to -20 %, or even -30 %, OEKAMETALL's activity is growing by 15% compared to the same period last year. This result has nothing to do with chance, explains Gerald Oehlhorn, who head the German company specialised in the production of mascaras, lipgloss and lipstick tubes. OEKAMETALL's assets holds in five points: speed in decision making, flexibility, automation, complete industrial offer and constantly improved productivity to offer the best product at the best price. Another item could be added to this list, the importance of innovative offers. By the way, one must not say OEKAMETALL anymore but OEKAbeauty for the cosmetic activity and OEKAtech for the ""technical parts"" business. ""Luckily enough we are doing well in the cosmetic market"", admits Gerald Oehlhorn, ""because our activity in the automotive sector, for the same period, has dropped by 30 %!"" Actually, this sector still accounts for 1/3 of the company's activity. As far as OEKABeauty is concerned, it seems obvious that the German company is reaping the benefits of an industrial strategy carefully planned during the last ten years. ""When a number of our colleagues chose to offshore part of their production, in Asia, we opted on the contrary, for full automation of our production workshops and integrating as much as possible the manufacturing sequences (injection, finishes, metallisation, fitting…, not to mention manufacturing of brushes for mascaras),"" explains Gerald Oelhorn. ""We have also worked hard on improving our productivity at every level of production by suppressing downtime and resumption, as much as possible, in optimising our stocks and reducing or even suppressing production scraps,"" he adds. The outcome is that in the injection and air-blown injection workshop, the German company has improved the number of ""good"" parts by 20% in just one year! ""Of course the pressure on prices is constant, but these gains in points of productivity allow us to sustain the challenge"", confirms Gerald Oehlhorn. Another asset is the company's policy for training and integrating the young people. ""Each year, we integrate from five to ten young people to attend technical and/or commercial apprenticeship. For seven years now, we have been training young engineers in cooperation with the Heidenheim University (cooperative education) This is greate to create competitiveness in workshops and offices. This also gives us a chance to built up a very solid skills base,"" says Gerald Oehlhorn. Even at a run, visiting the Bamberg plant, is very informative. And one understands quickly why the company is performing better today. The plastic injection workshop has 42 machines, a number of them coming from the latest generation in electric presses (annual capacity, 300 millions parts), the whole of it very automated. The workshop assembling the different parts used for the production of mascaras, lipgloss and lipstick tubes is organised by autonomous islets where each line of product is assembled and decorated at once (capacity of 120 Mio pcs). Again, very few employees. The lacquering and metalizing workshop has doubled with the adjunction of a brand new and completely automated unit (12 employees) a hundred kilometres far from Bamberg, CCO, capable of processing large orders (this unit also manufactures the flocks for lipgloss). Finally managers from OEKAMETALL display with some pride the different standards passed successfully like the ISO 9001, the ISO TS 16949 (automotive industry), the ISO 14001 (protection of the environment) and the BS OHSAS 18001 (labour safety). Concerning the new products issued from the Bamberg factory, there are a number of them, with as a high point the industrialisation of the famous vibrating mascara for Lancôme with a production rate that does not seem to want to slow down, on the contrary. Not to mention the latest lipgloss ""Laque Fever"" for Lancôme, the mascara ""Volume Collagène"" for L'Oréal Paris, the two mascaras ""Extreme Resist"" and the lipstick for Nivea, the lipgloss ""Stay Glossy"" for Rimmel, the mascara ""Volume Diva"" for Astor or the lipsticks and gloss ""Wild Rose"" for Lumene."
Airless dispensers: not concerned by the crisis,"Main objective of AirlessPack Association in 2009: carrying out a number of actions in order to promote and communicate throughout Europe on a system that offers multiple advantages in terms of packaging, delivery and preservation of products, whether cosmetic, pharmaceutical or even alimentary. Of course the aim for member companies is to help developping the global market related to this type of products. First stage, elaboration of a press kit and sensitizing of main European media, whether professional or mass audience, written or broadcasted, on the benefits of using airless dispensers. Several dozens of journalists have received or will receive a complete kit describing the Association and its goals. Appointments have been (and are) made with members of the Association to help journalists improve their knowledge in this unique system in terms of packaging and delivering products. Main objective, publication of articles and/or inquiries about airless systems. Second stage, joint implementation of a website dedicated toAirlessPack Association to help professionals as well as mass audience, find details regarding the Association and its goals as well as information on the system itself and its advantages. Third stage, sensitize all actors both, at the level of payers and at the level of prescribers (for instance Mass Distribution) so that airless dispensers are used more massively. The organisation of an European round-table is already scheduled for the second half of 2009. Fourth stage, lay foundations for a genuine ""airless label"" the implementation of which would begin early 2010, perfect highpoint and a guarantee of quality and recognition granted to this type of system. Obviously, it is fundamental that what was first initiated by four manufacturers of the sector is relayed and amplified by all the other actors involved in the business, because as the old saying goes... ""United we stand, divided we fall"" One will also note that since the beginning of 2009, Airless dispensers are not concerned by the crisis! A clear sign that this type of packaging suits exactly current needs in terms of preservation of the content and hygiene."
"""The enamel market is a mass market,"" Pierre Miasnik (Fiabila)","Premium Beauty News - In a dull market, nail enamels are doing fine! How do you explain this? Pierre Miasnik - Enamels can be found in the same stores consumers do their everyday shopping. The colour offer is significantly substantial: from light shades, French manicures to the deepest reds while enriching the palette to blue, green and yellow colours. Women know that a light enamel will help nails look more attractive, will hide the streaks and will prevent nails from splitting. It is all but expensive luxury. Premium Beauty News - What is your perception of the main trends in the global market of nail polish? Pierre Miasnik - It a mass market involving large volumes. We have noticed significant improvement in qualities both technical and cosmetic. Recent regulations have banished the use of toluene and DBP (Dibutylphthalate) and we have also discarded from our lists several ingredients often used in polishes. Customers are looking for easy-to-use products. Easy in the sense that they are easy to apply, that they cover without streaks, that they are bright and remain bright, that they dry quickly and are resistant. To make up for the withdrawal of some ingredients and meet new requirements we have rethought the formulation of enamels. Premium Beauty News - Do these changes impact your production tool? And if it is the case, what investments do you need to implement? For many years, Fiabila's activity has been progressing strongly, and our foreign affiliates, put aside, we are improving our production tools and filling tools to step up production capacity, quality product and safety. This year, we just finished installing last generation sprinklers for a cost of more than 2 million Euros and we are currently placing the whole site of Maintenon under telesurveillance. Still in 2009, we have installed high tech-equipment for the production of clay gels. This allows us to manufacture brighter and more fluid enamels therefore easier to apply, more stable, and with better constancy from one lot to the other. Premium Beauty News – Regulations regarding environment are increasing every day. What's the impact on your activity and how to you coop with it? Pierre Miasnik - We are currently studying the installation of a storage unit for solvents and implementation of solutions to limit open tank production."
USA/Europe: Texen's ambitions,"Premium Beauty News – What were the reasons for the buyout of Mar-Lee? Christian Baravaglio – We were interested in this company's expertise in the injection of highly technical plastic parts and of its mastery for instance in, in- mould labelling as well as design of the moulds themselves. Of course, it was also the occasion for Texen, one of the worldwide leaders specialised in plastic packaging for the Beauty industry, to gain a foothold-in the United States, thus getting closer to our major clients (Estée Lauder, Chanel, Avon et L'Oréal). Premium Beauty News – What are your goals? Christian Baravaglio – In fact, we are going to take advantage of Mar-Lee's expertise to establish Texen's own expertise in the Luxury universe. Incidentally as an illustration, people will witness the launch in the coming days of several packaging for the Luxury market. At the same time, Texen intends to develop in Europe Mar-Lee's expertise in the pharmaceutical and medical field , particularly in terms of cleanroom manufacturing. Premium Beauty News - All these actions have a price? Christian Baravaglio – Yes indeed, upgrading Mar-lee in the Luxury industry will cost around USD 5 millions. But we are extremely confident regarding results since the company's turnover in 2009 should rise. We are expecting strong growth in 2010 (+ 20 %) and 2011. Premium Beauty News – What makes Texen such a winner? Christian Baravaglio – Many things in fact! But surely rigor is one of our main assets. Each study is a commitment for us ! It is backed with product and process conception, timelines and detailed costing. We offer complete and immediate operational response. Resulting from investor's industrial knowledge, focused on the trilogy: cost / quality / delays, this rigor is present at each stage of the project. It also profits from constantly increased production capacities. Texen is one of the first companies to have equipped itself with 6 axis-robots, and we have been investing for years, from 8 % to 12 % of our turnover in industrial equipment. Our flexible, fully robotised lines operate under systematic Zero default check-out points."
"« Innovation as a main component », Thomas Jonas, MWV","Premium Beauty News – What were your feelings concerning the sector when you arrived a few months ago? Thomas Jonas – Contrarily to what you might have thought, the sector was in a good shape. Concerning the pump activity in 2008, it is true we had to deal with tensions regarding price increases in plastic raw materials, but finally the end market reacted well. As you also know we had the opportunity to acquire the company of Dutch origin, Keltec, specialized in the manufacturing of airless systems. The extremely clever patents developed by Keltec strengthens our leadership versus prestigious partners in the healthcare industry. Not to mention very promising developments in the perfume pumps like the Clikit IP a resin injected version of our Melodie Clikit pump. Clikit IP was created to give high-end perfume brands a high performance pump, offering new possibilities for decoration of dressing parts. We are also capable of offering a level of decoration that did not exist on the market before. Our goal is to help our customers win on their markets thanks to this kind of differentiation. Premium Beauty News - But you have also inherited of the cardboard transformation activity … Thomas Jonas – That is true! A sector where we have started important restructuration keeping our production tool in one plant in the United states but maintaining and reinforcing our factories in Central Europe, Brazil and China. It is a sector of activity in which we believe even if it encounters the same economic difficulties as the others presently. But due to the fact we are established, in high growth countries like the ones in Central Europe, we can only be confident in our potential for the sector. Premium Beauty News - Speaking of high growth countries, MWV is also established in Asia. Thomas Jonas – Yes, thanks to a factory located near Shanghai where we are centralizing pump manufacturing and cardboard transformation. There also, we are very ambitious. Which does not mean we are favoring a area of the world and not another one: we wish to be where our customers are wherever they are, in order to accompany them in their growth. And even if the United States and Europe suffer more today in comparison with other parts of the world, we are not in the state of mind consisting in making a strategic choice of a geographic area versus another. We will strive the same way from one side of the planet to the other. Premium Beauty News – We cannot avoid a question on environment. Thomas Jonas – Absolutely! We feel strongly about environment here at MWV and we are proud to have been ranked, three years in a row by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, first company in the Containers & Packaging Groups category. Environment is a strategic axe of our industrial policy but also of our policy in terms of innovation. No doubt, the coming months will bring quite a few good surprises regarding this last subject."
"""Business recovery is slower than expected,"" Didier Bourgine, Augros Cosmetic Packaging","Premium Beauty News - Times are tough for companies in the plastic industry. What about Augros Cosmetic Packaging? Didier Bourgine - Augros' plastic business has relatively dynamic during the first semester thanks to the launch of new products. On the other hand, the finishing business has been decreasing steadily at our of MSV decor branch. We initially thought that the market would quickly recover, with a rise of the business activity by the end of the summer. Apparently, this optimistic scenario is not the one occurring and the recovery of the economy will be longer than expected. The slowdown of retail sales and the postponing of new launches are now following initial stock clearance measures decided by our customers. Premium Beauty News - Considering the wide range of products that you are supplying to the beauty industry, what are the most dynamic segments? Didier Bourgine - The slower rhythm of new launches boosted our more classical ranges, in particular those that contribute to brands' signatures. On the contrary, ranges that already had difficulties to meet success are strongly decreasing, whether they are new or not. Furthermore, retailers seem to be more cautious than before about new products, which may explain why several launches have been postponed and why their number is declining. Premium Beauty News - Augros Cosmetic Packaging focuses its activities on two areas, plastic packaging components and decoration. Are they efficient synergies between these activities? Didier Bourgine - Actually there are good complementarities between plastic packaging and surface treatment as the perfumery industry is increasingly requesting high performing decoration technologies such as vacuum metallization, or lacquering. Furthermore, as our two production sites are located in a close area (less than 45 minutes from one to the other), production flows can be organised within short delays. Premium Beauty News - Perfume and cosmetic brands are increasingly looking for full-services. Didier Bourgine - We are receiving more and more requests for full-services and we address them positively when there are opportunities. For Thierry Mugler's Angel skincare line, for instance, we are supplying not only the glass jars, but also the labels, and the decoration on glass and plastic surfaces. Premium Beauty News - How do you address environmental issues? Didier Bourgine - Our mission is to answer to the needs of our customers and some brands are strongly committed on environmental issues. The implementation of the REACH legislation is accelerating the shift towards eco-friendliness. We strictly comply with it, whether for or plastic packaging branch or our decoration business."

""As far as sourcing is concerned, we remain highly active with regard to our main markets, promotional and packaging, with the aim to increase synergies and competitiveness,"" Stanislas Péronnet adds. ""We have developed a wide industrial know-how, in our own manufacturing units, which has been strengthened during the last years in the fields of metal and the making of luxury boxes."" ""Creativity, flexibility, reactivity and competitive prices…"", Cosfibel's arguments may be well received by customer companies in a period where they precisely try to optimise the cost and reliability of the supply chain. Cosfibel is also claiming its willingness to design and market a larger number of environment-friendly products and to evaluate the group's carbon emissions by 2009. Furthermore, the company has been performing routine inspections of its supplier's social practices, since 2007."
"Love & desire, latest trends by Intercos","The event gathered about 350 persons from 130 companies, including the most prestigious cosmetics companies in world, eager to discover the latest collections proposed by Intercos' staff. Several marketing departments consider this event as unavoidable. Into the showroom, Dario Ferrari, the group's president, together with its team, presented 114 new coloured formulations (Intercos), as well as 68 new make-up pens formulations (interfila) and 40 new skincare formulations. The collections were presented under the theme Love & Desire: ""Relevancy and emotional links between products and consumers are key factors of success of a marketing strategy. Today's consumers ask so much to a brand, much more than ever… because they have seen everything already!""Dario Ferrari explains. Intercos' research and development department strictly complied with these recommendations: – Excess-ion, is a range inspired by gold and designed for those that are attracted by an excessive and guilt-free consumption – I Love Cosmetics, is a range built on the ""I need it"" concept. The love and desire for items that cannot be missed, that are ""emotional necessities"" – Revolution, is a surprising range, where the sounds of rock impose a rapid and furious rhythm: ""I'm free to be who I want and when I want"" – Sea beauty … where its about discovering love in a sub aquatic blue and crystalline and sensual world, … – Cabaret, an elegant and sexy range, teasing one's sensuality – Charmed Life, a range for creating one's own fairytale, for making romances and dreams come true. Intercos' new success in the field of innovation is very good news when the economy is slowing down worldwide. ""Of course, we need to be careful but, once again, our teams have demonstrated they know how in the anticipation of trends and the design of new products. As far as we are concerned, we remain confident on the possibility to achieve our financial targets, that is to say a 10% increase of our turnover compared to last year, despite the fact that the first months of the year were really tough,"" Dario Ferrari says. Intercos' confidence in the future is certainly reinforced by the growing demand for ""full service"" product design and contract manufacturing. ""In this area, our experience is a source of reliability for our customers,"" explains Dario Ferrari."
Ancorotti Cosmetics takes off like a shot,"The brand new company created by Renato Ancorotti and daughter Enrica, both of them fond of fashion and make-up arts, apparently launched its first collection successfully. All along the four days of the Cosmoprof show in Bologna (Italy), the stand of the company specialising in the design of mascaras, eye-lines and other products for the eyes was fully booked. Demand remains strong on this dynamic segment. Apparently, the creative work made by Enrica Ancorotti has been fruitful, which is particularly noticeable considering the record time in which the products were developed. Ancorotti's brand new manufacturing unit is settled in Crema (Italy) in a 3,000 square metre facility. The building is features cleanrooms and a state-of-the-art laboratory. As far as research and development are concerned,Ancorotti Cosmetics also works in close cooperation with the University of Milan. The Cosmoprof tradeshow was the first occasion for the young company to present its range make-up products inspired by the 1930s, 1960s and 1990s and featuring interesting visual innovations. Ancorotti's staff, including Marie Guilbert, the head of their sales department in France, will present its new collection in September 2009 in Paris, in dedicate showroom."
Maesa promotes creativity in full-service contract manufacturing,"Premium Beauty News - What does ""full-service"" mean at Maesa? Sophie Thiolas - We manufacture f turn-key lines of tailor-made cosmetic and perfumery products for our customers, as well as packaging and promotional items. We provide a full service as we conceive our customers' cosmetics ranges from A to Z: from the market study, to the conception, to selection of relevant packaging options, and tailor-made and the design of entirely customized formulations, to the production, quality control and delivery. Actually, Maesa takes care of every step. Our customers - retailers and brand owners - need to focus on their main business: marketing and distribution. We offer them efficient product lines, so as they do not need to take care of the vagaries of design, product development and manufacture. Premium Beauty News - What is the scope of your know-how? Sophie Thiolas - Actually, once we're working on a project, we usually dedicate a full-time team to it with the aim cover all the aspects. The following persons may be involved: a sales manager, an innovation task force headed by Maesa's Creative Director, a brand manager, a designer, a regulatory affairs manager and a logistics manager. Our customers therefore benefit from the creativity and the quality of a dedicated team but do not have to support related fixed costs; That's exactly what we mean about ""full-service"". We can also extend our vision to the retail environment and develop the merchandising, the POS advertising and promotional samples. In practice, we adapt our service to the specific needs and goals of each customer. For instance, we cooperate with a network of selected suppliers worldwide in order to identify those matching with each project. As a result, a product may be made of various components sourced from manufacturing facilities in Europe, the USA or Asia. Each year, we develop more than 3,000 new products for our customers. Premium Beauty News - Can you name some of your latest successful developments? Sophie Thiolas - There are plenty! Concerning the most recent ones, let's mention the System U sun-care range featuring 18 SKUs and covering all the segments of the market for offering a tailor-made protection to the entire family. Let's also mention the Carrefour's bath and body-care line, under the ""Rites Originels"" brand, featuring 14 SKUs covering the entire body and hair care segments. Eventually, I'd like to highlight the products we developed for Pimkie, in particular the Lili Vanilla, Sexy Pink and Love Purple toilet waters. Maesa has entirely refreshed the line, through the development of new design for the closures, mixing retro chic and pure lines, and the definition of new packaging colours and graphics, but keeping the vials unchanged. We also developed Pimkie's Love Sun Shine and Love Island toilet waters that will be launched on the summer 2009. Premium Beauty News - Creativity appears to be the main component of your new development strategy? Sophie Thiolas - Yes, of course! One of the major trends of the latest years is the emergence of a ""third generation"" of retailer owned brands. Consumers want products with an original positioning and a quality similar to branded goods. The consequence is that retailer owned brands such as Victoria's Secret, Boots or Sephora have gained a wide recognition. Retailers can no longer offer ""me too"" brands. With the creation of a Creative Department headed by Paul Houlsby, Maesa has achieved the restructuration that will help us to bring the creativity and innovation needed to propose the future successful retailer owned brands."
Cosmogen: Applicators must fit with formulations,"Premium Beauty News - What is the outcome of your participation in Cosmoprof this year? Denis Richard-Orliange - The number of people who visited the 2009 edition of Cosmoprof positively surprised us. In the current economic context, where everybody was expecting a dramatic decrease in the number of visitors, we noticed that less representatives of the major French brands were present while other European brands were massively present. However, there were hardly any US brands visiting the show. Cosmogen's obvious positioning as an innovative company helped us to attract a large numbr of customers to our stand for an update on our latest packaging innovations.

Jackel Cosmetics: a perfect performance,"Jackel's initial activity was an Asian sourcing business for the American and European markets then rapidly focused on the perfumery and cosmetic business. The company soon became a specialist in the transformation of zamac and aluminium, a business area in which Jackel was soon recognised as a perfect performer. The Jackel group can now boast itself to be a world leader in this business, owning an impressive industrial equipment, located in Shenzen, People's Republic of China, employing about 1,800 staff and a facility of 60,000 square metres. Year after year, the investments in this factory are growing at an impressive rate. ""More than ten transfer machines have been added this year and also new automatic polishing lines,"" highlights Jean-Stanislas Orlowski, Jackel France's General Director. Metal transformation is a strategic industrial axis for Jackel Cosmetics. It was reinforced last year through the acquisition of a majority of the shares of an anodising unit, JS Anodising, and the acquisition of a surface treatment unit would be already scheduled this year. ""However, the activity of Jackel Cosmetics Ltd. is far from being limited to metal transformation,"" says Jean-Stanislas Orlowski. Actually, plastic transformation is now an important component of the company's activity through dedicated product units in China, such as PCM Sinoplast (9,000 square metres) and Castle Way (18,600 square metres). Jackel's strategy of industrial integration also features the development of cosmetic and perfumed formulas (lip gloss, lipsticks, compact powders, mascaras, fragrances) in the group's factory, JV Cosmetics, which employs 300 staff and that was recently extended to 22,000 square metres. ""This year we're launching our own range of formulas,"" Jean-Stanislas Orlowski confirms. Metal, plastic, formulations, filling and even glass-making, Jackel Cosmetics (a turnover of USD 120 millions) is now ready to provide full product development services. ""The most important is our customers' confidence. They know that, from one end to the other of the manufacturing chain, we provide a high-quality service. Thanks to our manufacturing facilities in China and our sales network worldwide, in particular in France, our customers have guarantee the best follow-up for achieving the best results,"" Jean-Stanislas Orlowski states. In France, Jackel chose to strengthen its logistics with the opening of a new platform in September 2008, in cooperation with Sitrans, and the recruitment of three additional staff. The US team was also strengthened, with Eric Bigotte and Mike Druce joining the New York office, respectively as Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales, and Vice President of Sales. Guerlain's latest lipstick is a brand new self-explanatory illustration of the Jackel's know-how. The tube is made of zamac, is white nickel coated, features a magnetic closure system and needs a hand assembling of sixteen different pieces. Jackel produced up to 100,000 units per week. The main challenge was to comply with the design and the weight and volume specifications required by the customer."
VG Emballage bets on new products,"Premium Beauty News - VG Emballage is supplying about 2,500 customers in Europe, with a cross-sectoral and multi-material positioning, and featuring a sales force of more than 40 staff. Quite exceptional in the industry isn't it? Alberte Luciani - Yes it is! People often believe that we are distributors, which is true but incomplete. We can supply our customers with turn-key products, vials, finishing and closures. Moreover, we have our own moulds, our own standards and our own specific products. We also have our own technical teams, working in coordination with our subcontractors. There's hardly any other company in Europe, if any, which can claim such a palette of competencies. Premium Beauty News - VG Emballage launched a large number of new products during 2008, in particular for the perfumery and cosmetic markets. Alberte Luciani - Every year we add new products to our offering and we complete our existing offer with additional sizes and new materials. In 2008 we completed our offering with four new foamers (foaming pumps). We also added several vials and jars to our existing ranges as well as two new airless piston pumps. Premium Beauty News - Airless is not a brand new technology for VG Emballage, you have been proposing this technology for a long time… Alberte Luciani - Actually, we have been selling airless pumps for ten years through our product Easy Bag, for which we holds two patents. Easy Bag's particularity is to use an air proof multi-layer single-piece diaphragm Premium Beauty News - What are your expectations for 2009. It may be a difficult year. Alberte Luciani - The economic context will not be easy. However, considering the company's high degree of diversification, VG Emballage should prove resilient. The outset of the year was even quite good for us, because during harsh economical times customers tend to prefer standard solutions that can be customized through specific finishing techniques and closures. This demand perfectly matches our core offering. As far as new products are concerned, we also invest a lot in the development of ""Glass Polymer,"" which looks like glass but is much lighter. After the launched of our BeSafe safety closure, 2009 should also be marked by the launched of a new pump with a double protection against opening, and responding to current market demand for safety."
Trimex: a French success story in Australia,"Trimex employs about 800 staff, for an annual turnover of AU$ 75 million (EUR 39,2 million). The company also runs a 6,200 m2 warehouse. Furthermore, Trimex offers access to a network of 2,200 points of sale. ""Actually, that's one of our main assets"", says Jean-Marc Carriol. ""Many distributing companies did not understand, at least at the beginning,how huge this country is, and how difficult it is to supply all points of sales"". Michel-Henri Carriol arrived in Sydney in 1966, when he was appointed as the new trade attaché at the French embassy. His mission was to advise French companies seeking for business opportunities on this faraway continent. At that time, Australia was far from being a first-list destination for most French or European exporters. But the demand was huge and Michel-Henri Carriol did not hesitate a while before founding its own company. In 1973, he left the embassy. Initially, Trimex operated in several businesses, focusing on the French best selling industries, the ""3F"": fragrance, fashion & food. At the outset of the 1980s, Trimex eventually opted for the personal care segment and concentrated its resources on this business. This new positioning was also the result of an encounter, three years before, between Henri Carriol and Christian Courtin-Clarins, the creator and chief executive of the Clarins group. In parallel, of course, Trimex develops the positions of French cosmetics brand in Australia. In 1989, Clarins grew into a joint venture member of the Trimex Group. Thirty-six years after its creation, Trimex achieved impressive results. Years after years the company grown up as the dominant importer and distributor of perfumes and cosmetics in Australia and New-Zealand. ""We really are the prominent logistics coordinator in the health and beauty industry for this area of the world."" And that's not that easy to supply around 2,200 Australian point of sales, including 65 Myer stores and 35 David Jones outlets. Trimex operates a partnership office for the No.1 natural health company in France, ArkoPharma. Finally, Trimex also represents multi-national group portfolios on a long term basis such as J&J and Puig Group."
