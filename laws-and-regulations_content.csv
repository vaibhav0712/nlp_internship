Microplastics: How the EU plans to reduce pollution by 30% by 2030,"The European Union has launched an ambitious plan to reduce pollution linked to microplastics. The aim is to reduce releases into the environment by 30% by 2030. Ultimately, the new rules [1] will prohibit the sale of microplastics as such, and of products to which microplastics have been added on purpose and that release those microplastics when used. According to the European Commission, this will prevent the release to the environment of about half a million tonnes of microplastics. Microplastics are defined as synthetic polymer particles below five millimetres that are organic, insoluble and resist degradation. The first measures, for example the ban on plastic-based loose glitter and microbeads added to cosmetic formulations, have entered into force on October 17, 2023. In other cases, the sales ban will apply after a longer period (up to 12 years for some cosmetic products) to give affected stakeholders the time to develop and switch to alternatives. The immediate ban on loose glitter, mainly made of plastic and aluminium, but also on microbeads which are used in the composition of cosmetic products such as scrubs, is justified by the immediate availability of usable alternatives. In addition, the European Commission announced other proposals on Monday October 16, this time targeting plastic pellets. The proposed regulation includes compulsory best handling practices for operators, mandatory certification and self-declarations, a harmonised methodology to estimate losses, with lighter requirements for SMEs. In practice, companies will have to conduct risk assessments to ensure their operations are taking the right measures to avoid spillage. If there is spillage, they will have to act quickly to contain leaks and undertake cleaning operations if necessary. The proposed text will now be discussed by the European Parliament and the Council. According to the institution, between 52 and 184 thousand tonnes of pellets are released in the environment each year due to mishandling throughout the entire supply chain. The commission hopes the proposal will reduce pellet release by up to 74 percent. ""Microplastics are pervasive and we need to stop the pollution at the source,"" the EU’s environment commissioner Virginijus Sinkevicius said. Persistent, very mobile, and hard to remove from nature, microplastics have been found all over the world, even in the most remote locations, and in the human body. The risks related to high levels of human exposure are a cause of grave concern."
French industry speaks up for octocrylene as health agency calls for a ban,"The French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health Safety (ANSES) is calling for a ban on octocrylene in sunscreen products. The information revealed at the end of last week by French media has been confirmed by the Agency. Octocrylene is commonly used as a UV filter to protect the skin from the harmful effects of sunlight. In recent years, however, this substance has been criticized for its effects on the environment. In coral, octocrylene has been shown to accumulate in the form of fatty acid conjugates and trigger mitochondrial dysfunction [1]. A 2021 study also pointed to its degradation into benzophenone over time in tested commercial products. In its latest opinion from 2021, the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) considered the use of this filter to be safe in sunscreen products at a maximum concentration of 10%. However, the committee’s analysis did not cover the environmental aspect which is the base of the French health agency’s request for a ban. According to the Agency, banning this filter would be the only option to reduce its presence in the environment and its harmful effects on the ecosystems. However, while it was sent on May 26 to the French Ministry of Ecological Transition, the recommendation was not forwarded to European authorities, an unusual situation. As far as it is concerned, the Ministry denied any attempt to block the process. France should therefore suggest its European partners to review all possible options regarding the safety of the substance. The French Federation of Beauty Enterprises (FEBEA) quickly reacted by stressing that the safety of octocrylene has been duly assessed by the SCCS in the 2021 decision. Regarding the impact of the substance on the environment, the FEBEA considers this allegation ""is not supported by robust methods"" and there is a lack of scientific consensus on the issue. ""Coral reef bleaching is mainly due to rising ocean temperatures linked to global warming, followed by other recognized factors such as overfishing,"" said the cosmetics industry advocacy group. In order to have a better view on the issue, the cosmetics industry is working within the International Collaboration on Cosmetics Safety (ICCS) to develop a standardized calculation model for the exposure of the marine environment to sunscreens. Once developed, the method will be made available to all stakeholders, including: cosmetic brands, public or private research organizations, and agencies. The model is expected be finalized by the end of 2023."
Canada joins countries banning cosmetic animal testing,"With the passing of Bill C-47, Budget Implementation Act, 2023, No. 1, the Canadian Parliament has amended the Food and Drugs Act (FDA) to ban cosmetic animal testing. The new legislative changes mean that in Canada, companies will no longer be allowed to test cosmetic products on animals or sell their cosmetics that rely on animal testing data to establish safety. The text received Royal Assent on June 22, 2023, with a coming into force six months later, on December 22, 2023. 
 According to Health Canada, the practice of testing cosmetics on animals was rarely conducted in Canada. However, by implementing this ban, the country is aligning with the global shift toward animal welfare and is joining a large number of countries that have already taken such measures, including all European Union countries, Australia, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea. The new legislation states that: “No person shall sell a cosmetic unless the person can establish the safety of the cosmetic without relying on data derived from a test conducted on an animal that could cause pain, suffering or injury, whether physical or mental, to the animal.” Some exceptions are listed, in particular when “the test was necessary to meet the requirement in order to sell the product in that country.” “Industry and animal protection advocates have worked together over the last several years to advance a cosmetics animal testing ban in Canada. Since this issue was first raised in Parliament through a Private Member’s Bill in the Senate in 2015, our group has met frequently to build a collaborative relationship and to align on the principles with Health Canada while ensuring the ban works within the Canadian regulatory framework. We are very pleased to see the government pass this long overdue legislation,” said Darren Praznik, President and CEO of Cosmetics Alliance Canada. “Cruelty Free International applauds the Canadian Government for taking action to fulfil the wishes of the vast majority of Canadian citizens who supported a ban on animal testing for cosmetics. This has been a unifying issue that has earned cross-party support in Canada and will match the progress we are seeing around the world as consumers, companies, regulators and advocates come together to achieve a common goal of ensuring that animals won’t suffer for the sake of cosmetics anywhere,” also said Monica Engebretson, Head of Public Affairs North America, Cruelty Free International."
"“Industry is not looking for loopholes,” says CTPA about ban on animal testing","The whole situation results from two decisions by the Board of Appeal of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) [1] in August 2020, requiring German chemicals manufacturer Symrise to carry out several toxicity tests on animals on two chemical UV filters (homosalate and 2-ethylhexyl salicylate), used exclusively in sunscreen formulations, to fulfil ‘tick-box’ registration requirements for worker safety under the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation. In the wake of the ruling, key players from the cosmetics industry, including Avon, L’Oréal, Procter & Gamble, Unilever and Lush, have joined forces with Humane Society International to oppose a decision that would undermine “the EU’s animal testing ban success story.” A joint campaign was even launched in 2021, calling on European citizens to mobilize against ECHA’s decisions. To clarify the legal situation in the United Kingdom, Cruelty Free International brought the case before the High Court of Justice saying the British government had not communicated clearly on the fact that it had aligned with ECHA’s Boar of Appeal ruling. In a judicial review of the Home Office’s policy on animal testing, the High Court dismissed the complaint and confirmed that in some case, chemicals used in cosmetics may be tested on animals as a last resort, to prove their safety for workers or the environment for the purposes of the REACH regulation on chemicals. This has been interpreted by Cruelty Free International as the proof that the government had abandoned the ban. “This is absolutely not the case,"" said Dr Emma Meredith, Director-General of CTPA. “Animal testing on cosmetic products has been banned in the UK since the late 1990s and these strict bans remain in place and will continue to be a key part of the UK cosmetics law, whether or not a product makes a ‘not tested on animals’ or ‘cruelty-free’ claim.” Indeed, CTPA considers the UK High Court ruling does not override the Cosmetics Regulation bans on animal testing. The association has sought reassurance from the Home Office, and said a Government spokesperson confirmed: “There has been no change in our legislation and the ban on using animals for the testing of finished cosmetic products remains in force.” Actually, the regulatory dilemmas are basically the same in the UK and within the European Union. Both the UK Cosmetics Regulation and the EU Cosmetic Products Regulation ban animal testing of cosmetic products and their ingredients. However, the ingredients in cosmetics are also subject to other chemical safety laws, including the REACH Regulation, which sometimes requires substances to be tested on animals, in particular to ensure the safety of workers who might be exposed to chemicals, and the environment. That was the meaning of ECHA’s 2020 rulings. Cruelty Free International considers that ECHA’s and the UK High Court’s interpretation of the legislation is creating loopholes and that the stringent bans on animal are finally abandoned. Therefore, the NGO is now seeking permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal against the judge’s ruling. Commenting on the decision, Cruelty Free International stressed the judge also said that there was nothing to prevent the Government from reinstating the policy ban. “The Government does not have to slavishly follow legislation coming from the EU. It should do what the overwhelming majority of British people want,” said the animal rights advocacy group. “The UK Cosmetics Regulation is clear in specifying that in order to meet its requirements cosmetic products may not be placed on the UK market if the final formulation, ingredients in a final formulation, or a finished product have been subject to animal testing if the purpose of the tests was compliance with the UK cosmetics laws, no matter where such tests took place. There are no loopholes and the cosmetics industry is not seeking to circumvent these important bans,” commented CTPA in a statement."
EU REACH Committee votes to ban microplastics from most daily life products,"On August 30, 2022, the European Commission presented a proposal to amend the REACH Regulation in order to address the proliferation of synthetic polymer microparticles (the so-called “microplastics”). On April 26, 2023, after a lengthy legislative process and heated discussions between member states and consultations with the various stakeholders, the REACH Committee voted in favour of the Commission’s proposal. The text aims to progressively phase out microplastics of everyday products, like cosmetics, fragrances and home cleaners, as well as of fertilizers, paints and artificial sports turfs. It defines microplastics as solid polymers contained in microparticles or microparticles which have a solid polymer surface coating, and used as a substance on their own or in a mixture in a concentration equal to or greater than 0,01% by weight. According to the European Commission, the proposed restriction would prevent the release in the environment of about 500,000 tonnes of microplastics, at an estimated total cost up to EUR 19 billion Despite intense advocacy from NGOs and from some cosmetics makers, the Committee granted several industries transitional periods to implement the ban. These deadlines range from six years for sports fields and encapsulated fragrances, to five years for detergents and some pesticides, and twelve years for some leave-on makeup products, such as lipsticks and nail polish. Rinse-off cosmetic products will have a four-year transitional period. However, the text says that “in order to encourage the substitution of synthetic polymer microparticles in make-up, lip and nail ‘leave-on’ cosmetic products before the end of the transitional period,” these products will have to bear a label informing consumers that they contain microplastics, eight years after the entry into force of the regulation. Before the official adoption of the text, EU Parliament and Council have a three-month scrutiny period, after which the Regulation will enter into force immediately."
Fragrance dupes are all the rage among younger shoppers. What the price?,"On TikTok, the #dupes hashtag has no less than two billion views. All the hashtags dedicated to fragrance dupes — and there are many of them — total well over 500 million views, reflecting the interest that users have in these imitations. Beyond fragrances, dupes exist in many sectors, including fashion, but also cosmetics, with dupes of skincare products, makeup, or perfumes. While low-cost imitations are nothing new, the phenomenon has taken on particular importance in the era of social networks where the quest for “good deals” has become one of Gen Z’s favourite sports. In terms of perfumery, the aim is to identify accessible fragrances that smell as close as possible as some of the world’s great designer scents. A game that is not very difficult, as fragrance duplicates are common in a world where there is no patent for scents. On social networks, Internet users therefore publicly engage in a big-scale game of scent comparisons. According to Stylight, the scent of the Baccarat Rouge 540 fragrance from Maison Francis Kurkdjian, for instance, would have been compared by TikTok users to the much cheaper Cloud by Ariana Grande. The fact that Internet users and influencers share “good deals” spotted among the plethora of perfumes available on the market is not really a problem. But the game sometimes takes a curious twist. The many videos themed on the trend seem to feature a lot of products by retailers such as Zara, Lidl, Action, Primark, or Mango. We can thus learn that Zara’s ’Gardenia’ apparently would smell just like Yves Saint Laurent’s ’Black Opium’, and that ’Lovely de Suddenly’ by Lidl would be a dupe of Dior’s ’J’adore’ scent. Outside the social networks, the media — whether specialist and generalist — often reproduce identical lists referring to the same distributors. In many cases, it looks like these comparisons might be – at least partly – controlled by third parties and are getting dangerously close to the limits set by industrial and commercial property rights. As long as they do not reproduce the designs and models of the brands they are referring to, and as long as they do not imitate their names, dupes are not considered to be counterfeits. However, certain practices may be sufficient to bring the law into play. It might be useful to remind that in 2014, a French court found that a company managing a site named www.pirate-parfum.fr was guilty of brand infringement. According to the judges, the company was not making reference to famous brands in order to compare its own products, but to profit from their fame by sparing itself the marketing design and development costs their owners did meet to become as famous as they are now. Whether they name their products dupes, generic perfumes, or designer-inspired perfumes, brands such as Nox, Divain, Eden Perfumes or Noted Aromas are using commercial practices that are very similar to those then condemned by French courts. However, none of these brands is located in France, and the case law on these subjects is quite variable from one country to another, even within the European Union. Moreover, court delay can be very long. Recently, Spanish-based chain retailer Equivalenza was sentenced by French courts to a fine of 400,000 euros - including 200,000 euros suspended - for trademark infringement with regard to major perfume brands, after almost eight years of legal proceedings! “Equivalenza was sentenced for the distribution and use of ‘correlation’ tables. But, to date, the case law history on dupes is inexistent,” highlights Xavier Guéant, Director Legal Affairs at France’s Fragrance, Cosmetics and Toiletries Federation (FEBEA). “However, this a highly symbolic decision. It marks an important step in the defence of the intangible perfumery heritage, and it should initiate a reflection about the practices of some industry players. And we are obviously very attentive to the practices that are now driven by the rise of social networks,” adds Guéant. In parallel to a well-informed comparison from beauty addicts searching for good deals, dupes could also hide the mere reinvention – with a new name – of old practices that have been judged illegal in the past. In any case, it is very unlikely that dupes announce the advent of a new way of consuming fragrances and the emergence of what some call “fast perfumery”. Indeed, the practice is closely linked to the innovation and creativity of major brands and cannot get any autonomy from those who set the trends."
Group of beauty brands calls on EU for swifter ban on microplastics,"Claiming to be microplastic-free already, the letter signatories [1] say the upcoming legislation does not go far nor fast enough “in its current format,” largely due to “exceptionally long transition periods”. Under the current proposal, transition periods would vary from four years for rinse-off products to 12 years for certain makeup products. Encapsulated fragrances would benefit for a five to eight year delay, and leave-on cosmetic products would have six years to adapt. The main arguments supporting these transition periods are the lack of alternatives, the cost of reformulation and the potential impact on how the products perform. A list of claims that the signatories of the open letter deem irrelevant. “The exceptionally long transition periods in the current proposal, especially 12 years for products such as make-up, remain at odds with the principles laid down in ongoing European Commission initiatives and therefore have no justification,” they say. They believe the legislation as it is proposed now is too flexible unnecessarily lenient since alternatives already exist. “It is clear that part of the industry doesn’t want to change,” says Sjoerd Trompetter, co-founder of Dutch personal care brand Naïf. “We have been making microplastic-free products for ten years. With great alternatives and without complaints. So it’s not that hard!” he adds. However, there is an urgent need to act, the microplastic-free brands say. Weleda quotes recent studies that found that 9 out of 10 care products still include microplastics. They contend that in Europe alone, 7kg of plastics from cosmetics are flushed into the environment every minute. Microplastics have been found in the human blood, lungs and even the placenta. “We urge the European Commission to implement decisive, consistent, and rapid introduction of microplastic-free legislation as a matter of urgency. We feel there is no justification for the exceptionally long 12-year transition period when certified natural cosmetics brands such as Weleda show that working without using microplastics at all has always been possible,” says Nataliya Yarmolenko, Chief Commercial Officer at Weleda. The request would have the support of public opinion. Indeed, more than 52.000 people across Europe have already signed a petition by the Plastic Soup Foundation to ban all microplastics in cosmetics and personal care products. The open letter signatories also underpin their request on a recent study by Provenance also shows that 9 out of 10 shoppers believe sustainability and ethics-related considerations are important when buying beauty and wellness products. [2] In 2015, Cosmetics Europe had recommended manufacturers to discontinue the use of synthetic, solid and non-biodegradable plastic particles used for exfoliating and cleansing in wash-off cosmetic products placed on the market as of 2020. However, the use of plastic polymers in the cosmetics industry is far from being limited to these products. Nevertheless, the development of alternative solutions may be complex, as in the case of encapsulation, and the need for innovation is growing urgently."
France tightens rules on “net zero” claims to take aim at greenwashing,"One of the most consensual measures of the French Climate and Resilience Law [1], which was voted in 2021, has entered into force on January 1, 2023. The text requires to all companies that highlight the carbon neutrality of a product or service to produce a report on all the greenhouse gas emissions of the said product or service. The report must be updated every year and cover the entire life cycle, from production to disposal or recycling. It must also explain how greenhouse gas emissions will be avoided as a priority, then reduced and finally ""offset"". If the emissions of the product or service concerned have increased between two successive years, the ""carbon neutral"" claim is prohibited. Finally, the offsetting methods used for the residual emissions will have to be detailed, including the nature and description of the projects and their cost. This obligation concerns claims as ""carbon neutral"", ""zero carbon"", ""zero carbon footprint"", ""climate neutral"", ""fully compensated"", ""100% compensated"" or with any wording of equivalent meaning or scope. [2] Advertising or packaging bearing the claim of carbon neutrality must also include a link to a website detailing the company’s climate plan. In case of violation, the company may have to pay a fine of 100,000 euros, which can be increased up to the total amount of the expenses devoted to the advertising campaign. The French government has said the goal is to provide transparent information for the public, to ""progressively strengthen the commitments of advertisers"" and to combat ""greenwashing"". The measures come after United Nations experts recently issued a raft of new guidelines aimed at drawing a ""red line"" around bogus net zero claims. The new recommendations from UN experts, published in November at the COP27 talks in Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh, say firms cannot claim to be net-zero if they invest in new fossil fuels, cause deforestation or offset emissions with carbon credits instead of reducing them. UN chief Antonio Guterres has called for companies to update their net-zero pledges within a year to meet the new criteria. In November, French climate activists from the association Notre Affaire À Tous said they had filed complaints with advertising regulators in several European countries over claims that the football World Cup in Qatar would be carbon neutral. Also last year, Britain’s Advertising Standards Authority hit out at HSBC for adverts promoting its green initiatives that failed to highlight the bank’s contributions to greenhouse gas emissions and banned further use of the posters. Britain’s financial watchdog has also proposed toughening regulations of environmental claims, including of investment product sustainability labels and restrictions on terms such as ""green"", ""sustainable"" and ""ESG"" (environmental, social, and governance)."
New York joins the list of states that ban cosmetics tested on animals,"Governor Kathy Hochul has signed into law the New York Cruelty Free Cosmetics Act (A.5653B/S.4839B) that will prohibit the manufacture and sale of cosmetics in New York State that have been tested on animals, beginning in January 2023. Instead, manufacturers will have to use widely available non-animal testing methods. However, cosmetics currently on sale will remain available and several other exceptions are provided for by the text. The bill, which was sponsored by Assemblymember Linda B. Rosenthal and State Senator Alessandra Biaggi, passed the New York State Assembly and New York State Senate with almost unanimous bi-partisan support. “More consumers than ever are demanding cruelty-free cosmetics, and I am proud that my legislation banning the sale of cosmetics tested on animals has been signed into law. I am proud to have worked with Cruelty Free International in passing this legislation into law and look forward to seeing more states follow in New York’s footsteps,"" said Linda B. Rosenthal. ""New York has finally joined the list of forty countries that have taken a stand against this harmful practice. Protecting the safety of humans by testing cosmetics is extremely important, but does not mean that animals must serve at their expense for our wellbeing,” added Senator Alessandra Biaggi. The new legislations was also supported by the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC). With 600 member companies representing more than 90% of the U.S. beauty industry, PCPC is the leading trade association representing cosmetics and personal care products companies in the U.S. The passing of the New York Cruelty Free Cosmetics Act could pave the way to the vote of a federal legislation. “U.S. history has shown that state activity leads to changes at the federal level. Because of New York’s association with the fashion and beauty industries, passing the New York Cruelty Free Cosmetics Act could be the tipping point that leads to the passage of a federal Humane Cosmetics Act,” commented Monica Engebretson, Head of Public Affairs North America at Cruelty Free International. The Federal Humane Cosmetics Act - the latest version of which was introduced in the House in December 2021 - would ban the sale and manufacturing of animal tested cosmetics throughout the US. More than 375 companies have signed on to support the legislation for a nationwide ban, including Walgreens, The Body Shop, Unilever, H&M and Paula’s Choice, according to the Humane Society. ""Now it is up to Congress to pass the Humane Cosmetics Act to bring about a consistent standard for ending cosmetics animal testing across the country,"" said Brian Shapiro, New York state director for the Humane Society of the United States."
California bans PFAS in cosmetics and textiles,"California is once again at the forefront of the regulation of chemical substances in the United States. After having banned PFAS in paper-based food packaging and juvenile products on October 2021, the state is now prohibiting the substances in cosmetics and textiles. Sometimes referred to as ""forever chemicals,"" PFAS have been the subject of various studies and evaluations, some highlighting how these compounds can remain in the environment or have harmful effects on health. The adoption of these of restrictions on PFAS follows several warnings about their relatively frequent presence in many everyday consumer products. Last year, a study published in Environmental Science & Technology Letters on 231 cosmetics purchased in the United States and Canada showed that sevaral of them contained PFAS. [1] In detail, more than three quarters of the waterproof mascaras analyzed — but also nearly two thirds of the foundations and liquid lipsticks, and more than half of the eye and lip products — had high concentrations of fluorine, the researchers stated. On the heels of the publication of this study, two Senators had introduced a bill titled ""No PFAS in Cosmetics Act"" in order to require the FDA to ban the addition of PFAS to cosmetic products [2]. A similar proposal has been submitted in the House of Representatives [3], but both texts still need to be discussed. However, Californian legislators moved faster than those in Washington. As far as textiles are concerned, Assembly Bill No. 1817 prohibits the manufacture, distribution, or sale within the state of any new articles containing regulated PFAS beginning January 1, 2025 [4]. When it comes to cosmetics, Assembly Bill No. 2771 prohibits the manufacture, distribution, or sale of any product in the state that contains “intentionally added PFAS” starting January 1, 2025 [5]. The text greatly expands on AB 2762, a bill passed on September 30, 2020, that banned the manufacture, distribution, or sale of 13 specified PFAS substances in cosmetic products. Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS are defined as fluorinated organic chemicals containing at least one fully fluorinated carbon atom. However, Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would have required certain businesses to submit annual reports concerning the usage of PFAS in products sold or imported in California [6]."
Cosmetics Europe calls for a science-based cosmetic products regulation,"In line with the objectives of the European Green Deal and of the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability (SCCS), the European Commission is considering a modification of the European Regulation on Cosmetic Products (CPR). The revision would include, among other points: the Generic Risk Management Approach, the concept of essentiality [2], the definition of nanomaterials, product labelling rules, safety assessment and combination effects. The public consultation launched on this issue at the end of March was closed on June 21. In its contribution to the public consultation, Cosmetics Europe laid down its recommendations , urging the European Commission to take a holistic approach to the revision process and see it in the overall context of various legislations stemming from the European Green Deal so that coherence and consistency across legislations can be ensured. Cosmetics Europe says it fully supports the objectives of the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability (CSS) of increasing the protection of health and environment, whilst boosting innovation and promoting EU competitiveness. However, the organisation recommends that any revision of the CPR should: – foster a sustainable (globally) competitive cosmetics sector, entrepreneurship and innovation capacity;
– strengthen its science-based, proportionate, effective and efficient approach, addressing human and environmental safety in the interest of consumers, industry and authorities;
– acknowledge the long history of a high level of safety of European cosmetic products and keep, at its core, the principle of scientific safety-based risk assessment;
– remain the “Gold Standard” and international reference worldwide;
– maintain a level of regulatory burden achievable and manageable particularly by SMEs; and
– be future-proofed by introducing digital labelling provisions. According to Cosmetics Europe, this notably involves maintaining a dedicated independent scientific committee for cosmetics safety assessment, and derogations to the concept of essentiality where safety the safety of cosmetics containing the concerned substances can be unambiguously demonstrated. Furthermore, Cosmetics Europe also says an additional systematic safety margin for all cosmetic ingredients should not be introduced. ""It is not necessary and would have significant negative impacts on practically all cosmetic products, consumer choice and public health, without a demonstrated positive effect on consumer safety,"" the organisation states. Eventually, while welcoming the introduction of a horizontal definition of nanomaterials and mandatory digital labelling requirements, Cosmetics Europe asks the Commission to ensure enough time for the industry to transition. The pevious week, the International Fragrance Association (IFRA) raised concerns about the consequences of the European Commission’s strategy for the sustainability of chemicals. A new study, commissioned by the fragrance industry trade association, suggests a negative impact on the industry of up to EUR 2 billion per year."
The fragrance industry expresses concerns about the EU’s Green Deal,"The study, by consultancy Ricardo Energy & Environment, focuses on how specific proposals within the European Union Commission’s proposed Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability (CSS) may affect fragrance companies and the wider industry in Europe. It suggests that more than a quarter of the industry’s portfolio in turnover terms would be affected in some way by the proposed changes. This impact would be felt by consumers, says the report, with a reduction in choice of products that people consider important to their mental and physical wellbeing. “The study highlights the challenges posed by the current plans to the long-term socio-economic sustainability of our sector, especially for small businesses, which make up half of all companies in the European fragrance industry,” commented Martina Bianchini, IFRA President. As well as addressing the potential impact on the fragrance industry, the study highlights a ‘ripple’ effect on the wider fragrance value chain – from raw materials suppliers, to manufacturers, consumer goods companies and retailers – due to the need to substitute and reformulate products. Published on 14 October 2020, within the EU’s Green Deal, the chemicals strategy for sustainability aims to create a toxic-free environment for EU citizens, in a context where the global chemicals production is forecast to double between 2020 and 2030. It is part of the EU’s zero pollution ambition, which is a key commitment of the European Green Deal. Among other things, the strategy promises to ban the most harmful chemicals in consumer products, to take into account the cocktail effect of chemicals when assessing risks from chemicals. IFRA explains that the proposals of the chemicals strategy for sustainability include: an extension of the General Approach to Risk Management (GRA) that does not take account of the specificities of fragrances; the addition of hazard classes to the EU Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation (CLP); and the introduction of a ‘mixture assessment factor’ to assess combination effects of chemicals. IFRA President, Martina Bianchini, expressed her support for the overall objectives of the EU Green Deal, but adds the transition “can only be successful if it promotes sustainable growth, covering social, economic, environmental, and cultural dimensions.” Data for the study was collected from dozens of companies, large and small, from across Europe. It will be used as input to the ongoing consultative process. IFRA will present the findings to European decision-makers as work progresses on implementation of the CSS."
Bondi Sands faces US class action over ‘reef friendly’ claim for sunscreens,"In a class action complaint filed in the US District Court in Northern California, Bondi Sands is accused of mislabelling several sunscreen products available in the US as “reef friendly” while they contain chemical filters, such as avobenzone, homoslate, octisalate, and/or octocrylene, which according to the plaintiff “are not safe for reefs” [Moran v. Bondi Sands (U.S.) Inc., 21-cv-07961-JSW (N.D. Cal. Apr. 29, 2022)] [1]. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, which revealed the case, other sunscreen makers, including Banana Boat and Edgewell Personal Care [2], are facing similar complaints. In response to questions from the Australian newspaper, Bondi Sands said their “sunscreen products are made in Australia and are compliant with TGA regulations, which are the strongest SPF guidelines in the world, and are compliant with strict EU and FDA laws.” On their website, the Melbourne-headquartered company now provides a definition of what does “Reef Friendly” mean according to them: the absence of oxybenzone [3] and octinoxate [4]. “It’s important to know that the term “Reef Friendly” is not defined or regulated by authorities, so when you see these words on Bondi Sands sunscreens, it simply means that our entire suncare range has been formulated in compliance with Hawaii’s regulations and is free of oxybenzone and octinoxate. We will continue to evolve our product formulations based on guidance from both local and international authorities,” the website quotes. Indeed, since January 1, 2021, the U.S. State of Hawaii has banned sunscreens containing these two filters, but did not provide a definition of what would be a reef of coral safe product. The class actions against Bondi Sands and other manufacturers should therefore focus mainly on the question of how misleading the terms ‘reef friendly’ and ‘reef safe’ are for consumers without any expertise in the formulation of sunscreen products. While the negative effects of oxybenzone on corals are fairly well documented, the impact of the numerous chemical UV filters washed into the oceans every year is still a subject of controversy, with some scientists insisting on the impact of global warming. However, research on this issue is making advances and some mechanisms of action are now better understood."
US Congress moves to ban discrimination of race-related hairstyles,"The bill (H.R. 2116, aka the CROWN Act of 2022), which now moves to the Senate, explicitly aims to protect Black Americans who have been forced to cut their hair or style it in a certain way while at school or work. ""As a Black woman who loves my braids, I know what it’s like to feel isolated because of how I wear my hair,"" said Cori Bush, a Black representative from Missouri, just before the vote. Black Americans have long explained they are often treated unfairly at work and in schools because of their natural hair or protective styles like braids, knots, twists and locks and have been forced to cut their hair or change their style in a certain way to comply with standards corresponding to other ethnical hair textures. Recently, numerous instances of this kind of discrimination have risen to public attention in the United States. In late 2019, a Black teen in Texas was suspended from school and threatened with expulsion if she did not cut her dreadlocks, which officials had deemed too long. Her case provoked a heated national debate over systemic racism in schools. Another case occurred in December 2018, when a referee forced a Black wrestler to cut his hair or face disqualification, arguing that his hairstyle was against the rules. According to recent a research by Dove, a Black woman in the U.S. is 80% more likely to change her natural hair to meet social norms or expectations at work [1]. Opponents of the bill, like the Republican Jim Jordan, accused Democrats of ""avoiding the issues the American people care about,"" like inflation and the soaring cost of gasoline. ""I believe we can walk and chew gum at the same time,"" shot back Sheila Jackson Lee, a Black representative from Texas. The White House said President Joe Biden supports the bill, and underlined his belief that ""no person should be denied the ability to obtain a job, succeed in school or the workplace, secure housing, or otherwise exercise their rights based on a hair texture or hair style."" While the Democrat-sponsored bill garnered some Republican votes, most Republicans voted against it, making the bill’s fate in the evenly-divided Senate uncertain. Several US states have already taken the step to ban hair discrimination, starting with California in the summer of 2019, immediately followed by New York. And after years of only allowing women in the military to wear a tight bun, the US Army revised its standards in January 2021 to better reflect the diversity in its ranks. If the Crown Act becomes law, natural hair discrimination would be treated as if it were race or national origin discrimination under federal civil rights law. Outside the U.S. too, people with afro hair texture explain they often feel obliged to change the natural texture of their hair in order to comply with social standards. Understanding that hair (or skin) stereotypes are closely intertwined, cosmetic brands have progressively changed their approach of the issue, even concerning the words the use to describe the different hair types or hair styles and whether to change them… or not."
All cosmetic products can now apply for the EU Ecolabel,"The European Commission has adopted new European Union Ecolabel criteria for cosmetics and animal-care products. As a consequence, all cosmetic products, as defined under the EU Cosmetic Regulation, can now apply for the label. Previous requirements for cosmetics to be awarded the EU Ecolabel covered a limited range of so-called ‘rinse-off’ products such as body wash, shampoo and conditioner. The updated rules include ‘leave-on’ cosmetics such as creams, oils, skin-care lotions, deodorants and anti-perspirants, sunscreens, as well as hairstyling and make-up products. The purpose of the EU Ecolabel is to help to reduce the environmental impact of products on water, soil and biodiversity, contributing to ""a clean and circular economy and a toxic-free environment."" As far as cosmetic products are concerned, the ecolabel criteria promote products that have limited impacts in terms of eco-toxicity and biodegradability, and that use less packaging, which can be easily recycled. The use of recycled material and refillable packaging is promoted. There are also sustainable sourcing requirements for some ingredients such as palm oil, palm kernel oil and their derivatives The new requirements set a total ban on substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction, on substances of very high concern, nanomaterials, those identified or suspected of having endocrine disrupting properties, phthalates, and perfluorinated and polyfluorinated substances, as well as on microplastics. The EU Ecolabel also sets rules to guarantee that packaging is minimised and/or easy-to-recycle. “I encourage companies to apply for the EU Ecolabel and profit from its established reputation. The EU Ecolabel helps guide concerned consumers towards reliable, certified green products and supports the transition to a clean and circular economy,” said Virginijus Sinkevičius, EU Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries. Awarded after assessment by an independent organisation, this label could perhaps give substance to clean beauty, which remains a vague notion for many consumers. According to the European Environment Bureau, the expansion of the eco-label to new categories could help fight greenwashing which, according to the NGO, is proliferating in the cosmetics industry, with “three out of four products in the EU displaying an environmental claim or label.”"
Mexico’s Senate unanimously votes to ban animal testing for cosmetic products,"In an unanimous vote (103 votes in favor), the senators approved the changes proposed by the Chamber of Deputies to the project aiming at prohibiting animal tests for cosmetic products. The bill is derived from an initiative presented, in April 2019, by Senator Ricardo Monreal Ávila. As a consequence, the country’s General Health Law (Ley General de Salud) will prohibit manufacturing, importing or marketing cosmetic products that have been tested on animals or contains ingredients or combinations of ingredients that have been tested on animals. The bill was supported by animal rights advocacy groups the Humane Society International Mexico and Te Protejo. “We are thrilled to see Mexico become the first country in North America to outlaw cosmetic animal testing, and commend our bill sponsor Senator Ricardo Monreal, and all congressmen and women for voting to end cosmetic animal testing in Mexico,” said the organizations in a statement. Commenting on the vote, Senator Ricardo Monreal Ávila called it “historic”: El @senadomexicano aprobó, por unanimidad, la iniciativa #BellezaSinCrueldad, cuyo objetivo es prohibir el uso de animales en experimentos de la industria cosmética, y fomentar el desarrollo de mecanismos alternativos. @_AnimalHeroes_ @HSI_Mexico pic.twitter.com/UytwD6godR — Ricardo Monreal A. (@RicardoMonrealA) September 3, 2021 The bill was also supported by Lush, Unilever, P&G, L’Oréal, Avon and others in the beauty industry, who are working with HSI globally through the Animal-Free Safety Assessment (AFSA) toward policy alignment, and training measures to support smaller companies and government authorities in transitioning from animal testing to state-of-the-art non-animal methods, which are readily available. With the addition of Mexico, animal testing for cosmetics is officially already banned in 41 countries, as well as 10 states in Brazil and seven in the United States. Three other U.S. states - New Jersey, Rhode Island and New York - are currently considering similar bills, and federal bills are pending reintroduction in both the U.S. and Canada."
Cosmetics brands campaign against ECHA to maintain EU’s ban on animal testing,"Animal rights groups and cosmetics industry giants are joining forces to say no to the re-introduction of animal testing for cosmetic products in Europe. The move follows new requirements from ECHA, the European Chemicals Agency, seeking to make animal testing possible again in order to evaluate certain substances already used in the industry. The Body Shop and Dove, with the support of organizations including PETA, Cruelty Free Europe, HSI, Eurogroup for Animals and ECEAE, are today calling on European citizens to mobilize against these decisions by signing a ""European Citizen’s Initiative"" petition now available online. In a joint statement, the brands explain that animal testing is no longer necessary to ensure safety in cosmetics, since modern, scientific, non-animal and equally human-relevant methods have been developed and used by specialists for decades. After many campaigns and advances in the fight against animal cruelty, the ban on the sale of cosmetic products tested on animals came into force in March 2013 in the European Union. The ban proved a model in the field, inspiring debate and reflection in many other countries around the world. But NGOs and cosmetics industry players now fear a return to the past following a decision by the ECHA’s Board of Appeal in 2020 to conduct tests on animals to assess two substances, homosalate and 2-ethylhexyl salicylate. While terminating animal testing on finished products was achieved well before 2013, putting an end to the tests on ingredients required a huge amount of investment to develop alternative methods. And most of the research has been funded by the industry. ""At Dove, we stand passionately against animal cruelty. We strongly believe that there is no role for animal testing for beauty products or their ingredients, and have pioneered safe and humane alternatives to assess the safety of products and ingredients for many years. This commitment drives us to take urgent action to protect the ban against animal testing in the EU,"" explains Firdaous El Honsali, Senior Director of Global Communications and Sustainability at Dove. In order to make the European petition known to as many people as possible, The Body Shop and Dove are taking to the streets of Berlin, Paris, Milan and Madrid with a full-scale awareness campaign. Thus, citizens will discover dedicated artworks on the walls of their cities, together with a slogan inviting people to join the fight to end animal testing and save cruelty-free cosmetics in Europe. The campaign is being led hand in hand with the artist and activist, Nina Valkhoff. ""It’s sad that — once again — we have to fight a battle that Europe’s citizens thought they had already won, but with a successful European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI), we can make decision-makers listen, protect the groundbreaking bans, and secure concerted action to end the suffering of animals in EU laboratories for good,"" hope the animal protection groups involved alongside the two cosmetic brands."
USA: Study prompts Senate bill to ban PFAS in cosmetic products,"The study recently published in Environmental Science & Technology Letters surveyed some 231 cosmetics purchased in the United States and Canada [1] and therefore submitted to the regulations concerning chemicals in cosmetics in these countries. However, this new research builds on previous, more limited studies that detected PFAS in cosmetics sold in Europe and Japan. Using particle-induced gamma-ray emission (PIGE) spectroscopy to rapidly screen total fluorine concentrations, the researchers first found that most of the waterproof mascaras, liquid lipsticks and foundations tested contained fluorine. According to the authors, this indicates the “probable presence” of PFAS in the tested items. In detail, more than three quarters of the waterproof mascaras analyzed — but also nearly two thirds of the foundations and liquid lipsticks, and more than half of the eye and lip products — had high concentrations of fluorine, the researchers state. The products with the highest levels of fluorine were analyzed further. The verdict: they all contained at least four PFAS that the researchers consider to be ""of concern."" A total of twenty-nine products were selected for further analysis, which revealed detectable levels of at least four specific PFAS in all of them. The study authors note that these included ""PFAS that break down into other PFAS that are known to be highly toxic and environmentally harmful."" Sometimes referred to as ""forever chemicals,"" PFAS have been the subject of various studies and evaluations, some highlighting how these compounds can remain in the environment or have harmful effects on health. The study also revealed that only a scarce few products, among those that were further analyzed, mentioned the presence of these substances on their ingredients list. According to the authors of the study, this may be linked to the “series of exemptions and generalized guidelines for polymers, silanes and siloxanes, color additives, and substituted compounds” that complicate the use of the International Cosmetic Ingredient (INCI) Dictionary and Handbook. According to the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC), the trade association that gathers the main producers of cosmetic and personal care products in the USA, some of the fluorine levels detected in the study could be the result of trace amounts from materials naturally occurring in the environment or as a result of the manufacturing process. ""Since trace amounts are not intentionally added to products, they are not required to be listed on the label. FDA recognizes their possible presence and offers guidance on allowable levels,"" commented Alexandra Kowcz, Chief Scientist, Personal Care Products Council. “All cosmetic products and their ingredients are subject to the same safety requirement under the FD&C Act - they must be shown to be safe for consumers before they are marketed. The labeling of those products must be truthful and not misleading,” she added. In the wake of the publication of the study, Senators Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) introduced a bill titled ""No PFAS in Cosmetics Act"" in order to require the FDA to ban the addition of PFAS to cosmetic products. Let’s note that several PFASs were banned by the Toxic Free Cosmetics Act that was passed in California last year. “Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a diverse group of chemicals with more than 6,000 ingredients and widely differing chemistries. It is inappropriate to assume that anything with a fluorine atom has the same safety profile. (...) PCPC, working with the Environmental Working Group, has supported prohibition of certain PFAS from use in cosmetics. Our member companies take their responsibility for product safety and the trust families put in those products very seriously. Science and safety are the foundation for everything we do,” emphasized Alexandra Kowcz."
China to end compulsory animal testing for imported cosmetics on May 1,"A series of drafts aiming at implementing the new Chinese regulations on cosmetics [1] had given a glimpse of this possible exemption. Now it’s official! Indeed, the Provisions for Management of Cosmetic Registration and Notification Dossiers, which were published on March 4th by China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), provide that so-called ""general"" cosmetic products can be imported into China without having to be tested on animals first. Actually, as far as cosmetic products are concerned, Chinese regulations make a distinction between two categories of products: “special-use” cosmetics and “general” cosmetics. “Special use” cosmetics include: hair dyes, hair perming products, freckle-removing/whitening products, sunscreens, anti hair loss products, as well as all cosmetics “claiming new efficacy”. All other products complying with the definition of cosmetics given by the Cosmetic Supervision and Administration Regulation (CSAR) are classified as “general cosmetics”. The exemption from animal testing therefore concerns the majority of cosmetics imported into China. However, to benefit from this exemption regime, the Provisions for Management of Cosmetic Registration and Notification Dossiers require to provide two documents: – A certificate of compliance to the good manufacturing practices (GMP), issued by the competent authority of the country of origin;
– The results of the product’s safety assessment. Depending on the country of origin, obtaining GMP compliance certificates could be more or less difficult. In France, however, governmental authorities have anticipated the publication of the Chinese text and provided for an online procedure for requesting and obtaining the document. In addition, certain “general” cosmetic products will still have to be tested on animals when they are imported into China: – Products intended to be used by children;
– Products using new ingredients (as defined by the Chinese regulations) during the compulsory 3-year monitoring period;
– Products notified, imported or manufactured by a person listed as a key supervision target by the NMPA. “We were pleased to see that the anticipated update to China’s cosmetics animal testing rules by the National Medical Products Administration has been finalised, exempting some imported ordinary cosmetics from mandatory animal testing from May 1st this year. While some ingredients and products remain ineligible and there are questions about GMP requirements, it is too early for cruelty free certainty, but we’re definitely getting closer. We hope that it won’t be too long before Leaping Bunny brands will be able to import their cosmetics ranges into China and stay cruelty free,” commented Michelle Thew, CEO of animal welfare organisation Cruelty Free International. Despite these restrictions, this is an important step towards removing impediments on accessing the Chinese market."
Brazil’s Anvisa clarifies new ingredients labelling rules for cosmetics,"Anvisa, the Brazilian agency responsible for overseeing the safety of drugs and cosmetics, has just published a technical note (Nota Técnica (NT) 5/2021 [1]) specifying the procedures for labelling in Portuguese the ingredients of perfumes and hygiene and cosmetic products sold in the country. The note complements the rules laid down in the resolution (RDC) 432/2020 of November 4, 2020, which provides that personal hygiene products, cosmetics and perfumes marketed in Brazil must be labelled with the list of their ingredients in Portuguese. ""The International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) remains mandatory in the labelling of personal hygiene products, cosmetics and perfumes,"" Anvisa first emphasizes in its note. In practical, as the November text already mentioned, the translation into Portuguese appears to be a complement to the INCI list, the two pieces of information will thus have to coexist on the label, whether on the original product label or thanks to an additional label sufficiently resistant so that the information cannot be removed or erased, even partially. Regarding the translation of INCI terms, operators will have to refer to the official Brazilian pharmacopoeia (Denominação Comum Brasileira - DCB). In the absence of a translation available in the DCB, the Agency advises companies to translate the INCI terms in accordance with the method provided in Article 7 of DRC 63/2012, namely: a) the translation must respect the usual spelling and phonetics of the Portuguese language of Brazil;
(b) the translation must be distinct phonetically and by its spelling from other existing translations and be spelled as simply as possible;
(c) the use of a trade name, trademark or other fanciful name in the translation is prohibited; and
d) translations which, due to their spelling or phonetics, would induce a reference to anatomical, physiological, pathological or therapeutic effects or which could lead to confusion with other names, should be avoided. The technical note also details the rules to be followed so that the information be clear for consumers: a) the translation of the ingredients into Portuguese must appear in parentheses or after a bar, next to the corresponding terms in the INCI list, which must be introduced by the terms Composição or Ingredientes; or in a separate list preceded by the terms Composição (português) or Ingredientes (português);
b) ingredients in Portuguese will be in the same order as in the INCI list of ingredients;
c) the terms “e o corante”, “e os corantes” or “Pode conter os corantes”: must precede the list of colour additives in Portuguese;
d) knowing that these different terms may or may not be in upper case. The entire Technical Note (NT) 5/2021 is available (in Portuguese) here below or on the Brazilian government website www.gov.br"
Allergenic fragrances found in cosmetics sold as “perfume-free” in Europe,"Conducted by the European Network of Official Cosmetics Control Laboratories (OCCLs) the market surveillance study was part of the Council of Europe’s effort to assess compliance of cosmetic products with European legislation governing their safety, labelling and claims. In total, 932 samples of cosmetics, such as skin, hair and lip care products, as well as deodorants and perfumes, were collected in eight European countries between 2018 and 2020. The sampled products had been manufactured in 34 different countries, with the majority (85%) manufactured in Europe. Of these, 544 samples were marked “perfume-free” (or a similar statement). The overall compliance of products tested in this market surveillance study was 80% but it fell to 59% for perfumes. All samples were tested for the presence of 24 allergenic fragrance compounds [1]. Results showed that 7.7% of samples were non-compliant with legislative requirements due to a missing or false declaration of allergenic fragrance compounds and 2.3% due to claims that the authorities considered misleading. Furthermore, 3.1% [2] of products marketed as “perfume-free” contained allergenic fragrance compounds. Linalool, benzyl alcohol and limonene were the most frequent sources of non-compliance. The study also found 12.7% of non-compliant samples for other reasons than the analysis of allergenic fragrance compounds. Most of the problems were linked to wrong labelling or unauthorised claims. Missing or wrong notifications in the CPNP portal were also identified. Preservatives not in accordance with Annex V of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 (iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, methylisothiazolinone), high content of cadmium or low molecular weight mineral-oil compound in lip-care products accounted for further objections. Two products (0.2%) were assessed as unsafe products, one due to the prohibited use of iodopropynyl butylcarbamate in a body lotion and one because of microbiological contamination. According to the EDQM, there was no significant difference in the non-compliance levels within the different European countries included in the study. “Ensuring compliance of cosmetic products is key to avoiding potential health risks. The problems revealed by this study demonstrate the continuing need for close co-operation between Official Cosmetics Control Laboratories, in the interest of public health in Europe,” commented Susanne Keitel, Director of the EDQM."
Brazil: Anvisa changes cosmetics labeling rules,"From November next year, the labels of cosmetic products sold in Brazil will have to be labeled with a Portuguse translation of their list of ingredients. This translation will be added to the INCI [1] list currently required. According to the article 1 of the resolution RDC No 432, approved by the collegial council of the Agency, the text was adopted because of a court decision in a civil action. According to article 2, “personal hygiene products, cosmetics and perfumes marketed in Brazil must be labeled with the list of their ingredients in Portuguese, without prejudice to other requirements provided for in the regulations in force.” Consequently, the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) remains mandatory and must appear on the products. The Portuguese translation and the INCI list will thus coexist on the label. In fact, the composition in Portuguese may be included either on the product’s original label or in a complementary label, provided that the integrity of the colors and the material with which the label is made is guaranteed, in order to prevent it from being partially or totally removed. The measure was published in the Federal Official Journal on November 5, 2020 and comes into force a year from this date, on November 5, 2021. Products manufactured before November 5, 2021 can be marketed without a list of ingredients in Portuguese until their respective expiration dates (art. 3)."
Cosmetics giants say EU authorities are undermining cosmetic animal testing ban,"The call comes in the wake of two decisions by the Board of Appeal of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) [1] last August, requiring German chemicals manufacturer Symrise to carry out several toxicity tests on animals on two chemical UV filtres (homosalate and 2-ethylhexyl salicylate), used exclusively in sunscreen formulations, to fulfil ‘tick-box’ registration requirements for worker safety under the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation. According to the signatories, the EU’s animal testing ban “success story is now being undermined” by the European Chemicals Agency and its Board of Appeal, continuing “the trend of systematically requesting unnecessary animal data despite a legal obligation to promote non-animal methods.” They say that, far from ensuring occupational safety for workers in chemical manufacturing plants, “these data demands are to ensure ECHA has an administratively complete set of data for hazard classification and labelling, regardless of whether additional data are in fact needed to ensure worker protection.” Actually, Avon, L’Oréal, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Lush and Humane Society International consider that lessons learned in animal-free safety assessment of cosmetics over many years can be “readily applied to occupational safety assessment of ingredients without compromising human safety”. With no reaction yet from the European Commission, the signatories fear the two chemical ingredients currently under ECHA’s scrutiny could be just “the tip of the iceberg”, with the EU Chemicals Agency and some Member States demanding new animal tests for cosmetics at a time when the rest of the world is taking action to eliminate them. “This is a direct threat to the EU’s historic ban on cosmetics animal testing which is widely supported by consumers and cosmetic companies alike because causing animals to suffer and die for beauty products or their ingredients is both ethically and scientifically unjustified. Chemical authorities need to urgently shift their perspective to embrace 21st century science instead of dragging us back to cruel and outdated animal tests,” said Marina Pereira, Humane Society International’s regulatory science advisor. If one refers to the two decisions of the ECHA Board of Appeal (below), the growing contradiction between two regulations pursuing opposing goals reads clearly. According to ECHA, these tests are needed to assess the safety of ingredients. The Board of Appeal says that, if this safety is confirmed, the tests will not have to be included in the cosmetic file and will therefore not lead to a ban on the marketing of the ingredients concerned. At no time is the goal of eliminating animal testing mentioned in the decisions. Obviously, this is not in the Board’s scope of concerns. For the cosmetics industry, the goal now seems to have recognition of the validity of alternative methods under the REACH regulation, even if it means having to adapt them."
Might California’s new regulations help upgrade confidence in beauty products?,"Signed into law on 1 October 2020, the set of legislations originates from two bills: Assembly Bill 2762, dubbed ""California’s ’Toxic-free Cosmetics’ Act"", and Senate Bill No. 312, also known as “Cosmetic Fragrance and Flavor Right to Know Act” (see documents here below). The first text prohibits 12 chemicals in cosmetics sold in California starting in 2025, all of which are already banned by the European Union, under Annex II of Regulation No. 1223/2009. Under the second text, manufacturers of cosmetics sold in California will have to disclose their products’ fragrance ingredient information to the Division of Environmental and Occupational Disease Control within the California State Department of Public Health. The obligation applies in particular to fragrance allergens as listed in Annex III of the EU Cosmetics Regulation No 1223/2009 and subsequent updates, when at or above the following concentrations: 0.01% (100 ppm) in rinse-off cosmetics and 0.001% (10 ppm) in leave-on cosmetics. These new provisions strengthen the legislative framework for cosmetics in California, already the most stringent in the United States. They are the result of concomitant and joint actions from consumer associations, feminist movements and environmental activist groups who have raised public awareness on the discrepancies between the US and EU legislation, thus contributing to sparkle the ‘clean beauty’ movement in the country. The US industry has traditionally denied that the EU legislation would offer a better level of consumer protection than the US one. The main argument was that the general safety requirement was sufficient. This line of reasoning suggested it was useless to explicitly ban specific substances from cosmetic products since cosmetic makers, legally responsible for product safety, would not knowingly use substances that endanger consumers. Indeed, most of the substances prohibited by the European legislation are never used in cosmetics sold in the United States. Most but not all. A laissez-faire logic which has the advantage of not imposing excessive regulatory constraints on new entrants, these start-up companies which contribute so much to the dynamism of the American market. However, it fails to admit that the safety assessment of a substance and a formula is a very complex job that is highly regulated in Europe, but not at all in the United States. While US multinationals, which sell around the world, tend to align their practices with the most stringent rules, this is not always the case with smaller players. Eventually, the growing gap in the level of requirements between European texts, which are regularly updated according to scientific progress, and the American legislation, which remained almost unchanged since the beginning of the 20th century, generated distrust among U.S. consumers. By once again playing a leadership role at the national level, California could push for the adoption of similar rules across the country. Even if this is not the case, the need to market their products in the Union’s most populous state will prompt many American manufacturers to adapt their formulations. In contrast, the impact on consumers is much more uncertain. In Europe, a much more robust legal framework has not prevented mistrust from taking hold. Actually, trust cannot be decreed, it is built. For instance, in 2017, Mintel pointed out that only 24% of Italians, 30% of French and 39% of English trusted the cosmetics industry. “Companies must be ready to provide consumers with quantified and qualified facts,” explained the market research firm. In a post-truth and post-trust world, transparency and trustworthiness become the key tools for building trust. When action groups need to pressure lawmakers to get more transparency from the industry, it is unlikely to reinforce confidence, on the contrary it is likely to reinforce preexisting doubts. Doubts on which young brands have skillfully learned to build their marketing ..."
California officially bans a series of toxic chemicals in cosmetics,"Introduced by Assembly member Al Muratsuchi, the Assembly Bill 2762, dubbed ""California’s ’Toxic-free Cosmetics’ Act"", prohibits 12 toxic chemicals in cosmetics in California starting in 2025, all of which are already banned by the European Union, under Annex II of Regulation No. 1223/2009. “The science is clear on the harmful nature of these chemicals and AB 2762 will provide Californians with the same consumer protections already provided in the European Union. I thank Governor Newsom for his support and the bill cosponsors for their leadership and hard work to get this bill signed into law,” said Assembly member Al Muratsuchi. The new law bans 12 substances: 1. Dibutyl phthalate (CAS no. 84-74-2)
2. Diethylhexyl phthalate (CAS no. 117-81-7)
3. Formaldehyde (CAS no. 50-00-0)
4. Paraformaldehyde (CAS no. 30525-89-4)
5. Methylene glycol (CAS no. 463-57-0)
6. Quaternium-15 (CAS no. 51229-78-8)
7. Mercury (CAS no. 7439-97-6)
8. Isobutylparaben (CAS no. 4247-02-3)
9. Isopropylparaben (CAS no. 4191-73-5)
10. m-Phenylenediamine and its salts (CAS no. 108-45-2)
11. o-Phenylenediamine and its salts (CAS no. 95-54-5)
12. per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and their salts:
– Perfluor­ooctane sulfonate (PFOS); heptadec­afluorooctane-1-sulfonic acid (CAS no. 1763-23-1)
– Potassium perfluor­ooctanesulfonate; potassium heptadec­afluorooctane-1-sulfonate (CAS no. 2795-39-3)
– Diethano­lamine perfluor­ooctane sulfonate (CAS 70225-14-8)
– Ammonium perfluor­ooctane sulfonate; ammonium heptadec­afluorooctanesulfonate (CAS 29081-56-9)
– Lithium perfluor­ooctane sulfonate; lithium heptadec­afluorooctanesulfonate (CAS 29457-72-5)
– Perfluor­ooctanoic acid (PFOA)(CAS no. 335-67-1)
– Ammonium pentadec­afluorooctanoate (CAS no. 3825-26-1)
– Nonadeca­fluorodecanoic acid (CAS no. 355-76-2)
– Ammonium nonadeca­fluorodecanoate (CAS no. 3108-42-7)
– Sodium nonadeca­fluorodecanoate (CAS no. 3830-45-3)
– Perfluor­ononanoic acid (PFNA)(CAS no. 375-95-1)
– Sodium heptadec­afluorononanoate (CAS no. 21049-39-8)
– Ammonium perfluor­ononanoate (CAS no. 4149-60-4) Both the Environmental Working Group (EWG) and the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC) applauded Governor Newsom for signing the Bill into law. Indeed, this very symbolic text was supported by both the NGO and representatives of the cosmetics industry. “Californians now have greater assurance of the safety of the consumer products they use every day, like lotion and body wash, toothpaste, shampoo and conditioner, and makeup,” said EWG President Ken Cook. “This marks a momentous milestone in the history of cosmetics and personal care products regulation. And for the first time, groups like EWG along with a diverse group of stakeholders and the industry’s trade association, the Personal Care Products Council, support legislation to modernize the rules governing these products.” In practice, this law should not disrupt fundamentally the habits of cosmetics makers, since most of the substances concerned are hardly found in personal care products sold in the United States. “We all agree that this bill helps protect public health in California while safeguarding the jobs of the more than the 415,000 Californians who work for the overall personal care industry and the more than $28 billion contributed to the state’s economy,” said PCPC President & CEO Lezlee Westine. The law only addresses substances added “intentionally” and does provide for unavoidable trace contaminants that occur during manufacturing. Read the full text here below:"
Cruelty Free International extends support to brands selling in China,"Cruelty Free International and Australian aromatherapy, natural skincare and wellness brand, Subtle Energies have announced the successful shift of the animal welfare organization’s Shanghai-based Leaping Bunny pilot project to an all-China route to market for cruelty free certified international brands. As a matter of fact, Subtle Energies will now supply Peninsula Spa, based in the Chinese capital. Back in 2018, Cruelty-Free International launched its Leaping Bunny China Pilot Program, which helps leaping bunny approved brands to enter the Chinese market without having to test perform animal tests. Before entering this new phase in their Chinese journey Cruelty Free International worked closely with Shanghai-based regulatory advisors Knudsen&CRC to carefully review the recent regulatory changes announced by Chinese authorities, in particular the possible end of compulsory animal testing for imported “ordinary” cosmetics (also named “general cosmetics”). [1] “Our pilot allowed us to ensure that expertise was on hand to allow companies to remain free from pre-market animal testing and expertly find a way through all the other requirements. To manage the complex issue of post-market testing - testing that could take place on a product after it has hit the shelves - we worked closely with Oriental Beauty Valley and Fengxian district, Shanghai to be sure this would not happen,” explained the organization. All international Leaping Bunny brands wanting to sell in China using this all-China route must: – Agree plans with Cruelty Free International;
– Manufacture the products at approved facilities within China;
– Maintain ongoing contact with their distributors and retailers to monitor any risks of animal testing;
– Only use ingredients that already feature on the list of approved cosmetics and personal care ingredients in China (in other cases, animal tests will be required by Chinese authorities);
– Not include special use cosmetics in their sales offer (as animal tests are required for these products). As an increasing number of countries globally, and lately Colombia, are prohibiting animal testing for cosmetic purposes, in the wake of the EU initiative in 2013, China’s rules requiring that all “special cosmetics” and imported “general cosmetics” (locally made “general cosmetics” are exempted under certain conditions) has long been see as a major impediment to trade. Indeed, some brands have given up their prospects regarding the Chinese market so as not to be forced to test their products on animals. However, the situation could change. Following the publication on 29 June 2020 of the long-awaited Cosmetics Supervision and Administration Regulation (CSAR), which will replace the existing Cosmetics Hygiene Supervision Regulations, which was first released in 1989, it is expected imported ""ordinary cosmetics"" will no longer have to be tested on animals. While the CSAR is note clear on this issue, a formal and official clarification should come in the next few months. “Although it is anticipated that regulations will follow to spell out that non-special use imported cosmetics would no longer require animal tests as part of their safety assessment if other specified requirements are fulfilled, until these are published and details become clear, Leaping Bunny brands remain unable to export into mainland China,” highlights Cruelty Free International. For so-called “special cosmetics”, the legal situation is even worse, since hardly any exemption from animal testing is expected yet."
Colombia to ban use of animals in cosmetics testing by 2024,"The bill has been in the works since 2018, initially introduced by vegan House Representative Juan Carlos Losada. A recognized environmental and animal advocate, Mr. Losada welcomed the news on Twitter: ¡TENEMOS LEY! Colombia el primer país suramericano que prohíbe las pruebas cosméticas con animales! Aquí puedes consultar la Ley 2047 de 2020 https://t.co/DDz5hM4NWY pic.twitter.com/STdqnrEiiV — Juan Carlos Losada ॐ (@JuanKarloslos) August 12, 2020 The Law 2047 of August 10, 2020 (available here, in Spanish) prohibits the import, manufacture and marketing in Colombia of cosmetic products and their ingredients when they have been tested on animals. These provisions will come into force 4 years after the promulgation of the law. 
 However, the law provides for two exceptions. The first, when an ingredient requires safety tests, in the interest of human health or to assess its safety to the environment and there are no alternative tests validated by the international scientific community. The second: when safety data generated through animal testing for an ingredient has been performed for a purpose other than cosmetic. Actually, these provisions are quite similar to those already in force within the European Union."
California’s Toxic-Free Cosmetics Act moves forward after Committee vote,"On Thursday May 14th, the Assembly Bill 2762 passed out of the State Assembly Committee on Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials.  Authored by Assembly man Al Muratsuchi (D-Torrance) a co-sponsored by Assembly Members Bill Quirk (D-Hayward) and Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland), the bill would ban 12 chemicals from being used in cosmetics in California. 
“This bill, which passed in a bipartisan vote 7-0, will now go to the Appropriations Committee,” announced Assemblyman Muratsuchi on Twitter. Today I presented my AB 2762 - the Toxic- Free Cosmetics Act - to the ESTM Committee. This bill, which passed in a bipartisan vote 7-0, will now go to the Appropriations Committee. Women deserve to know that their personal care products and cosmetics are toxic-free. — Asm. Al Muratsuchi (@AsmMuratsuchi) May 14, 2020 If adopted, the Act would ban 12 chemicals from cosmetics, including Dibutyl phthalate, diethylhexyl phthalate, formaldehyde, isobutylparaben, isopropylparaben, long chain PFAS chemicals, methylene glycol, mercury, paraformaldehyde, phenylenediamine, and quaternium-15. All these ingredients are already banned in the European Union and other regions. It will be possible to add new ingredients to this list when they have been identified after a stakeholder process and provided that they listed as a banned substance in Annex II of Regulation No. 1223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council or in any updates to that Annex. The Personal Care Products Council (PCPC), the most important national trade association representing the cosmetic and personal care products industry in the US, praised the move. “We are proud to have joined a broad coalition, including the Black Women for Wellness, Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, CalPIRG and the Environmental Working Group, in supporting well-crafted, science-based reforms like AB 2762. Such legislation modernizes California’s cosmetics regulation and also strengthens consumer confidence in the products they trust and enjoy every day,"" said the organization in a statement. A better alignment of cosmetics laws in the U.S. with the E.U. regulations has long been a key demand of consumer advocacy groups such as Environmental Working Group (EWG), Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, or Black Women for Wellness. Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, Black Women for Wellness “Today’s vote to ban 12 ingredients from cosmetics is just the first step in the legislative process. But this vote is an important milestone in the history of cosmetics regulation. For the first time, groups like EWG and the industry’s trade association, the Personal Care Products Council, support legislation to modernize the rules governing these everyday products. Industry and consumer advocates agree that ingredients like formaldehyde and mercury have no place in cosmetics and other personal care products. This is good news for consumers, who should not have to worry about the presence of these chemicals, and good news for cosmetics companies, which benefit from greater harmony among global rules,” said EWG President Ken Cook."
EU Commission’s scientific body says aluminium is safe in cosmetics,"The CSSC’s final opinion reiterates the terms of its preliminary opinion submitted for comments at the end of last year. The Committee - which gathers seventeen independent experts in chemistry and toxicology - considers that the use of aluminium compounds is safe at the following equivalent aluminium concentrations up to:
– 6.25% in non-spray deodorants or non-spray antiperspirants,
– 10.60% in spray deodorants or spray antiperspirants,
– 2.65% in toothpaste and,
– 0.77% in lipstick. Aluminium is a known systemic toxicant at high doses. Therefore, the safety of its use in cosmetics, especially in antiperspirants, has been the subject of numerous controversies and alarming media reports. Indeed, some studies have suggested that cosmetics may be a more important source of exposure than food. In 2011, based on an in vitro study evaluating the cutaneous absorption of aluminium, the French Health Products Safety Agency (Afssaps) recommended a re-evaluation of the risks linked to the use of this substance in cosmetics. In 2013, the risk assessment issued by the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety concluded that the contribution of cosmetic products to the total systemic aluminium exposure was significantly larger than the contribution of diet. Those questions led to a previous SCCS opinion on aluminium in 2014. At that date, the Scientific Committee considered that there was a lack of adequate data, in particular regarding the dermal penetration of aluminium. The new opinion supplements and updates the previous opinion of 2014 taking into account the latest scientific data, in particular those obtained from three studies, two of them dating from 2020. According to the committee, recent studies show that aluminium is hardly absorbed by the skin, including freshly shaved skin, and is not stored in the skin. Therefore, the systemic exposure to aluminium via daily applications of cosmetic products “does not add significantly” to the systemic body burden of aluminium from other sources. According to the SCCS, exposure to aluminium may also occur from sources other than cosmetic products, in particular from the diet. ""The latest results show, among other things, that aluminium contained in antiperspirant products is neither absorbed nor stored by the skin. In addition, all the latest assessments and bibliographies carried out up to 2017 by other scientific committees have been reviewed and confirm that aluminium contained in cosmetic products does not has any role in breast cancer,” comments FEBEA, the French Federation of Beauty Businesses, in a statement. The safety margin calculated by the SCCS - taking into account the different routes of exposure (oral, dermal, respiratory) linked to cosmetic products, is always greater than 2,000. This means that the amount of aluminium consumers are exposed to is, at least, 2,000 times lower than the dose identified as having no toxicological effects. This assessment has not taken into account the daily dietary intake of aluminium. According to Anne Dux, FEBEA’s Scientific and Regulatory Affairs Director: “This report puts an end to more than ten years of controversies that have generated anxiety among consumers using antiperspirant products. The European opinion, which has just been issued after an extremely rigorous procedure, gives users of such products the full assurance they are both safe and effective.”"
Cruelty Free International helps Aussie beauty brands access China,"Highlights include seeing entire nations beyond the EU to ban the sale of newly animal-tested products including New Zealand, Switzerland and Turkey. The organization has also witnessed success with individual brands including Covergirl, which announced back in November that it is entirely cruelty-free, meaning none of its products or ingredients are tested on animals, nor are those of the brand’s suppliers. Last week Cruelty-Free International CEO, Michelle Thew, hosted a presentation in Sydney, Australia - in collaboration with Covergirl - to show how the organization provides pioneering scientific and legal expertise to brands and governments. One current area of interest for the NGO is China, a country that has proven near-impossible for cruelty-free brands to access given its law that requires cosmetics to be tested on animals. In the past, beauty brands have used workarounds such as cross-border e-commerce (the Chinese law is only for brands that physically retail in the country), however, this option is handicapped by restricted cross-border spending limits. Back in 2018, Cruelty-Free International launched its Leaping Bunny China Pilot Program, which enables leaping bunny approved brands to enter the Chinese market without animal testing, for the first time. ""Historically it’s not been possible for brands and it is still not possible to import directly to China. But our program makes use of the unique agreement we’ve struck with Shanghai Gengpu Industrial Park, Oriental Beauty Valley and Knudsen&CRC,"" Thew explained. ""This enables brands to make use of domestic manufacturing and then, supervised by us, launch onto the market."" Last month, UK men’s skincare brand Bulldog was the first Leaping Bunny certified brand to reach the Mainland Chinese market. ""We want Australian brands to know this market is actually open to leaping bunny brands,"" she continued. ""If there are brands not currently selling in China who are interested in that market, they can talk to us about getting leaping bunny approval and joining the pilot program."" Michelle Thew hopes that the pilot program will significantly speed up overall regulatory changes in China. When it comes to the cruelty-free state of play in Australia, Thew believes there is still work to do. Earlier this year, however, the Australian Government committed to prohibiting reliance on animal test data for ingredients in cosmetics with introduction of the Industrial Chemicals Act 2019. From July 1 2020, the IC Act 2019 will give effect to the ban for ingredients used solely in cosmetics. ""This is an important signal from the Government,"" said Thew, ""it’s very future-looking and it’s very specific to cosmetics ingredients. We know that here in Australia there are a huge number of brands that have an organic, ethical feel so we know animal testing is also an interest of concern with Australian consumers."" Should any Australian beauty brand wish to know more about how the IC Act will impact them, Thew recommends getting in touch with Cruelty-Free International for advice on how to prepare."
Proposed Natural Cosmetics Act aims to define “natural cosmetics” in the US,"Introduced by Representative Sean Patrick Maloney from New York state and co-sponsored by Representative Grace Meng, also from New York, and Rep. Janice Schakowsky from Illinois, the Natural Cosmetics Act (H.R.5017) aims to define the terms “natural” and “naturally-derived ingredient” as they relate to personal care products. According to Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, falsely labeling products as “natural” does not qualify as misbranding and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently has almost no authority to take these products off the shelves. To date, no details are available regarding the exact content of the bill. However, according to Rep. Maloney, the bill requires cosmetic products sold, labeled, or represented as “natural” to contain at least 70 percent natural substances, excluding water.  The bill would also require suppliers to conduct Carbon-14 testing which they must submit to manufacturers and would give the FDA authority to issue a cease distribution order, public notice on the FDA website, and voluntary recall authority of any product deemed misbranded under this act. “Right now, the FDA doesn’t consider it misbranding for companies to label products as ‘natural,’ even if they contain toxins like coal tar, asbestos, and other harmful chemicals. That’s just not right,” said Rep. Maloney. “Increasing protections, transparency and oversight of personal care products is desperately needed. (…) All Americans deserve nothing less than full transparency and accountability from companies that market their products as ‘natural.’ I look forward to this important bill moving through the House, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.” The bill is endorsed by clean beauty brand Beautycounter and its founder and CEO Gregg Renfrew. “While words like ‘natural’ can signal a safer product, there are currently no industry standards. For years, Beautycounter has been asking Congress to create clear standards for marketing terms and so we are thrilled to support the Natural Cosmetics Act. This landmark bill sets clear and reasonable standards for companies who want to claim an ingredient or product is natural, while instilling confidence in today’s savvy consumer.” Beyond the endorsement, Beautycounter is also mobilizing its base in support of the bill, including its clients and network of more than 45,000 Independent Consultants across all 50 states. Other brands such as BaboBotanicals and NakedPoppy also endorsed the bill, as well as biotech beauty ingredient maker Aprinnova and retailers Credo, Follain and Ivy Wild. According to Beautycounter, the natural beauty market accounts for $70 billion in the USA."
"Natural and organic cosmetics: A booming market and a legal fight about ""free from claims""","With a double-digit growth in 2018, sales of natural and organic cosmetics are the driving force behind the French market. With sales reaching a record 757 million euros in 2018, a leap of +18.7% compared to 2017, France is ranks second in Europe and third in the world, behind the United States, the world’s largest market with a turnover of 4.32 billion euros, and Germany, the world’s second market and the first European one, with 1.34 billion euros in 2018, according to figures published by Ecovia Intelligence. In France, natural and organic cosmetic products represent 6.4% of the total cosmetics market value. At the European level, sales of natural and organic cosmetics grew by +7.2% in 2018 compared to the previous year, and recorded an annual growth of +7% over the last five years, much more than the overall market. Sales of natural and organic cosmetics in Europe reached 3.82 billion euros in 2018 and are expected to reach 5 billion euros by 2023, an annual rate of about 6.3% per year, according to Ecovia Intelligence. In Europe, specialty stores dominate the natural and organic cosmetics market. Although their importance is decreasing, they still account for 38% of sales, ahead of pharmacies, parapharmacies and drugstores (33%). Mass general retailers account for 7% of sales of natural and organic cosmetic products, while other retail channels (perfumery shops, hairdressing salons, beauty salons, online sales, etc.) account for 23% of sales. In this context, Cosmébio, a trade association created in 2002 to speak on behalf the organic and natural cosmetics industry in France, demand that so-called “free from claims” be maintained to better inform consumers.  Such claims have been prohibited by France’s Autorité de Régulation Professionnelle de la Publicité (ARPP), the French advertising self-regulatory organization. ""Today, consumers no longer want certain ingredients to be in their daily beauty routines and the ‘free from claims’ help them to immediately spot the products that meet their expectations,"" the association said in a statement. Cosmébio criticizes ARPP, for having over-interpreted European law in a sense considered much too narrow. Indeed, according to the ARPP, claiming that a product is “free from” an ingredient that is authorised by the cosmetic regulation implies a denigrating message and such claims should therefore be prohibited. In particular, claims such as ""free from parabens"" or ""free from phenoxyethanol"" are under fire. According to Cosmébio, the ARPP’s guidelines [1] do not have any binding value and rely on a technical document that is just an interpretation of the European law [2]. ""We cannot accept the way we promote our products to be imposed by a text that is not legally binding. Within Cosmebio, we remain convinced that ‘free from claims’ are a useful information for consumers. Consumers have the right to be able to quickly spot the products that do not contain unwanted ingredients, even when such ingredients are allowed by the regulations,"" said Romain Ruth, President of Cosmébio. On the other hand, those defending the prohibition of “free from claims” say that cosmetic products need a more ""positive communication"" that would ""contribute to a promote the image of the cosmetic products"". In practice, the market context could eventually work in favour of Cosmébio and of the other labels whose specifications prohibit controversial substances. Boosted by the consumer demand, the rise of the so-called clean cosmetics and the success of cosmetics apps are based on the implementation of black lists intended to reassure consumers. That is to say: “Free from claims"" without explicitly writing them."
French and European authorities in disagreement about the safe use of phenoxyethanol on babies,"ANSM has requested for all non-rinsed cosmetic products containing phenoxyethanol to be labelled with the words ""do not use on the buttocks of infants less than three years."" [1]. Companies marketing these products will have a period of nine months (until December 20, 2019) to comply to this measure, which concerns all non-rinsed cosmetics containing phenoxyethanol, with the exception of deodorants, hair styling and make-up products. In practice, the text targets more particularly the wipes used to clean the nappy area of babies. Phenoxyethanol (or phenoxy-2-ethanol) is a germicidal and germistatic glycol ether commonly used as a preservative by the cosmetics industry. European regulations [2] require its concentration in cosmetics to be limited to 1% in the formulas of finished products. Suspected of reproductive toxicity, phenoxyethanol has been in the crosshairs of the French agency for several years now. In 2012, as a precautionary measure, the ANSM recommended not using this preservative in cosmetic products intended for the nappy area of babies and that its maximum authorised concentration threshold for use as a preservative should be lowered to 0.4% in cosmetic products for infants less than three years. Subsequently, in its opinion of October 2016 [3], the European Scientific Committee for Consumer Safety (SCCS) considered that phenoxyethanol used at 1% in cosmetic products was safe for use whatever the age group. In its decision taken ""as a precautionary measure, in order to guarantee the safe use of cosmetic products intended for infants"", the ANSM explains that it relied on ""new scientific data concerning exposure to phenoxyethanol"". After the publication of the opinion of the European scientific committee, the ANSM has indeed wished to continue its investigations and in 2017 formed a temporary specialized scientific committee (CSST) consisting of experts in toxicology, epidemiology, expology, dermatology and allergology with the aim of evaluating the advisability of maintaining its 2012 recommendations. These experts came to the conclusion that ""the 2012 recommendation for the non-use of phenoxyethanol in cosmetic products intended for the nappy area of babies should be maintained."" These experts also expressed the wish to extend this recommendation to all cleansing wipes, even those intended for adults, as they are frequently used to clean the buttocks young children. ""In all other cosmetic products intended for children less than three years, the maximum concentration of phenoxyethanol could remain at 1%."" The opinion of ANSM is therefore directly opposed to the EU’s. In such a situation, Article 27 of the European Cosmetics Regulation [4] provides that the Agency will have to communicate to the Commission and the competent authorities of the other Member States any supporting data on which it bases its decision so as to determine, as soon as possible, whether the provisional measures are justified or not. COSMED and FEBEA, the professional trade associations defending the interests of French cosmetics manufacturers, have already indicated that they would use the various means of redress available to have the validity of the ANSM decision re-examined. The FEBEA has announced in particular its intention to refer this decision to the Conseil d’État (French highest administrative jurisdiction) for suspension and then cancellation. The FEBEA also asked Cosmetics Europe, the Brussels cosmetics industry lobby, to immediately refer the matter to the European Commission. On the eve of this legal battle, two scenarios are therefore to be considered: – Either the provisional measure decided by the French health authorities is considered groundless by the European authorities, in which case the Commission will inform the Member States and the ANSM will have to repeal its text without delay;
– Either the French provisional measure is considered justified (probably after a new SCCS opinion is issued) in which case the European regulation will have to be modified. Whatever the outcome of the procedure, phenoxyethanol appears to be again in the hot seat. At a time when apps assessing the safety of cosmetic products are mushrooming, and ‘clean beauty’ being a buzzword in the cosmetics industry for some times, there is a fair chance that the days of this substance are already numbered, even though it is of interest to formulators."
No-deal Brexit: What should the cosmetics industry be preparing for?,"After the UK parliament’s overwhelming rejection of Theresa May’s Brexit deal, the French government considers a no-deal scenario as the most likely now. Therefore, French authorities have triggered a EUR 50 million (GBP 44 million) contingency plan to prepare the country’s customs as well as the port and airport infrastructures. A no deal Brexit would see Britain leave the European Union without a formal agreement on the future trade relationship with member countries of the bloc. ""From one day to the next, without any transitional period, the United Kingdom will shift from EU Member State status to third country status. As far as trade is concerned, this will mean a shift to EU rules to WTO rules,"" warned Pierre Chabrol, Head of the Trade Policy, Strategy and Coordination Office at the French Ministry for the Economy and Finance. New rules will therefore apply to exports and imports to and from the United Kingdom. ""In such a situation, the measures taken by the administration cannot replace the necessary preparation of private businesses that are trading with the United Kingdom,"" he added before members of the cosmetics industry convened by the FEBEA on January 24 in Paris. From a general point of view, companies must quickly: – carry out a self-assessment of the impact of Brexit on their activity,
– identify the measures to be taken,
– check their supply chain and alert their subcontractors,
– implement the measures identified. As far as the cosmetics industry is concerned, beyond additional customs procedures - for both imports and exports - which can seriously disrupt logistics flows, other issues need to be anticipated. Cosmetics companies must prepare to: – Appoint a Responsible Person in both the EU and the UK. “As soon as the Brexit is effective, marketers of cosmetic products will need a Responsible Person in the UK for the products placed on this market,” explains Olivia Santoni, Director, Regulatory and International Services de la Cosmetic, Toiletry & Perfumery Association (CTPA).
– Update labels to feature an address in the UK for products from the EU and an address in the EU for UK products. However, for products placed on the British market, a transition period of 24 months is foreseen.
– Re-make notifications to the CPNP (Cosmetic Product Notification Portal), since those made via the UK will no longer be valid after Brexit, and for EU companies notify the products to the new Bristish Portal. ""As far as cosmetics are concerned, we are fortunate to have a draft of the future regulation of the United Kingdom, [1]"" said Olivia Santoni. In particular, the new text no longer refers to the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS). In the future, the status of ingredients will be decided at UK level. If it is not yet certain, the no-deal scenario must be seriously considered and companies cannot wait to prepare."
Brexit: “We need to get ready for a no-deal exit”,"“The UK’s exit is enacted. The question is, will there be an agreement with a transitional period or a brutal separation? The first solution would give everyone more time,” explains Virginie D’Enfert, FEBEA’s VP of Economic, International, and Environmental Affairs. Since Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union was implemented, on March 29, 2017, the UK and the EU have been trying to agree on the terms of their separation scheduled for March 29, 2019. In the event of a deal, an 18-month transitional period will allow for a “soft” exit, since the EU law will apply in the UK until December 31, 2020. Unfortunately, if many points are resolved, a number of issues are still preventing a final compromise, in particular the Irish border. If these difficulties are not overcome, there will be no deal (“Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed""), and there will be no transitional period. And as D-Day is approaching, this hypothesis is getting more and more plausible. “Companies should get ready for a possible hard Brexit, which would definitely not offer any period of adaptation,” warns Olivia Santoni, Director of Regulatory and International Services of the CTPA. Of course, an extension of negotiations can be considered, but this additional period of time would be short: it would not go beyond the May 2019 European elections. As soon as the divorce is pronounced, the UK will become a “third country”. Starting from March 29, 2019, in the event of a hard Brexit or at the end of the transitional period, if there is a deal, the European regulations will no longer apply in the UK, which will also be out of the Customs Union. As a result, for cosmetics companies [1], there is an urgent need to prepare for the worst-case scenario, i.e. for: – The obligation to appoint a Responsible Person in both the EU and the UK.
– Updating labels to feature the two Responsible Persons’ addresses and the exact product origin since the UK will be a third country.  Let’s remind that “made in EU” is not accepted by customs authorities outside the Union.
– Re-making notifications on the CPNP (Cosmetic Product Notification Portal), since those made via the UK will no longer be valid (it should be possible to create drafts).
– Making notifications on the future British portal.
– Having to pay customs duties on materials and goods crossing the Channel one way or the other.
– Increased transit costs and complexity, and delays due to customs procedures all along the supply chain. Beyond the European Cosmetics Regulation, other regulations will have to be translated into English law, including REACH and CLP. However, Brexit will create no legal vacuum. At first, the British will use the original European legislation by replacing the words “European Union” by “United Kingdom”, where needed, as soon as 2019, in case of a no-deal Brexit, and at the end of the transitional period, if there is a deal. But once this phase is over, the UK will regain control of its legislation – which is what Brexit supporters want. No doubt they will copy the better part of the European legislation, but in the long run, there will be inevitable divergences. Ideally, cosmetics manufacturers on both sides of the Channel would have preferred deals specific to their own sector to maintain British participation in a few European agencies, like ECHA, the European Chemicals Agency, and avoid any duplications. But the details of the future relationship between the UK and the EU will only be discussed after a deal on the exit – which just cannot be found yet. Right now, the negotiation process is horizontal, not sector-based, and unsurprisingly, both parties have opposed ambitions and interests. When the British seek a tailor-made status that best meet their interests, the Europeans try to avoid cherry-picking, which would lead to the UK only taking part in – and financing – the agencies and policies they are interested in. As the third cosmetics market in the EU, behind Germany and France, and ahead of Italy, the UK is also one of France’s major trading partners: in 2017, France exported 996 million cosmetics across the Channel (the UK is the French industry’s third client, after the US and Germany). This issue is obviously not trivial."
Brazil: ANVISA agrees to simplify the regulations of cosmetics for children,"The regulatory move is a consequence of the public consultation on the technical and administrative requirements applicable toiletries, cosmetics and perfumes placed on the Brazilian market. ""The main change resulting from the public consultation is the migration of children’s products from compulsory registration to registration exemption. The only products remaining subject to registration are: sunscreens, insect repellents, hair straighteners and antiseptic gels for the hands. The move will not put children at risk. These products are considered as low risk and, in most parts of the world, registration is not required,"" said João Tavares Neto, Manager of the Hygiene, Perfume, Cosmetic and Sanitation Products Directorate (GHCOS) at ANVISA. According to ABIHPEC, the regulatory change does not alter efficacy and safety requirements but reduces bureaucracy thus enhancing innovation. ""This breakthrough is very important for providing consumers with an increased access to key health products; and for the Brazilian personal care industry, which will enjoy a greater predictability for the launch of new products. We are making progress in simplifying administrative processes and gradually putting the sector in line with the more advanced countries in relation to low risk products,"" said Renata Amaral, manager of Technical and Regulatory Affairs at ABIHPEC. According to ANVISA’s Board of Directors, the change in the RDC 07/2015 reinforces the need to increase in-market control. As required by Brazilian law since 1976, it is the responsibility of the manufacturer to comply with all the rules and regulations and to carry out all the tests to place safe products on the market. The improvement of the procedure for regulating Children’s Products only refers to an administrative change, this means that all the technical requirements provided by RDC 15/15 will not be modified."
Nanoparticles: What is the meaning of the complaint of the French consumer watchdog?,"UFC-Que Choisir has analysed 16 consumer food and cosmetics products for nanoparticles of titanium dioxide, but also silicon dioxide, iron and zinc oxides (dyes). As a result, according to the consumer association, “100% of products analysed contain nanoparticles.” While, only three products mentioned them on their label. Applying the name and shame method, the Association unveiled the names of the products concerned, among which, M&M’s Peanuts (Mars), the toothpaste Aquafresh triple protection+blancheur ( GlaxoSmithKline), the deodorant Sanex Natur protect 48h (Colgate-Palmolive), or Avène’s Cold Cream nourishing lip balm (Pierre Fabre Group). UFC-Que Choisir has also lodged a complaint in Paris against nine manufacturers [1], which it accuses of knowingly concealing the presence of these substances. Consumer associations have long been concerned about the presence of these nanoparticles in consumer products. The publication in January 2017 of a study confirming that chronic (oral) ingestion of titanium dioxide (TiO2) could contribute to the growth of precancerous lesions in rats has reinforced these fears. [2] Identified by the food industry under the code E171, Titanium Dioxide is an additive used to whiten and intensify the shine of sweets or of some pastries. It is also used by the pharmaceutical industry and in cosmetics, more particularly in toothpastes and sunscreens. To respond to the concerns of NGOs, the government had announced at the end of August the reinforcement of controls by the DGCCRF (fraud control). The results of these tests showed that 87% of the 40 cosmetics and 39% of the 74 food products analysed contained nanoparticles. But “only one product mentioned, on its labelling, the presence of all identified nanomaterials”, according to the Ministry of Economy. “The procedure asking manufacturers of these products to comply, is pending,” indicated to the AFP Alexandre Chevallier, Deputy Head of Office at the DGCCRF, also ensuring that investigations would continue in 2018. At this stage, however, the supervisory Bodies shall refrain from any legal proceedings. Indeed, just because nanoparticles are found in a product does not mean they were voluntarily introduced by manufacturers. Many substances naturally contain nanoparticles. “This is why the European Regulation only requires their labelling under two conditions: It has to be manufactured intentionally, i.e., when more than 50% of it is present in an ingredient, and it must be insoluble or bio-persistent,” Anne Dux told the AFP. While the DGCCRF prides itself on having ""developed innovative methods of analysis"", the issue at hand concerning the detection of nanoparticles is very complex. Certain techniques, such as electron microscopic analysis, can break apart molecular aggregates and reveal nanoparticles where there were none before. Others techniques can have the opposite effect. Some analyses conducted by the DGCCRF were for example unable to detect the presence of carbon black in a nano form in a product that mentioned it on its labelling! The reactions of companies concerned are mixed. Indeed, it is a thorny issue to address. To avoid problems some of them have already decided to give up the use of TiO2. ""We are well aware of the issue raised by UFC-Que Choisir,"" responded the Casino Group, ensuring that it had engaged in steps with the supplier of an additive present in a soup, towards its removal. “This will be effective in the coming weeks,” emphasised the Group. Mars Chocolat France officials assured that their products complied with ""all regulations in force"", while underlining that the phase-out plan for TiO2, which was decided to meet consumers’ preferences for more natural ingredients, was a “priority”. For its part, the Avène brand (Pierre Fabre Group) asked the UFC-Que Choisir Association to have some details on the methodology used in tests. “Our Cold Cream lip balm does not contain nanomaterials as defined by European cosmetic Regulations, as shown by the certificates given to us by our raw material suppliers,” underlined Avène officials. In summary, complaints from UFC-Que Choisir are probably more indicative of the flaws in the methods of analysis than of a supposed lack of transparency from the industry. This probably explains why, for its part, the DGCCRF did not find it appropriate to prosecute. Supervisory Bodies have access to the technical files of products that must contain all the data on the ingredients used and their suppliers. To date, it seems that controlling this file remains the best way to detect a possible fraud."
Natural and organic cosmetics: The new ISO standard continues to be debated,"Like all ISO standards, the aim was to reach consensus among the various stakeholders to best meet expectations of brands and consumers. The standard attempts to establish common definitions and calculation bases, internationally recognized, to determine the minimum level of organic and natural ingredients required in the composition of cosmetics with such claims. The result of a compromise, the standard was criticized by historic labels who disagreed on several points. Through the voice of its Director Valérie Lemaire, the Ecocert Greenlife Group - the world’s leading certifying body of natural and organic cosmetics, based chiefly on the specifications of the European label COSMOS - disagrees on three points: the definition of natural ingredients, and the minimum percentage calculation required for organic ingredients and natural ingredients. ""It’s a standard of calculation and to make these calculations, definitions were necessary, but we don’t agree on these definitions,"" explains firstly Valérie Lemaire. For Anne Dux, Director of Scientific and Regulatory Affairs at FEBEA, the French trade association representing the cosmetics industry, ""the ISO 16128 standard represents an international consensus, which cannot limit itself to the position of various European private labels"". For the industry, the standard has the advantage of offering an international standard serving as a global reference without however replacing national or regional specifications of various labels. The first point of disagreement concerns the definition of natural ingredients, which specifies that according to the specifications of the COSMOS label, a natural ingredient cannot be qualified as such from the moment it originates from a plant that has undergone genetic transformation. On this point, the ISO 16128 standard specifies that ""GMOs are only allowed in the regions of the world that authorize them"". In theory, they should not be allowed in the European Union. However, according to Valérie Lemaire, it is commonplace that ingredient manufacturers in France or Europe supply themselves with plants originating from areas of the world where GMOs are allowed. ""Today, corn and soy are almost systematically sourced from the United States, and therefore are 100% GM, however ingredients originating from them will be described as natural,"" she adds. On the other hand, organic ingredients should not be concerned, since they cannot be certified organic in Europe if they come from a GM plant. The second sticking point concerns the percentage calculation of ingredients of biological origin. Anne Dux stresses on the fact that ""the standard does not enable an industrialist to claim that his product is organic, but more to guarantee that it incorporates a certain percentage of organic ingredients."" To this end, the standard provides for the calculation of the ratio of organic ingredients introduced at the beginning of the product’s manufacturing process. This calculation at the beginning of the manufacturing process puzzles Valérie Lemaire. She considers that the mode of transformation of the product is not taken into account to validate the biological index. ""A manufacturer can very well start with a certified organic ingredient and then add a solvent or petrochemical molecules. Once the formula is transformed, the biological molecule is completely modified and will be mixed. This ingredient, which however no longer respects the principles of organic farming, will be valued in a percentage of ingredients of biological origin,"" she says. An issue that she also raises for the calculation of the natural origin as well as for the resulting claims. This is the third point of concern. ""Today any product on the market may claim having a percentage of natural origin, for example surfactants are plant derived, but during the transformation process, some far from green petrochemicals can come into play. It is therefore a wide open door for having claims on all products and for consumers to be completely misled,"" she explains. ""It’s impugning motives"", answers Anne Dux who, on the contrary, sees in the standard an opportunity to simplify things for consumers often confronted to the diversity and contradiction of labels. Does the solution lie in a better control of environmental claims, similar to what is done in France? This point, in contrast, seems to have reached consensus.  "
Scientists recommend avoiding the use of triclosan and triclocarban in consumer products,"The news comes after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced last year that 19 different antimicrobial chemicals, including triclosan and triclocarban, were not effective and should not be used in over-the-counter consumer hygiene products. However, the scientists behind the report say the FDA’s decision does not go far enough.  ""I was happy that the FDA finally acted to remove these chemicals from soaps. But I was dismayed to discover at my local drugstore that most products now contain substitutes that may be worse,"" said Arlene Blum of Green Science Policy Institute. In addition to being used in soaps and hygiene products, antimicrobials are found in a variety of everyday products including paints, exercise mats, flooring, apparel, food storage containers, home textiles, electronics, kitchenware, school supplies, and countertops. Although the report acknowledges that antimicrobials can be useful in certain products, such as paint, they also point out that any health claims about products with antimicrobials are largely invalid.  “In personal care products like hand soap, there is no evidence that use of triclosan or triclocarban improves consumer or patient health or prevents disease,” claim the scientists behind the statement. The scientists add that triclosan or triclocarban “are source of toxic and carcinogenic compounds”, “have detrimental effects on aquatic organisms”, “are endocrine disruptor”. Furthermore, overusing these substances “may contribute to antibiotic/antimicrobial resistance and may modify the microbiome.” Despite this, sales of products marketed with antimicrobials are expected to rise.  ""Customers may think added antimicrobials are a way to reduce infections, but in most products there is no evidence that they do,"" said Ted Schettler of the Science and Environmental Health Network. ""People think antimicrobial hand soaps offer better protection against illness. But generally, antimicrobial soaps perform no better than plain soap and water,"" added Barbara Sattler from the University of San Francisco. The reports by the scientists concluded that non-medical uses of antimicrobials should be reduced, with Rolf Halden at Arizona State University explaining that, ""Environmental and human exposures to triclosan and triclocarban are widespread, affecting pregnant women, developing fetuses, and breastfeeding babies.  We must develop better alternatives and prevent unneeded exposures to antimicrobial chemicals."" The statement was published while the FDA is in a multi-year process of establishing a new Healthcare Antiseptic Monograph, which regulates the use of most antiseptic hand hygiene agents in healthcare settings, including what are commonly known as antibacterial soaps, hand sanitizers and pre-operative scrubs."
"Sunscreens and aluminium salts, the FEBEA takes the floor","The first themes addressed at the workshop led by Anne Dux, Director of Scientific and Regulatory Affairs, concerned issues related to sunscreens and deodorants. First finding: only one French out of four bought suncare products in 2016, (26.5% exactly), for an average of 1.6 product per year. It is not much, especially considering that skin cancer is making progress and is one of the top three cancers in the world [1]. The often high price of suncare products, could explain the lack of interest of French people for sunscreens, a public health issue. ""Products are expensive because filters are expensive,"" explained Anne Dux. Filters, – key components of the product –, their quality, performance, relevance and environmental impact are at the heart of issues. To be efficient a suncare product generally uses two types of filters to protect the skin against UVAs and UVBs: mineral filters, playing the role of sunray reflectors like a mirror, and organic filters that absorb UVs. Some manufacturers are questioning the need of adding IR filters (against infrareds) in sunscreen formulas. ""We do not recommend their use, because these rays impart a sensation of heat on the skin, protecting himself from IRs will encourage the user to stay longer in the sun or to expose himself during the hottest hours of the day,"" emphasised Anne Dux. There is currently a debate going on about the evaluation of the protective effect of sunscreens. According to the FEBEA, concerning SPFs (sun protection factor), which measures the protection against UVBs, only in vivo measurements, i.e., on human volunteers, are reliable. However, this poses an ethical problem, while in vitro results are more uncertain. ""In terms of innovation, improvements both in efficiency measurements and in the development of more eco-friendly filters are expected. Maybe with the introduction of natural filters, which so far, lack efficiency, or with formulas minimizing the presence of filters,"" assured Anne Dux. Because the other much debated issue on sunscreens is their environmental impact on wildlife and marine life. ""Yet, there is no scientific evidence of this impact"", according to the specialist. Mineral filters are deposited on the ocean floor and do not degrade. But as far as pollution is concerned, sunscreens are not the biggest polluters in the field, way behind industrial paints. Finally Anne Dux recalled that at present, the EU regulation was one of the safest in the world concerning suncare products. There is currently In Europe a list of 25 modern filters authorized, while in the United States this list, regulated by the FDA has not been updated since 1974. It only has 9 authorized filters, hence old generation filters. ""This creates a real burden for U.S. and international companies, and a lack of safety for consumers,"" she concluded.  
The speaker focused on recalling the differences in their mechanism of action and therefore their composition. Deodorants fight against perspiration odours by using agents and perfumes that limit bacterial growth. Aluminium salts, which have been in the hot seat for many years due to a possible link with breast cancer, are present in antiperspirant products to block sweat excretion from sweat glands. Anne Dux looked back on the issue concerning these aluminium salts recalling that aluminium was present everywhere in our environment without impacting the organism because it did not cross the skin or digestive barrier. Adding that, no reliable study proved so far that these aluminium salts could cross the skin barrier and justify the presence of the substance in the ganglia of women with the disease. ""In all logic, if the link between deodorants and breast cancer was established, it would then cause bilateral cancers and also affect men. There is no conclusive study on the crossing of the skin barrier. The recommendations of the AFSSAPS (French Agency for the Safety of Health Products) are based on invalid tests because they were performed in an environment charged with aluminium,"" commented Anne Dux. A new in vivo study is underway on which the SCCS (Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety) will soon take position."
Brazil: Anvisa updates definition and labelling rules for sun products,"The purpose of the regulation was to complement and to clarify existing technical requirements and to fill in gaps in the definitions of these products. According to Anvisa, these gaps were generated by the repeal of Decree 79094, dated January 5, 1977, in August 2013. The Agency provides the following definitions: A sunscreen (bronzeador) is a cosmetic preparation intended to come into contact with the skin, with the sole or principal purpose of protecting it against UVB and UVA radiations without, however, preventing the tanning action of the sun. A self-tanning (bronzeador simulatório) is the cosmetic that darkens the skin by external application, regardless exposure to solar radiation, it shall be dermatologically innocuous and free of irritating or photosensitizing substances. A tan activator or accelerator (ativador/acelerador de bronzeado) is intended to promote the darkening of the skin by external application, it shall be dermatologically innocuous, and free of irritating or photosensitizing substances. The procedures for the regularization of these products with the Anvisa remain unchanged and must comply with the requirements established in regulation RDC No. 7/2015, that is to say that sunscreens are subject to registration, while self-tanning products and tan activators or accelerators are exempt from registration. Furthermore, sunscreens shall also comply with the requirements of the regulation RDC No. 30/2012. As far as labelling is concerned, companies that already have tan activators or accelerators listed with the Anvisa have 180 days to update the labelling of the products, which shall now display on both the primary and secondary packaging, the words: ""This product is not a sun protector,” (Este produto não é um protetor solar,)in addition to the warnings already required by regulation RDC No. 7/2015."
Zinc oxide makes official entry into the list of UV filters approved in the EU,"Following a vote by member states in the EU Commission Working Group on Cosmetics in October last year, zinc oxide in both its nano and non-nano forms has now been added officially to the list of UV filters allowed for use in cosmetic products.  Being known for decades for its beneficial properties as skin protectant and its antimicrobial activity, zinc oxide is one of only two UV filters approved for UVA1 protection in sun care applications in the US. According to Regulation (EU) 2016/621 of 21 April 2016, amending Annex VI to the Cosmetics Regulation [1], both the nano and non-nano forms will be authorized for use at a maximum concentration of 25%, except in applications that may lead to exposure of the consumer’s lungs by inhalation.  Therefore, the use in an aerosol sunspray would not be allowed as part of the formulation could be unwittingly inspired. Furthermore, only the nano forms meeting the criteria mentioned in the annex of the regulation - including particle size, morphology, purity and solubility - are allowed. This modification to the Cosmetics Regulation is effective on May 11, 2016. Suppliers of these substances applaud the move, which will widen formulation options for products aimed at filtering UV rays. “The formal approval of new options to achieve effective UVA and UVB protection is a major milestone for formulators of UV protection products. Having a wider choice of globally approved filters enables brands to meet consumer needs more easily,” said Helene Hine, Marketing Manager at Croda.  The company offers a range of zinc oxide dispersions under their Solaveil Clarus brand, Solaveil CZ-100 and Solaveil CZ-300. “UV radiation is responsible for various physiological effects in the skin. These include sunburn, premature appearance of wrinkles and - with frequent intensive exposure - an increased risk of skin cancer.  Each approval of a UV filter offers new options and a wider choice for formulators of sun care products to provide vital protection for the skin against these harmful effects of UV radiation,” also said Dirk Mampe, BASF’s Head of Business Management for Personal Care Specialties in Europe. BASF offers zinc oxide - with and without coating - under its Z-Cote brand. The EU may soon approve other nano UV filters.  In February 2016, titanium dioxide has received a positive vote by the EU Commission Working Group on Cosmetics. The official entry of the nano UV filter into Annex VI of the EU Cosmetics Regulation is expected for the second half of 2016. Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutyl-phenol (MBBT) is still on the voting list. In 2015, the Scientific Committee for Consumer Safety (SCCS) published a positive scientific opinion on MBBT in nano form. Its official entry into Annex VI is anticipated for 2017. Both titanium dioxide and MBBT were already approved as UV filters and have been used in sunscreens for years. However, a new approval as “nano“ was required due to the new EU Cosmetics Regulation."
Audit of cosmetics advertising practices shows high compliance level,"The European Regulation on the justification of claims used in relation to cosmetic products [1] and the guidelines and recommendations adopted by the cosmetics industry [2] to regulate its advertising practices are well followed. This is the conclusion of the audit conducted, upon the request of Cosmetics Europe, by the European Advertising Standards Alliance (EASA) - a non-profit organisation based in Brussels, which brings together national advertising self-regulatory organisations.  The audit, which was conducted across six representative European countries (France, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Sweden and UK), also checked the compliance of advertisements against the national self-regulatory advertising codes and laws. Results are very positive for the European cosmetics industry.  Indeed, EASA’s audit report finds that 91% of the advertisements of cosmetic products were in compliance with all relevant advertising codes/laws. A total of 1,861 advertisements were reviewed, including 577 television and 1,284 print advertisements aired/published over three month periods - September 2014, March and June 2015. Only 6% of the advertisements were found to be in breach of relevant advertising codes/laws while 3% of the advertisements could not be assessed, as the experts did not receive the information necessary to assess the compliance of the claims made in the advertisements. Poland and France reported the highest compliance rates with 98% and 95% respectively. The compliance rates in Sweden (89%), UK (87%), Hungary (86%) and Italy (83%) showed in comparison a lower compliance rate. “The high level of compliance found in the EASA report highlights the effectiveness of self-regulation by the industry and the vital role it plays as a component of the overall EU policy and regulatory system for cosmetics advertising; the system works well! Nevertheless, our industry is not complacent. Cosmetics Europe is committed to promote continuous improvement of industry’s advertising practices, through compliance with the regulatory and self-regulatory framework and will seek to take learnings from the results of the EASA audit for the future,” said Loïc Armand, President of Cosmetics Europe. The main issue identified with the 6% of advertisements found to be in breach was misleading advertising followed by social responsibility, health and safety and taste and decency. Misleading advertising mainly concerned unsubstantiated claims and health/medical claims. Other misleading issues flagged by the experts were related to: claims regarding legal requirements, claims related to studies/tests, denigration of the use of ingredients that are legal to use, testimonials, promotions with no expiration date, misleading imagery and comparative advertising; Finally, let’s note that 97% of the television advertisements were considered as compliant with all relevant advertising codes/laws while only 88% of the print advertisements were considered as compliant."
Cosmetics under fire: What is the impact on consumers and the industry?,"The last few weeks have been rough for cosmetic manufacturers. The safety of their products, which is a regulatory requirement, has come under fire.  Charges have multiplied with cosmetics successively accused to pollute indoor air, to contain substances potentially harmful for babies or for everybody… Each time, the industry tried to respond. Regarding indoor air quality, the Cosmetic, Toiletry & Perfumery Association (CTPA) explained that media reports linking the use of personal care products and harmful indoor air quality were “based on a misrepresentation” of a report issued by the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. Indeed, the report is very clear, when it comes to the quality of indoor air, as few substances such as cigarette smoke and carbon monoxide are pointed out as very serious hazards. While personal care products may contain VOCs, the report clearly says: “Although they are very common in the air, their health effects are generally minor.” Similarly, the French Federation of Cosmetics Makers (Fédération des entreprises de la beauté - FEBEA) immediately responded to the publication of the reports from Women in Europe for a Common Future (WECF) and UFC-Que Choisir. As far as baby products are concerned, FEBEA reminded that all cosmetic products marketed in Europe are subject to a safety assessment and that specific and reinforced procedures apply to cosmetic products intended for children under three years of age. It is the same for substances in the products. When a potentially hazardous substance is identified, the European Commission may, where appropriate, prohibit or limit its use to ensure that it presents no hazard.  ""For the scientific authorities, there is no question of accepting that legislation would not be up to date,"" highlights the Federation. For several years, the representatives of the cosmetics industry have also created websites to provide answers to consumer concerns: ParlonsCosmetiques.com in France, The Facts About Cosmetic Products in the United Kingdom, and CosmeticsInfo.org in the United States. However, one must admit that the industry’s arguments hardly emerge from the mass of scaring stories. It is likely that the opinions of cosmetics makers are regarded with suspicion due to their supposed bias. But when whistle-blowers themselves temperate their previous affirmation, or the way they were interpreted, they face the same difficulties. UFC-Que Choisir has just published a new article strongly moderating some of the conclusions that were drawn from its previous report (in French). Let’s bet it will not make much ado. In this case, the media mechanics are to blame. In a basic economic calculation, media tend to prefer sensational news generating high audience levels (or a lot of clicks) rather than complex and costly investigations that are much less impactful. Moreover, the behaviour of cosmetics makers, which are eager to maximize sales, does not always help to clarify things.  When consumers began to be suspicious about parabens, many brands have seen it as a business opportunity, either because they never used parabens, as for natural or organic brands, or because they were able to quickly reformulate their products. The “paraben-free” claim becoming a commercial argument, it confirmed consumers’ worries. Despite the lack of conclusive studies and despite (or because of) frequent confusions between different types of molecules, the arguments of experts defending parabens have fallen flat. Today, among the substances blamed for their potentially harmful effects are materials such as methylisothiazolinone (MIT), which have been used to replace parabens. History repeats itself and scaring stories about endocrine disruptors in cosmetics are leading to the emergence on the marketi of cosmetics claiming to be “free from endocrine disruptors”. [1] For Celine Couteau and Laurence Coiffard, who teach cosmetology at the University of Nantes’ Faculty of Pharmacy, these alarming reports mix very different things.  In a recent opinion paper (in French) the two scientists criticized ""excessively scaring information"" that ""creates confusion between irritating molecules, allergens and endocrine disruptors."" Legitimate criticism about the honesty of so-called hypoallergenic products containing well-known allergens (such as MCI and MIT), are placed alongside questions on possible endocrine disruptors, for which there is no scientific consensus.  Such confusion greatly complicates the response from the industry. ""Different and incomparable things are placed at the same level,"" Céline Couteau told Premium Beauty News.  “It is as absurd as to say that a food market is full of allergenic products such as strawberries or photo-sensitizers such as celery.” Will consumers eventually benefit from these polemics? It is very unlikely according to Céline Couteau.  ""In my opinion, it is not in the interest of consumers to cry wolf constantly. This can lead to remove molecules that are not perfect but that have a very well known spectrum. The risk is that they are replaced by apparently less problematic substances for which we actually lack of detailed information."" Meanwhile consumers seem rather puzzled. According to a recent survey by Toluna for the magazine Challenges, nearly a quarter (24.8%) of respondents in France believe that the safety of products sold in supermarkets is declining, but a half believe that it remains stable and 18.8% that it improves!  ""These scandals reinforce the suspicion from the most pessimistic consumers towards products,"" Philippe Guilbert, CEO of Toluna, told Premium Beauty News. “We also note that certifications still play a key role to reassure consumers, even if occasionally they may fail to guarantee full product quality.” What conclusions can be drawn from all of that? One can certainly note the paradox of multiplying alerts in an increasingly stringent regulatory environment. But one must admit that safety requirements are becoming stronger and that the succession of scandals even areas not related to cosmetics - such as pharmaceuticals or food - tends to increase the defiance of consumers regarding the industry in general. The trend towards more natural products will certainly continue, although natural and organic cosmetics are far from being beyond reproach.  However, consumers do not panic, they are suspicious but still measured in their conclusions. One of the main challenges is certainly to allow the emergence of independent and expert voices, which could translate complex scientific facts into nuanced and well-argued analyses understandable by the general public. From this point of view, web and social media cannot be perceived as just dangerous. Many talented bloggers and vloggers have demonstrated their ability to build bridges between consumers and scientists.  Just read, for instance, the interesting posts from French bloggers Capucine Piot (in French) and Sophie Strobel (in French)."
USA: Ban on microplastic beans in rinsed-off cosmetics,"The Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015 prohibits “the manufacture and introduction into interstate commerce of rinse-off cosmetics containing intentionally-added plastic microbeads."" The Bill (H.R. 1321) was co-sponsored by both Republican and Democrat congressmen and passed the U.S. House on December 7 and the Senate on December 18, 2015. According to the law, the term “plastic microbeads” means “any solid plastic particle that is less than five millimetres in size and is intended to be used to exfoliate or cleanse the human body or any part thereof.”  The text also includes toothpastes within the rinse-off cosmetic category concerned by the ban. The new law will phase microbeads out of consumer products over the next few years, starting with a ban on manufacturing the beads beginning on the July 1, 2017, followed by the ban on sales on July 1, 2018.  However, in the case of a rinse-off cosmetic that is also a non-prescription drug, the ban on manufacturing will begin on July 1, 2018, and the ban on sale on July 1, 2019. The Personal Care Products Council applauded the new law “which creates a planned and pragmatic national phase-out process in the interest of both consumers and the industry.” Legislations prohibiting microbeads particles in cosmetic products were already passed in several U.S. States.  The new law “is aimed at the proliferation of conflicting state and local restrictions that create unnecessary disruption and confusion for both consumers and companies,” said Lezlee Westine, President and CEO of the Personal Care Products Council. The persistence of plastic debris in the marine environment and waterways is an issue of increasing public debate.  In Europe, Cosmetics Europe, the European personal care association has issued recommendation to discontinue their use in wash off cosmetic and personal care products as of 2020."
North America on the way to ban plastic microbeads in cosmetics,"With the recent adoption on June 29 by the Connecticut legislature of a number of items as budget implementers including a ban of plastic microbeads used in cosmetics and personal care products, the prospect of a general ban in North America gained ground. The text prohibits the manufacture of personal care products - with the exception of over-the-counter drugs - containing synthetic solid microbeads from December 31, 2017.  It also prohibits the importation of such products from December 31, 2018. Several other states have already passed similar laws or are considering their adoption.  The list of states that have passed a ban or discussing this issue includes California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, New Jersey, New York and Wisconsin.  In New Jersey, for instance, Governor Chris Christie signed the legislation (S2178) into law on March 2015, after having vetoed an earlier version of the law in December 2014. On the 1st of May 2015, Congressman Fred Upton and members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Health held the first legislative hearing on H.R. 1321, the Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015.  This bipartisan bill, authored by representative and Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, would require the Food and Drug Administration to prohibit the sale or distribution of personal care products containing plastic microbeads by January 1, 2018. A Federal legislation would have the advantage to establish a national standard to protect the environment and therefore ensure that manufacturers do not face a patchwork of State laws. In Canada, the House of Commons unanimously voted a proposition from the New Democratic Party (NDP) to add microbeads to the list of toxic substances managed by the government under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.  The NDP initiative has received support from many people across the country, NGOs and the Canadian Cosmetics, Toiletry and Fragrances Association.  A public petition on Change.org has gathered over 30,000 signatures in a few short months. All these legislative initiatives show a clear direction and it is quite reasonable to expect that a ban on plastic microbeads in cosmetics will be effective across the North American continent around January 2018."
USA: What’s in the Personal Care Products Safety Act ?,"For several years, the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC), the trade organization which represents the leading producers of cosmetic and personal care products in the United States, has expressed its support to strengthening FDA oversight of these products.  However, the organization’s position proved difficult to conciliate with those of consumer advocacy organizations.  Having support from all stakeholders is certainly the main asset of the text proposed by Senators Feinstein and Collins, which is the result of numerous discussions and extensive consultations. [1] The bill requires FDA to review chemicals used in cosmetic products and provide clear guidance on their safety.  A minimum of five ingredients per year would be evaluate to determine their safety and appropriate use. The first set of chemicals for review includes: – Diazolidinyl urea, which is used as a preservative in a wide range of products including deodorant, shampoo, conditioner, bubble bath and lotion.
– Lead acetate, which is used as a colour additive in hair dyes.
– Methylene glycol/formaldehyde, which is used in hair treatments.
– Propyl paraben, which is used as a preservative in a wide range of products including shampoo, conditioner and lotion.
– Quaternium-15, which is used as a preservative in a wide range of products including shampoo, shaving cream, skin creams and cleansers The Personal Care Products Safety Act would also: – Provide the FDA the authority to order recalls of certain personal care products that threaten consumer safety.
– Provide the FDA the authority to require labelling of products that include ingredients not appropriate for children and those that should be professionally administered.
– Require complete label information, including ingredients and product warnings, to be posted online since many personal care products are purchased over the Internet. 
– Require companies to provide contact information on their products for consumers and report serious adverse events to the FDA within 15 days, including death, hospitalization and disfigurement. Health effects that could have resulted in hospitalization without early intervention would also be required to be reported.
– Require manufacturers to register annually with the FDA and provide the agency with information on the ingredients used in their personal care products.
– Direct the FDA to issue regulations on Good Manufacturing Practices for personal care products.
– Encourage the use of alternative testing methods that provide information that is equivalent or superior in scientific quality to the animal testing method. The bill is available here below or on Senator Feinstein’s website."
"UEAPME, IFRA and Cosmebio recommend a pragmatic approach to labelling of fragrance allergens","The possible addition of tens of fragrance components to the current list of 26 allergens that must be labelled on cosmetic products is a source of concerns for the whole cosmetics industry and in particular for SMEs. According to IFRA and the two other trade organisations, efficient and relevant information must be provided to people suffering from skin allergy, this information must be provided before choosing to use a cosmetic product containing certain skin sensitizers, it must be straightforward and easily accessible, as well as rigorously identical across the industry and proportionate, and manageable by all concerned in the supply chain. “Given the intrinsic nature of elicitation thresholds to each individual, it is essential that the way in which the information is structured helps each individual tailor his management of the risk under consideration,” explain the three organisations. According to the trade bodies, a hybrid informative approach combining “several tools such as pictograms, on-pack warnings, web sites and toll free access to consumer help centres,” would be the best way to address all the efficiency, proportionality and manageability pre-requisites. They recommend adding 12 “allergens of concern” (as enumerated in table 13.5 of the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety opinion [1]) to the list of substances that must be labelled on the external packaging of cosmetic products. “These substances are the ones frequently prevalent in the reported cases of skin allergies”, they say. For all other substances, a pictogram could be used to draw consumers’ attention to a specific web based data bank disclosing the full list of skin sensitizers contained in the product.  “This website will enable downstream consumer product companies to add any relevant information, notably the one relative to the presence of allergens and guidance on applications and warnings,” add IFRA, Cosmebio and UEAPME. According to the three trade organisations, this hybrid approach could also offer additional advantages. For instance, the voluntary recommendations provided by the brands through their websites could generate a substantial benefit for allergic consumers. For the medical community, on-line consultation of information would even offer the option to analyse the patient’s extensive products usage without the burden of referring to the physical products."
Cosmed calls for a simplification of the Cosmetics Regulation,"Responsible for making concrete proposals to strengthen the competitiveness of European SMEs, Commissioner Timmermans met six organizations representing the interests of small and medium French companies through a dinner organized by the General Confederation of Small and Medium sized Enterprises (CGPME [1]), an interprofessional organisation for employers. On this occasion, the President of Cosmed called for a simplification of regulations that, according to him, could have a direct positive impact on the margins of SMEs, without compromising consumer safety. Six proposals were put under the spotlights by Cosmed: – Extended deadlines for the compliance of products after regulatory changes. Current deadlines for the compliance of new products and the removal of old products from the market are limited to 6 and 12 months respectively. Cosmed proposes to double this period (1 year and 2 years).
– Suppression of Certificates of Free Sale (CFS). Cosmed said the Commission could pressure non-EU countries requesting this document to obtain a simplification of import procedures.
– International recognition of self-certification of compliance with European GMP, which is not easily accepted by some national authorities.
– Consistence and coordination in the treatment of sanitary risks by avoiding pointing out the cosmetics industry alone when complex health issues also involve other sectors.
– Simplification of product labelling, by focusing on essential information only and allowing using digital information to inform a specific population, for instance on the presence of allergens.
– Vigilance in the TTIP negotiations (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership). Eventually, the CGPME Directorate highlighted more general issues, in particular the lack of harmonization in several areas, such as social and fiscal regulations, thus leaving national discrepancies unsuited to the economic context. “Franz Timmermans has asked the members of its cabinet to investigate these issues and to maintain contact and regular dialogue with Cosmed for the cosmetics industry, and the CGPME for general topics,” said Cosmed."
Brazilian health agency simplifies registration of cosmetic products,"According to the resolution DRC 07/2015 of the 10th of February 2015, a large part of products that are classified as risk grade 2 [1] will now be exempt from registration. These products will only have to be notified to health authorities before being placed on the market, with the exception of product categories that are submitted to specific regulations (sunscreens, insect repellents, products for children, as well as alcohol gel products and hair straighteners). Products classified as risk grade 1 were already exempt from registration. Advance notification is a simplified administrative procedure to inform ANVISA about the intention of placing a product on the market. As a consequence, products of Grade 1 and Grade 2 submitted to the procedure can be placed on the market as soon as the notification is confirmed on the ANVISA’s web portal. Products of Grade 2 that remain subject to registration can only be placed on the market when the official registration is granted and published in the Official Gazette. Registration generally requires about 60 days, while the notification is usually completed within 48 hours. The control of products exempt from registration will be carried out through procedures including periodic and random controls, as well as market monitoring including the control and analysis of products available on retail shelves. Products that still need to be registered are listed in Annex VIII of Resolution RDC 07/2015. The list includes tanning products, hair straightening products, sunscreens, insect repellents, antiseptic hand gels and children’s products. “Considering their higher level of risk, these products remain submitted to analyses performed by the Agency,” said the AVINSA. The new rule aims at providing more flexibility to the sector and enabling the Agency to focus its analyses of products with the higher level of risk. “This is a historic change for the personal care, perfumery and cosmetic industry,” said the Brazilian Association of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Industry (ABIHPEC). ""We have debated this issue since 2008 and we celebrate now another step forward for the Brazilian industry, which comes closer from global practices. This achievement will provide greater predictability to the industry to launch products, resulting in a more competitive and innovative market. It will also speed up consumer access to the industry’s products and help improve health, well being and quality of life,"" said João Carlos Basilio, President of the ABIHPEC. Technical and safety requirements applicable to cosmetic products remain unchanged. The person responsible for marketing cosmetics must “ensure that the product does present any risk to health when used in accordance with the instructions,"" says the article 10 of the new resolution."
Ban on cosmetics animal testing makes progress around the world,"The South Korean Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs has announced that finished cosmetics product testing on animals will be banned, followed by consideration of a further ban on the testing of ingredients.  This move is part of the Ministry’s 5 Year Plan for Animal Welfare. ""We very much welcome this important breakthrough and we are grateful to the members of the National Assembly who helped us press the case. We will now be urging implementation as soon as possible so that the full ban can be achieved at the earliest possible date, bringing Korea into line with Europe and India”, commented Michelle Thew, Chief Executive of Cruelty Free International. “We hope to see this echoed in 2015 by other Asian countries where we are active. This is a great start to the New Year,"" she added. As far as cosmetics animal testing is concerned, 2014 can be viewed as a milestone year with awesome breakthroughs worldwide. After having prohibited the tests in its territory, India has announced a ban on imports of animal tested cosmetics, China has made important progress towards ending mandatory animal testing, and several countries, including Brazil and Australia, are discussing bills to ban tests on animals for cosmetics. Ban on cosmetics animal testing: 2014 Highlights  – India bans cosmetics animal testing and the sale of animal tested cosmetics – China removes mandatory animal testing for most domestically-produced cosmetics
– Brazil’s state of Sao Paulo bans cosmetics animal testing – Brazil bill launched for national test ban – New Zealand MP launches bid for cosmetics animal test ban in Animal Welfare Act – New Zealand’s Labour Party pledges support for a ban on cosmetics animal testing – Australia’s Green Party launches End Cruel Cosmetics Bill – Australian Senate Motion launched with unprecedented cross-party support – United States’ Humane Cosmetics Act backed by more than 140 companies and the bill is introduced by Representative Jim Moran “We’ve ended cosmetics animal testing in India, started the ball rolling in China, seen bills introduced in Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, Taiwan and the United States. There are still thousands of animals suffering for our lip sticks and shampoo, so we have a long way to go but I’m excited to see the progress we’ll make for animals in 2015,” said Claire Mansfield, #BeCrueltyFree Campaigns Director at the Humane Society International (HIS)."
Australia bans commercial sunbeds over cancer fears,"The ban - which came into force in the states of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, Queensland and in the Australian Capital Territory on January 1 - made Australia the second nation after Brazil to impose such a restriction, public health campaigners said. Western Australia has said it would also implement a ban, though it has yet to announce a start date. There are no commercial solariums in the only other part of Australia - the hot and humid Northern Territory. Cancer Council Australia welcomed the ban, which it has long pushed for, adding that it would help to reduce rates of skin cancer, which affects two out of three Australians by age 70. ""Australia has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world,"" advocacy director Paul Grogan said in a statement to AFP.  ""Solariums expose users to extremely highly levels of UV (ultraviolet) radiation, greatly increasing their risk of melanoma and other skin cancers."" Australia is sometimes referred to as the sunburnt country, where beaches are thronged with bathers basking under blue skies and the rates of melanoma, a potentially fatal form of skin cancer, are the highest in the world. Australia’s proximity to Antarctica, where there is a hole in the ozone layer which normally filters out UV rays, also increases the risk. Public health campaigners and authorities have long pushed to promote awareness of the dangers of exposure to the sun, urging people to wear sunscreen, hats and sunglasses. They have also warned that tanning on a sunbed is not safe. ""Queensland already has the highest rate of skin cancer in the world and there is no question there’s a direct link between regular sunbed use and the incidence of malignant melanoma,"" the state’s interim Health Minister Mark McArdle told Australian Associated Press. The incidence of skin cancers in Australia is two to three times the rates in Canada, the United States and Great Britain, the Cancer Council said. More than 2000 Australians died from skin cancer in 2011, the majority from melanoma, which is caused by harmful ultraviolet light from the sun, the council added. Previous research suggested that the use of sunbeds by people aged 18 to 39 increases their risk of developing melanoma, the most common form of cancer among young Australians, by an average of 41 per cent. The ban was supported by a majority of Australians, the council said, in a recent survey of 6,300 people, while fewer adults and youths said they had used a solarium in the past year. About one per cent of adults and 0.3 per cent of youths used a sunbed, the data showed, down from 2.2 per cent and 1.2 per cent a decade ago. Several European countries and American states have also banned the use of sunbeds by minors, according to research published in the journal Nature."
High Court refers questions about the scope of the ban on animal testing of cosmetics to the ECJ,"Brought before the High Court by the European Federation for Cosmetic Ingredients (EFfCI), the action concerned the interpretation of the EU ban on animal testing of cosmetic products and their ingredients.  The Court concluded the claim involved a real issue and referred questions to the European Court of Justice (ECJ). [1] Contained in Article 18 of Regulation (EC) 1223/2009 on cosmetics products, the ban prohibits the marketing in the European Economic Area (EEA) of cosmetics products tested on animals or containing ingredients tested on animals.  The questions referred concern the extent to which the ban applies to cosmetic ingredients tested on animals for the purposes of regulatory requirements imposed by non-EEA countries. Actually, countries outside the European Union, such as China and Japan, may require some cosmetic ingredients to undergo certain tests, including tests on animals, to demonstrate the safety of those ingredients. According to EFfCI, there is uncertainty about whether placing cosmetic products incorporating these ingredients upon the market in the United Kingdom, or the rest of the European Union, would involve a breach of the prohibition imposed by Article 18(1)(b) of the Cosmetics Regulation. The Humane Society International (HSI), animal rights group, said this action could to undermine the EU’s historic cosmetics animal testing ban. “The industry’s legal action could be a potential disaster for animal welfare and is a betrayal of the clearly expressed desire by EU consumers to end cruel and needless animal testing for cosmetics no matter where in the world that animal testing is taking place. EFfCI’s case would undermine both the spirit and the letter of the EU ban, effectively allowing companies to continue testing cosmetics on animals abroad, and importing them back into the EU. We hope the ECJ will see fit to reject this case and find in favour of a strong and comprehensive ban,” explained Susie Wilks, HSI’s #BeCrueltyFree Policy Advisor.

The Sunscreen Innovation Act: What is changing?,"In the US, products that protect the skin against sunburns are classified as OTC drugs (standing for “over-the-counter drugs”).  One of the consequences of this classification is that the approval of new active ingredients (in this case new UV filters) for these products is subject to a process initially designed for the approval of new drugs.  Over the years, the acceptance of new sunscreens has proved much more complex and long in the United States than in Europe or Asia, where sunscreens are generally considered as cosmetic products. “The last over-the-counter (OTC) sunscreen ingredient to be approved by FDA was in the 1990s. Since 2002, eight new sunscreen applications have been filed and are still awaiting review 12 years later,” said the Public Access to SunScreens (PASS) Coalition, which members include the Skin Cancer Foundation, Prevent Cancer Foundation, Melanoma Research Foundation, Dr. Fallick, Dr. Henry Lim, Dr. Nadim Shaath, Dr. Steven Wang, Dr. Warwick Morison, Beiersdorf, L’Oréal USA Products, Ashland Inc., BASF Corporation, DeWolf Chemical, Fitz Chem Corporation, and McCullough & Associates. The new law: – Requires the FDA to reduce the existing regulatory backlog of sunscreen applications and ensure an improved, reliable approval pathway for future sunscreen applications while maintaining the existing safety and effectiveness requirements for sunscreens;
– Requires the FDA to provide expedited approval pathways for pending sunscreen ingredients;
– Requires the FDA to regularly report to Congress on its efforts to reduce the backlog of existing applications and review of new ingredients;
– Requires independent reporting by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) on the regulatory pathway for sunscreen products and other OTC products;
– Requires the FDA to finalize its regulations related to all OTC sunscreens. “We are confident that the new law will enable Americans to have greater choice when it comes to protecting their skin from the sun’s harmful UVA and UVB rays,” said Michael Werner, PASS Coalition Policy Advisor.

Plastic microbeads: Australia to stop; ban is on governor’s office in New Jersey,"The latest news regarding the withdrawal of polyethylene beads from cosmetic and personal care products came from Australia.  In a statement dated November 21, Accord, Australia’s industry association for the hygiene, cosmetic and specialty products industry, announced that the local operators are committed to working towards a phase-out of polyethylene microbeads by the end of 2017. Accord says its decision reflects both the importance of environmental protection for the Australian industry and the need to adapt to a change in market conditions as several U.S. states are considering a ban on these substances. This summer, Illinois was the first state to adopt a binding legislation on this subject. In August, the Council of State Governments (CSG), a U.S. body that monitors and highlights innovative legislation from one state that may be beneficial to other states, has added the new Illinois’ law into its annual Suggested State Legislation (SSL) volume.  This decision was applauded by the Personal Care Products Council, the leading trade association representing the cosmetic and personal care products industry in the U.S. “The nation’s personal care products companies are pleased to support efforts that demonstrate their longstanding commitment to the global stewardship of their products. We urge policy makers to work with all sectors of the business community as they seek to eliminate plastic waste in our waterways and to identify effective and realistic solutions that consider the existing and emerging science as it becomes available,” the Personal Care Products Council stated.  Actually, a ban on the manufacture and sale of plastic microbeads used in personal care products by December 2017, as specified in the Illinois’ legislation, seem to be acceptable for the US association. Most recently, the New Jersey Senate voted the final text of the A3083 Diegnan, Moriarty bill, which aims to ban the production of cosmetics containing plastic beads from 1 January 2018 and to prohibit the presence of such products on the market after 1 January 2019. The text is now awaiting New Jersey Governor Chris Christie’s approval."
Preservatives: The EU Commission further restricts the scope of possibilities,"These new decisions follow a risk assessment by the independent Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS). The first measure adopted by the Commission [1] limits the maximum concentration of Propylparaben and Butylparaben, from currently allowed limit of 0.4% when used individually and 0.8% when mixed with other esters, to 0.14%, when used individually or together. Furthermore, the two preservatives are being banned from leave-on products designed for the nappy area of young children below the age of three. Indeed, the Commission explains, “existing skin irritation and occlusion may allow increased penetration than intact skin.” The new rules will apply for products put on shelves after April 16, 2015. Non-complying products must be withdrawn from the market by October 16, 2015. You can download Commission regulation (EU) No 1004/2014 here below: Earlier this year, the Commission banned the use of five other parabens in cosmetic products - Isopropylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Phenylparaben, Benzylparaben and Pentylparaben [2] due to the lack of data necessary for reassessment.  Products placed on the market after 30 October 2014 will have to be free from these substances.  However, this decision was a mere reflect of the industry’s practice as most manufacturers had already banned these substances from their formulations. Secondly, the Commission bans the mixture of Methylchloroisothiazolinone and Methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI) from leave-on products such as body creams [3]. The measure is aimed at reducing the risk from and the incidence of skin allergies. You can download Commission regulation (EU) No 1003/2014 here below: However, the mixture can still be used in rinse-off products, such as shampoos and shower gels at a maximum concentration of 0.0015 % of a mixture in the ratio 3:1 of MCI/MI. The measure will apply for products placed on the market after July 16, 2015. Non-complying products must be withdrawn from the market by April 16, 2015. Last December, Cosmetics Europe, the association representing the personal care industry in Europe, recommended to discontinue the use of methylisothiazolinone (MIT) in leave-on skin products, including cosmetic wet wipes. However, the Commission also reiterated the important role of preservatives for the safety of consumers.  “Preservatives in cosmetics serve a valuable function ensuring that the products we use on a daily basis are free from pathogens. We need however to ensure that the preservatives guarantee the maximum degree of protection,"" said the European Commissioner for Consumer Policy, Neven Mimica. The status of other parabens, like Methylparaben and Ethylparaben, remains unchanged.  The EU Commission reminded that the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) has repeatedly confirmed them as safe.  “They are also some of the most efficient preservatives,” the Commission added."
"French justice imposes a fine on perfumery ""pirates""","As intellectual property rights are being challenged all over the Internet, Pin thought of the 12/10/2013 French Court of Cassation’s decision to refuse the protection of perfume copyrights [1] as a “perfume liberation”. The company then presented its activity as operated by a “handful of mavericks” describing themselves as “adventurers armed simply with an idea, a vision: essences have never had owners”. The www.pirate-parfum.fr website thus provided Internet users with a search engine so that they could find the references of an alternative fragrance (Pirate) by typing the name of a well-known perfume. In short, it was like a modern version of the “concordance tables” that French lawyers in industrial and commercial property used to hunt down on small town markets. Twenty companies owning the brands used issued a writ against Pin. The company defended itself mainly by maintaining it used these brands for purely descriptive and comparative purposes. The Court rejected this argument, considering in its judgment that “word marks in the comparative lists published are not used for purely descriptive purposes, but for advertising purposes”, thus enabling Pin to “unduly take advantage of the (…) brands, the said brands being known for identifying fragrances associated with a world of prestige, and which were subject to massive marketing investments Pin could spare itself, while benefitting from them through the system of access to products it set up”, and “damaging the communication, investment or advertising function attached to the brands concerned”. All in all, Pin does not refer to the brands it mentions in order to compare its own products, but to profit from their fame by sparing itself the marketing design and development costs their owners did meet to become as famous as they are now. The judges considered the brand infringement was blatant, and therefore imposed on the defendant a fine of €564,000 for damages on account of “the damage to their brands as a result of the infringement acts”, and of €640,000 on account of “the loss of earnings as a result of the infringement acts”. They also obliged Pin to cease any use of the litigant brands on its website. However, judges rejected the “misleading advertising” grievance, as they considered nothing established the falsity of the information published on the www.pirate-parfum.fr website, in particular regarding the mention stating the geographical origin (Italian and/or French) of the alternative fragrances available. More surprisingly, the judges also refused to consider the mentions “three times cheaper” and “the only label which is able to guarantee 95 % product costs for 5 % marketing costs, whereas this trend is completely the opposite for all others” disparaging, on the ground that “consumers reasonably well-informed of commercial practices (…), particularly when it comes to luxury products, know that a significant part of the price results from the investments made for their design, advertising and place of distribution, so they are not surprised to see a product imitating a premium brand perfume (…), which did not get the same publicity, is cheaper”. This decision contributes to reinforcing brands’ rights when dealing with the – often aggressive – practices of some website operators, and that is rare enough a ruling to be welcomed."
Ukraine: A new regulation for cosmetic products?,"Of course, Ukrainian authorities surely have other priorities and emergencies to deal with!  Nevertheless, the implementation of the new Technical Regulation on the safety of cosmetic products has not been postponed. The new Technical Regulation provides a definition of cosmetic products and several lists of regulated ingredients that are almost identical to those in force in the European Union. The text also includes a definition of nanomaterials that is similar to the definition provided in the European cosmetics regulation, and it refers to GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices). Furthermore, the definition of ""manufacturer"" is complemented by the notion of ""person responsible for placing the product on the market"". If its entry into force is confirmed, the new regulation should facilitate the access to the Ukrainian market. However, in the meantime, the current procedure remains applicable. The foreign manufacturer or its authorized representative must: – Meet the requirements of the Ukrainian Ministry of Health’s Sanitary and Epidemiological Service,
– Meet the requirements of the UkrSepro standards (for some hair products),
– Provide access to the technical file,
– Provide the instructions of use,
– To comply with UkrSepro health inspection and certification procedures,
– Get a positive sanitary and epidemiological assment and provide it together with the products,
– Obtain the UkrSepro Certificate of Conformity (for some hair products). In practice, the original conclusions of the sanitary and epidemiological assessment and the UkrSepro Certificate of Conformity, or certified copies, are required upon the entry of products on the Ukrainian market - namely from the clearance - and thereafter to the point of sale. The conclusions of the sanitary and epidemiological assessment is issued by accredited bodies with the Sanitary and Epidemiological Service of the Ministry of Health, based on a documentary analysis and laboratory product testing. Most of the cosmetic products are subject to this requirement. The procedure for obtaining lasts about 3 weeks and the document is valid for a period of 3 to 5 years. Several hair product categories (such as shampoos, soaps, sprays, etc.) are subject to mandatory certification on the basis of documentary expertise and laboratory testing products. The procedure for obtaining the UkrSepro Certificate of Conformity lasts about 3 weeks and the validity of the document is of 3 years. Given the current political situation in Ukraine, forecasts regarding the market trends are largely pessimistic. The eventual enforcement the new Technical Regulation should obviously be considered in relation to this broader context."
The perfumery industry faces a harsh regulatory environment,"Invited to open the discussion, Patricia de Nicolaï, an independent perfumer and the current president of the Osmothèque, the International Conservatory of Perfumes, reminded how perfumery is an important patrimonial heritage in France. While we can trace its origins to the Renaissance, the perfumes and cosmetics sector is also a strong reality in today’s France where it is the third largest net exporter of the French industry. Furthermore, it is composed of 81% of SMEs. Having invested heavily to adapt their processes to the new requirements of the European Cosmetic Regulations [1], the perfume industry is now worrying about the possible consequences of a regulatory environment that has considerably tightened. Michèle Elbaz, Delegate Director Regulation and Safety at Chanel, has reviewed the perfume substances whose legal status is under review whether in application of the Cosmetics Regulation or in application of REACH. Some of these substances correspond to series for which the European Commission questioned the Scientific Committee [2] some years ago and which are still under discussion, waiting for regulatory measures (Tagetes minuta, patula; Methyl -N -methyl anthranilate; Vetiveryl acetate; Acetaldehyde). Some substances also fall under the scope of Article 15 of the Regulation on cosmetic products, which prohibits the use of CMR substances classified in category 1A (known CMR effect on humans), 1B (Suspected CMR effect on humans) or 2 (suspected CMR effect, but the available information is insufficient). Furthermore, some substances are also impacted by some additional REACH procedures besides registration, namely Substance Evaluation and Harmonized Classification and Labelling. This is the case, for example, of BMHCA, Furfuryl alcohol, Citral and Citronellal.  ""However, this does not necessarily mean that these substances are about to be prohibited or restricted,"" said Michèle Elbaz. Indeed, the deadline of their assessment may be delayed, depending on priorities, or they may be removed from the list if their REACH dossier has been fulfilled. However, the situation for the fragrance industry could become even more complex. Indeed, REACH procedures are currently very focused on CMR but should be massively expanded to include sensitizing and endocrine disruptors.  ""The challenge will be to demonstrate that the risk posed by skin sensitizers is sufficiently managed by the Cosmetics Regulation and the Regulations for the protection of workers, and that skin sensitizers cannot be treated a as CMRs,"" said Michèle Ebaz. Florian Schellauf, Issue Manager at Cosmetics Europe, exposed the situation regarding the other big concern: perfumery allergens. The measures proposed by the European Commission in response to the recommendations of the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) are currently subject to public consultation. The Commission is pursuing two main goals: to prevent induction (the onset of allergies), and to prevent elicitation (the trigger of allergic reactions among sensitized individuals). The Commission therefore proposed to prohibit certain substances, to restrict the concentration of a series of others, and to add many substances to the list of allergens that must be labelled. ""In this context, Cosmetics Europe is proposing a series of solutions which, while being very pragmatic, will ensure that consumers be properly informed,"" says Florian Schellauf.  In particular, Cosmetics Europe suggests that companies may chose to label the list of allergens on the package or to provide this information electronically. A logo (left) could inform concerned consumers that the information they need is available online. “The general revolution of providing information in electronic format has progressed in such a manner that a majority of consumers today prefer this way of receiving information. Accessing information electronically has become a fact of life and an integral part of society”, said Florian Schellauf. Cosmetics Europe also supports a change in the INCI nomenclature, in order to allow abbreviations. The European Association also requested a transition period of at least 6 years for products already placed on the market. The public consultation period on this issue will end mid-May 2014. The Commission will then submit its final proposals to the Parliament and the Council for final adoption in late 2014 or early 2015. Then perfumers will know their fate."
Access to genetic resources: the European Parliament votes new rules,"The European Union and all of its 27 Member States are Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which entered into force on 29 December 1993. The CBD recognizes that states have sovereign rights over genetic resources found within their jurisdiction and the authority to determine access to such resources. The Convention obliges all Parties to facilitate access to genetic resources over which they hold sovereign rights. It also obliges all Parties to share in a fair and equitable way the results of research and development and the benefits arising from the commercial and other utilization of genetic resources with the Party providing these resources.  However, the CBD provides little detail on how access and benefit-sharing (ABS) for the use of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge should be done in practice. This is precisely the aim of ""Nagoya Protocol” adopted on 29 October 2010. The aim of the new Regulation is to implement a European set of rules on access to genetic resources and fair and equitable sharing of benefits resulting from their utilization, thus preparing the ratification of the Nagoya Protocol. “This regulation eventually sets up a tool to fight biopiracy as it prohibits the use in the European Union of any genetic resources that would not have been legally acquired. It is the first European instrument in favour of biodiversity since the habitats directive of 1992,” highlights Sandrine Bélier, the Parliament’s rapporteur on the convention on biological diversity. The new EU rules also aim to monitor and support compliance with ABS requirements already implemented around the world. Laws and regulations in biodiversity rich countries such as Brazil, South Africa, and India already include requirements on how to access biological material for research and development and how to share the monetary and non-monetary benefits resulting from innovations or new products. “The Parliament vote is a landmark vote that will significantly impact the way biodiversity based R&D is conducted”, says María Julia Oliva, Senior Coordinator for Policy and Technical Support at the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT).  This mainly concerns the food, pharmaceutical, biotechnology and cosmetic sectors. Companies involved in biodiversity-based research and development will have to seek, keep and transfer information such as on the date and place of access; their source and any subsequent users, and the relevance and compliance with any ABS requirements. When there are uncertainties around ABS compliance, they must obtain relevant permits or discontinue utilization. In turn, EU Member States will establish different checkpoints, including during final stages of product development, for companies to declare compliance with due diligence requirements. The new regulation still has to be adopted by the Council, but that should be a mere formality as EU Member States have already agreed on the current version of the text during a meeting of the Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) in December 2013. Also note that latest developments on ABS, including the practical implications of the new EU rules for companies working with natural ingredients, will be analyzed at the upcoming conference on the “Beauty of Sourcing with Respect,” organized by the UEBT on 8 April 2014 in Paris (www.ethicalbiotrade.org/bsr_2014)."
Australian senator introduces legislation to end animal tests on cosmetics,"The bill introduced by Australian Senator Lee Rhiannon, who is also Greens animal welfare spokesperson, aims to modify existing legislation, in particular the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 to ban cosmetics animal testing within Australia as well as the import and sale of cosmetics newly animal-tested abroad. “We are encouraged that MPs from both Labor and the Liberals have pledged their support to the Be Cruelty-Free Australia campaign.  This takes us one step closer to ending cosmetics animal cruelty in Australia,” Senator Rhiannon said. Indeed, this landmark legislation follows more than a year of campaigning by Be Cruelty-Free Australia - a coalition of Humane Society International and Humane Research Australia. Thus, several federal politicians have already pledged their support for Be Cruelty-Free Australia, including the legislation’s sponsor Senator Lee Rhiannon, Deputy Opposition Leader Tanya Plibersek, Leader of the Greens Christine Milne, Greens MP Adam Bandt, Labor MP Anna Burke, Liberal MP Jason Wood, Senator Scott Ludlam, Senator Richard Di Natale, Senator Penny Wright, and Senator Peter Whish-Wilson. “There is overwhelming public support for a national cosmetics animal testing and sales ban in Australia, so we are delighted that politicians are joining with our Be Cruelty-Free Australia campaign to achieve this shared goal,”commented Hannah Stuart, Be Cruelty-Free Australia The proposed new Australian legislation would mirror the test and sales ban introduced in the European Union in 2009 and 2013 respectively.  “The European Union, one of the world’s biggest markets, is already cruelty-free and it’s great that Australia will be joining the list of cruelty-free countries,” said Greens deputy leader Adam Bandt. A similar bill was introduced last week in the USA, in context where there is a global pressure to end animal testing."
USA: A step forward towards the end of cosmetic testing on animals?,"Introduced by Congressman Jim Moran, The Humane Cosmetics Act (H.R. 4148), aims at ensuring animals are not harmed in the process of creating or manufacturing cosmetics. “The U.S. can and should phase out the use of animals in cosmetic safety testing.  Not only are animal-based tests fundamentally inhumane, they also rely on outmoded science that can fail to accurately predict safety for humans,” said Representative Moran.  “This legislation would encourage the use of testing alternatives that are more effective and cheaper to conduct, helping the American cosmetic industry remain the dominant, and humane, leader in the global cosmetics market.” If it would be enacted, The Humane Cosmetics Act, H.R. 4148, would make it unlawful for anyone to conduct or commission cosmetic animal testing in the U.S., and would prohibit selling, offering for sale or transporting any cosmetics in interstate commerce if the final product or any component was developed or manufactured using animal testing. See text here below: This Federal bill is endorsed by animal rights organisations, such as The Humane Society of the United States, the Humane Society Legislative Fund and Humane Society International, along with members and stakeholders of the personal care products industry, including Lush, Jack Black, Biao skincare and Aubrey Organics. “Our customers and ingredient suppliers support the Humane Cosmetics Act, and we urge members of the House of Representatives to co-sponsor this important bill. We believe all cosmetics should be cruelty-free,” said Lush North America CEO & President Mark Wolverton. Bans on animal-tested cosmetics have been implemented in the 28 states of the European Union, and in Israel.  India has prohibited domestic animal testing for cosmetic products and ingredients, and is working on a follow-up import and sales ban. The State of São Paulo, Brazil, recently signed a bill prohibiting cosmetics testing on animals, and the Brazilian federal regulatory body for animal experiments will be voting on this issue later this month. In China, where animal testing has historically been required, the Chinese Food and Drug Administration announced it will remove the mandatory animal testing for non-essential domestically produced cosmetics in June 2014. The international trend is clearly toward the ban of animal tests for cosmetics. The bill was assigned to a congressional committee, which will consider it before possibly sending it on to the House or Senate as a whole.  Statistics show that this bill has a 4% chance of getting past committee first. Furthermore, only 11% of bills made it past committee and only about 3% were enacted in 2011–2013."
Fragrance allergens: the measures proposed by the EU Commission ,"After more than a year and a half of concerns, the fragrance industry eventually knows what are the new European Commission’s proposals regarding the protection of consumers from potential fragrance allergens: some substances will be prohibited and others will have to labelled. At the origin of the strong worries within the perfumery community was the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) dated 26-27 June 2012.  The SCCS then recommended – To add more than 50 fragrance components to the current list of 26 allergens that must be labelled on cosmetic products
– To limit the concentration of substances of special concern (twelve single chemicals and eight natural extracts) at 0.01% or 100 ppm in cosmetic products in order to prevent elicitation for the majority of individuals. Another cause for concern for perfumers: the SCCS recommendation to ban certain substances, some of them being used for years and in a huge number of perfumes. Eventually, the Commission proposals fall short of the SCCS recommendations, while being in line with its main axes: – The three substances which were found to be unsafe (HICC, atranol and chloroatranol) should be banned from cosmetic products, through the revision of Annex II of the European Cosmetics Regulation (EC No. 1223/2009).
– Additional allergens should be mentioned in the list of ingredients, in addition to the words ‘parfum’ or ‘aroma’, when their concentration exceeds 0.001% in leave-on products and 0.01% in rinse-off products. Thus, tree mosses should not be prohibited, but will have to be purified so as not to contain prohibited molecules. Regarding the twenty substances of “special concern”, the Commission does not provide direct answer but opens the door to the adoption of thresholds, using the QRA approach. [1] “We broadly welcome the proposed measures,” said Pierre Sivac, President of the International Fragrance Association (IFRA).  “The Commission has devoted a great deal of effort to assess all the aspects of this issue and we think that the measures are relevant and will be effective.” However, IFRA says to be concerned that the extension of the current labelling of allergens “may not improve the level of information for consumers already sensitized.”  The organisation, which represents the fragrance industry, considers that combining meaningful labelling and additional information through a website could have been more effective. The Commission’s proposals are now open for public comments. Interested parties, including EU Member States, manufacturers of cosmetic products, producers of fragrances and consumers associations, may send their comments by 14th May at the latest. Taking the consultations into account, the proposed changes to the Cosmetics Regulation in the form of an implementing act will be subject to a vote by the Member States in the standing Committee on Cosmetics. Once the measures are approved by the Member States, the European Parliament and the Council will have three months to exercise their right of scrutiny. If the proposal is not opposed the formal adoption of those changes is expected at the end of 2014/beginning 2015."
Japan and the USA under pressure to end animal testing for cosmetics,"While testing cosmetics and their ingredients on animals is now prohibited in the European Union, India, Israel and in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, over 80% of the world - including the United States - still allows animals to be used in experiments for cosmetic products.  To change the situation, Cruelty Free International, the leading animal rights association fighting against vivisection, has partnered with The Body Shop to collect the signatures of consumers and supporters in more than 65 countries including Japan, the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Russia.  Customers of The Body Shop stores were asked to sign a pledge calling for an end to tests on animals for cosmetic purposes, and about one million signatures were collected. Last week, Cruelty Free International, Japan Anti-Vivisection Association (JAVA) and The Body Shop called on Japan to end the use of animals to test cosmetics. Dr Nick Palmer, Director of Policy with Cruelty Free International, was in Japan to help present a petition to the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare, Norihisa Tamura. ""In today’s Japan, some cosmetic companies have given up animal experiments in response to consumers’ appeals whilst others are still testing on animals. In order to improve such a confused situation without a level playing field for all companies, the Japanese government should proactively introduce into its policies the new ethical value to promote the abolition of animal testing,"" explained JAVA Executive Director, Yuichi Hasegawa. According to Dr Nick Palmer, Mr Norihisa Tamura, said that it was now clear that the global trend was away from animal testing for cosmetics. The Minister of Health still saw difficulties in an early Government initiative but encouraged members of the Diet [Japanese Parliament] to bring forward suggestions. “The meeting was an important step. Up to now, Japan has not engaged with us on the issue so we very much welcome Mr Tamura acceptance that the problem needs to be tackled. We look forward to a constructive dialogue on the way forward,” Dr Palmer commented. As far as the U.S.A. is concerned, representatives from Cruelty Free International and The Body Shop met with Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) to discuss the petition. Mrs Schakowsky is the leading legislator working on cosmetics regulation reform in the United States. “We appeal the to the United States Government to listen to the collective voice of one million people and start putting plans in place to end these experiments and prevent further unnecessary suffering for thousands of animals,” said Cruelty Free International Chief Executive, Michelle Thew."
Sao Paulo to ban animal testing for cosmetics,"Bill 777/2013 prohibiting the use of animals in testing and experiments performed for the development of cosmetics, toiletries, fragrances and their components, was signed on Thursday the 23rd of January by, Geraldo Alckmin, governor of the State of Sao Paulo. This project had already been approved by the Sao Paulo Parliament, at a special session on 11 December. Before signing the law, Governor Alckmin met all stakeholders, including animal rights advocates, representatives of the cosmetics industry, and scientists etc.  ""We have screened all aspects related to this issue, including international law, and heard all sectors,” explained Geraldo Alckmin. For their part, animal advocates warmly welcomed this decision, the first of its kind in Latin America, which will be enforced in the most populous and mst industrialized Brazilian state, where most of the country’s cosmetics production is located.  “We congratulate the Parliament and Governor Alckmin on their progressive decision and call on other state governments and the national government to follow their example,” stated Cruelty Free International’s representative in Brazil, Frank Alarcón. According to the new law, any violation by an institution or research centre could be fine one million reais (about 305,000 euros or 415,000 US dollars) per animal. The amount of the fine will be doubled in case of new offense and the establishment may be closed. Fines may also be imposed on concerned physical persons. The new law (No. 15316 of 23 January 2014) came into force on the 24th of January 2014, the day of its publication in the official journal of the state of Sao Paulo."
No more methylisothiazolinone in leave-on cosmetics,"Following a surge of dermatological consultations resulting from allergic reactions to methylisothiazolinone (MIT), the dermatology community recently alerted public authorities and the industry about the risks linked to the presence of this substance in cosmetics.  For instance, a study released at the British Association of Dermatologists’ Annual Conference, which was held in Liverpool in July 2013, showed a sharp rise in contact allergy to the MCI/MI [1] mixture and to MI alone over the past three years. In the wake of these reports, the European Commission proposed to amend Annex V of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 on cosmetic products in order to limit the use of the MCI/MI mixture and MI alone. However, Cosmetics Europe recommends companies do not wait for regulatory intervention under the Cosmetics Regulation but stop using MIT in leave-on skin products as soon as feasible.  The European trade association says that industry experts have concluded there was evidence to suggest a relationship between the use of leave-on skin products, including cosmetic wet wipes containing MIT, and the induction of contact allergy and allergic contact dermatitis. “Following close analysis of clinical data, market feedback and Quantitative Risk Assessment analysis, Cosmetics Europe has concluded that the discontinuation of MIT use in leave-on skin products would result in a significant decrease in the incidence of sensitisation to this ingredient,” explains Cosmetics Europe. MIT was introduced to the market as a cosmetic preservative in 2006, and since then has been widely used due to its broad spectrum preservation properties.  However, this substance was previously used in combination with chloromethylisothiazolinone under the trade name Kathon-CG. Once widely and commonly used, Kathon-CG was gradually abandoned and its use restricted to certain rinsed off products such as shampoos. Kathon-CG has been gradually replaced by parabens, which had the advantage of being much more tolerated. As a consequence, parabens were present in nearly 70% of cosmetic products, until their safety was questioned. Allergenic problems linked to preservatives have led some cosmetic manufacturers to look for non-chemical alternatives to protect their formulations, including new formulation concepts, sterilisation processes or protective packaging. Experts will take stock of the latest innovations in this field at a conference organised by Premium Beauty News in Paris on January 23, 2014."
"France: about 500,000 tons of nanomaterials placed on the market","Approximately 500,000 tons of nanomaterials have been placed on the French market in 2012. This figure is the result of the mandatory “census” required by the law.  A first report, based on the data collected during the census was released by the French Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy. ""This is the first time that all manufacturers, distributors or importers of substances in a nanoparticle size - a billionth of a meter length scale - must declare the uses and the annual quantities produced, imported and distributed on French territory,"" says the Ministry. The first series of declarations, covering the year 2012, was collected via a dedicated web site [1].  In total, more than 930 registrants have made more than 3400 declarations. Of these 500,000 tons, 280,000 tons were produced in France and 220,000 tonnes were imported. Cosmetics and personal care products represent 6.1 % of reported uses, ranking in the third position of identified uses, behind the formulations (mixtures) of preparations and / or re-packaging (19.6% of all declarations), coats and paints, solvents, thinners (8.1%). Despite difficulties in accurately identifying reported substances, the report includes a list of the substances for which the largest quantities (over 100 tonnes) were declared. The list is topped by: carbon black, silicon dioxide, calcium carbonate, titanium dioxide and aluminum oxide. As far as the industry is concerned, the Union of Chemical Industries (UIC) emphasized the strong mobilization of chemical manufacturers, despite practical difficulties with the collection system, but expressed its concerns regarding ""the impact of this initiative on the chemical industry in France."" “So far, France is the only country in the world that has implemented a mandatory declaration, while regulations concerning chemicals are almost exclusively developed at the European level, at least,"" said Jean Pelin, Director General of the UIC. A second report will be published in January 2014."
Animal testing: Asia shows growing interest for alternatives,"Last February, Shiseido was the first among the leading Asian cosmetic companies to announced its will to eliminate on animal tests in line with the European ban.  “Shiseido does not test its cosmetic products on animals, under any circumstances. As for cosmetic ingredients, we do not conduct animal testing save for exceptional cases where it is required by law, or where there are absolutely no other alternative methods (…). Shiseido’s goal is to eliminate ‘animal testing’ for cosmetics, rigorously working to ensure the safety of cosmetics, in order that our customers can feel safe to use them, while paying full respect to animal protection as well. Shiseido shall proactively seek the abolition of animal testing in line with EU regulations,” the company explains. A few weeks later, Shisieido’s Korean competitor, Amore Pacific, made a similar announcement.  “Amore Pacific is responding to the wishes of our consumers,” said the company.  “We look forward to the time when there will be a global agreement to end animal testing for cosmetics.” On this issue, the views of the industry leaders have changed dramatically. Now that the full ban on animal testing is implemented in Europe, China’s maintained obligation to test cosmetics on animals is seen as both an unnecessary burden and a barrier to market access. And it is also viewed as a risk for the brands’ image.  Thus, a number of companies have refused to sell cosmetics in China until it becomes possible to do so without animal testing. “Traditionally, animal protection groups and industry have been on different sides in the debate over cosmetic regulation. However, with the China FDA consultation in progress, our sister organisation Cruelty Free International has adopted the innovative approach of a joint submission with leading European companies keen to avoid mandatory animal testing in China,” commented Cruelty Free International in a release. Thus, companies such as The Body Shop, L’Occitane, Montagne Jeunesse and Marks and Spencer have joined forces with the animal rights activists to try to change the Chinese regulations. Apparently, these pressures are producing effects gradually. The Chinese government, which until recently was hardly concerned with this issue, has repeatedly expressed there was no objection in principle to a regulatory change. After a first step consisting in the recognition of some alternative methods, the Chinese authorities have recently announced that the reform of the regulation governing cosmetic products would address this issue. The Chinese authorities have invited input from industry and other interested parties in a review of cosmetics regulation, with new proposals expected by the end of the year. China does not make a commitment to alternatives, but animal rights groups see it as an opportunity to press for positive change.   “This is the first review of Chinese policy in the area for a quarter of a century and we are eager to seize the opportunity,” says Cruelty Free International’s Chief Executive Michelle Thew. The Humane Society International also confirmed recently that Korea is to develop its first national centre of excellence for the development and validation of alternatives to animal testing. With 166 billion Korean Won (USD 145 million) allocated to the project, the centre is expected to be completed by 2016. It will focus on developing new microbial, cell, tissue and in silico approaches that can replace, reduce or refine the use of tests on animals. This change of attitude on the part of Asian authorities is more than the expression of a sudden and new attention to animal welfare. The overall aim is also to ensure the competitiveness of local industries towards regulatory developments in Europe in both the cosmetics and chemical fields (REACH)."
The hassle of importing cosmetics into China,"Along the years, the organization system of regulatory offices has been quite modified with a growing involvement of the China Food & Drug Administration (CFDA) in the cosmetics industry. It has more and more replaced the role of the Hygiene Bureau and consequently has increased the importance of toxicology and concern on impacts for consumer safety. Similarly the involvement of the powerful AQSIQ (General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine) has been increasing with recent scandals on food industry, leading to a strengthening role of the ministerial-level agency in control of cosmetics companies. As AQSIQ also administrates the Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau as well as the Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision, the respective roles of these two provincial-level entities have also grown in importance. All these constraints have been an increasing problem, in particular for small and medium size companies that have more difficulties to overcome the extra-costs. However, the worst impact of these regulations seems to be on manufacturers and importers of cosmetic ingredients.  Indeed, the list of officially approved ingredients is not that much comprehensive, compared to international practices. Furthermore, as any new ingredient (i.e. which is not in the list approved by Chinese authorities) needs to pass through a very long registration process, the whole system appears a huge barrier for players of the cosmetic ingredients industry, in particular when innovation is at stake. For new comers, the barrier is high and entering into the Chinese market is not always the best strategic option. While procedures are longue and burdensome for cosmetic products that are made in China, it appears that in practice the hassle is much stronger for imported products and registration then becomes a major issue. The 5-year plan voted last year is focusing on domestic consumption, with the aim to support the Chinese industry.  The context is not favourable to imported products.  These politics have a real and strong impact on the business timeline the approval of imported cosmetic products is usually going through at the national level in Beijing, while the registration of domestic products is performed at the regional level. For a brand, the whole registration process would require one year in average for new products with a new formula, in particular due to the toxicology tests that must be performed in China. Such a delay may lead to tricky situations, in particular for products that must be marketed quickly, especially on some special occasions such as Chinese New Year or the upcoming Singles Day on the next November 11th."
"Fragrance allergens: Is the ""worst case scenario"" away?","In an opinion published on July 31, 2012, the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety’s (SCCS) has recommended to add more than fifty fragrance components to the list of allergens that must be labelled on cosmetic products in order to inform sensitized persons that are keen to develop an allergic reaction to one of these substances.  However, the Committee did not stop there. The SCCS also considered that a level of exposure up to 0.8 μg/cm² (0.01% or 100 ppm in cosmetic products) would suffice to prevent elicitation from probable allergens for the majority of individuals. This very low limit, applied to relatively common substances in perfumes, triggered a worried reaction among the industry.  Especially as, at the same time, the Committee suggested a total ban of other substances such as hydroxyisohexyl 3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde (HICC) or chloroatranol and atranol. According to the representatives of the perfumery industry, should the limits and bans suggested by the Committee be enforced, most of existing perfumes (about 90%) and the major part of skincare products (78-88%) would need to be reformulated. The three actions suggested by the Committee - the prohibition of certain substances of particular concern, the restriction of use for a range of other substances, to limit the increase in allergies, and additional labelling requirements for better information of people already allergic - should remain in the draft regulation to be presented by the Commission in October. The perfume industry made several remarks, in particular regarding the 100 ppm threshold for probable allergens identified by the SCCS.  Instead of a maximum concentration applicable to all allergens and products, the industry would prefer a Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) calculation, namely a maximum allergen concentration for each allergen in a given product.  According to the industry, this would enable to better manage risk, to protect people who are not sensitized, while avoiding unnecessary restrictions. Regarding new labelling requirements, the representatives of industry and of Member States have deemed that the period of two years initially proposed by the Commission was too short. The Commission has confirmed that she was considering a possibility reconsider this delay. Questioned by MEP Gaston Franco, the European Commission confirmed in June that it was exploring the possibility of implementing the QRA method and that it would ask the CSSC to assess it suitability to serve as a basis for the development of future regulatory measures. While they prefer remain cautious, fragrance manufacturers hope their view will betaken into consideration by the Commission. Anyway, the text that will be presented in October will be the result of negotiations between the different stakeholders. The regulatory draft that will be presented in October will be submitted to public consultation during an 8 week period. Then the Commission will have the possibility to reshape its text again before submitting it to the European Parliament."
European Commission plans to restrict the use of MCI and MI,"Dermatologists, in particular in France and in the United Kingdom, have raised the alarm on a “contact allergy epidimedic” allegedly caused by two cosmetic ingredients, methylisothiazolinone (MI) and a mixture of methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI), used as preservatives in some cosmetic products as well as in certain household products. A study released at the British Association of Dermatologists’ Annual Conference, which was held in Liverpool in July, showed a sharp rise (up to 6.2 per cent sensitivity) in contact allergy to MCI/MI and MI over the past three years. [1] This was also reported by a team of researchers at St John’s Institute for Dermatology at St Thomas’ Hospital in London who had seen a rapid rise in contact allergy to MI in the last two years going from one case in 2010 to 33 cases in 2012. [2] According to the British Association of Dermatologists, other dermatology centres across the UK are also noticing rapid rises in numbers of acute allergic contact dermatitis related to MI exposure.  British researchers suspected that the recent use of MI as a single agent preservative in quantities up to 100 ppm in personal care products may be a major contributor to this outbreak of MI allergy. “Across the large patch test centres in the UK, data suggest that rates of allergy to these two preservatives are now nearing 10 per cent – and in some cases higher – this is clearly far too high and is an unacceptable situation,” said David Orton, President of the British Society of Cutaneous Allergy.  “The last time a preservative had this type of effect it was banned by the EU,” he added. In the wake of the release of these two study, reports in the British press also called for immediate ban on methylisothiazolinone. “This is a complex issue and the cosmetics industry is committed to working in partnership with dermatologists, the broader scientific community and regulatory authorities to find out what this means for the population at large and how it can be most effectively managed in a timely manner. Preservatives are essential in many consumer products, including cosmetics. Simply banning MI could have unforeseen consequences, so whatever action is taken it must be done with all the facts in front of us to ensure it is the most appropriate in the circumstances,” commented the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA), the voice of the cosmetic, toiletry and perfumery industry in the UK. For its part, the Commission proposed to amend Annex V of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 on cosmetic products in order to limit the use of the mixture of methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI) to rinse-off products and clearly indicate that the use of this mixture is incompatible with the use of methylisothiazolinone (MI) alone, because the 3:1 ratio in the mixture would be affected (see document here below). The proposed implementation dates are: six months, after the date of entry into force of the restriction, to place on the market compliant products, and twelve months, after the date of entry into force of the restriction, to withdraw from the market non-compliant products after the entry into force of this Regulation. Interested parties can send their comments regarding the proposed ruling to the European Commission by mail or e-mail by 8 October 2013 at the latest."
The European cosmetics regulation enters into force,"As of today, cosmetics marketed in the European union [1] must be fully compliant with the cosmetics regulation [2] replacing the Directive that was applicable so far. “For the first time, the world’s largest personal care market of more than 500 million consumers will be served by a single, harmonised piece of legislation, directly applicable in all the Member States of the European Union. The regulation both gives consumers a uniform level of protection in a single market, and brings unprecedented clarity for industry,” commented Bertil Heerink, Director-General of Cosmetics Europe, the trade association representing the European cosmetics and personal care industry. Indeed, unlike a directive, a European regulation does not need to be transposed into the law of Member State: it is directly and immediately applicable. In short, everyone must comply with it in the same way. According to Neven Mimica, European Commissioner for Consumer Policy, the regulation makes “enforcement easier, bringing greater peace of mind and confidence in the products purchased."" The Cosmetics Regulation provides more accurate definitions of certain existing legal provisions, reproduces the previous requirements and also adds new one. The main changes are: – Strengthened safety requirements for cosmetic products: As of today, manufacturers need to follow specific requirements in the preparation of a product safety report prior to placing a product on the market. 
– Introduction of the notion of “responsible person”: Only cosmetic products for which a legal or natural person is designated within the EU as ‘responsible person’ can be placed on the market. The new Cosmetics Regulation allows the precise identification of who the responsible person is and clearly outlines the obligations. The responsible person must also keep the product information file, including the safety assessment of the product, available and up-to-date in case of inspection of the national market surveillance authorities.
– Centralized notification of all cosmetic products placed on the EU market: Manufacturer will need to notify its product only once - via the EU Cosmetic Products Notification Portal (CPNP), which has been started several months ago. The information stored in the portal will allow the personnel of national Anti-Poison Centres to access the composition of the products within seconds, in case of accidents, and the competent authorities to easily access information on all the cosmetic products placed on the EU market for market surveillance purposes. 
– Introduction of reporting of serious undesirable effects: a responsible person will have an obligation to notify serious undesirable effects to competent national authorities. The authorities will also collect information coming from e.g. users and health professionals, and will be obliged to share the information with other EU Member States.
– New rules for the use of nanomaterials in cosmetic products: Colorants, preservatives and UV-filters, including those that are nanomaterials, must be explicitly authorized. Products containing other nanomaterials not otherwise restricted by the Cosmetics Regulation will be the object of a full safety assessment at the EU level, if the Commission has concerns. Nanomaterials must be labelled in the list of ingredients with the word ’nano’ in brackets following the name of the substance, e.g. ""titanium dioxide (nano)"". In addition, a new Commission Regulation adopted yesterday sets out common criteria for cosmetic claims [3] (here below). Manufacturers wanting to put a claim on their product, e.g. ""48 hrs efficiency"" for deodorants, will have to follow six common criteria: legal compliance, truthfulness, evidential support, honesty, fairness and informed-decision making. National competent authorities will be able to check claims against these criteria."
Commissioner Borg sees “first signs of acceptance of alternative methods in China”,"Following a four-day visit to China, where he took part in several high-ranking meetings focusing among others, on product safety, medical devices, cross-border health threats and cooperation in the area of animal diseases control and anti-microbial resistance, EU Commissioner Tonio Borg said he also used his stay “as an opportunity to have an exchange with the Chinese authorities on the European ban on animal testing for cosmetics, which applies fully since 11 March 2013.” Indeed, testing cosmetics on live animals is still legally required in China and this strong divergence of legal requirements poses difficulties to the both Chinese and the European cosmetics industry. “I have encouraged the Chinese authorities to avoid unnecessary testing for cosmetics. There are many areas where animal testing can be replaced, for example, where the proof of safety can be based on ingredients. In this case, the respect of animals as well as the costs of animal tests speak in favour of not doing them,” said Commissioner Borg.  “I see first signs of acceptance of alternative methods in China which I welcome very much,” he added. According to Mr. Borg, acceptance by Chinese authorities of OECD validated alternative methods “is clearly key to limit animal testing for cosmetics internationally.” “I invited the Chinese authorities to work in closer cooperation with the EU Joint Research Centre in the area of alternative methods. Here we have already had first promising contacts. In the same vein, I have also welcomed China’s participation as an observer at the next meeting of the International Cooperation on Cosmetics Regulation, aiming for acceptance of validated alternative methods at international level.” Borg’s statements were warmly welcomed by animal-rights organisations.  “Commissioner Borg’s intervention is hugely significant, and paves the way for further progress towards ending cosmetics animal testing worldwide. China, unlike other markets, requires animal testing for cosmetics products already safely on sale in the EU and elsewhere, so the Commissioner’s statement is particularly welcome,” commented Humane Society International’s Be Cruelty-Free Campaigns Director, Troy Seidle."
Serious Adverse Effects: “The implementation of specific procedures is essential”,"Premium Beauty News - What is the situation like in Europe today in terms of cosmetovigilance? Nedjwa Abbadi - Currently the amended Directive 76/768/EEC governing the placing on the market of cosmetic products in the member countries of the EU, does not provide for a harmonised cosmetovigilance system. No one can deny that the situation is quite disparate depending of countries mainly because of Member States regulatory specificities. In some countries, like France, Portugal and Norway, a cosmetovigilance system is formalized and formally implemented. In other countries, it is in the process of being implemented, this is the case in the Netherlands, Italy and Spain. Elsewhere, a simple system of incentives for the declaration is effective for health professionals and manufacturers, with no real formal framework. This is the case in Belgium, Ireland, Sweden or Denmark. Premium Beauty News - But this should change as of 11 July 2013 with the entry into force of the Regulation 1223/2009? Nedjwa Abbadi - Indeed! Firstly, the new Regulation defines what is meant by “adverse” and “serious adverse reaction” [1] and, mostly, clarifies the obligations of the responsible person for placing on the market and of the distributors in the occurrence of such events and also the obligations of Member States. As this new regulatory framework is now supported by a Regulation and no longer, as was the case until now, by a Directive, these obligations will apply uniformly to all operators inside the EU and the European Economic Area. Upon entry into force of the Regulation, people will have to comply with these new rules. They will be directly applicable, It is no longer a question, as before, of “transposition” by Member States. Premium Beauty News - And what are these new requirements? Nedjwa Abbadi - Article 23 of the new Regulation requires that the responsible person and the distributors notify certain information to the authorities in the occurrence of serious adverse effects. They must describe these effects, indicating the name of the cosmetic product(s) concerned – so that it/they may be identified – and specify the corrective actions taken, if any. These new obligations complement those already provided for in the amended Directive 76/768/EEC, which are to make easily available to the public, the existing data on the undesirable effects. Premium Beauty News - How can this be organized in practice? Emmanuelle Amsler - This is the tricky bit! The management of serious cases requires both skills and the setting up of specific procedures that must complement those used in “classic” cases of cosmetovigilance. This is not specific to serious cases, but of course the feedback on these cases will need to be organized. People will also need – and this is new – to be very reactive because the deadline for reporting serious cases is only of 20 calendar days from the time when any person in the company is informed of the case. Finally, the person will need to be able to decide on the seriousness of a case and have sufficiently documented it to then fill in a notification form and send it to the competent authorities of the country of occurrence. If we focus on what is meant by severity, the regulation defines severe cases according to 6 criteria: temporary or permanent functional incapacity, disability, hospitalization, congenital anomalies, immediate vital risk or death. However, the exact definition for some of these criteria remains unclear. Let’s take for example, temporary functional disability, how can it be considered in an objective and reproducible way? How to judge a functional disability in a pensioner, a school child or a housewife?  Even sick leave is not easy to handle because there are some variations depending of the labour law and health systems in the different European countries. About hospitalization, it is quite clear that a simple visit to the hospital emergency service is not within its scope, but is there a clear definition of hospitalization for all countries concerned by the Regulation? The reporting of information, for serious cases, is important. The possible entry doors need to be identified for consumers, educate and inform the teams involved in the detection of the level of seriousness (which needs to be clearly differentiated from severity) because they will be the first links in the chain. Another issue is to be able to properly qualify these events. With of course the use of specific standardized questionnaires, but in the case of serious cases, the medical documents provided by consumers, and in their native language (medical certificates, hospitalization report, copy of the sick leave report, ...), will need to be decrypted! In summary, at this stage, brands will need to have organized themselves and anticipated the answers to some key questions: Who fills in and sends the form to the competent authorities? Who monitors the case? Who ensures the relationship with the authorities? Premium Beauty News - And at the distributor level? Emmanuelle Amsler - Indeed, they are subject to the obligation of notifying severe cases the same way as the responsible person. Distributors are in direct contact with consumers, we can imagine that in the event of problems it is to them that they will turn to spontaneously. They also need to organize and structure their relationship with the responsible person. Premium Beauty News - Some difference of opinion will certainly arise with authorities? Emmanuelle Amsler - It is indeed conceivable, depending on differences in experience in terms of cosmetovilance between the different EU Member States, for some differences of opinion in the assessment of cases, to occur. Today it is difficult to anticipate what is going to happen. There will certainly be a need to communicate/explain/argue in the case of divergence on a case. Premium Beauty News - What can you bring to brands? Emmanuelle Amsler - IRIS is a unique centre of vigilance which, with over 20 years of experience, offers assistance and support to brands in the investigation of their cases of cosmetovigilance. At the request of brands, we contact the consumers concerned to collect the relevant and specific data on the adverse effect reported. Then, depending on the case, we can propose a contact over the phone with a physician, or a consultation with a possible allergy investigation (tests with the product, and if necessary its ingredients). All this helps to document the case, an essential step in its appraisal. Once the investigation is completed, an internally validated conclusion by a physician is sent to the brand. This document specifies in particular the diagnosis for the presented reaction, if it is possible to make one, and the evaluation of the accountability between the use of the product and the adverse effects reported. With the new Regulation, and the management of severe cases, this mission is still topical and IRIS has complemented its services to assist brands in their regulatory obligations, particularly by making an assessment on the severity and by helping them to fill the notification forms."
European Union: Full ban on animal testing for cosmetics enters into force,"The European Commission has announced, in a communication adopted today, the entry into force of the full marketing ban of cosmetic products for which test on animals have bee performed. Testing finished cosmetic products on animals has been prohibited in the European Union (EU) since 2004, as with animal testing of ingredients since 2009. In addition to these prohibitions, after March 2009 there has been a marketing ban on selling cosmetic products within the EU containing ingredients that have been tested on animals after this date, irrespective of the place of testing. However, some very complex tests [1], for which there is currently no alternative method available, the deadline for the marketing ban was extended to 11 March 2013. According to European Commissioner in charge of Health & Consumer Policy, Tonio Borg, this decision “gives an important signal on the value that Europe attaches to animal welfare.” The European Commission deemed that, despite the difficulties linked to the lack of alternative methods for replacing certain of the tests that are required to ensure the safety of consumers, maintaining the 2013 marketing ban was preferable to the other options: postponing it or introducing a derogation mechanism for innovative ingredients with a significant added value to consumer health, well-being and/or the environment. “This is in line with what many European citizens believe firmly: that the development of cosmetics does not warrant animal testing” the Commission says.  “If product safety cannot be demonstrated the product simply cannot be placed on the market,” it adds. In the same time, the Commission intends “to continue supporting the development of alternative methods and to engage with third countries to follow our European approach.” The Communication published today outlines the Commission’s contribution to the research into alternative methods and the recognition that these efforts must be continued. The Commission has made about 238 million euros available between the years 2007 and 2011 for such research.  The cosmetics industry has contributed as well, for example by co-funding with EUR 25 million the SEURAT1 research initiative, a five year research initiative, which was launched to develop a consistent strategy for the replacement of in vivo repeated dose systemic toxicity testing. In order to continue these efforts, the Commission will engage with stakeholders to define the research priorities going ahead and the best implementation instruments which, for example, could take the form of a new public-private partnership. Cosmetics Europe, the organisation representing the European cosmetics industry, said the entry into force of the marketing ban for cosmetic products containing ingredients tested on animals ignores the reality that science is not yet ready to bridge existing knowledge gaps and that non-animal alternatives cannot address all ingredient safety questions. “The ban acts as a brake on innovation for the European cosmetics industry while achieving little to improve global animal welfare,” claims the trade organisation in a release. “It is our hope that today’s deadline will provide the impetus for even greater collaboration between our industry’s scientists, regulators and the wider scientific community. This will be vital to address those challenging areas where non-animal tests are not yet available to assure safety. Since we will not compromise on safety, there will be innovations that will not be available to European consumers first in future,” commented Dr Chris Flower, Director-General of the CTPA, the UK cosmetic trade association. As far as animal welfare NGOs are concerned, comments were very positive.  “With the sales ban, the EU becomes the world’s largest cruelty-free cosmetics market,” said the Humane Society International in a release.  The organisation now aims at replicating the EU testing and sales bans around the world."
Animal testing: EU Commission confirms full ban will take effect in March,"The European coalition of leading animal protection organisations across Europe (ECEAE), the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) as well as Cruelty Free International and People for the Ethical treatment of Animals (PETA) have celebrated the achievement of their long-run campaign to end animal testing by the cosmetics industry in Europe. Indeed, the new commissioner for health and consumer policy, Tonio Borg wrote in a letter to animal testing campaigners, ""I believe that the ban should enter into force in March 2013 as Parliament and Council have already decided. I am therefore not planning to propose a postponement or derogation to the ban.""  Mr Borg also confirmed this position in a recent meeting with animal rights organisation in Brussels. As a consequence, the full ban should take effect in little more than a month, on the 11th of March 2013, as scheduled. “PETA has responded by sending a huge bouquet of flowers in thanks and is encouraging supporters to do the same,” said the organization in a release, and Cruelty Free International Chief Executive, Michelle Thew, said this is “the culmination of over 20 years of campaigning.” “We were aware - via the public calendar - that Commissioner Borg was meeting with a delegation from BUAV and other NGOs on Wednesday [January 30]. Such meetings are commonplace for European Commissioners,” said Colin Mackay, Communications Director at Cosmetics Europe, which represents the interests of the cosmetics industry in Europe.  “The confirmation of the ban has been in the public domain for some time, so from the perspective of Cosmetics Europe, this was not a notable development,” he added. Testing finished cosmetic products on animals has been prohibited in the European Union (EU) since 2004, as with animal testing of ingredients since 2009. In addition to these prohibitions, after March 2009 there has been a marketing ban on selling cosmetic products within the EU containing ingredients that have been tested on animals after this date, irrespective of the place of testing. However, some very complex tests [1] remain exempted from these various prohibitions until a general marketing ban comes into force in March 2013. While the cosmetics-testing ban has driven the development of non-animal testing methods, which can replace the use of animals in certain safety testing procedures, there are still important safety areas where alternative tests are lacking.   Last year, several European scientific committees have expressed doubts about the possibility to combine this final ban with the goal to reach the highest level of safety for consumers, in particular in emerging fields such as the use of nanoparticles in cosmetic products. So far, as no official text was issued to detail the conditions under which the full ban would enter into application, most of important questions for the industry therefore remain unsolved."
Animal testing: the future Commissioner commits to introduce full ban,"Questioned by members of the European Parliament on 13 November, the Maltese candidate gave its position on issues that will fall under its jurisdiction. The procedure is not a formality, in 2004 and 2010 MEPs have already obtained the withdrawal of candidates commissioners who failed to give appropriate answers to some of their questions. Cosmetics Europe, the trade association representing the cosmetics industry in Europe, said that prospective Commissioner Tonio Borg’s commitment to “conclude the introduction of the March 2013 ban without addressing the scientific reality or consumer needs is an issue of great concern.” “Our industry commitment to ending animal testing is solid and widely recognised, and we continue to invest heavily into finding viable alternatives. The cosmetics industry has been the engine of progress in this area. Mr. Borg’s comments therefore do not reflect the complexity or the reality of the issue, and will not further the cause of global animal welfare; rather it will undermine it,” commented Fabio Franchina, the President of Cosmetics Europe. Testing finished cosmetic products on animals has been prohibited in the European Union (EU) since 2004, as with animal testing of ingredients since 2009. In addition to these prohibitions, after March 2009 there has been a marketing ban on selling cosmetic products within the EU containing ingredients that have been tested on animals after this date, irrespective of the place of testing. However, some very complex tests [1] remain exempted from these various prohibitions until a general marketing ban comes into force in March 2013. Several European scientific committees have expressed doubts about the possibility to combine this final ban with the goal to reach the highest level of safety for consummers. On the contrary, animal advocacy groups have welcomed Mr Borg’s position. The British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) and the European Coalition to End Animal Experiments (ECEAE) said they agree with Tonio Borg’s comments that industry would not find alternative means of testing if the marketing ban is not implemented as “necessity is the mother of invention.” As it happens quite often on this issue, it has taken a political turn with several MEPs and political groups who included the respect of the March 2013 deadline as a condition of their vote in favour of Tonio Borg. The Conference of Presidents of the EU Parliament has set the date for the vote on Tonio Borg’s nomination for next Wednesday, 21st of November 2012."
China strengthens regulations governing cosmetics for children,"According to the directive recently published by the China’s State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) on its website (www.sfda.gov.cn), cosmetic products intended for children under 12 years of age will now have to comply with a list of specific criteria in order to get registered. The aim of the Guide for the Application and Review of Children’s Cosmetics is to standardise the application and technical review of children’s cosmetics aged of 12 or less.  The text specifies the scope of application, principles of formulation, safety of cosmetics, application requirements for children’s cosmetics and review principles. The text provides, in particular, that the packaging of the concerned products should be marked with a clear and unambiguous indication that they are intended for children. As far as ingredients are concerned, the text recommends avoid using, or use less, “resinoid, colouring agents, antiseptic and surface-active agents.”  Ingredients designed for skin whitening, for the lightening of freckles, for acne treatment, hair removal, for stopping perspiration, deodorising, or for hair waving and dying, or breast care and muscle enhancement are “not appropriate” in children’s cosmetics. The SFDA also provides that the manufacturers of such products should prefer substances with a long history of safe use. In particular, ingredients derived from with genetic or nano technologies should not be used. However, the new text remains vague on possible acceptable levels for these substances and does not mention any concentration limit. The risk assessment must take into account the particularities of children’s metabolism as well as the way products are used and substances contained in the formulation that are likely to promote skin penetration of ingredients. The presence of colonies of microorganisms in cosmetics for children is limited to 500 CFU/mL or 500 CFU/g. The SFDA will refer to these recommendations for the registration of products intended for children of 12 of age and under from the 1st February 2013. The text (in Chinese) of these guidelines is available here below or on the website of the SFDA: www.sfda.gov.cn"
"Customs Union Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan: placing cosmetics on the market","The Technical Regulation on the safety of cosmetic products TR TC 009/2011Adopted on 23 September 2011 by the Commission of the Customs Union (Decree No. 799). aims at a better harmonisation of requirements applying to cosmetic products in the member countries of the Customs Union - Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan - with the European rules [1].  Actually, the text that entered into force on the July 1, 2012, still contains a lot of specificities. As far as labelling is concerned, the Technical Regulation requires several additional constraints when compared to the rules of the European Union. These include: – The mention of the name and address of the company, registered in the territory of the Customs Union, responsible for the distribution of products,
– The indication of the shade (or the dye) for makeup and hair dye products,
– The indication of fluorine contents by weight, for oral hygiene products,
– The expiry date and the date of manufacture of the product,
– The Eurasian conformity mark. Regarding technical requirements, Regulation TR TC 009/2011 draws its inspiration from the European legislation (a negative list of substances that are prohibited in cosmetics, a restrictive list of substances which cosmetic products may contain only under certain conditions, and positive lists of the only substances that can be used in cosmetics as colour agents, preservatives or UV filters). However, the text also regulates the pH value of products, their microbiology and various other aspects not detailed in the European Directive 76/768 and its amendments, or in theRegulation (EC) No 1223/2009 which will replace the Directive from July 2013. Moreover, while for the majority of products a declaration of conformity is enough, the Technical Regulation TC TR 009/2011 also lists a number of products for which registration is still needed: – Self-tanners,
– Skin bleaching products,
– Products for tattoo,
– Hygiene products,
– Cosmetics for children,
– Hair dyes and professional products for hair perms and hair straightening,
– Hair removal products,
– Peels,
– Oral care products,
– Teeth whiteners. For these products, the registration is a prerequisite for the placing on the market. For imported products, it must be completed prior to clearance the Union’s customs. The registration procedure consists of three main steps: 1. Evaluation of the technical and administrative file provided by the manufacturer, which includes a Certificate of Free Sale, a GMP statement or the corresponding ISO certificate, the composition of products, labels or their draft in Russian signed and stamped by the manufacturer or an authorized representative of the manufacturer, samples, etc.. [2]
2. Toxicological testing and clinical trials in laboratories accredited according to the regulations of the Customs Union
3. The recording of the product’s and manufacturer’s data as well as test results in the single sanitary database of Customs Union; Then the registration certificate is issued, it is valid for the entire life of the product. For products that are not subject to registration, a declaration of conformity is sufficient. This can be done only by legal entities registered in Russia or in other countries of the Customs Union."
France to assess environmental information one year test,"The wish to require companies to provide the public with information on the environmental impact of their products has emerged in France during the ""Grenelle Environnement"", a set of negotiations between environmental NGOs and industry sectors, which aimed at modernising French environmental policies.  However, technical difficulties have led French authorities to start with an experimental phase, scheduled to last a minimum of one year, before deciding whether to go further, for instance by proposing to extend such a requirement at European level. A total of 168 companies, of which 8 cosmetics companies [1] , participated in the experimental phase, which was launched in July 2011.  ""The experiment focuses on both the product and the packaging,"" says Juliette Mélédié, Director of Economic, Environmental and International Affairs at the French Federation of Beauty Companies (FEBEA). France made the choice of a multi-criteria approach, not limited to Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and based on life cycle analysis (LCA) using calculation methods identical for each product category. As far as cosmetics are concerned, a standard for shampoos and shower gels was published on April 2011. The goals of the experimental phase are: to enable consumers to use environmental criteria for their purchasing decisions, to raise public awareness about the environmental impact of manufactured goods and to provide businesses with the opportunity to promote their environmental commitments. To simplify the way the information is communicated to the public, the French Consumer Industries Research Institute (ILEC) and its partners [2]have proposed to harmonise both the semantic and the logos. A full assessment of the first year of experimentation is in progress and will be submitted to the Parliament in early 2013. Juliette Mélédié emphasizes that the multi-criteria approach eventually proved relevant.  “In addition to greenhouse gas emissions, most often selected indicators include water and biodiversity.” Most companies chose to display the environmental information through the internet. ""Only one out three companies displayed the information on the product or on the point of sale,"" says Juliette Mélédié. According to Jean-Florent Campion, International Sustainable Development Manager at L’Oréal, the outcome of the participation of the French cosmetics giant in the experimentation - through its Garnier Ultra-Doux brand - is rather mitigated.  ""A total of 19 products, representing 10% of the French shampoo market, were involved in this testing phase."" The main difficulty, he said, was the lack of accurate data that implied using general databases.  ""In the event the display of environmental information would become a general requirement, it would be necessary to set up complex logistics and information systems.” Jean-Florent Campion also points out the uncertainties linked to the LCA method. Due to the lack of precision of the data used, the difference between two products would be significant only beyond 15 to 20%. In the case of Garnier products, the results were posted on the website of the brand. Studies conducted among consumers receiving news form the brand’s website showed a very good value given to the initiative and a good understanding of the information provided. However, a larger study conducted in partnership with Carrefour showed that the retailer’s customers, while being highly interested in the initiative, lack of confidence in the information provided to them and are only marginally influenced by it when it comes to purchasing shampoo. As far as L’Occitane - another participant in the experimentation phase - is concerned, the findings are quite similar. The brand conducted the test on a shea butter hand cream, since it has a good control and knowledge on the supply chain for this product. The environmental information was display on the brand’s website but also in its shops. ""It has been necessary to train the sales staff, to learn how to respond to customers’ questions, including providing practical advice,"" says Marielle Le Roux, Head of the Eco-Design Project, at L’Occitane en Provence. According to Marielle Le Roux, the main lessons learned from this experiment are the strong mobilization of the brand’s team, but in the end, only few feedbacks from consumers. ""The generalization of this requirement would involve improving the databases and methods that are currently available, but also clarifying the scope of the information to display,"" she says. Many technical and practical hurdles still have to be overcome before public authorities can actually consider generalizing the environmental information requirement. However, French and European governments are likely to support the continuation of efforts made towards this direction. More details available from the BeautyFull Club: www.beautyfullclub.com"
Lancôme stumbles over U.S. regulations,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the authority controlling drugs and cosmetics marketed in the United States, sent Lancôme a warning letter involving claims associated with a series of the brand’s skincare products [1]. The FDA says to have reviewed Lancôme’s US website and identified, for some products, a series of claims that are should not be considered as belonging to the cosmetic category. The U.S. agency gives some examples of claims that could be considered as litigious, for instance: ""Boosts the activity of genes and stimulates the production of youth proteins"", "" See significant deep wrinkle reduction in UV damaged skin, clinically proven"". According to the FDA, these claims are problematic because they imply that the concerned products are intended to affect the structure or any function of the human body, they are therefore pharmaceutical claims, according to the U.S. law. The agency also states that its warning letter is not an all-inclusive statement and that the brand is responsible for ensuring the compliance of all its products with all the U.S. regulations. Actually, what does the FDA reproach Lancôme is the nature of the claims. The agency does not question whether they are true or not. Indeed, as provided by the U.S. regulations and according to the FDA’s point of view, a product producing the effects claimed by Lancôme is not a cosmetic but a drug. Under U.S. law, drugs are defined as ""articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals; and articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals"". [2] In practice, the border between cosmetics and drugs is far from being as clear in the United States as it is within the European regulatory framework, and a claim considered as ""medical"" may be enough to switch from the first to the second category. In such a context, how to decide whether a product is a cosmetic, a drug, or both? Under the U.S. law, this is determined by a product’s intended use.  The type of claims stated on the product labelling, in advertising, on the Internet, or in other promotional materials, is the first tool used by the FDA to determine whether a product is a cosmetic or a drug. Consumer perception and ingredients in the product also have to be taken into account. The L’Oréal’s brand is not the first to stumble over the intricacies of the U.S. regulation that fundamentally differs from the legal framework in which European brands are used to work. Thus, one can find on the FDA’s website, a ""yellow list"" of all businesses to which the federal agency sent warnings due to the medical nature (under U.S. law) of their claims. Actually, most of the big names in the cosmetics business are listed, among any others. Before another name be dropped on the list, Lancôme has 15 days to submit the FDA with its arguments or the corrective measures it intends to take."
Morocco requires registration of cosmetic products,"Cosmetic products will now be subject to registration prior to their marketing on the Moroccan market. According to the Circular No. 48 DMP/20 published on August 17th by the Moroccan Health Ministry, cosmetic manufacturers or importers must now file a product registration application with the Direction du Médicament et de la Pharmacie (DMP). According to Moroccan Health Minister al-Hussein al-Ouardi, this text aims to protect the health of Moroccan consumers by guaranteeing the ""quality, efficiency, safety of use of the cosmetic and hygiene products available on the domestic marketplace."" The Minister also stated that this procedure was introduced on a temporary basis ""pending the enactment of a specific regulation in this area"". The circular sets out a number of general principles very similar to those of the EU Directive 76/768/EEC and also explicitly refers to the Annexes of this text. It thus provides that ""cosmetic products put on the market must not cause damage to human health when applied under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use, taking account, in particular, of the product’s presentation, its labelling, any instructions for its use and disposal as well as any other indication or information provided by the manufacturer or his authorized agent or by any other person responsible for placing the products on the market"". The circular prohibits the use in cosmetics of ""substances known to be carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction"". Furthermore, it also creates a Commission of Cosmetology in charge of examining registration applications and to advise the Minister of Health on all matters concerning the suspension, removal or prohibition of sale of cosmetics. To be registered, a cosmetic product shall comply with the requirements stated in the circular, particularly concerning its safety, composition and labelling. The manufacturer, packer or importer of the product must also have declared their activity and have some qualified staff in charge of quality control and of the evaluation of the products’ safety. The registration file consists of an administrative and of a technical part. In addition to the usual elements (corporate identity, product identification, etc.), the administrative part must also include a certificate of free sale and an acknowledgement letter from the poison control and pharmacovigilance centre. The technical part includes: the qualitative and quantitative composition of the product, the raw materials monographs and specifications, the microbiological specifications, the analytical results of the finished products, the name and addresses of the qualified and responsible persons, the claim substantiation, etc. Once issued, the marketing authorization is valid for 5 years.  The application for renewal must be submitted three months before its expiry date. The text of the circular can be read (in French or in Arabic) on the website of the Moroccan Ministry of Health: www.sante.gov.ma"
EU expert panel paves the way to a longer list of allergens requiring label disclosure,"In order to protect the secret of their composition, the fragrances used in cosmetics are exempted from the full labelling of their ingredients. With the exception of substances identified as potential allergens, all the ingredients in a perfume composition are therefore gathered under the terms ""parfum"" or ""aroma"".  To date, the list of substances identified as potential allergens includes 26 entries (including, Limonene, Eugenol, Cinnamal, Benzyl Benzoate, etc.).  These 26 fragrance ingredients must be labelled so as patients who know the cause of their allergy are able to avoid cosmetics that will cause reactions. According to the SCCS, the frequency of contact allergy to fragrance ingredients in the general population in Europe is 1-3%.  However, the real prevalence of contact allergy may be higher, as the testing is made with a limited number of ingredients out of the 2,500 fragrance ingredients listed in the European database of cosmetic ingredients. Thus, around 16% of eczema patients in the European population are sensitised to fragrance ingredients. In its new opinion, the SCCS lists fragrance ingredients that are established contact allergens in humans, based on results from human clinical and epidemiological evidence. The list includes the 26 ingredients already identified and an additional 30 individual chemicals and 26 natural extracts. Furthermore, the SCCS also lists fragrance allergens likely to cause allergies in humans and says that a level of exposure up to 0.8 μg/cm² (0.01% in cosmetic products) would suffice to prevent elicitation for the majority of allergic individuals. Based on the SCCS opinion, the Commission will now consider the appropriate regulatory measures and will likely extend the list of fragrance allergens required to be disclosed on cosmetic labels. The SCCS opinion is available at the following address: http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/docs/sccs_o_102.pdf"
New ISO standard to evaluate protection against UVA,"The standard ISO 24443:2012, Determination of sunscreen UVA photoprotection in vitro, gives specifications for an in vitro procedure to characterize the UVA protection of sunscreen products in accordance with a methodology defined. With the better understanding of the negative effects of UVA radiation, consumers have been warned about the risks sun exposure and regulations have been strengthened at a global level, leading consumers to develop large spectrum sunscreen products covering UVB and UVA as well. In particular, UVA rays play an important role in premature skin ageing linked to sun exposure.  “UVA rays are not as powerful as those of UVB, but they are more abundant and penetrate the skin to a greater depth. This then leads to a slackening of tissue, a loss of skin firmness and the appearance of wrinkles. These rays penetrate so deeply that they can lead to genetic changes, affecting DNA, and resulting in the onset of skin cancer. UVA is also responsible for triggering photosensitizations in reaction to the consumption of certain pharmaceuticals,” says ISO in a release. The new standard was developed by the ISO technical committee devoted to cosmetic products. “The trade in cosmetics between different countries is increasing. ISO 24443:2012 will be an important tool in improving the quality and safety of sunscreen products and facilitating their global trade. It will also help manufacturers to better respond to local requirements for sunscreen products and give better information to consumers,” comments Pr. Philippe Masson, Chair of the ISO group of experts that developed the standards. The standard ISO 24443:2012 is available from ISO national member institutes - such as BSI in the UK, ANSI in the USA, or SCC in Canada - as well as from the ISO Central Secretariat."
EU Scientific Committee warns on the impossibility to assess the risk of nanomaterials in cosmetics,"Cosmetics manufacturers may find themselves at an impasse when they seek to comply with two apparently clashing requirements in the cosmetics legislation. Indeed, the EU’s Cosmetics Directive [1], which will be replaced by the EU’s Cosmetics Regulation [2] as of July 11, 2013, has been phasing out animal testing progressively.  Testing finished cosmetic products on animals has been prohibited in the European Union (EU) since 2004, as with animal testing of ingredients since 2009. In addition to these, after March 2009 there has been a marketing ban on selling cosmetic products within the EU containing ingredients that have been tested on animals after this date, irrespective of the place of testing. However, some very complex tests [3] remain exempted from these various prohibitions until a full marketing ban comes into force in March 2013. In parallel, article 16 of the Cosmetics Regulation will impose strict conditions and timelines for the notification and the assessment of cosmetic products containing nanomaterials. Unfortunately, validated alternative methods that can be used to replace animal tests are only available for conventional substances, and not for nanomaterials.  “This poses an insurmountable obstacle to the safety assessment of cosmetic nanomaterials, and further research work is needed in this area,” says the SCCS in a recently published Guidance on the Safety Assessment of Nanomaterials [4]. The publication of this Guidance is aimed at providing scientific and technical information to cosmetics companies in order to comply with the requirements for safety assessment of nanomaterials intended for use their products. The document highlights that in view of the possible distinct properties, interactions, and/or effects that may differ from conventional form of the same materials, the safety assessment of nanomaterials requires special considerations. The SCCS considers that in the absence of a sufficient knowledgebase on nanomaterial properties, behaviour, and effects a category approach to risk assessment is currently not feasible, and risk assessment of each nanomaterial needs to be carried out on a case-by-case basis.  Material characterisation appears as the first step and as an essential requirement of risk assessment.  Then the SCCS suggests the process should be driven by considerations of exposure. Eventually, where application of a nanomaterial containing cosmetic product can lead to systemic exposure, data on toxicological evaluation will be required. It is precisely at this step that the current lack of alternative methods that are specifically validated for nanomaterials, combined with a complete ban on in vivo testing of cosmetic ingredients and products in 2013 “poses an obstacle to the risk assessment of cosmetic ingredients in general, and ingredients in nanomaterial form in particular,” says the SCCS. The Committee also insists on the fact that the field of nanomaterial risk assessment is still evolving and that its opinion is based on the currently available knowledge.  “The guidance may therefore be revised in the light of new scientific knowledge in the future.”"
"“Our goal is the safe enjoyment of fragrances for all,” Stephen Weller, IFRA","Premium Beauty News - Can you briefly picture IFRA’s missions? Stephen Weller - It’s a fact almost universally known that trade associations promote, protect and help the industry professionals they exist to serve.  In IFRA’s case, we not only have the role of promoting the industry but also of policing it.  This voluntary approach puts us in a difficult position and leads to misunderstanding of what we actually do. Premium Beauty News - Even within the industry? Stephen Weller - On one hand, those who know, or are members of, IFRA understand just how hard the organisation works to defend the industry and ensure safe use and enjoyment of fragrances. On the other hand are those who believe that, far from being defender of the industry, IFRA is spoiling the alchemy of the perfumer’s art by banning and limiting the use of certain materials. Premium Beauty News - Actually, some perfumers apparently consider that things are going too far.  They deem other options, less stringent than bans, could lead to similar results for the safety of consumers. Stephen Weller - IFRA has in fact delivered some very positive results. Far from banning certain materials, IFRA has in fact been protecting them from potential bans. A material such as oak-moss would have disappeared if it hadn’t been for IFRA. The EU would have abolished it. In fact, thanks to IFRA’s work, many materials are still capable of being utilised as part of the palette of more that 3000 materials which perfumers can employ in their creative art. There are restrictions on the use of some substances but these are justified when balanced with the safe enjoyment of fragrances for all. Premium Beauty News - Can you describe us IFRA’s self-regulation system ? Stephen Weller - It is important to understand the regulatory context in which all manufacturers of consumer products have to operate, not just the fragrance industry. The Scientific Committee for Consumer Safety (SCCS), the advisory group to the EU Commission, and other EU departments may sometimes receive representations from lobby groups including allergy experts and dermatologists, for instance, suggesting a ban or restriction of fragrance ingredients. When that occurs, IFRA and the Research Institute for Fragrance Materials - RIFM - review the data on the substances, gather views from perfumers and form a group to review the situation. If this review of safety data reveals a positive result then further detailed tests are undertaken to investigate the tipping point and establish the level at which the substance could be safely used by most people whilst also maintaining an adequate olfactory profile. The IFRA Scientific Committee reviews the findings of this research, makes recommendations and issues an IFRA Standard. IFRA recommends the parameters for safe usage. Premium Beauty News - A criticism we sometimes hear, is that IFRA is supporting large chemical manufacturers by banning natural substances. Stephen Weller - What makes IFRA a strong and respected organisation, is the fact that IFRA leads the way by issuing its carefully researched Standards. IFRA Standards, which recommend holding usage to a certain level are not mere guidelines; they are mandatory for IFRA members. The benefits are obvious - for consumers, retailers, manufacturers - right through the supply and usage chain. If an IFRA member develops a perfume, it is deemed safe across Europe and beyond. For global brands this has hugely important and positive implications. It also means that smaller operators and brands can rest assured on the safety of their products with regards to fragrance materials if they follow the Standards. For consumers and health professionals it provides a guarantee that the high safety standards are being adhered to. Finally for perfumers, creative as they are, a restriction shouldn’t have a dampening effect but could be expected to spur them into doing what they do best. All perfumers relish a creative challenge and should do so in a safe and assured fashion using materials from a palette of 3000 substances some of which, without the intervention of IFRA, might otherwise have been thrown out - forever. Far from being destroyers of the perfumer’s art, IFRA is very much a champion and protector. IFRA helps ensure that this wonderful, creative process can continue to be enjoyed both by the perfumers and by those whose lives are enhanced by the safe enjoyment of fragrances whether these scents are in fine fragrances or everyday household products. Here are some examples of materials that would have risked being banned [1] by the authorities if it were not for IFRA’s intervention: – Dimethyl Anthranilate (contained in mandarin oil)
– Furfural
– Furocoumarins (affecting all citrus oils containing higher levels of furocoumarins)
– Lyral
– Oakmoss
– Tagette (marigold)
– Tree moss (as affected as oakmoss)
– Verbena absolute
– Vetiveryl acetate"
"REACH: costs are soaring, but not the advantages","Despite its complexity (more than 800 pages for the Regulation itself and an extra 12,000 for the explanations), the implementation of the European Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemical substances. (REACH) was considered has a successful step, according to the Union of Chemical Industries, who tried in Paris on May 29, to draw an initial review of the first five years of application of the text. ""Thanks to a strong mobilization, French chemical manufacturers have adopted REACH"" stresses Jean Pelin, Director General of the UIC, ""but we must remain vigilant to ensure a pragmatic implementation of the regulation is done in order to preserve the competitiveness of our businesses"" he added. The great fear of the French representatives of the chemical industry is indeed the soaring costs associated to REACH. On this point, the Commission estimates were exceeded by a large margin. The latest study available evaluates at EUR 2.1 billion the implementation cost of the first registration deadline, while the cost for all three deadlines had initially been estimated to EUR 2.3 billion. It must be said that the regulation is not only complex, but it has also forced stakeholders to take up many challenges. Upon entry into force of the text, companies had to organize themselves to meet deadlines, in spite of a difficult start on the side the administration. Thus for the pre-registration process in 2008, some of the guidelines were not completed, the Commission having not ruled on some interpretations. As for the first registration phase, once again the deadlines were met, despite the difficulties of setting up the exchange forums (SIEF) and despite the legal and technical complexity of finalizing the registration dossiers. As the various aspects of the regulations unfold, manufacturers must assume new tasks. Since 2011, it is for example, the communication of exposure scenarios in supply chains, or the responses to the ECHA [1] assessments. In addition, the number of companies concerned continues to grow. The next two registration deadlines should concern more SMEs. As for companies downstream in the sector they shall be also concerned. Direct customers, of course, who must in particular provide some feedback on the ""specific uses"" they make of certain substances, but also companies that do not necessarily see themselves as users of chemical substances, who will have to declare the presence of substances of very high concern (known as ""candidate substances"") in finished products, when their concentration exceeds 0.1%. In an industry under severe competitive pressure where prices on high tonnage commodities are dependent of the global market, companies can hardly pass on these extra costs, which therefore impact directly their margins. If for the objective to improve the protection of human health and environment, ""progress is noticeable, in terms of improved knowledge in chemicals used in Europe,"" the UCI emphasises on the fact that REACH also aims to promote the competitiveness of companies. ""On this last point, chemical manufacturers find it difficult today to see the competitive advantages offered by REACH in the medium term,"" worry chemical industry representatives. Even the image of the chemical industry has not been substantially modified by the efforts made by manufacturers. If at the international level, many countries [2] are changing their regulation on chemicals, REACH remains unique today because of its ambitious objectives and broad scope. Thus for example the United States remains strongly opposed to a purely quantitative system based solely on the tonnages of substances. Worse, even within the European Union, the differing interpretations of the public authorities lead to distortion of competition. In such a context, the UCI stresses on the need for a stabilization of the regulatory framework. While the appraisal current conducted by the European Commission could, under the pressure from NGOs, lead to changes in the regulation, the UCI request that no changes are undertaken until all the objectives of REACH, including objective of competitiveness, have not been integrated."

China to approve non-animal cosmetics test,"According to the animal rights organization, scientists funded by its US branch have successfully guided Chinese officials towards the recognition of a first alternative method to animal testing. PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) was concerned that despite many cosmetics companies have pledged to cease any animal testing, they were nevertheless required to perform such tests in order to market their products in China.  PETA US thus awarded a grant to scientists at the Institute for In Vitro Sciences (IIVS) late last year, to meet Chinese officials and share their expertise and guidance. According to PETA, the 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Assay (3T3 NRU PT), an in vitro toxicological assessment test used to determine the cytotoxicity and photo(cyto)toxicity of chemicals when they come into contact with sunlight, is scheduled to be accepted in China by late summer.  This test method was adopted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2004 and is already in wide use in the US and the European Union. ""Fast, accurate non-animal methods which protect humans better than animal tests are already here, and it’s great news that China has responded positively to the scientific arguments supporting them,"" says PETA policy adviser Alistair Currie. Last year, Chinese health authorities had already shown their interest in alternative testing methods through a seminar initiated and organised by the China Cosmetics Research Centre of the Beijing Technology and Business University.  On this occasion, members of the cosmetics industry and the scientific community in Europe and the US had shared the expertise and initiate discussions with China on this issue.  Beijing’s main concern was to fill the gap between Chinese legal requirements and European laws that ban animal testing for cosmetics and their ingredients and have scheduled to prohibit the sale of all cosmetics containing ingredients tested on animals in 2013."
Tax on cosmetics: French trade association claims a first victory,"The FEBEA has obtained from the Council of State, the highest administrative court in France, the recognition of an additional six month delay to undertake the declaration formalities which will serve to calculate the tax amount per company. The Law on the tax passed in December 2011 concerns companies subject to VAT who are placing on the French market for the first time, cosmetic products, after they were manufactured or after they importation. Simply put, manufacturers and importers who market in France finished cosmetic products, but also subcontractors who transfer the ownership of finished cosmetic products - which excludes, the FEBEA believes , ""those who only provide occasionally some services ( contract manufacturing, packaging, conditioning)."" The declarations formalities that must fulfil the concerned companies consist in two main steps: – The declaration with the tax authorities of the tax amount to pay, which is done at the same time as the VAT declaration, on the same document,
– The declaration with the ANSM (National Security Agency of Medicines and Health Products, the successor to the AFSSAPS) of the turnover achieved the previous year, i.e., 2011 for this year. Details on the modalities of the declaration with the Agency, that companies were asked to submit no later than March 31, 2012, having only been released on March 23 (8 days only before the time-limit for the filing), the FEBEA initiated proceedings for interim suspension with the Council of State, while negotiating with the Agency so that no penalties would be applied until April 30 in the case of absence of declaration. ""A misdeclaration or an absence of declaration, would have been subject to heavy fines (up to 45,000 euros) - this would have caused irreparable harm to many VSBs-SMEs in our industry,"" explained the Federation. Alain Grangé Cabane, President of the FEBEA, personally pleaded the case of the industry at a hearing on April 24th. Finally, through a summary judgement issued on Monday 30 April, the Council of State officially confirmed the necessity and validity of a further period of six months (until September 30 2012) to enable companies to fulfil their declaration. According to the FEBEA, the granting of this extended deadline will enable ""companies who had not declared yet, to take the necessary time to complete this declaration and hand it out to the Agency, and to those who, feeling they had responded to swiftly under time pressure, to make the necessary corrections."" The granting of this additional time period does not prejudge however, the outcome of other proceedings against the tax undertaken by the representatives of the French cosmetics industry. At the FEBEA officials say they are ""fully mobilized for the future..."""
Three proposals compete to amend U.S. cosmetics legislation,"Following a historical hearing last March before the House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee on the safety of cosmetic products, there are now three legislative proposals circulating to amend federal rules governing cosmetic products in the United States. The original one (“The Safe Cosmetics Act,” H.R. 2359) was introduced last year by Representatives Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), Ed Markey (D-MA), and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI).  This text targets substances known to have carcinogenic effects and to be toxic for the reproduction.  It is supported by the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, and several other consumer, public health, medical and environmental advocacy groups. At the end of March, Representatives Frank Pallone (D-NJ) and John Dingell (D-MI) introduced the “Cosmetics Safety Enhancement Act” (H.R. 4262). Among other proposals, the bill suggests granting recall authority to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Eventually, a third legislative proposal, the “Cosmetic Safety Amendments Act of 2012,” H.R. 4395, was introduced by Representative Leonard Lance (R-NJ) and is supported by the professional organisations representing U.S. beauty and personal care companies - namely the Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors Association (ICMAD), the International Fragrance Association North America (IFRA), Professional Beauty Association (PBA), Direct Selling Association (DSA), and the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC), all members of the Safe Cosmetics Alliance. “FDA regulation of cosmetics has protected the public for decades, and this landmark legislation will enhance protections for millions of American consumers,” said Lezlee Westine, the Council’s president and chief executive officer, about the latter bill. “Cosmetics companies recognize the need for a modern regulatory process that keeps pace with product innovation, as well as the demand for transparency.” Representative Lance’s bill calls for increased reporting and transparency by the industry. The legislation aims to create formal processes for the FDA to review ingredients for safety, set safety levels for trace impurities, create national uniformity for cosmetics regulations, review all safety determinations made by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel and establish industry-wide “Good Manufacturing Practices.” “We look forward to working with Congressman Lance on this legislation,” added Westine.  “We also look forward to working on a bipartisan basis with Congressmen Pallone and Dingell on legislation that updates FDA regulation of cosmetics and enhances consumer protections.” Similar comments from ICMAD President and CEO Pam Busiek, who considers “this bill is a major step forward in increasing transparency at the FDA.” Oppositely, Janet Nudelman from the Breast Cancer Fund, said that “essential public health protections could be set back another 70 years if industry gets away with writing its own laws that put industry profits over public health.”  Nudelman stressed the need for a reform that includes: phasing out cosmetic ingredients linked to cancer, and reproductive or developmental toxicity; a safety standard that protects workers, babies and other vulnerable populations; full disclosure of ingredients and FDA authority to recall dangerous products from the market - all of which are elements of the Safe Cosmetics Act of 2011 (H.R. 2359)."
"""The tax on the cosmetic industry is unconstitutional,"" Alain Grangé-Cabane, FEBEA","The tax on companies that manufacture or import cosmetics and who market them in France was adopted at the end of last year (between Christmas and New Year’s Day), to everyone’s surprise, and after two unsuccessful attempts in 2009 and 2010. ""A law which was passed on the fly,"" observes Alain Grangé-Cabane for whom, beyond the financial burden for businesses, the ""moral"" damage must not be overlooked, for an industry for whom it is implied that its products require a specially close monitoring. ""Usually when a specific industrial sector is taxed, it is because it is considered a source of nuisance or a danger to health, explains AlainGrangé-Cabane, which is obviously not the case for our industry or its products.""

According to Government’s estimates, the tax passed last year, with a rate set at 0.1% of the turnover of the concerned companies, should yield between 8 and 10 million euros. Not enough to really relieve the budget of the State, but enough to exasperate an industrial sector, which comprises numerous SMEs, at a time when it must already manage the cost of a transition towards a new regulation.

""Especially since the implementation of this tax is particularly heavy,"" adds Alain Grangé-Cabane. ""Two declarations must be made, one for fiscal purposes, the other for sanitary purposes, with the AFSSAPS [1], for whom companies must disaggregate their turnover into 86 categories, indicating for each of them the number of products sold to the nearest unit. This makes little sense and represents a considerable work load for many companies.""
 But it is precisely this second declaration that offers the FEBEA the possibility to counterattack, by seizing the newly offered possibility for French people appearing before the courts to challenge the constitutionality of laws which are opposed to them. ""Since the constitutional reform of 23 July 2008, it has indeed become possible to challenge the compliance with the Constitution of a law already in force,"" explained Alain Grangé-Cabane, who is also a former member of the Council of State. According to the new Article 61-1 of the Constitution, this is only possible ""on the occasion of a pending lawsuit before a court.""

""In practice, we only had two options,  points out the President of the FEBEA. Either wait until a dispute arises between a cosmetic company and public authorities on this tax and take the opportunity to challenge the law, but this could have taken several years. Or, and that’s what we did, challenge before the administrative court the decision of March 22, 2012 taken by the Director of the AFSSAPS determining the model of this declaration to his body and attach to this appeal a Priority Question of Constitutionality (Question Prioritaire de Constitutionnalité - QPC).  ""

In support of its request, the FEBEA puts two arguments forward. First, the law establishing the tax on the cosmetic industry leads to a breach of equality in relation to public burdens. The funds collected will be in effect, according to the FEBEA, much higher than those really needed by the AFSSAPS to carry out its supervising task of the cosmetics market. In practice therefore, the cosmetic industry would be ""overpaying"" its contributions compared to other industries, which would amount to forcing this industry to finance missions which do not concern her in any way.

Second argument, the law also violates the principle of proportionality of penalties. Indeed, it provides in the case of failure to declare to the agency a fine of up to 45,000 euros. ""In an industry in which 20 to 25% of companies have a turnover of less than one million euros, and for which we can estimate an average annual profit of 30,000 euros, it is a totally abusive fine,"" observed Alain Grangé-Cabane.
 In this case, the Council of State will be the one to determine the admissibility of the QPC raised on March 29 by the French cosmetic industry. The highest administrative court has for that a maximum period of three months to reject the claim or on the contrary forward it to the Constitutional Council for a consideration on its merits, who in turn has a period of three months to issue a decision, which is final and without appeal.

On the side of the FEBEA, officials are decidedly confident, the subject has been studied in depth with lawyers and tested with several legal experts. And, after all, the three previous referrals to the Council of State, undertaken under the Presidency of Alain Grangé-Cabane all found a positive conclusion. And things come in fours don’t they?   Response on September 29, 2012, at the latest."
Cosmetics for children: The Council of Europe recommends more precautions,"Although it has no regulatory authority, the Council of Europe is often a precursor. From its headquarters in Strasbourg, the institution, which comprises 47 member countries, has been the first to define natural cosmetics, to recommend better consumer information on sun protection or to propose the generalization of cosmetovigilance. Inviting States Parties to the Convention on the Elaboration of an European Pharmacopoeia [1], to better protect children under three years against the risks caused by cosmetic products which would be unsuited for them, the Council of Europe echoed the concerns raised by health professionals, particularly in France. On a number of points however, the recommendation of the Council of Europe mostly concerns non EU members and invites them to take over the provisions already included in the new Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 on cosmetic products, in particular on the product safety assessment or the basic requirements for ingredients, or in other texts such as REACH. But the Council of Europe also calls for particular attention to be paid to impurities and traces from raw materials, packaging materials, manufacturing processes, alterations or chemical interactions in the finished product, which should be evaluated, as well as to preservatives, the presence of which should be reduced to ""the minimum effective concentration"". It also urges to pay the greatest attention to the choice of packagings which ""should provide appropriate protection to ensure the physicochemical stability and avoid microbial contamination during storage, distribution and use"" and whose materials ""should be inert and should not release any toxic substances in the product."" If young children have been for the past years the subject of a very special regulatory attention, this is due to important discoveries on their particular sensitivity to certain chemicals, especially concerning endocrine disruptors. Indeed, several organs and vital physiological functions do experience a significant development during childhood, particularly in young children under three years. While recalling these points, the Council of Europe also calls to take into better account the relatively greater exposure of children, not only because of their low weight, but also because of their specific behaviour involving a higher risk of ingestion. Despite its limited scope, both because of the number of states theoretically concerned and because of its non-binding character, this resolution should logically lead to a strengthening of the legislative framework on cosmetics intended for children under three years, a strengthening already well underway in the European Union.

How the total ban on animal testing will impact the cosmetics industry?,"This situation comes as a direct result of changes instigated by two separate set of regulation: the European Cosmetics Directive, and in particular its 7th Amendment in 2007, and the regulations concerning the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH).  This legislation paved the way for a staggered ban on animal testing, which is due to culminate in the total ban on the sale in Europe of any cosmetics tested on animals, whether it concerns the final products or its ingredients, and wherever in the world the tests have been made. However, as it now clearly appears there will not be enough alternative methods to fully replace animal tests by 2013, it is still unclear, at the moment, as to whether the deadline is feasible. Premium Beauty News asked Dr. Florian Weighardt its insight into some of the most pressing issues faced by the industry in finding suitable and safe alternatives. Premium Beauty News - If the March 2013 deadline is not met, what potential new date will be set? Dr. Florian Weighardt -  Any new deadline for the total ban of animal testing will probably be set for a time when all the alternative tests will be available. But nobody really knows. The final word lies in the hands of the legislators, who act on the basis of the scientific opinions they receive from experts. Obviously, politicians will also take into account all the social and economic inputs coming from the industry, consumers and involved NGOs or associations. Premium Beauty News - What will be the most difficult test to find alternatives to? Dr. Florian Weighardt - The most difficult tests to find alternatives for are those which involve complex physiological and metabolic processes, for example toxicokinetics, repeated dose toxicity, skin sensitization, carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicity. The development of suitable alternatives for these complex tests represents a huge challenge for scientists. These tests all have the scope to assess toxicological aspects of ingredients, which involve the eventual metabolic processing of substances, its eventual accumulation and the effects of chronic exposures over time. None of these aspects can be assessed in a “simple” cell culture. Premium Beauty News - Are the cosmetic companies themselves funding the research into alternatives? Dr. Florian Weighardt -  Yes, several companies are investing huge amounts into the development and validation of these alternative tests - it has become essential.  Animal testing actually requires highly specialised structures and numerous authorities to run effectively, not to mention the many and obvious ethical concerns associated with it. The alternative tests have the advantage of requiring less governmental supervision to operate, whilst also removing the morality issue from the debate. Premium Beauty News - Does the ban have the potential to change the cosmetic industry permanently - for example, will some products cease to become viable and simply not be made any more? Dr. Florian Weighardt - Only time will tell. Theoretically, if an approved set of alternative testing methods is made available, nothing will change. On the other hand the obligations of REACH, combined with the ban of animal testing, will require the unprecedented testing of new and already existing compounds. As a consequence, chemical industries and manufacturers will feel the impact, though we’ll have to wait and see how severe this is."
Russia: The new cosmetic regulations will soon come into force ,"Premium Beauty News - The adoption by the Customs Union of Technical Regulations applicable to cosmetic products, it’s good news for manufacturers? Ramzia Lefebvre - This is great news! With an annual growth rate that could exceed 8% until 2013, the Russian market of cosmetics is one of the most dynamic in the world. For cosmetic manufacturers, the Technical Regulation TR TC 009/2011 [1] has the double advantage of harmonizing the Russian regulation with the regulation in force in the European Union and to abolish the dual system for achieving compliance. Best of all, these technical regulations also include Belarus and Kazakhstan, the two other members of the Customs Union created in 2010. Premium Beauty News - How does this Technical Regulation work exactly? Ramzia Lefebvre - Its aim is to harmonize the requirements on cosmetic products for the member countries of the Customs Union and to get more in line with European rules. This ranges from the manufacturing process to product labelling. Its structure and content are based on both the European Directive 76/768/EEC and the European Regulations 1223/2009 [2]. The definition of cosmetics and the lists of regulated ingredients are almost identical. The text of the Technical Regulations even includes a definition of nanomaterials which is very similar to the one found in the European Regulation and mentions for the first time the term GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice). Similarly, the definition of ""manufacturer"" is complemented by the notion of ""responsible for placing on the market."" There has been quite some progress as you can see! Compared to the current regulation in Russia, this text also has the advantage of grouping all categories of cosmetic products in a single document. However, the harmonization with the current EU rules is not total, particularly with regards to the maintenance of the obligation to establish the product compliance by a third party. Similarly for the labelling of products, the obligation for an expiration date is maintained, and all information must be written in the official language of the member state of the Customs Union in which the product will be marketed. Mastering all these aspects, and anticipating changes and risks in connection with them, are key to the success of export operations. For this purpose, by relying on the services offered by a provider like Intertek who has a dual product and business expertise through its Health & Beauty division and its position as a key player in export certification, exporters are better equipped to face these risks and gain autonomy. Premium Beauty News - And for the placing on the market? Will cosmetic manufacturers benefit from simplified procedures? Ramzia Lefebvre - Yes, certainly. However, prudence is called for because experience has shown us that changes are not always synonymous with simplification, as was the case with the GOST R declaration of conformity in 2010. In practice, from July 2012, only the Declaration of Conformity to the Technical Regulations will be required for most products. Only 13 product categories will continue to be subject to Registration as a single document: artificial tanning products, skin whitening, tattooing, personal hygiene; protection products against harmful manufacturing factors; cosmetics for children; hair dyes and lightening products; hair perms and relaxers; products containing nano-components, depilatory products; peelings; products for dental and oral hygiene containing fluorine (as of a certain percentage of fluorine) teeth whiteners (as of a certain percentage of hydrogen peroxide) Both, the Declaration and the Registration documents will be valid indefinitely and on the whole territory of the Customs Union. Conversely, the conditions needed to obtain the two documents were brought into line with the most demanding conditions, those applying to existing Registrations. To note that products which are certified according to the requirements of the Technical Regulations should bear the EAC conformity mark (for Eurasian Conformity) of the Customs Union, and no longer the Russian Gost-R mark.

Animal testing: The other serial of the season,"This may be the new series of the new year in Europe, just beside the never ending story of the crisis in the euro zone! But in this scenario, the European Commission is under the joint surveillance (but for different reasons) of animal advocates and cosmetics manufacturers. Testing finished cosmetic products on animals has been prohibited in the European Union (EU) since 2004, as with animal testing of ingredients since 2009. In addition to these, after March 2009 there has been a marketing ban on selling cosmetic products within the EU containing ingredients that have been tested on animals after this date, irrespective of the place of testing. However, some very complex tests [1] remain exempted from these various prohibitions until a general marketing ban comes into force in March 2013. While the European Commission recognized it would be impossible to fill the gaps regarding alternative methods to animal testing by the 2013 deadline, the European body said last September not to have the intention to propose postponing the deadline. To break the deadlock, the solution proposed by the Commission exempt from the ban those ingredients “would bring considerable technical progress and a significant added value to the health and/or wellbeing of consumers/society or to the environment.""  In order to benefit of the exemption, concerned ingredients should have to go through a special approval procedure. According to the European Coalition to End Animal Experiments (ECEAE), which revealed the intentions of the Commission, “this is unacceptable and would still allow cruel animal testing to take place for cosmetics products sold in Europe.” The ECEAE thus decided to mobilise its members and supporters by launching a petition against animal testing. For its part, PETA has enlisted singer Kimberly Wyatt, a former member of the Pussycat Dolls, to appear in a billboard campaign denouncing the ugly side of beauty."
European cosmetics Regulation: a challenge for SMEs,"The entry into force of the European Regulation on cosmetic products [1] in July 2013 has focused much of the discussions of the 9th Congress of the Perfumes and Cosmetics ""Regulatory Issues"" organized by the Cosmetic Valley and Chartres Métropole. Among the 468 people gathered for the occasion, there were many representatives of SMEs, rather unanimous on one point: the term may seem quite far away, but given the importance of the task at hand, time is running out! Admittedly, from REACH to the new Regulation on cosmetic products through the CLP [2] (for Classification, Labelling and Packaging of substances and mixtures) Regulation, the scope of the issues discussed at the Congress was impressive and the stacking of legislations could be bewildering. But ""we must be careful not to pave the way of anti regulation speeches,"" tempers Anne Dux, Director of Scientific and Regulatory Affairs at the Federation of Beauty Enterprises (FEBEA). ""Both REACH and the CLP regulation are quite old already. Moreover, SMEs in our industry hardly have to deal with REACH. They are a bit more concerned by the CLP Regulation, for the protection of their employees. However, their main concern remains the cosmetics regulation, and in our opinion, they are not yet ready,"" she adds. One explanation for the late departure of companies is the fact that several parts of the new regulatory framework have been detailed quite late. But according to Jean-Marc Giroux, president of COSMED, ""all companies will comply with their obligations.""  However, the representative of the association of the French cosmetics SMEs, tells the main problem is about resources of time and money to allocate for this purpose. ""We do not deny the interest of the cosmetics Regulations, nor its benefits to consumers and even businesses, but the financial resources to devote to this implementation are very important."" An analysis that shares the FEBEA which calculated that in order to be ready in July 2013, each company must allocate ""the equivalent of a full-time job every 75 formulas"". In any case, in such a context, the French decision to tax its cosmetics industry falls rather bad. Nevertheless, the good organization of the transition period is probably as important as the allocation of resources. ""It is important not to be mistaken in priorities, stresses Anne Dux, we find that firms tend to address the notification first, but it’s really the last thing to do.” The priorities are, by decreasing order: – To check that its production complies with the good manufacturing practices, and therefore to audit suppliers, when one do not produce itself,
– To organize the cosmeto-vigilance system. ""And that also affects SMEs. To say that one has no problems is not an answer since, as long as one is not well organized to see something, it may never see anything,"" insists the Director of Scientific and Regulatory Affairs of FEBEA. ""We are organising a free and open information session on this subject, on 30 January 2012.""
– To check all contracts with partners in order to ensure they comply with the requirements of the Regulation. For contracts with manufacturers, these include provisions relating to good practices. For contracts with distributors, the cosmetic-vigilance clauses are the most important.
– Then we can begin the updating of the product information package, knowing that on this issue final guidelines are in draft form and still have to be published by the European Commission. The latter step is probably the one where SMEs may face the greatest difficulties. ""In our view, the main problem for SMEs is that they will be confronted with complex technical issues, including in the toxicological field. They will need advices from experts who will be less and less available, and they will have obtain information that suppliers may be reluctant to provide,"" said Pierre Perrier, co-founder of Essential Consulting. To help companies in this stage, the FEBEA provides a diagnostic service in order to prepare the transition of product information packages. ""We send a person within the company, a specialist who identifies the key issues of each information package,"" adds Anne Dux. For its part, COSMED will launch its Guide of the Schedule 1, in January, a 150-page handbook designed to help businesses get their records in compliance with the new requirements. According to the FEBEA, resources to allocate at this step correspond to the equivalent of one-week full-time job per product information package. Once all these steps completed, and only then, it is possible to make the notification through the web portal set up by the European Commission for this purpose. Notifying a product, is also committing on its comply with the new regulations. The portal set up by the European Commission will be available from January 11, 2012. And between 500,000 and 700,000 notifications are expected by July 2013."
"""The new European Regulation on cosmetics is going to change our way of working!""  Sylvain-Romain Cotte","Premium Beauty News - You are launching a new offer to help cosmetic companies meet their regulatory obligations. Is the new European Regulation going to change the situation at this level? Sylvain-Romain Cotte - The Regulation on cosmetic products [1], which will become mandatory no later than July 11, 2013, will be introducing several new elements, with some of them having a significant impact on the businesses of companies. But mostly, it will clarify some legal points which were ambiguous or interpreted differently from one EU member state to the other. This is the case, in particular, for the notion of person responsible for placing on the market. Articles 4 and 5 of the Regulation give a very precise definition on the marketer’s mission and scope of responsibility. They also provide that the person responsible for placing on the market can be a third party specifically appointed by the manufacturer, the customer or the importer. Our analysis is that the entry into force of the Regulation with the removing of many grey areas, will force a number of companies, including distributors, subcontractors and importers of cosmetics to change their way of working. Premium Beauty News - Ensuring the full regulatory compliance of the company’s activity and of its products can represent a pretty heavy workload, especially for small businesses. Sylvain-Romain Cotte - Quite true! That’s why we are offering three services through a new legal entity that we created, International Beauty Office SAS, with the aim to enable companies to focus on their core business and help them benefit from economies of scale on regulatory issues. First service offer: the role of legal person responsible for placing on the market of products of companies that so wish. In accordance with the requirements of the Regulation, International Beauty Office ensures the full compliance of the cosmetic product vis-à-vis the European regulations and assume responsibility as such.   This service is mostly intended for SMEs who do not have the possibility to set up their own regulatory service nor to ensure a constant regulatory watch, as well as for cosmetic brands located in a non-European Union member and whose importer or distributor do not wish to ""endorse"" the responsibility of marketer. Second service offer: the European notification. As of 1 January 2012, companies will be able to electronically start notifying their products to the European Commission and they will need to comply with this requirement no later than July 2013. The marketers will therefore have to organize themselves to perform these procedures internally or rely on qualified service providers. They will have to collect the required data and prioritize the work, by giving priority to products which they are sure will still be on the market after July 2013 and by side-lining the ones they know will no longer be available at that date. In order to meet these confidentiality requirements, it is also a service that we offer to perform in the premises of our customers by despatching one of our staff member trained on a given period of time. Third service offer: the electronic Product Information File (PIF). We build, manage and validate electronically our customers Product Information Files which are required by European regulations. I also remains at the head of SRC Consulting, which still offers a set of consulting & expertise services (regulatory compliance of imported and exported products, compliance audits of industrial sites with Good Manufacturing Practices in cosmetics according to standards EN ISO 22716). Premium Beauty News - You were mentioning economies of scale, how is this achieved concretely? Sylvain-Romain Cotte - The core of our business is regulations, that of our customers is essentially research and development, marketing developments and the placing on the market of cosmetics. For medium-sized companies and/or third country companies who are seeking to market their products in the European Union, it is obviously preferable in terms of regulatory constraints to rely on a specialized service structure rather than internalizing all the costs. We have also invested in the design and development of a unique software package specially intended to perform the computerized management of the cosmetic Product Information File (PIF) which is also available online if necessary on the fully secured website ""DIP-online.com"".   It is both an innovative and user-friendly tool based on all our know-how and operational experience. It enables the creation, management, downloading and editing a DIP through a simple process. Of course the storage, archiving and traceability of the technical data are undertaken in a fully secured and confidential manner. Depending on the customers’ choice, we can insure the validation of the DIP’s technical data or we can offer a complete full service for the DIP with its updating. For the time being, this tool is not intended for the creation of registration files of products exported outside the EU. We have developed this expert tool on European regulatory requirements. It is therefore particularly suited to the needs of operators within the European market. In addition, we are developing partnerships on DIP Online and we are already working with other providers to offer a comprehensive range of quality services. We plan to present our company and DIP Online in Paris early next year. Premium Beauty News - Doesn’t the involvement of third parties like your new company, raise confidentiality issues? Sylvain-Romain Cotte - On the contrary, it often helps to solve them! I am convinced our action will be likely to facilitate the relationship between contractors and subcontractors. We all know that customers, who need to obtain all the guarantees in terms of regulatory compliance sometimes find it difficult to collect all the legal technical information they want from their suppliers or subcontractors. The latter being legitimately concerned with preserving the confidentiality of some key information. In this context, the involvement of a third party, such as International Beauty Office SAS, which will guarantee the regulatory compliance, is likely to reassure all parties. In addition DIP-Online, our software package, makes it possible if need be, to filter in a completely transparent manner the editing of some of the DIP’s details, and this, with the contractual consent of the parties involved (client and subcontractors). Our company remaining the guarantor that all the legal information has been provided. At their request, the supervisory authorities have of course access to all the data contained in the DIP."
French health agency asks for lower aluminium concentration in cosmetics,"“More than twenty-five aluminium compounds can be used in cosmetic products,” explains the French Agency in a recent safety assessment of the risks linked to the use of aluminium in cosmetic products.  “The aluminium chlorohydrate is one of the most widely used, especially as antitranspirant,” the agency adds. Since the beginning of the 2000s, several studies have been focusing on the risks related to these substances, in particular because of the role of aluminium in the Alzheimer’s disease. Since 2004 and the publication of the works of Darbre et al. (2003), the possible link between the use of underarm cosmetics such as aluminum-based antiperspirants and breast cancer made the headlines. So far, previous attempts to assess the risk related to aluminium in cosmetic products collided with the lack of relevant data, and the latest assessment by the French agency was made possible thanks to a recent dermal absorption study provided by the cosmetics industry. This in vitro study conducted on human skin allowed to estimate the quantities of aluminium absorbed via a daily exposure to an antiperspirant containing 20% of aluminum chlorohydrate (2.5% aluminum) to a rate of 0.5% in case of the exposure of intact skin, and to a rate of 18% in the case of damaged skin exposure. The margin of safety is 20 in intact skin exposure conditions and less than 1 in the case of damaged skin exposure conditions, the Afssaps says. Under such circumstances, what are the possible effects of exposure to aluminium? Repeated dose administration in laboratory animals showed that several aluminium containing compounds have the potential to produce neurotoxicity and to affect the male reproductive system. Human effects (neurotoxicity, anemia…) are also known in patients undergoing dialysis and thereby chronically exposed parenterally to high concentrations of aluminium, as well as in premature infants fed by parenteral route. However, the animal studies did not show any carcinogenic potential. Furthermore, epidemiological data “do not establish any conclusive link between dermal aluminum exposure and development of cancer,” says the agency. Thus the Afssaps deems that “exposure to antiperspirant products with concentrations of 20% aluminium chlorohydrate does not ensure consumer safety under normal conditions of use.” In conclusion, the Afssaps recommends: – to restrict the concentration of aluminum in cosmetic products at 0.6%;
– not to use cosmetics containing aluminum on damaged skin (after shaving or if the consumer’s skin is affected by small cuts), and to clearly indicate this information on the packaging. Concerning cosmetics others than antiperspirants, the Afssaps underlines that regulations could become more stringent, as its risk assessment does not take into account the total exposure to various products likely to contain aluminium."
Parabens: EU cosmetics rules to be amended,"The strengthening of restrictions on the use of parabens had already been announced by the European Commission to take into account the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) recommending limiting the use of butylparaben and propylparaben at a maximum concentration of 0.19%. The SCCS had also confirmed the safety of methyl paraben and ethyl paraben at current maximum allowable concentrations (0.4%). [1] The draft, however, should be partially revised to incorporate recent information provided by the SCCS about the safety of parabens in cosmetic products intended for children under three years of age. [2] According to information collected by Premium Beauty News, the Commission should propose to Member States representatives: – To prohibit the isopropyl, isobutyl, pentyl, phenyl and benzyl parabens and their salts in all cosmetic products. These substances, are considered as having only very little commercial interest, and the industry had given up supporting them.
– To maintain the maximum allowable concentration of methyl and ethyl parabens and their salts at 0.4% (acid) for an ester, in all cosmetic products.
– To lower the concentration of use of propyl and butyl parabens and salts to 0.19% (ester) alone or together, and to prohibit their use in leave-on cosmetic products intended to be applied the nappy area of children under six months.
– To maintain at 0.8% (acid) the maximum allowable concentration of use in all cosmetic products for mixtures of authorised esters (methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl). The Commission therefore intends to strictly follow the recommendations of scientists and opts for the utmost care regarding leave-on cosmetics applied the nappy area of children under six months, the only case for which the SCCS had indicated that risk could not be excluded totally. The draft should be discussed on the 8th and 9th of November 2011. Taking into account the time required for consultation, the final version should be adopted and published in the Official Journal of the European Union during the first quarter of 2012. Once the new rules published, manufacturers will have to put their products in compliance within 6 to 12 months."
The European Commission defines nanomaterials,"The definition adopted by the Commission is based on the size of the constituent particles of a material. The wording describes a nanomaterial as ""a natural, incidental or manufactured material containing particles, in an unbound state or as an aggregate or as an agglomerate and where, for 50% or more of the particles in the number size distribution, one or more external dimensions is in the size range 1 nm - 100 nm."" According to the European Commission, a clear definition was needed to ensure that the appropriate chemical safety rules apply. ""I am happy to say that the EU is the first to come forward with a cross-cutting designation of nanomaterials to be used for all regulatory purposes. We have come up with a solid definition based on scientific input and a broad consultation. Industry needs a clear coherent regulatory framework in this important economic sector, and consumers deserve accurate information about these substances. It is an important step towards addressing any possible risks for the environment and human health, while ensuring that this new technology can live up to its potential,"" commented European Environment Commissioner Janez Potočnik. A draft version of the definition was subject to a public consultation, and the Commission says the definition is based on scientific advice from the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) and the Joint Research Centre (JRC). However, while the SCENHIR suggested to classify as nanomaterial any substance containing at least 0.15% of nanoparticles, eventually put the threshold at 50%. BEUC, the European Consumer’s Organisation, as well as the European Environmental Bureau (EEB), said they were disappointed and surprised by the shift of threshold from 0.15% to 50%, which they consider will exclude too many substances from the scope of the definition. The Commission said the decision to deviate from this threshold value was made for practical considerations. “Nanoparticles are present in low quantities in most solid materials. The percentage may be significant, in particular in certain powders. Therefore, a threshold of 0.15% could include too broad a range of materials within the definition, and would have made it difficult to tailor regulatory provisions appropriately. The choice of 50 % is based on the attempt to distinguish nanomaterials which may exhibit specific novel properties from conventional chemical substances.” As far as the chemicals industry is concerned, Cefic deems on the contrary that the definition is too broad in scope and therefore difficult to integrate into existing legislation in a meaningful way Regarding cosmetics, the new Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 of 30 November 2009 on cosmetic products already provides a definition of nanomaterials [1], which significantly differs from the one the Commission just adopted. In practice, earlier definitions, developed on a case-by-case basis and which vary across sectors, will nevertheless remain applicable in their respective areas, as long as these texts will not be updated by the legislator.  However, the Commission may decide to propose some legal updates where deemed necessary, this should be the case in particular for REACH. Otherwise, the Commission intends to use the definition in new proposals and applied it in a flexible way. For instance, in case of specific concerns related to the environment, health, safety or competitiveness, a lower threshold for the number size distribution of nanoparticles may be used. The definition will be reviewed in 2014 in the light of technical and scientific progress."
Parabens and children: no health risk according to the SCCS,"The Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS), who is in charge of advising the European Commission on scientific matters, further addressed the issue on the safety of parabens in cosmetic products, focusing this time on the specific case of products intended for young children. In a previous opinion [1], the Committee had indeed confirmed the safety of the two commonly used parabens (methyl paraben and ethyl paraben) within the limits of recommended concentrations (0.4%) and lowered to 0.19% the concentration use of butylparaben and propylparaben. If this decision had the effect of rather reassuring the industry, whose practices were already consistent with the Committee’s recommendations, the latter was criticized for not specifically addressing the case of children under three, considered more sensitive to risks linked to hormonal disruptors. Soon after, the Danish authorities invoked the safeguard clause, arguing that butylparaben and propylparaben were to be banned in cosmetics for children under three years, a ban in force in the country since March 15. The activation of the safeguard clause by a Member State of the European Union automatically resulting in the referral of the Commission, the latter asked the CSSC to clarify its opinion in the light of the objections raised by Denmark. In its opinion of 10 October (CSSC/1446/11), the Committee therefore recalls that its previous risk analysis of parabens was based on particularly conservative assumptions including concerning the actual exposure to parabens, and that the data now available seems to confirm that the reality of the exposure in Europe and in the United States is actually far less than the one imagined at the time. Given the safety margins adopted, the SCCS believes that parabens are not a safety issue, and this regardless of the age of users. However the Committee noted, that in the case of leave-on products intended for application in the nappy area of children under 6 months, a risk could not be excluded, because of the risk of skin lesions in this area and because of the immaturity of the immune system at this age. However, such concerns should only arise, the Committee said, in the case the worst level of exposure is retained. Unfortunately, the Committee indicated that the currently available scientific data did permit the Committee to further refine its position on the subject. Details provided by the SCCS strongly weaken the position of the Danish authorities, but do not provide answers to all questions. So it is now up to the Commission to decide."
On-line resale of trade-marked products: further details from the Court of Justice of the European Union,"Lessons drawn from this decision will encourage online marketplaces like eBay, to act with the utmost caution particularly on the following cases: – the online sales of demonstration samples and of unboxed products (from which the outer packaging has been removed);
– the reservation from platforms like eBay, of keyword comprising trade marks. Having found that a series of its trade marked products were offered for sale on eBay, some of them without their packaging and the other ones, demonstration samples not intended for sale, the L’Oréal company assigned before the English courts (High Court of Justice) the individuals responsible for these sales, as well as the various companies from the eBay group, alleging an infringement of its trade mark rights. L’Oréal accused them of having sold some testers not intended for sale, as well as unboxed products, and was also complaining that eBay had rent to Google several keywords (AdWords) consisting of trade marks owned by L’Oréal, among which Shu Uemura and Matrix Hair. Thus, internet users entering these trade marks into the Google search engine could see displayed commercial links pointing to the eBay site and, more specifically, to advertisements on these trade marked products offered for sale on the website. eBay and individuals defendants, for their part, put forward the theory of exhaustion of rights according to which the owner of a trade mark cannot prohibit the use of it for products that have already been marketed with his consent within the European Union: in giving his approval, he has exhausted his rights, except for a ""legitimate reason"", which in practice equals to the marketing of products under a altered form (repackaging not taking into account the requirements of the manufacturer, or otherwise infringing the brand image because of its poor quality...). eBay also denied any wrongdoing by renting as AdWords several of L’Oréal’s trade marks, in that, such use did not affect the essential function of the trade mark which is to guarantee the origin of products, since these keywords did actually refer to some products from the L’Oréal brand offered for sale on the eBay platform. Believing that the case required guidance from the CJEU, the High Court of Justice sought advice from the former with a series of questions that can be summarized in the following (and non exhaustive) way: – Can the product samples available from L’Oréal’s authorized distributors be considered as ""marketed"" and therefore can they be sold freely on the eBay website without L’Oréal being able to object to it?
– Can the removal of the outer packaging of some of the cosmetic products be considered as a ""legitimate reason"" justifying a refusal from L’Oréal and thus hindering the free reselling of products?
– Can the fact that eBay reserved on Google some keywords containing some trade marks owned by L’Oréal be considered as an illegal use of these trade marks?
– Can the service provided by a sales platform like eBay be qualified has a hosting service, to which is attached a system of limited liability? On the first point, the CJEU’s answer is a traditional one: it considers that ""the supply by L’Oréal to its authorized distributors of demonstration samples bearing its mark is not, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, a proof of placing on the market"" thus rejecting the exhaustion of rights theory and giving L’Oréal the possibility to oppose to their resale. In a previous ruling of June 3rd, 2010 (Case C-127/09) the CJEU had adopted a similar position about testers distributed by the Coty Group, in Germany. On the second point, the response of the CJEU was quite clear in stating that the unboxing of a product is not in itself unlawful ""but that it becomes unlawful when the consequences are that vital information, such as the identification of the manufacturer or the name of the person responsible for the marketing of the cosmetic product are no longer available"". The solution adopted here by the CJEU seems more flexible for the sale of a repacked product, for which compliance with the following four conditions had been set in a decision of the Court on 11 July 1996 (Case C-427/93, C-429/93 and C-436/96): – repackaging should be ""necessary"" to market the product in the importing Member State, for example under a national rule requiring a certain type or size of packaging;
– the product’s state of origin should not be altered;
– the name of the entity who repacked the product must be clearly indicated on the new packaging;
– the trade mark proprietor must have received notice before the repacked product is offered for sale. On the third point, the Court recalls here the principles established in its Google Judgement of March 23, 2010 (Cases C-236/08 to C-238/08), namely: – the reservation of keywords corresponding to trade marks enabling the display of a sponsored link leading only to the eBay site (home page) does not constitute, for the latter, a reprehensible use in the domain of trade mark laws because the service provided by eBay is not identical or even similar to the activity of L’Oréal; 
– on the contrary, when these same keywords lead to the display of a link pointing directly to products offered for sale placed on the eBay platform, the use of the trade mark is then characterized; the Court stating that the fact according to which the products sold are proposed by internet users using the eBay site, and not by eBay itself has no effect and that the latter is indeed making ""use"" of these trade marks;
– finally, this practice is illegal if it is ""likely to undermine one of the functions of the mark"", an infringement that exists ""when advertising does not enable or makes it difficult for reasonably well-informed and observant internet users to ascertain whether the goods concerned originate from the proprietor of the trade mark or from a linked business or, on the contrary, originate from a third party"" in this case, the Court did not rule on the fact whether the trade links pointed to announcements posted on the eBay site and concerning the products in question, generated or not the afore mentioned confusion. Finally, and on the fourth point, the CJEU considers that a platform like eBay should benefit from the system of limited liability applicable to a hosting site provided it does not play an ""active part"" giving it ""a knowledge or a control of stored data"", a condition which is left to the appreciation of national courts. The Court notes, however - and this is perhaps not neutral - that eBay ""performs a processing of the data which it has stored at the request of its customer advertisers"" and that it ""also provides assistance such as optimising the presentation or promoting some of the online offers""... It is on this last point that online marketplaces will have be the most careful in order to avoid, like Google, moving away from the classification of hosting site and to the system of limited liability which is attached to it. The balance of electronic commerce, on which much of modern economy now depends, is in the hands of national judges... surely a topic to be followed very closely."
Australia: Notification and assessment of cosmetic ingredients simplified ,"So far in Australia, the regulation of ingredients used in cosmetic products has been split between the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and the National Industrial Chemicals Scheme (NICNAS).  Such a situation “has been confusing for consumers and a burden on industry,” said Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing, Catherine King, welcoming the vote of the law changing the requirements applicable to the notification and assessment of industrial chemicals. “The new legislation will cut red tape, eliminate overlapping regulation between agencies and better protect public health,” she added. In practice, the vote of The Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Amendment (Inventory) Bill 2011, means that the TGA will transfer the monitoring of ingredients used in cosmetic products, in particular ultraviolet filters, onto the Australian Inventory of Chemical Substances (AICS). “For industry this new law will mean that the ingredients in their products will automatically be included in the Australian Inventory of Chemical Substances (AICS) without requiring further assessment by NICNAS,” explained Catherine King. “The passing of the new laws completes the government’s cosmetics regulatory reforms which we began in 2007.” A consequence of the new law is also that all the information regarding substances used in cosmetic products will now be available from NICNAS, in particular trough its website. According to Ms King, consumers now can “find information in one place about the regulation of cosmetic ingredients, including the assessment of ultra-violet filters in secondary sunscreen products, which are one group of the cosmetic ingredients transferred to NICNAS under the cosmetic reforms.” The new law also removes the need for NICNAS to prepare and publish a summary report for each chemical assessment as NICNAS now publishes the full public report for each assessment on the NICNAS website."
Animal testing: the Commission intends to maintain the 2013 deadline,"The European Commission officially recognized on Thursday, September 13th, it would be impossible to fill the gaps regarding alternative methods to animal testing by the 2013 deadline. However, the Commission added not to have the intention to propose postponing the deadline. “Instead, the Commission is currently assessing the impact of the entry into force of the ban in 2013 without alternatives and will decide on next steps on the basis of the full impact assessment,” the European institution said in release. Testing finished cosmetic products on animals has been prohibited in the European Union (EU) since 2004, as with animal testing of ingredients since 2009. In addition to these, after March 2009 there has been a marketing ban on selling cosmetic products within the EU containing ingredients that have been tested on animals after this date, irrespective of the place of testing.  However, some very complex tests [1] remain exempted from these various prohibitions until a general marketing ban comes into force in March 2013. It is precisely for these tests that solutions for replacing animals will be missing by the deadline. In the report presented to the European Parliament and Council, the Commission highlights the continued commitment in Europe to find alternative approaches. ""Over the last 20 years more than 200 million euros has been dedicated to research in this area in the EU and the commitment to finding alternatives to animal testing continues both in Europe and worldwide, said John Dalli, Heath and Consumer Commissioner. This research and development has not only reduced the number of animals used in testing, it is at the same time yielding important results in terms of better science to the benefit of consumer safety."" Validated alternative methods are now available for the identification of corrosive substances, skin irritants and severe eye irritants, skin phototoxicity and skin penetration as well as to assess genotoxicity. Furthermore, significant advances have been made in many other areas. The Commission says that research efforts regarding alternative testing on animals will be carried on, both at the European level, in partnership with the industry, and at the international level, in particular in cooperation with the USA, Japan and Canada. The European Commission, which is currently assessing the environmental, animal welfare, economic and social impacts of the implementation of the full marketing ban scheduled for 2013, will announce its final decision by the end of 2011.  The Commission says that, while full replacement is not possible by 2013, “there is potential for partial replacement strategies and developing a ’toolbox’ of test methods to be improved until the goal can be reached.” For its part, Colipa, the association representing the European cosmetics industry, welcomed the Commission’s report, considering it highlights the progress achieved and the efforts of the industry to put a final end to all animal tests.  Regarding the next steps, Bertil Heerink, Colipa’s Director General, said to be ready to provide the Commission with “any further input required” for the forthcoming impact assessment and the development of partial replacement strategies."
France bans 3-benzylidene-camphor in cosmetics,"The 3-benzylidene-camphor (CAS: 15087-24-8), which has been banned in France, is a substance that, in practice, is scarcely used by cosmetics makers.  However, it can be found in some products, in particular in sun protection creams. Indeed, the European regulation has bee allowing its use so far, in particular as a UV filter at a maximum concentration of 2 %. In a decision dated August 24, 2011, the French Agency for Safety of Health Products (AFSSAPS) says that this substance is likely to cause endocrine disruption and particularly to affect fertility. According the AFSSAPS, many recent studies, conducted both in vitro and in vivo demonstrate these effects, ""especially given the positive results achieved during in vitro estrogenic tests and an uterotrophic assay in female rats (increased weight of the uterus) as well as changes observed in reproductive organs in a reproductive toxicity study.” In addition, the Agency points out two skin absorption studies that were part of the file upon which this substance was authorized as a UV filter. According to the authority responsible for ensuring the safety of cosmetic products sold in France, these studies were affected by methodological flaws: “on the one hand, an exposure of volunteer limited to six hours can not be considered as a foreseeable duration of use and, on the other hand, the dermal absorption rate was calculated from the average of the two rates obtained from these studies, while it the highest value that must be considered in order to assess the risk on the base of maximum exposure.” Considering that 3-Benzylidene-camphor can present ""a serious danger to human health"", Afssaps has decided to prohibit its use in cosmetic products manufactured, imported or distributed in France. Concerned manufacturers and importers are asked to take, without delay, all necessary measures in order to stop the distribution of products that contain this substance. This measure, said the agency, was adopted pending a decision of the European Commission. Should the Commission consider that the decision of French authorities is scientifically substantiated, the ban would be extended in Europe. The endocrine disruptors issue is highly sensitive in France where a majority of MPs voted on the 3rd of May to ban them from consumer products. For additional information, read the AFSSAP’s decision here below or on the Agency’s website (in French): Or the text as it was published on September 17, 2011 in the Official Journal (Update September 19, 2011):"
British advertising watchdog bans two digitally retouched ads,"It is the first decision of this kind after the British bodies regulating advertising practices have published a new advertising guidance that aimed to bring greater clarity about digital retouching for the cosmetics sector.  The prohibition follows a complaint by Liberal Democrat MP Jo Swinson that the ads were misleading, because of digital alterations and concerns a two-page magazine ad for the Teint Miracle foundation by Lancôme, featuring an image of actress Julia Roberts, and a magazine ad for The Eraser foundation by Maybelline, featuring an image of top-model Christy Turlington. In both cases, L’Oréal admitted to the ASA that ""post-production techniques"" had been used, but claimed the images accurately illustrated the results the products could achieve.  The cosmetics firm provided details on how the photographs were digitally retouched.  In the Lancôme case L’Oréal even provided before and after laboratory pictures of testers wearing the foundation. Nevertheless, the ASA deemed that the information provided by the company did not enabled it to conclude that the ad images accurately illustrated what effect the products were capable to achieve.  By prohibiting the ads from further appearance, the British watchdog implied the digital postproduction techniques used might have exaggerated the results of the products. A few months ago the Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP) and the Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice (BCAP) issued a Help Note on ’The use of production techniques in cosmetics advertising’.  This document is supposed to clarify under which circumstances pre and post production techniques are admissible, or not, in cosmetic ads.  The Help Note gives examples of production techniques that, depending on their use, are likely to mislead and those that are not.  The text allows “minor adjustments to correct for lighting problems and other photographic issues.” Apparently the ASA has opted for a stringent interpretation of the document."
Endocrine disrupters: the French Parliament reaffirms the precautionary principle,"It is not a very well known organization, but it plays a key role when issues of both scientific and political sensitivity are submitted to the Parliament. Composed of 18 deputies and 18 senators, the Parliamentary Office for the Evaluation of Scientific and Technological Choices (OPECST) aims to take stock of up-to-date knowledge in order to inform the French Parliament. It enjoys the support of a scientific council featuring 24 internationally renowned experts. As part of on-going debates in France relating to endocrine disruptors, in approving the report submitted by Senator Gilbert Barbier, entitled “Endocrine disruptors, the time for caution”, the OPECST recently brought grist to the mill of those supporting stricter regulations for these substances. Concerns about endocrine disrupters find their origin in a significant, and not yet explained, increase in hormone-related diseases like some cancers and fertility problems, said the French senator. In France, the occurrence of breast cancer has doubled since 1980. It would be the same for testicular cancer in developed countries since 1970. Concerning fertility, researchers are concerned about a possible combination between the decrease by 50% of the sperm count and the increased occurrence of male genital malformations. The report stresses that scientific data already available establish a credible causal link between these diseases and the action of endocrine disrupting substances. However, there are still many uncertainties about particular mechanisms of action at low doses, in combination, or at specific times of life and about the different molecules involved. Despite these uncertainties, Senator Gilbert Barbier deems that the available data are sufficient to act now. He therefore proposed a series of actions to protect the most vulnerable populations, particularly babies and pregnant women, starting with a strengthening of research efforts with the aim to validate international tests allowing the detection of endocrine disrupters by 2013. Howevern Senator Barbier mainly requires better information of consumers and advocates using dedicated signs to clearly warn pregnant and lactating women they should avoid to expose themselves and their young children to products containing endocrine disruptors. The necessity to label this logo would be submitted to the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES). Eventually, since the time of exposure may be greater than the dose, the report reaffirms the goal to ban, at a European-wide level, the presence of endocrine disruptors in products specifically designed for pregnant and lactating women and young children. On the 3rd May, the French National Assembly voted in first reading, a proposition of law prohibiting the use of three types of endocrine disruptors: parabens, phthalates and alkylphenols. At the moment, the text is still in the hands of senators, waiting for a second reading. If it states the risks linked to endocrine disruptors with no ambiguity, the OPECST report, which is merely informative, considers a possible ban on endocrine disruptors only in products intended for certain categories and recommends that to be done at European level, with no fixed deadline, and without laying down in details what substances would be involved."
US industry criticizes bill to reform cosmetics legislation,"According to its sponsors, Reps. Jan Schakowsky, Ed Markey, and Tammy Baldwin, the Safe Cosmetics Act of 2011 (H.R. 2359), which was introduced at the end of June in the House of Representatives, aims to “close major loopholes in federal law that allow companies to use ingredient in cosmetics and personal care products known to damage human health and the environment.” Key provisions in the bill include: random post marketing tests, registration of cosmetic companies with FDA and payment of corresponding fees, a list of prohibited ingredients, mandatory reporting of adverse health effects, increased power for the FDA, including the possibility to recall products. The bill is a partially rewritten version of the previous attempt that was introduced last year. “Industry self-regulation just isn’t working. This bill recognizes that consumers have a right to safe personal care products and that companies have a responsibility to ensure their products are safe,” said Lisa Archer, director of the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, an advocacy group campaigning against hazardous chemicals in cosmetics. “We agree with Reps. Schakowsky, Markey and Baldwin about the need for certain provisions of the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to be modernized in order to keep pace with evolving science and the growth of our industry,” commented Lezlee Westine, President and CEO of thePersonal Care Products Council (PCPC), the leading trade association representing US manufacturers and marketers of cosmetic and personal care products. However, “we are very concerned that, as written, it contains provisions that will place unnecessary burdens on FDA and businesses of all sizes and may compromise jobs without providing meaningful benefits to consumers,” she added. Personal Care Truth, a group of independent cosmetic business owners, also responded to the proposed act to address what it believes to be misinformation included in the bill. The group said the bill holds universal flaws that could impact the entire cosmetics industry, including large and small businesses.  “It is unworkable, far reaching, and will do absolutely nothing to make cosmetics safer than they already are,” said Lisa Rodgers, co-founder of Personal Care Truth. More particularly,Personal Care Truth criticizes the risk of label confusion as the process of labelling all components and contaminants of each ingredient would be nearly impossible, registration duplication for the manufacturer and distributor, and the inappropriate definition of adverse health effects."
"New cosmetics regulations, what is the impact on the industry’s everyday business?","Premium Beauty News - What is the current situation and what are the immediate consequences? Bernard Brancq - All cosmetic products are formulated with ingredients, whether natural or not, comprising chemicals.  Even though the marketing trend in favour of ""green"" products suggests they are safe, it is still necessary to prove their perfect safety for consumer use according to comprehensive specifications that take into account all routes of exposure. Some surprises are possible for many ingredients, natural or not, who, although they are used in small quantities do not have a comprehensive safety record. For more widely used substances, under REACH it will soon be possible to know if they are all allowed. As such, it is necessary to wait for results based on the regulatory process and to not put suspicion on some ingredients, in view of non-scientifically based data, or even ban them by ignoring existing regulations. In this regard, the case of parabens, authorized by the Cosmetic Regulations [1] and recently reviewed by the SCCS (Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety) is instructive Premium Beauty News - There may also have some collateral consequences! Bernard Brancq - That’s true, as these regulations generate high costs for testing and a strong mobilization of R&D means of companies in the cosmetics industry to the detriment of innovation which is, as you know, both the growth engine of the profession and its weight in the economy. Obviously the cost of ingredients will be on the rise too. The number of safe available ingredients will be reduced, requiring the reformulation of many cosmetic products. Finally, we can expect the sector to operate some relocations of its R&D and production in emerging countries where cosmetic products will be marketed in priority before Europe and where animal testing is still allowed. Thus, economic and social consequences which are not insignificant, even if the regulations of these countries copy quite quickly the ones in Europe. On the other hand, we must admit that consumers safety will be improved, thereby strengthening their confidence and trust in beauty products, while the image of the profession will be reinforced at the same time."
FDA issues new sunscreen rules,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has posted long awaited regulations regarding over-the-counter (OTC) sunscreen products.  The updated rules provide new labelling requirements as well compulsory testing for effectiveness by extending compulsory testing to the measure of ultraviolet A (UVA) protection.  Under the current regulation, manufacturers were only required to test for ultraviolet B rays (UVB) that are the major cause of sunburn. The final regulation allows sunscreen products that pass the FDA’s test for protection against both UVA and UVB rays to be labelled as “Broad Spectrum.” Furthermore, as both UVB and UVA radiation contribute to sunburn, skin cancer, and premature skin aging, while sunburn is primarily caused by UVB radiation, sunscreens labelled as both Broad Spectrum and SPF 15 (or higher), if used regularly, as directed, and in combination with other sun protection measures can claim they “help prevent sunburn, reduce the risk of skin cancer, and reduce the risk of early skin aging.” Any product that is not “Broad Spectrum”, or that is “Broad Spectrum” but has an SPF between 2 to 14, will be required to have a warning stating that it has not been shown to help prevent skin cancer or early skin aging. The FDA clear wants to push these products out of the market. The new regulations will become effective for most manufacturers in one year. However, manufacturers with annual sales less than USD 25,000 have two years to comply. “We are concerned about manufacturers’ ability to make the required testing and labelling changes in only 12 months given the thousands of products on the market, the limited number of testing facilities, and the time needed to redesign product labelling.  It is unusual for FDA to require such a short implementation period for a rule making of this scope.  Manufacturers typically require at least two years to design and implement broad-scale, product-wide labelling changes,” said Farah Ahmed, Chair of the Personal Care Products Council Sunscreen Task Force, in a statement. In addition to the final rule for sunscreen labelling, the FDA also released a Proposed Rule that would limit the maximum SPF value on sunscreen labels to “50+”. According to the FDA, there is not sufficient data to show that products with SPF values higher than 50 provide greater protection for users than products with SPF values of 50.  However, the proposal creates the opportunity for the submission of data to support including higher SPF values in the final rule. FDA looks forward to receiving stakeholders’ comments on this document. Major companies, such as Johnson & Johnson or Energizer, have already said they would oppose this proposal and that data is available to support the usefulness of sunscreen with SPF higher than 50. “In its Proposed Rule, FDA acknowledged that SPFs higher than 50 have been substantiated by independent clinical testing labs, and the results are validated and repeatable.  We look forward to working further with the agency on this issue.  Individual companies may also provide their own additional data supporting SPFs higher than 50,” added Farah Ahmed. In an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) for Dosage Forms, the FDA announced its intention to investigate several issues regarding dosage forms for sunscreens, in particular the safety of sunscreen sprays. The federal agency said the ANPR will allow the public a period of time to submit requested data addressing the effectiveness and the safety of sunscreen sprays and to comment on possible directions and warnings for sprays that the FDA may pursue in the future, among other issues!"
Parabens: the debate continues in France,"While it is still not included in the agenda of the Senate, the bill proposed by Yvan Lachaud (an MP from the ’Nouveau Centre’ party, centre right), adopted on first reading by the National Assembly with the aim to ban the use of phthalates, parabens and alkylphenols in consumer goods, continues to cause some turmoil in France and Europe. If, after the vote, the UIC (Union of Chemical Industries) expressed its feeling of ""utter incomprehension"", and the industry of plasticizers, represented by the ECPI (European Council for Plasticizers and Intermediates), was pinpointing at a proposal ""scientifically unjustified and unenforceable in practice"" and which was offering ""more drawbacks than solutions"", representatives from the cosmetics industry were for their part, much more cautious in their reactions. Thus, to date, the FEBEA (the French trade association representing manufacturers specialised in beauty products) expressed no opinion whatsoever on the subject, merely relaying on the site ParlonsCosmetiques.com an interview with Marc Mortureux, the Director General of the Anses [1] stressing on the fact that ""the levels of exposure to these substances and the risks they may pose are highly contrasted"". The discretion was the same at the Colipa, the European cosmetics association, which issued no general statement on the subject. “All ingredients, including parabens, are screened by top experts. The use levels recommended by the SCCS (the European Commission’s Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety) in their latest Opinion on the safety of parabens in cosmetic products [2], reflect to a great extent current use practice in cosmetic products on the EU market,” Bertil Heerink, Colipa Director-General, told Premium Beauty News. The organization, which represents manufacturers with the European authorities, however, alerted the Commission via the Directorate General for Health and Consumers, on the incompatibility of the proposed Lachaud bill with European regulations. But it’s probably through the stand taken by the COSMED, the association of French SMEs in the cosmetics industry, that the embarrassment of this industry seemed the most visible. In a lengthy statement published on its website, the COSMED expressed its concerns about a proposed bill that would cause ""an immediate detriment to the cosmetics industry"", but also believed that it ""could also be regarded as visionary"". In fact, the association took note of consumers doubts and believed that scientific expertise alone would not be sufficient to alleviate them. ""in spite of its flaws and even in the case of its possible withdrawal, this proposed bill will clearly play a role in accelerating the finding of alternative solutions acceptable to all, as well as by launching the necessary dialogue to be engaged with consumers"". Eventually, COSMED asked for time: the association called for the rejection of the proposed bill while announcing ""a total or partial abandonment of parabens by the trade itself provided alternative solutions were made available on the market"". Indeed, the abandonment of parabens would represent a considerable and yet probably impossible effort to achieve for most brands. COSMED thus noted that the relative success encountered with paraben-free cosmetic lines most often resulted from products which were designed with this in mind, and more rarely through the reformulation of existing lines. In its edition dated May 24, 2011, the French newspaper, Le Monde reported having identified about 400 medicines containing parabens and published a list of them on its website lemonde.fr. The list includes all sorts of products, such as creams like Biafine; many cough syrups (Clarix, Codotussyl, Drill, Hexapneumine, Humex, Pectosan, Rhinathiol); gastrointestinal protectants (Maalox, Gaviscon); treatment for intestinal transit disorders (Motilium) or against nausea and vomiting (Primpéran); oral suspension forms of cardiovascular medicines (Cozaar, Vastarel) or of antibiotics (Josacine, Zinnat); medicines against pain and fever (generic forms of ibuprofène and paracétamol) treatment against asthenia (Sargenor). Is this extension of the debate, beyond the cosmetics industry, likely to change its nature? It is possible because medicines do not share the same status as cosmetics, in the minds of consumers not to mention the ones of MPs."
Alternative methods to animal tests not fully available by 2013,"In 2010, the European commission appointed a panel of scientific experts to report on the current status and future prospects of alternative methods to animal testing for cosmetics, and to provide realistic estimates of the time required for the development of alternative methods where not already existing. This work was coordinated by theEuropean Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) and underwent a period of public consultation prior to its finalisation and publication in the peer-reviewed journal Archives of Toxicology. According to the experts, considerable scientific challenges still have to be overcome before a full replacement of animal tests will be possible. Whereas substantial progress has been made over the past years, they predict that for toxicokinetics, repeated dose toxicity, carcinogenicity, skin sensitisation, and reproductive toxicity, alternative methods to fully replace animal tests will not be available by 2013. More particularly: – No specific timeline could be estimated in the areas of toxicokinetics, repeated dose toxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity due to the underlying scientific challenges.
– The timelines estimated for full replacement of animal tests in the area of skin sensitisation point to a further 7-9 years (i.e. 2017-2019). This study [1] will be an important input for the Commission’s report to the Parliament and the Council expected in mid-2011, regarding the technical difficulties in complying with the ban on animal testing.  Indeed, the European Commission must review the situation regarding the technical difficulties in extending the ban to the most complex tests, including skin sensitisation and carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity and toxicokinetics, for which the deadline was set to March 2013. While full replacement is not yet accomplished or possible by 2013, the EU experts argue that there is a potential for partial replacement strategies. In the short to mid-term, providing a combined ""toolbox"" of well-defined test methods with established reliability and relevance for particular purposes, could support the development of integrated testing strategies. “While each of the methods alone may not be able to generate all required information, their combination might provide a sufficient basis for an integrated safety assessment withthe ultimate aim of completely replacing animal testing.” Animal testing opposition group, the BUAV, expressed extreme disappointment over the content of the final report by EU experts.  The group said that delaying the ban will not speed up the development and acceptance of non-animal alternatives. “Rather, the pressure of a deadline has helped to speed up the development of new alternatives - thereby saving the lives of thousands of animals worldwide.”"
French cosmetics makers face MPs vote,"By voting on the 3rd of May, a bill of law proposed by a group of centre-right members of the National Assembly, and aiming at prohibiting the use of endocrine disruptors such as phthalates, alkylphenols and parabens in consumer products, French deputies have caused confusion within the cosmetics industry, generating the utter incomprehension of some and the satisfaction of the others. The Union of Chemical Industries (UIC) said the vote by the National Assembly created utter incomprehension.  “The prohibition of entire categories of substances with very different toxicological profiles, uses, and therefore exposure levels is a scientific, technical and regulatory non-sense,” commented the organization representing the interests of French chemicals industry. While MPs argue that the effects of these substances and their interactions are not entirely known, the UIC believes that the bill is “an excessive application of the precautionary principle.” Where the deputies from the Nouveau Centre party said that toxicity studies of endocrine disruptors “still relies on the definition of daily intake, while potential cocktail effects or the effect of small doses have been hardly or not studied,” the chemical industry answered that, from a scientific and technical point of view, this is mad with much precipitation as neither the INSERM [1] nor the ANSES [2] that were seized by the Ministry of Health have not made their final risk assessment yet.  According to the UIC, endocrine disruptors even lack a validated definition at European level. The UIC also emphasizes the usefulness of the suspected substances in daily life: phthalates render some plastics flexible, parabens inhibit the proliferation of pathogenic microorganisms in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, and derivatives of alkylphenols are used as emulsifiers. ""Today, many of these applications are not technically substitutable,"" according to the UIC. As far as NGOs are concerned, their position is obviously very different.  André Cicolella, spokesman for the Réseau Environnement Santé, welcomes ""the lucid and courageous vote of French deputies"" that he hopes it will not be without incidence on the Commission and Member States of the European Union. For manufacturers of natural and organic cosmetics, the vote of French deputies has the advantage of consolidating their own position regarding the use of synthetic chemicals.  According to Thierry Logre, CEO of Laboratories Phyt’s, a leading maker of organic cosmetics in France, the vote strengthens its brand’s strategy, which since its inception 40 years ago, refuses the use of parabens. “From the outset, we learned how to make products without synthetic preservatives, according to a methodology of our own,” he says. Indeed, according to Thierry Logre, there are “many questions related to these substances.”  He particularly stresses the uncertainties regarding their ""chronic toxicity"" that is extremely difficult to assess. “So when they say that parabens have a very positive toxicological profile, they only speak about acute toxicity, but they pretend to ignore the consequences of the accumulation of small daily doses absorbed by the skin."" However, Thierry Logre does not claim for victory. “Parabens should not hide other synthetic preservatives, such as phenoxyethanol or formaldehyde precursors,” he warns. Above all, he knows that the new legislation must still be approved by the Senate which will have to resist “pressure from the government.” Indeed, the bill proposed by MP Yvan Lachaud (Nouveau Centre) was adopted against the opinion of the government and despite a negative vote by the Assembly’s Commission of Social Affairs. To date, the examination of the text is not scheduled in the work load of the Senate for weeks to come. In France, the government decides of the Parliament’s agenda, but lawmakers still have the opportunity to schedule the examination of their own proposals during the “parliament niches"", i.e. days that are dedicated to them. In this framework, all options are possible: from the approbation by the senators on the bill in the same terms, which would mean it become a law applicable upon publication in the Official Journal after its promulgation by the President of the Republic, to the mere rejection of the text or, more likely to date, a vote amending the Assembly’s text. Meanwhile, social networks and blogs devoted to cosmetic products, clearly expressed strong supports to the text voted by the National Assembly. What makes some people consider that, in any case, these substances are publicly condemned."
Sweden: Controls detect large numbers of non-compliant products,"As part of its market surveillance activities, the Agency tested 99 skincare creams available in Sweden, mostly products manufactured in Scandinavia. The products were submitted to laboratory testing, in particular for assessing their compliance with the rules applying to the use of preservatives.  In its Report on the supervision system of cosmetic and hygiene products [1], Läkemedelsverket points out numerous non-compliances, regarding both undeclared preservatives and erroneous information on labels. The analyses revealed that 20 products contained one or more preservatives that were not declared in the list of ingredients.  According the Swedish Agency, one reason is that manufacturers are sometimes ignorant of the presence of these preservatives in the ingredients they use.  Yet, full knowledge of the product formulation falls within the scope of responsibility of marketers, warns Läkemedelsverket.  “However, none of the tested products showed microbiological hazards, which is yet a satisfactory result,” said Monica Tammela, head of the cosmetic and hygiene products unit. Results regarding labels controls are even more catastrophic since 76 non-compliant products were detected out of 99 tested! These problems concern inaccuracies or errors in the labelling of business names or addresses, errors regarding the quantity of product claimed, the durability after opening, but also errors about the warnings or precautions of use, the batch numbers or the list of ingredients. Following these controls, some companies have decided to stop the sale of certain non-complying products.  Furthermore, the Agency has also decided to prohibit the sale of products where important problems were identified or where the concerned company were not able to produce the necessary corrective actions. The detailed report is available here below (in Swedish):"
Intertek wants to partner with brands for quality and safety,"For perfumes and cosmetics exporters, the agreement signed between the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) and the two leading companies in quality control and products safety, Intertek and SGS, should not bring many changes in the short term. Certification is from now on only carried out by the two certification bodies approved by the SFDA, which are precisely those who already were doing most of the controls. According to Aurélie Moreau, in charge of the cosmetics industry for Intertek, ""this agreement will mostly allow us to work more closely with the SFDA, particularly to address technical issues that are a source of concerns for manufacturers.""  An important aspect in view of the transfer to the SFDA of the standard-setting activity currently undertaken by the Saudi Arabian Standards Organization (SASO). Today, Intertek does not want to content itself with just being a surrogate of Saudi governmental bodies.   ""We have in France a centre dedicated to regulatory affairs, which allows us to provide exporters with local expertise and to keep them informed on the latest regulatory updates"", explained Aurélie Moreau. Services that the British group would like to continue to develop in all countries requiring certification of shipments, such as Algeria, Kenya and Russia. With a network of more than 1,000 laboratories and offices and over 27,000 employees in more than a hundred countries, Intertek has an unparalleled testing capacity and offers a set of services to support the quality demand of brands in the beauty industry. Since the acquisition of the 4-Front company in 2008, Intertek has become a recognized leader on the market of clinical trials, tolerance tests, verification of the activity of active ingredients on their substrates, be it, for hair, skin or teeth, toxicological risk assessment, and efficacy tests. With its knowledge in regulations and of international certifications requirements, Intertek also offers services for the preparation and validation of the cosmetic file, the writing of safety data sheets (SDS), and of quality and compliance control (microbiological testing, dosing of preservatives, etc.). The strengthening of regulations and of safety requirements the world over, offers the company, huge opportunities especially with the supply chain. ""Brands will soon have to insure that both their raw material suppliers and packaging suppliers, meet the REACH requirements, and by 2013 the compliance of cosmetic production sites to Good Manufacturing Practices recognized in the European Union will be mandatory"", warned Aurélie Moreau. Even the rise of ecology and a concern for natural products are accompanied by requirements for independent controls and for guarantees to new consumers.   ""Consumers are both better informed and more cautious vis-à-vis environmental claims. Intertek offers, thanks to its laboratory tests and its experts, a support regarding environmental claims.”  And it can go as far as the realization of a life cycle analysis.   ""We are anticipating the needs of brands in the prospect of the general implementation of environmental labelling"", emphasised Aurélie Moreau."
UK to tackle misleading retouched cosmetics ads,"A new advertising guidance published yesterday addresses the cosmetics sector with the aim to help the industry to advertise their products without misleading consumers.  The so-called new Help Note on ’The use of production techniques in cosmetics advertising’  was issued by the Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP) and the Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice (BCAP), the bodies that regulate advertising practices in the United Kingdom.  They also sought expertise from the Cosmetics, Toiletries and Perfumery Association (CTPA), the trade association representing the cosmetics industry. CAP and BCAP acted following a request from the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) Council for greater clarification on the use of pre and post production techniques in cosmetic ads. Indeed, in recent years, the ASA has received several complaints about the use of eyelash inserts, hair extensions and styling, as well as photographic retouching in advertisements for cosmetic products, on the grounds that they can misleadingly exaggerate the effect a product is capable of achieving. L’Oreal, for instance, came under fire in 2007 after an advertising over its “Telescopic Mascara” TV ads starring actress Penelope Cruz was deemed misleading.  Actually, Cruz was found to be wearing individual false eyelashes. In order to address these issues, the Help Note gives examples of production techniques that, depending on their use, are likely to mislead and those that are not. For instance, are considered as likely to mislead: – ‘Before-and-after’ images where only the ‘after’ image had used pre-production techniques
– The use of lash inserts that are longer or thicker than the model’s natural lashes or that do more than replace damaged or missing lashes
– Re-touching, for example, removing or reducing the appearance of lines and wrinkles around the eyes for an eye cream advertisement or increasing the length or thickness of eyelashes in an advertisement for mascara
– The excessive use of hair extensions or inserts that significantly adds to hair volume in hair care advertisements Are considered as unlikely to mislead: – The use of styling and make-up generally
– The use of lash inserts for non-eye area cosmetics
– The use of hair extensions and inserts for non-hair care cosmetics
– Minor adjustments to correct for lighting problems and other photographic issues
– Removal of skin blemishes provided this does not affect the impression given of the effectiveness of the product The Help Note also makes clear that while disclaimers or qualifiers can be used to clarify claims, if an advertisement is inherently misleading, it remains so regardless of any superimposed text. ""This guidance provides a clear set of principles that will be of real benefit to the cosmetics sector, helping them promote their products in a positive light without misleading the consumer,"" said Shahriar Coupal, CAP Secretary. Earlier this month, French cosmetics brand Make Up For Ever debuted world’s first unretouched make-up ad. The detailed document is available here below:"
Natural and organic cosmetics: what prospects for harmonization?,"Premium Beauty News - What is the current situation concerning the attempts to harmonize the definitions on natural and organic cosmetics? Laurence Mulon - At a European level, a first step was taken with the association COSMOS-standard AISBL, who last February 16, announced the start of the ""Cosmos-natural"" and ""Cosmos biological"" certifications. Five certifying body are now empowered to grant certification according to the Cosmos standard: BDIH, EcoCertGreenlife, ICEA, Qualité France and Soil Association Certification Ldt. A certification process will soon be available for new certifying bodies. No common logo is planned for the time being, just a common signature. For its part the NaTrue label, created by German industrialists is developing itself in the U.S. through the negotiation of mutual recognition agreements with NSF/ANSI. Premium Beauty News - Are authorities also trying to help clarify things? Laurence Mulon - Natural and organic cosmetics are in the spotlight of the European Commission who has initiated the creation of two working groups: one at the level of the CEN [1] for the standardization of methods, and the other one at the level of the DG SANCO [2], within the subgroup “cosmetic claims”. This latter group, however, decided in February 2011 to wait for the recommendations of the ISO working group on the terminology of natural and organic cosmetics before it would start giving its own recommendations for this category. Premium Beauty News - So ISO seems concerned about this subject too? Laurence Mulon - Yes, since 2009, at the instigation of the Colipa, the European association of cosmetic manufacturers. In practice, it is a working group on terminology (WG No. 4 Terminology) from the technical committee on cosmetics [3] who is trying to define natural and organic cosmetics. This working group has a wide international audience, because a number of countries have an approach to natural cosmetics which is related to their traditional uses but few countries have developed their own standards. The members of the group met twice in 2010, in June and October. The draft of definitions submitted by the Colipa was commended by all parties. There was unanimity on one point: the future standard will not cover labelling or product claims. This first project, greatly inspired by western approaches should integrate the traditional approaches of use of plants and natural extracts in cosmetics, and in particular India’s point of view. On the other hand, participants will have to agree on the methods of calculation of extracts and on the status of water. Premium Beauty News - Is all this work likely to clarify things for consumers? Laurence Mulon - The clarification expected by consumers is not for now. At the European level, the new Cosmos standard, that groups major European labels proposes a transition period during which will coexist on the European market, products certified according to national standards, to Cosmos standards and to the NaTrue label. The ISO standard is not expected before 2013. What will be the situation then?   Will Cosmos have imposed itself? Will the NaTrue label have attracted other continents? Or will the national approaches of each country be favoured? Manufacturers will have to make strategic choices according to the targeted market, not only on the choice of the standard but also on the choice of the certifying body. Not to mention the fact that some new labels are emerging. Some claims go further than the simple environmental approach by adding to them an ethical dimension, such as for example: Bio équitable, ESR, ""Main dans la main"", or an environmental approach focused on biodiversity, which is the case for ""Forest Garden Products""."
The proliferation in natural and organic cosmetic standards continues,"Although the adoption rate of natural and organic cosmetic standards is the highest in Europe, the region is also the most fragmented in terms of seals and logos. Standards are mainly adopted on a national basis, with few transcending national boundaries.  The Soil Association standard is almost exclusively adopted by UK companies, ICEA almost entirely by Italian companies, Cosmebio mostly by French companies, and BDIH predominantly in Germany. In order to simplify and harmonise the certification schemes in Europe, the six leading certification bodies have introduced the Cosmos standard and the first certified products are expected this year.  However, Organic Monitor deems that, since no common logo is planned, the new Cosmos standard “will not replace or unify the plethora of existing symbols and logos.” Nevertheless, a strong asset of the Cosmos standard is the international coverage of one of its members: Ecocert.  Originating in France, the standard has been adopted by companies in Greece, Denmark, Latvia, Brazil, India, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Australia.  The Ecocert logo is becoming recognised as ‘the organic logo’ in some of these countries.  “With the large number of licensees and certified products of Ecocert and its fellow Cosmos partners, Cosmos has the potential to become a de facto global standard,” adds the market research firm. Natrue, the other European standard with international ambitions, now covers almost 1,400 products, but has its actual popularity limited to German-speaking countries where are based most of its 55 licensees.  However, contrarily to Ecocert and its Cosmos fellows, Natrue is making inroads in North America. “High interest in standards and a flurry of re-formulation activity is occurring in North America since Whole Foods announced its new guidelines for personal care products a year ago,” explains Organic Monitor. So far, the NPA standard for natural cosmetics is the most successful. As far as organics are concerned, the NSF ANSI 305 ‘contains organic’ standard is gaining currency, but the USDA NOP organic standard remains popular in spite of it designed for organic agricultural food products. Thus, three separate standards and logos are gaining momentum in North America, and a fourth one is expected since Natrue and NSF ANSI have announced the launch of a new natural cosmetics standard last month.  “With this new initiative, Natrue has become embroiled in two major standard battles in Europe and North America.” There are currently no local certification schemes in the fast-growing Asian and Latin American markets for natural cosmetics.  Local players use European schemes to fill the void, but are also supporting the development of national or regional certification, like in Australia with the OFC [1] and ACO [2] organic cosmetic standards. In developing countries, governmental authorities could play an important role in advocating or introducing natural and organic cosmetic standards, according to Organic Monitor. Taiwan and Brazil could support the development of certification through local standards. “The proliferation in seals and logos, especially at the national level, could widen divisions in an already fragmented natural cosmetics industry,” Organic Monitor says."
First congress on alternatives to animal testing in China,"For the first time ever, the People’s Republic of China is exploring alternatives to animal testing.  This issue will be the subject of the first edition of the International Forum on Cosmetic Technology and Applications, initiated and organised by the China Cosmetics Research Centre of the Beijing Technology and Business University. According to the organisers, the purpose of this first congress on “alternatives to animal experimentation for cosmetics” is to “increase communication and cooperation within the international cosmetic community, remove technology barriers to cosmetic safety assessment, exchange information on international cosmetic technology and application, and look into the future of the cosmetic industry in China.” The organisers plan to invite representatives from companies and trade organizations, researchers and experts from research institutes in the European Union, America, Japan and South Korea, as well as Chinese experts in cosmetics studies, government officials from relevant Chinese supervision departments, and cosmetic companies in China. In a context where animal tests for cosmetics and their ingredients have been banned in the European Union and while they are regressing in most countries, the current Chinese legislation appears somewhat out of phase with the general trend.  Indeed, tests on animal are compulsory to assess the safety of cosmetics placed on the Chinese market, even where validated alternatives exist.  In the long run, this gap between Chinese and international standards may pose problem to China’s trade. Through this congress, China’s industry and administration intend to get more information about current legal requirements and technologies related to alternatives to animal experimentation for cosmetics in several countries.  Major cosmetics companies such as Amore Pacific, Chanel, Estee Lauder, L’Oréal, LG, Mary Kay, P&G, Shiseido, Unilever are supporting this initiative. The first “International Forum on Cosmetic Technology and Applications - Alternatives to Animal Experimentation for Cosmetics,” will be held in Beijing on April 11th and 12th, 2011 at the Beijing Xiyuan Hotel (No.1, Sanlihe Road, Hadian District, Beijing 100044). The deadline to submit papers is March 15th, 2011. Registration form here below:"
Natural cosmetics: NPA fears increased confusion for the U.S. consumer,"Premium Beauty News - What is NPA’s role in the certification of natural personal care products? John Gay - Celebrating its 75th anniversary this year, the Natural Products Association is the largest and oldest nonprofit organization dedicated to the natural products industry. NPA represents over 1,900 members accounting for more than 10,000 retailers, manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors of natural products, including foods, dietary supplements, and health and beauty aids. Among its many activities, NPA provides several self-regulatory quality assurance programs, including a good manufacturing practices certification for dietary supplement manufacturers and the NPA Natural Seal, the first and only natural certification in the U.S. Every day, NPA helps millions of people find truly natural personal care and home care products, awarding the NPA Natural Seal to products that are certified as 95 percent natural. NPA-certified products appear in more than 85,000 stores nationwide, ranging from independent retailers to some of the largest chains in the country. More than 500 personal care products and ingredients from more than 45 companies, both large and small, have been certified natural by NPA. You can get a complete list of products at www.TheNaturalSeal.org. Premium Beauty News - How are the audits conducted? Dr. Cara Welch - Each certified product or ingredient undergoes a third-party certification by a qualified auditor. NPA staff collects all the required documentation and provides complete packets for the auditor who then examines each submission and provides for NPA an audit report approving, if applicable, the certification. Premium Beauty News - NATRUE and NSF International recently announced they are cooperating to create an internationally harmonized US standard. They argue that such a standard would allow all stakeholders to take part to discussions? Dr. Cara Welch - The NPA Natural Standard was written by collaborating manufacturers, suppliers and retailers in the natural personal care industry. We launched the Natural Seal program to define the term “natural” in the US personal care industry for manufacturers, retailers and consumers. We believe a second natural standard will actually work to confuse the U.S. consumer as to what is a truly natural personal care product. We understand the importance for international harmonization and had previously worked toward an agreement with NATRUE in order to simplify the audit process for manufacturers looking to certify under both standards. At this point, however, NPA will continue to develop and grow our Natural Seal program and strengthen the natural personal care product industry. Premium Beauty News - As far as personal care products are concerned, what are your projects for the future? John Gay - NPA will continue to build on its success with the NPA Natural Seal program, continuing to certify more products and ingredients for the industry and consumers. NPA also advocates for the rights of consumers to have access to these and other products that benefit their health. Each year, NPA hosts Natural Products Day in Washington, D.C. This year, we expect more than 150 retailers and manufacturers to join us on April 6. Natural Products Day provides an opportunity for NPA members and others in the industry to meet with members of Congress. For more information, visit www.npainfo.org/NPD11."
Kao sues Henkel over hair dyes,"Japan’s cosmetic giant, Kao Corporation has filed infringement lawsuits against German manufacturer of consumer goods Henkel and its Japanese subsidiary Schwarzkopf & Henkel K.K. claiming the Düsseldorf-headquartered firm has infringed its intellectual property rights for a foaming hair-colouring agent. Kao filed two suits, one in Düsseldorf and another in Tokyo, demanding that Henkel ceases the sale of products infringing its patents and pays compensations for damages. According to Kao, Henkel’s foam type hair colour products marketed under the brand Schwarzkopf Perfect Mousse, which was launched in September 2010, would infringe one of its German Utility Model.  Kao also alleges that foam type hair colour products Fresh Light marketed in Japan by Schwarzkopf & Henkel K.K. since September 2010 also infringe one of its Japanese patents. “Kao’s German Utility Model and Japanese Patent relate to a two agent foam type hair dye in a non-aerosol vessel and are key intellectual property rights that support Kao’s beauty care business,” said the Japanese company in a release. After starting development of this technology in 2002, Kao commercially launched the first corresponding applications in Japan in July 2007, thereby establishing a ""foam type"" category in the hair dye market.  Kao also launched products using this technology in Hong Kong in July 2009, and thereafter in Singapore, Malaysia, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.  Sales were initiated in the United States, Thailand, and Taiwan at the beginning of this year and Kao says it is planning to expand sales to other countries."
EU confirms ban on musk xylene,"The European Commission has just announced its decision to move musk xylene [1] from the candidate list to the authorisation list, known as Annex IV, under the REACH regulation. [2]  This means it will be phased out since substances in Annex XIV cannot be placed on the market or used unless authorisation has been granted for a specific use. Musk xylene is a fragrance material that once ranked among the most widely used synthetic musks in the perfumery industry before declining in the early 1990s. As a very persistent and very bioaccumulative pollutant in the aquatic environment, musk xylene was the first substance to be proposed as a ""substance of very high concern"" under the REACH regulation. The Commission also announced the ban of five other substances: 4,4’-diaminodiphenylmethane (MDA), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD), bis(2-ethylexyl) phthalate (DEHP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP).  “These substances are carcinogenic, toxic for reproduction or persist in the environment and accumulate in living organisms. Operators wishing to sell or use these substances will need to demonstrate that the required safety measures have been taken to adequately control the risks, or that the benefits for the economy and society outweigh the risks,” the Commission explains in a release. The six substances will be phased out within the next three to five years. However, the move to Annex IV should hardly have any impact on the fragrance industry since the International Fragrance Association (IFRA) had already voluntarily withdrawn musk xylene from perfumes’ formulas through the fragrance industry’s global self-regulation programme. ""We have always taken our responsibilities for safety very seriously and once again our self-regulatory approach has proved to be more up to date with current scientific knowledge, faster to implement and cheaper for industry and consumers,” said Pierre Sivac, IFRA President. Actually, IFRA banned musk xylene in June 2009 [3], based on risk assessments carried out by an independent Expert Panel [4] that deemed the substance had potential effects on the environment.  According to IFRA, its membership accounts for approximately 90% of the global volume of fragrance materials."
"“We want clear, stringent, and globally harmonised standards for natural cosmetics,” Julie Tyrrell, NATRUE","Premium Beauty News - In only few years, NATRUE has succeeded to become one of the main labels for natural and organic cosmetics in Europe. Julie Tyrrell - First of all, when NATRUE was established - in 2007 - the intention was not to come out with a label for natural and organic cosmetics. The European manufacturers who joined forces and founded NATRUE had encouraged discussions that led to the Cosmos standard [1] but they did not find the outcome satisfactory. At that time, the European cosmetics directive was going through a process of simplification that eventually led to the new regulation [2]. Thus, we thought it would be possible to introduce provisions about natural and organic cosmetics within the framework of the new regulation.  However, when I opened the NATRUE secretariat, in 2008, it was already too late. NATRUE’s founding members were pioneers in Europe in the field of natural cosmetics. For instance, companies such as Weleda and Dr. Hauschka have been operating in this market for 90 years! They always campaigned in favour of international - not national - standards, with stringent and transparent criteria.  They want natural and organic standards for cosmetic products to be consumer driven, not something the industry is fitting to a trend. Premium Beauty News - NATRUE and NSF International recently announced their partnership to develop the first U.S. national standard for natural cosmetics. Julie Tyrrell - This initiative is not new for NATRUE.  Today the market for natural and organic cosmetics is international and many players in this market are international too. As soon as it was founded, NATRUE had discussions with its US counterparts. In January 2009, a NATRUE delegation went to the US and met with the Natural Products Association (NPA) and with NSF International with the objective to join forces to be bear the industry thought at a transatlantic level. Unfortunately, since that time NPA has been holding us back because of unanswered questions regarding ingredients and the certification process. As far as NATRUE is concerned, things are clear. Harmonisation needs to agree on common criteria but also on transparent certification processes.  Despite visits to the USA and an important number of conference calls, we were not able to clear up these questions. Meanwhile however we agreed with NSF International on the mutual recognition between their NSF 305 and the NATRUE  Level 2 [3]. We also recently signed a memorandum of understanding for the use of the NATRUE Level 1 (natural cosmetics) as the basis for an ANSI (American International Standards Institute) standard. Indeed, the existing NPA standard is not recognised by ANSI, it’s a private standard.  What NATRUE wants is not just a standard, but stringent and internationally harmonised criteria the consumers can trust. ANSI, which is the ISO official representative in the USA, requires American standards to be elaborated in a transparent and open process, with all stakeholders being represented. That is what we seek too: transparency, stringent criteria, independent certification, open process, harmonization. Premium Beauty News – Commenting on the co-operation between NATRUE and NSF in view of a new standard, NPA said it would do “no service to natural products customers, retailers, or manufacturers.” [4] Julie Tyrrell - The future ANSI standard will differ from the NPA one as it will not be a private standard but an official US standard. NPA was invited to join this process, and still can, the original idea was to work with them. In view of the inability to make any progress with NPA, we informed them before Christmas that we would go ahead, anyway, because we want an ANSI standard providing clarity for consumers and a better international harmonisation. NPA is still welcome to join the process. Actually, we are somewhat frustrated about NPA and their behaviour. Premium Beauty News - Is this partnership between NATRUE and NSF independent from economic considerations? Julie Tyrrell - There is absolutely no direct financial interests in this collaboration. NATRUE is a 100% not for profit organisation, and there is no financial interest for NATRUE in this partnership! NATRUE is a membership-based organisation, and we get an administrative fee for each product that is certified under one of the three levels of the NATRUE standard. [5] Premium Beauty News - How do you ensure transparency? Julie Tyrrell - Our website is an important tool for transparency. Every single NATRUE-certified product enjoys a whole dedicated webpage, including its name, its certification level, what makes it special, information concerning the companies behind the product etc.  In practice, at the point of sale (POS), that is to say where it really matters, consumers can simply use their cell phones to scan the QR-tag that is on NATRUE-certified products, or enter the corresponding short URL in a web browser, and thus reach all this detailed information. The QR-tag is already widespread in Asia and is becoming increasingly common in Europe. We are at the leading edge of this innovative. For us the POS is a point of experience, where products must “speak” to consumers, tell about what they contain or not contain, etc. The QR-tag is really a great opportunity for natural cosmetics makers because they have so much to say about their products. Premium Beauty News - What will be the benefits of the co-operation between NATRUE and NSF? Julie Tyrrell - The key benefit of harmonization between standards is clarity for consumers.  As far as manufacturers are concerned, our aim is to lower the cost of certification. We try to work with certification bodies that are common to both standards. In practice, for instance, it means only one factory audit instead of two. It is really important in an industry where there are many small companies. Also it should not be forgotten that multiple certification costs also impact the cost of the end product to the consumer so harmonization also plays a positive role in this regard, it is a win-win situation. Premium Beauty News - What about the future of the natural cosmetics market? Julie Tyrrell - In my opinion, the biggest danger is green-washing and watered down standards. One year after the launch of NATRUE we commissioned a study that revealed that consumers have lost trust in the industry. I think, the danger is that nature-inspired companies look for the easiest solution instead of really working to provide high quality natural and organic products. Premium Beauty News – What about the perspectives regarding international harmonisation? Julie Tyrrell - I am quite positive about this. Considering the discussions we are having at a global level, I am sure it is possible. NATRUE is there to ensure the definition of natural cosmetics will still rely on stringent criteria, and the partnership with NSF is a step in this direction. And there are other initiatives on the way."
Towards a US standard to define natural cosmetics,"A new U.S. standard may soon compete with the NPA standard for Personal Care Products to define what a “natural cosmetic"" might be.  Indeed, NSF International, a testing and certification organization accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and Natrue, a Brussels-based organisation promoting natural and organic cosmetics, have announced their partnership to develop the first U.S. standard on this issue. In practice, NSF International will use the Natrue Standard Level 1 [1] as the base for the development of the new American standard, which will be elaborated in an open forum using a consensus-based process, with a committee having balanced membership of interested stakeholders, including members of industry as well as regulators, academia and consumers.  As it will not represent the point of view of a single trade association, it will therefore comply with ANSI requirements to be recognized as an official American National Standard, which is not the case of the NPA standard. Transatlantic harmonization According to Natrue, “the partnership marks an important step towards international harmonization and a globally recognized definition of natural in personal care product.” Actually, the future standard should make life easier for producers of natural cosmetics who wish to sell their products both sides of the Atlantic. In 2010, Natrue already signed an equivalency agreement for the Natrue Level 2 and the NSF/ANSI 305 standard. This mutual-recognition agreement concerned products cosmetics manufactured with organic ingredients, referred to as products ’containing organic’.  In addition to their cooperation on the new American standard for natural personal care, Natrue and NSF have also signed an agreement to harmonize the criteria for these two standards. While this new agreement is presented as a means to eliminate confusion among consumers it is not sure it will significantly improve a situation that is actually getting increasingly complex with the perspective of two standards competing to define natural cosmetics in the U.S.A.  This strategic move can also be viewed as another step in the competition between certification bodies before the publication of the ISO standard on natural and organic cosmetic, which is currently under discussion. [2]"
New ISO standard to assess toxicity of inhaled nanoparticles,"The rapid progress of the nanosciences and the spread of nanotechnologies and nano-based products, in particular in the fields of medicine, beauty and cosmetics, IT, advanced materials, food and even packaging, are raising concerns among researchers, manufacturers, regulators and consumers.  This is “a relatively new technology, scientists still have a lot to learn about nanoparticles,” says the ISO in a release. Dr. Peter Hatto, Chair of the committee that developed the standard explains, “With the rapid expansion of nanotechnology applications comes a growing risk of exposure to potentially toxic substances, especially for workers in nanotechnology-based industries. Moreover, if airborne nanoparticles were liberated from products, the general public could also be affected. Ensuring the safety of these particles is therefore paramount for the well-being of workers and consumers.” Developed by the ISO technical committee devoted to nanotechnologies (ISO/TC 229), the new ISO 10808:2010 “Nanotechnologies - Characterization of nanoparticles in inhalation exposure chambers for inhalation toxicity testing” aims to address a part of these issues. The purpose of the standard is to ensure that the results of existing inhalation tests measuring the inhalation toxicity of airborne nanoparticles are reliable and harmonized worldwide. “In order to test inhalation toxicity it is necessary to monitor concentration, size and size-distribution of nanoscale particles in an inhalation chamber. Traditional methods used in other areas are considered insufficient for testing nanoparticles since parameters specific to them like particle surface area or number, might be crucial determinants of toxicity. ISO 10808 takes into account the particular characteristics and potential risks of nanoparticles, and is thus an important asset to the industry,” Dr. Hatto adds. ISO 10808 establishes a battery of inhalation toxicity testing chamber monitoring, including – a differential mobility analyzing system (DMAS), for determining particle number, size, size-distribution, surface area and estimated mass dose,
– as well as morphological examination using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped,
– and an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDXA) for chemical composition."
France: Teething troubles for environmental information,"It was during the Grenelle de l’environnement [1] that the idea emerged on informing consumers on the environmental impact of products they were buying. This proposal was translated into legal terms in the Article 59 of the Law of August 3rd 2009, called “Grenelle 1” [2]. According to the text, consumers must be able to access “sincere, objective and comprehensive environmental information on overall characteristics of the product/packaging couple.” The early versions of the law called “Grenelle 2” provided for the gradual implementation of this provision from January 1st 2011. But, given technical difficulties and the huge costs of implementation, MPs strongly reduced the scope of the law. Thus, the text finally enacted on July 12th, 2010 [3], only provided for the implementation of a one year experimental period as of July 1st 2011. At the end of this period, a report would be forwarded to the Parliament to assess whether or not to generalize the experiment. Given the lack of enthusiasm from the current parliamentary majority, concerning environmental issues, it is quite unlikely that the idea of a compulsory labelling extended to all products will emerge shortly. Actually, even environmental organizations seem to have better things to focus on! Considering the implementation of this environmental information requirement very complex in comparison to the immediate benefits, they have let, during debates on the law “Grenelle 2”, the former requirement turn into an experiment. Eventually, issues concerning energy savings in construction and transport and agricultural policies have seemed more important to tackle. However, they would have preferred a deadline to be set for the experimentation phase, and the environmental information to become compulsory by 2014. As for cosmetics, the FEBEA, the French trade association representing the manufacturers cosmetic products, is in charge of the secretarial work for the Working Group in charge of studying the implementation of the environmental information in this sector. Until then considered very proactive, the professional organization appears now much more cautious. According to several participants of the Working Group, the publication, in the short-term, of a guide on environmental labelling of shampoos, which was to be the cosmetic industry’s contribution to this national experiment was delayed. The main reason to this: significant methodological difference of opinion between stakeholders. The overall approach initially adopted by the Working Group was actually called into question, some participants wishing to step up the process by only focusing on greenhouse gas emissions, in the wake of what was undertaken in the United Kingdom. The general feeling being that the deadline set for the beginning of the experiment (July 1st, 2011) was anyway very optimistic given the scope of the task. However, many manufacturers are eager to see the file make some progress. If only because they have already worked hard to gather the necessary information concerning the implementation of the labelling. According to Philippe de Brugière, Vice President, in charge of the Packaging development of L’Occitane, and who did not participate to the work of the Working Group, but who nonetheless followed them closely, “a lot of work has already been achieved, but resources to mobilize are important and obviously industry players have everything to gain in pooling their efforts.” As far as L’Occitane is concerned a global approach was preferred. Beyond the mere measurement of greenhouse gas emissions, the French cosmetics maker and retailer seeks to evaluate the entire impact of its products on non-renewable resources, air and water pollution, etc.  “We hired a person that has been exclusively working on this issue for one year,” says Philippe de Brugière. “We have made important progress, while some data about certain ingredients are still missing.”"
Europe’s final ban on animal testing may be delayed,"As far as cosmetics are concerned, the European Union has already banned mosttests on animals.  The testing ban on finished products applies since 11 September 2004; and the testing ban on ingredients or combination of ingredients applies since 11 March 2009, with the exception of repeated-dose toxicity, reproductive toxicity and toxicokinetics. These latter tests should have been prohibited step by step, as soon as alternative methods are validated and adopted in EU legislation, and before 11 March 2013.  However, the development and validation of alternative methods seems to have been longer than initially expected and several voices from the industry argue that applying the ban on these final tests irrespectively of the availability of alternative non-animal tests could seriously hinder the innovation capacity of Europeans cosmetics makers.  Apparently, they have been listened by the authorities. Opening an exhibition held at the European Parliament and organised by Colipa, the European Cosmetics Association, Commissioner John Dalli highlighted the importance of innovation.  “Colipa can be assured that we will continue to do our utmost to support innovation through EU legislation and through our international activities,” said the Commissioner who is responsible for Health and Consumer Policy in the Union. Furthermore, Neil Parish, a member of the British Parliament and chairman of a parliamentary group for animal welfare, said that sufficient replacement safety tests would not be available until 2017, four years later than expected, The Guardian reported. Parish also criticized the cosmetics industry that he accused of deliberately delaying the development of alternative methods. Actually, several industry experts expect the European commission - who must publish an annual report on progress made in the development, validation and legal acceptance of alternative methods - will announce shortly that it is unable to introduce the last phase of the cosmetics directive in 2013 as initially planned."
"Parabens are safe for use but red hair dye n° 16 poses risks, says EU scientific committee","Parabens, a family of preservatives, have been the subject of several controversies regarding their safety in cosmetic products.  A consequence on the market has been the mushrooming of paraben-free personal care products.  But parabens used in cosmetics are safe, according to a recent draft opinion of the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS), an experts panel that provides the European Commission with opinions on health and safety risks of non-food consumer products. [1] The draft opinion re-iterates a June 2008 opinion confirming the safety of two parabens, methyl and ethyl parabens, at current maximum authorized concentrations (0.4%). However, when this earlier opinion was adopted, the scientific committee required further data before a final opinion on other parabens would be considered.  The industry therefore generated and submitted additional data on butylparaben and propylparaben, the other categories (isopropyl, isobutyl, phenyl, benzyl and pentyl parabens) being considered of no commercial importance. After having reviewed all the available information, including the possible relationship between the use of parabens and the development of breast cancer, the estrogenic and androgenic properties of parabens, and their dermal absorption, the SCCS said, in its new opinion, that butylparaben and propylparaben can be used safely in cosmetics, “as long as the sum of their individual concentrations does not exceed 0.19%”. The 0.19% threshold is to put in relation with the current legal limitations, which are significantly higher. Indeed, European cosmetics regulations permit the use of parabens in cosmetic products at a maximum concentration of 0.4% (and 0.8% for a mixture). [2]  However, according to the Cosmetics Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA), the voice of British cosmetics makers, limits proposed by the SCCS are “in line with industry practice”.  In practice, the maximum concentrations proposed by the SCCS are rarely exceeded in cosmetics, and industry experts say that very few products on the market fall outside of this range. The SCCS added it was not able to assess the safety of other parabens (isopropyl, isobutyl, phenyl, benzyl and pentyl parabens) for which limited to no information was submitted. In addition to parabens, the SCCS also published draft opinions on two hair dyes, HC Yellow n° 13 with the chemical name 4-(2’-Hydroxyethyl)-amino-3- nitrotrifluormethylbenzene, and HC Red n° 16 with the chemical name N-(2-nitro-4-aminophenyl)- allylamine (B114). HC Yellow n° 13 is considered as safe at a maximum on-head concentration of 2.5% in oxidative and non-oxidative hair dye formulations, despite the fact that a sensitising potential cannot be excluded. On the contrary, the SCCS says that the use of HC Red n° 16 as a hair dye ingredient within current admissible on-head concentrations (0.75% under oxidative and 1.5% under non-oxidative conditions) poses a risk to the health of the consumer, due a low margin of safety. These opinions, including the one on parabens, are open for comments until January 28, 2011."
Russia: regulatory changes in sight for cosmetics,"Premium Beauty News - For several months, there has been much talk about regulatory reforms in Russia. What is it all about? Olga Lambert - Two major reforms are going to directly affect cosmetic products. It concerns firstly, the adoption of Technical Regulations on fragrances and cosmetics and, secondly, the creation of a Customs Union between Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus, a first step towards a genuine common market by 2012. Premium Beauty News - How will the Customs Union impact the cosmetics industry? Olga Lambert - First, the level of customs duties will evolve in order to align themselves with the common tariff. But more importantly, the governments of the three countries have reached an agreement on the movement of goods which, like cosmetics, are subject to a compulsory procedure in order to control their compliance. Under the agreement, the relevant products will be tested and certified in one of the member countries according to criteria common to all three countries. The goal is to allow free movement on the whole territory of the Customs Union, without restriction, to picture what is done within the European Union. The creation of the Customs Union leads to logical changes in the procedure of placing on the market of cosmetic products. It should be remembered that this procedure is undertaken through two steps: Firstly, the products’ sanitary control and then the declaration of conformity. Sanitary control is now performed at the level of the Customs Union. Depending on products, it can takes the form of either a ""Sanitary Expertise"" or of a ""Registration"".* Are subject to ""Registration"", cosmetic products and oral care products other than those from the family 33 of the HS.] As part of the Sanitary Expertise, the clearance of products requires the presentation of a technical report confirming the safety of products, based on tests conducted in laboratories accredited within the common system of the Member States of the Customs Union. As part of the Registration process, which must be undertaken prior to placing on the market (or before customs clearance for imported goods) several documents are required, including a technical and administrative file provided by the manufacturer, toxicological tests and clinical trials. These data are registered into the unique sanitary base of the Customs Union before the sanitary registration is issued. Finally, with the creation of the Customs Union, Technical Regulations promulgated within the domestic systems of each member country will be common and valid on the territory of the Customs Union. Premium Beauty News - It is within this context that the adoption of the Technical Regulations on fragrances and cosmetics in Russia comes into play? Olga Lambert - Partially. Since 2006, the Russian Government has begun a huge regulatory reform to improve the quality of products manufactured locally and imported. The federal law on technical regulation for cosmetic products and fragrances should be passed by the Duma of the Russian Federation in the coming spring. We can already consider that it is a great step towards an harmonization with the technical rules in force in the European Union. Premium Beauty News - In concrete terms, what will be the changes? Olga Lambert - Technically speaking, Russian regulations will be similar to EU regulations. This first of all concerns ingredients since requirements related to the composition of cosmetic products will be harmonized with the provisions of the EU Directive 76/768/EEC on cosmetics. These requirements are more complete than the characteristics of current local sanitary standards (SanPiN). The main principles of the ""Cosmetic products and fragrances Special Technical Regulations are the following: – The registrant (manufacturer or distributor) shall bear full responsibility for all safety aspects related to cosmetic products;
– Cosmetic products and fragrances should not be harmful to human health and environment;
– Regulation requirements shall protect consumers against confusion;
– State agencies will be in charge of controlling the quality of marketed products. Under the bill, the safety of cosmetic products and fragrances is guaranteed by the compliance to the conditions pertaining to the composition, the microbiological characteristics, the concentrations in toxic elements, toxicological safety, clinical safety, to the conditioning and consumer information. In practice, Technical Regulations will be based on various existing sources with some amendments. Thus, the requirements for microbiological characteristics and concentrations of toxic elements are based on the standards of the Russian Federation, the requirements concerning labelling and consumer information are determined by GOST 51391 standards, ""Cosmetic products and Fragrance"" and consumer information is based on the law on ""The protection of consumer rights."" Like all technical regulations, the text applicable to cosmetics will list product categories that are either subject to a mandatory declaration of conformity or a mandatory certification of compliance. Premium Beauty News - The adoption of the Regulations will lead to changes in procedures for placing on the market? Olga Lambert - Currently, the certificate of compliance is achieved through the declaration of conformity in accordance with GOST R local standards When Technical Regulations come into force, they will become the standard of reference and the certificate of compliance for cosmetic products and fragrances will be granted according to three procedures: – the declaration of conformity or the certificate of compliance according to the standards listed in the Technical Regulations,
– or the State registration for cosmetic products intended for children under 3 years,
– or the control on products’ state of compliance."
China: registration of cosmetics resumed?,"According to information collected by Premium Beauty News on the occasion of theCosmoprof Asia tradeshow, which was held in Hong Kong from the 10th to the 12th of October 2010, registrations of cosmetics imported into China would have partially resumed since the beginning of the month. Indeed, following the change of regulatory framework and the administrative reorganization initiated in April 2010, the registration flow has been suspended. Since then, no product reference obtained the required administrative authorisation, whatever the product, “special function” cosmetics or “general function cosmetics.” About twenty registration applications, covering both “special function cosmetics” and “general cosmetic”, were recently given the green light that is necessary for entering into the Chinese market. “As far as we are concerned, confirms Ms. Françoise Yidan Li, co-founder and CEO of SEYCO, an agency specializing in the registration of cosmetic products in China, we have obtained the approval of seven products, on behalf of Estee Lauder, one of our clients. And we know that more than ten cosmetic products of other cosmetics companies have obtained the agreement of the administrative authority responsible for the registration.” Françoise Yidan Li is optimistic for the future and is convinced that the process should gradually resume.  “We now understand much better what the authorities are expecting.  We now know with much precision what the new registration files must contain and how they must be presented. I think the permits will be allowed to an acceptable pace and the situation will gradually unlock.” According to the regulations of the People’s Republic of China, cosmetics are divided into two categories: on the one hand the general function cosmetics, and, the second hand, the products special function products). Whatever their category, all products imported into China must get an approval from the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) before being placed on the market. The SFDA evaluates the product on the basis of a technical and administrative file, which must comply with strict formal rules, and include a series of mandatory tests performed by approved Chinese laboratories, as well as several pieces intended to demonstrate the product’s safety and the compliance of its labelling. This regulation only applies to mainland China and not to the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau."
"European cosmetics Regulation: ""The countdown is started!""","“The countdown has started,” says Anne Dux, Director of Scientific and Regulatory Affairs, at the French Federation of beauty enterprises (FEBEA). “There are 676 working days before the mandatory implementation of the cosmetics regulation. For a catalogue featuring 50 products, this means that we need to upgrade a file produced every 13.5 days. Those waiting for the 1st January 2013 to get on with the task will have only two days per product! And there are many other items to address.” Actually, the Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on cosmetic products will come into full force on July 13, 2013.  The consequences of the text on the producers and marketers of cosmetic products are far from negligible.  There are four main levels of impact said Anne Dux: on the catalogue of raw materials, on the production, on cosmetics information files and on the placement on the marketing. “It’s really the priority for companies. On the one hand, there is a lot of work to do.  And on the other hand, this work can be started immediately, unlike the update of the cosmetics information file for which some key elements are still missing,” says Anne Dux. The Regulation lays down several new requirements on raw materials, particularly for the notification of products containing nanomaterials and the defence of substances classified as CMR [1] class 1A and class 1B from 1 by December 2010.  Furthermore, REACH is complicating things.  It’s true that the cosmetics industry is largely a downstream user, which is not responsible for the registration of substances. But the downside of this situation is that the cosmetics industry does not decide what substances must be defended or eventually abandoned. It is important, therefore, to organize a careful monitoring on the raw materials catalogue, considering that the most sensitive ones are those that are used in many formulas. The purpose of such a monitoring is to gather the data that is necessary to update the cosmetics information file, as well as to monitor the behaviour of suppliers and to anticipate the substitutions that would appear necessary. As far as production is concerned, the new Regulation on cosmetics makes clear requirements: respect of good manufacturing practices (GMP) for cosmetics, as specified in the standard ISO 22716, and formalization of the contractual relationship with suppliers, subcontractors and outsourcers. Demonstrating GMP compliance may require applying for a third party certification, which implies of course quite a long preparation. The regulations significantly strengthen the requirements for assessing the safety of cosmetic products. However, these new requirements shall be specified by guidelines published by the European Commission. This publication is expected in the first quarter of 2011 and in the meantime, says Anne Dux, it is difficult to move forward on this issue. However, companies of the beauty industry can immediately organize the mandatory cosmetovigilance scheme. Indeed, they will have to gather all available data on the undesirable effects, including serious undesirable effects, in the report on the cosmetic products safety. “But this raises the issue of imputability,” said Anne Dux. Namely it is the question of determining to what extent an undesirable effect is really caused by the use of a cosmetic product. To this end, Afssaps and Colipa have developed common imputabilty method. Article 13 of the new Regulation 1223/2009 provides that before placing a cosmetic on the market with several pieces of information must be notify to the European Commission. The electronic portal allowing to fulfil this formality should be online from January 11, 2012, and a beta version will be put into test in the first quarter of 2011. Finally, the new regulations also require to review contractual relationships with distributors."
Advocacy group calls for more stringent cosmetics regulations in Canada,"The report published on October 18 on the website of the David Suzuki Foundation is based mainly on the results of an online survey to which more than 6,200 persons contributed. The Foundation asked internet users to inspect the ingredient lists of their cosmetic products and to indicate whether they contained one or several substances in a list of twelve sets of chemicals considered as potentially harmful for human health and the environment.  The survey provided data about 12,500 personal care products.  “Four out of five of the products entered in the survey contained at least one ingredients with suspected links to environmental or health problems - including cancer, reproductive disorders, asthma and severe allergies,” states the Foundation. Actually, the list of the ingredients “to avoid” proposed by the David Suzuki Foundation is quite long and includes such a large variety of substances that anyone clearly has strong chances to find at least one of them in cosmetics or perfumes: – BHA and BHT 
– coal tar dyes (including p-phenylenediamine),
– DEA, cocamide DEA and lauramide DEA
– dibutyl phthalate,
– formaldehyde-releasing preservatives (DMDM hydantoin, diazolidinyl urea, imidazolidinyl urea, methenamine, quarternium-15 and sodium hydroxymethylglycinate),
– paraben, methylparaben, butylparaben and propylparaben,
– parfum (any mixture of fragrance ingredients, in particular because to allergy risks),
– PEGs (e.g., PEG-60) because they may be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane,
– petrolatum,
– siloxanes (cyclotetrasiloxane, cyclopentasiloxane, cyclohexasiloxane and cyclomethicone),
– sodium laureth sulfate, because it may be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane,
– triclosan. For instance, the Foundation notes that the generic term ""parfum"", which is used on labels to designate the specific fragrance ingredients that manufacturers are not required to disclose, “was the most commonly reported ingredient, identified in more than half of the products entered in the survey.” According to the David Suzuki Foundation, the results of the survey are enough to demonstrate the loopholes of the Canadian regulation.  “Clearly, we need more effective regulatory action to keep these potentially harmful chemicals out of consumer products,"" said Lisa Gue, environmental health policy analyst with the Foundation. The report identifies several weaknesses in Canada’s cosmetics regulations. For example, the fact that ingredients used in personal care products have never been tested for their effects on human health and the environment, in particular when they were introduced on the market before the availability of modern environmental controls. Another example is the lack of legal authority of theCosmetic Ingredient Hotlist, published by Health Canada.  The list cannot be enforced directly, in contrast to the European Union’s regulation, which explicitly restricts a wide amount of substances, including carcinogens, mutagens and reproductive toxicants. The Foundation also criticizes the complexity of Canadian regulations that leads to apply three different rules to products that seem similar.  In theory, a beauty cream can be considered as a mere cosmetic product, or as a natural health product, in the event it would contain natural ingredients with a therapeutic function, or as a drug, when claiming sunprotection. The Foundation eventually asks Health Canada to control commercial use of the terms ""unscented/fragrance-free"" and ""natural/bio/organic"". “Health Canada monitors cosmetics for their safety and regularly reviews new scientific and regulatory information on cosmetic ingredients as it becomes available,” answered the Canadian regulatory body in letter."
China: cosmetics registration comes up against new ingredients and traces of harmful substances,"Since April 2010 and the publication of new texts concerning the registration of cosmetic products, no new approval was granted by the Chinese authorities for the marketing of “special function” cosmetics [1].  The presentation of the new arrangements for the registration that members of the SFDA made on the occasion of the conference on “Cosmetics Regulations in Asia” organized by Premium Beauty News on October 14, was therefore eagerly awaited. Mr. Huang Jiansheng, Director of the Center for Health Food Evaluation of the SFDA, presented the outline of the new regulation and its objectives, as well as the new organization of the administration responsible to approve imported cosmetic products before their sale in China. He particularly emphasized the central role to be played, by the Committee of Experts charged of the technical evaluation of the application files of “special function” products. This committee, which will meet monthly, will consist of twenty members, and will assess the compliance of products with chemical, toxicology and labelling requirements. Its expert members are currently being recruited. On the contrary, as far as “ordinary cosmetic” are concerned, the appraisal of the Committee of Experts is not required. Mr. Liu Baojun, Director of the Cosmetic Division, of the Centre for Health Food Evaluation, entered more in depth into the details, and recalled the main technical requirements for the regulatory compliance of cosmetic products imported into China: testing to perform, toxicological data to provide, detection of hazardous materials, etc. Then, Ms. Françoise Yidan Li, consultant specializing in the registration of cosmetic products, proposed a very comprehensive overview of the components of a registration file, as well as the new regulatory requirements, including the approval of new ingredients. The approval of new ingredients, one of the main new items of the modified procedure, raised many questions from the audience. For the SFDA, China’s regulation is clear: new ingredients are those that have not yet been marketed in China and, where appropriate, it is to the company responsible for placing the product on the market (manufacturer or supplier) to provide evidence of an earlier marketing.  The administration is currently drawing up the list of substances already known in China and should publish it on its website.  “But the process is long,” has warned Mr. Liu Baojun, who declined to give deadline for this publication. Another sticking point: the search for traces of dangerous substances, which is an important element of the new registration rules. Mr Liu Baojun recalled that according to the Chinese regulations, these substances are defined as substances that are brought by impurities in cosmetic raw materials, or through the manufacturing process, and that may pose a risk to human health. The implementation of this provision has also raised many questions as the scope of investigation seems immense while the risks are extremely low or nonexistent below a certain threshold."
New legal conflict about the protection of the designation “Champagne”,"Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch cosmetics giant, was sentenced Friday by a court in The Hague to withdraw from sale all its shampoos “Andrélon Champagne” and to refrain immediately from the use the use of the denomination Champagne in its advertisements.  This judgement follows a complaint from the Comité interprofessionnel du vin de Champagne (CIVC). Under the terms of the decision dated October 8: [1]  “Unilever has infringed on the denomination Champagne, which is a Protected Designation of Origin, by selling a shampoo called Champagne, as forbidden by article 118m of the Regulation 491/2009.” [2]  According to the court, the use of the word champagne, as well as the multiple advertisements referring directly to the famous liquor, were a very clear breach of the European legislation, which prohibits the exploitation of “the reputation of a designation of origin or a geographical indication.” [3] The court has therefore prohibited Unilever to continue the sale and the promotion of its shampoo, backing up its injunction by a penalty payment of 5.000 euros per day, with a maximum of 500.000 euros. According to press reports in the Netherlands, 340,000 bottles of “Andrélon Champagne”  had been produced to mark the 70th anniversary of the Andrélon brand. This is not the first time that the use of the word champagne in the cosmetics industry raises protests from the French producers.  In particular, one can remember the long legal battle who opposed the CIVC and Yves Saint Laurent after the launch of the Champagne perfume in 1993, which was eventually renamed Yvresse, after the French perfume house was sentenced for parasitism. “This decision confirms that protected designations of origin or geographical indications names are effective legal tools to fight against some commercial uses, which can be characterized as a misappropriation of notoriety. The famous decision Comité Interprofessional du vin de Champagne vs. Société Yves Saint-Laurent, rendered by the Court of Appeal of Paris on December 15, 1993, demonstrates it perfectly,” said Matthew Bourgeois, lawyer, and specialist in trademark law and intellectual property rights at law firm KGA. “The EU regulation and relating case law are all the more remarkable that they can punish any use of a protected name, like Champagne, for different products, including cosmetics. “"
The prohibition of samples resale is valid,"In a recent decision dated June 3, 2010 (Case C-127/09), the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in favour of Coty Prestige Lancaster Group GmbH, finding that the supply of samples to distributors did not suggest an authorisation to resell them and rejecting the “exhaustion of rights” theory invoked by the reseller of the samples under consideration. In this case, Coty noted that certain samples distributed to members of its distribution network had been resold to a retailer outside of the network, “Sparfümerie” a German company, which resold these samples to the public in Germany. The retailer claimed that Coty had agreed to the marketing of these samples when it distributed them to its distribution network and could not oppose the free distribution of the samples on the European market. This line of reasoning relies on the theory of “exhaustion of rights”, which means that the owner of a trademark cannot prevent its use for products already introduced into the stream of commerce with its agreement in the European Union.  In agreeing to this, the trademark holder would thus exhaust its rights. On the contrary, Coty denied having made any such agreement and highlighted the provisions of the distribution contract that bound the members of the authorised retail network, all of whom agreed that these samples remained the property of Coty so long as they had not been given to the consumer and that they would not resell them as well. After having been denied relief by the lower courts, the Superior Regional Tribunal of Nuremberg finally sided with Coty, finding that the contractual stipulations cited by Coty as well as the notice on the samples and their packaging (phrases like “Demonstration” and “Not for Sale”), which precluded any authorisation by Coty to market the samples. The Court of Justice of the European Union was asked to respond to the following question by means of a question for preliminary ruling:  “Are goods ‘put on the market’ (…) if ’perfume testers’ are made available to contractually-bound intermediaries without transfer of ownership and with a prohibition on sale, so that those intermediaries are able to allow potential customers to use the contents of the goods for test purposes, the goods bearing a notice stating that they may not be sold (…)?” The Court of Justice of the European Union responded negatively, siding with Coty.  It stated that the notice fixed to the samples “clearly reflects the intention of the proprietor of the trademark concerned that the goods bearing it should not be sold” and denied the application of the “exhaustion of rights” theory in this case. Going forward, practitioners should note the necessity to precisely draft contractual clauses concerning samples in selective distribution contracts involving perfume to preclude any ambiguity regarding the resale of samples without agreement of the trademark owner."
Conference to focus on cosmetics regulations in Asia,"Regulations are a major concern for companies eager to taps into the fast growing Asian cosmetics markets.  Premium Beauty News is organising a one-day regulatory conference next month in Paris, focusing on China, India and the ASEAN. China is probably the main issue on the regulatory agenda of cosmetics companies today.  Since the creation of the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) and the adoption of a new regulatory framework last year, the registration of new products has been partially halted.  During the summer, the SFDA has published several guidelines and measures in a move to reorganise the supervision of cosmetic products in the country. For the first time in Europe, representatives of the SFDA will present and explain the organisation the Chinese administration, the aims of the new regulations, the details of the assessment procedure and how it is implemented.  Mr. Huang Jiansheng, Director of the SFDA’s Centre for Health Food Evaluation, and Mr. Liu Baojun, Director of the Cosmetic Division of the Centre for Health Food Evaluation will also answer questions from the participants. Practical arrangements for the registration, as well as usual errors to avoid, will be presented by Mrs Françoise Yidan Li, consultant in legislation and registration of cosmetic and health products in China. An English translation of the latest Chinese regulatory texts will also be provided to participants in the conference. While India’s cosmetic market is still far from equalling its Chinese counterpart, the country is emerging as one of the fastest growing world economy.  Cosmetics regulations in India are based on the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules as they were recently updated.  New rules regarding the registration of cosmetic products will be enforced by April 2011. Dr. Jean Pierre Joubert, consultant and toxicologist, will provide an overview of the current legislative texts as well as market access conditions for cosmetics exporters. With a population of approximately 580 million people, 8.7% of the world population, the ten ASEAN [1] countries (Burma, Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam) refer to a common regulatory text, the so-called ASEAN Harmonized Cosmetic Regulatory Scheme, also nick-named as the ASEAN Cosmetics Directive as it is very closed from the European Union’s regulatory reference.  However, the implementation of this text between the different states differs widely. Mr. Emmanuel Capiomont, L’Oréal’s Scientific Director Asia & Pacific will update participants on this issue.

China to put cosmetics under close surveillance,"During the summer, the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) has published several guidelines and measures strengthening the supervision of cosmetic products in China. The first series of texts - the “Measures on Management of Health Food Evaluation Experts” and the “Measures on Management of Cosmetics Evaluation Experts” - concern the administrative management of the evaluation of the cosmetic products by the authorities. At the beginning of August, the SFDA also published the “Guidelines for routine on-site inspection to health food and cosmetics production and distribution enterprises.”   This text lays down in details the procedures and methods applicable during controls performed by Chinese inspectors. Eventually, the SFDA issued a “Guide for Risk Assessment of Possible Substances with Safety Risks in Cosmetics.”  This text aims toxic substances that may be present in small quantities in cosmetic products. The text provides a definition of the concerned substances, the procedures for risk assessment and the information required in the risk assessment dossier. In September 2006, China temporarily prohibited the import and sale of some Japan’s made SK-II products, a Procter & Gamble (P&G) brand, alleging they contained traces of neodymium and chromium.  P&G had to discontinue the line, before going back in stores in December. In a joint statement the Ministry of Health and the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine of China agreed with P&G company officials that the product line posed no danger to human health. The next step was announced by the SFDA at the very beginning of September.  A new text should finalise China’s cosmetic evaluation and registration scheme. “The SFDA had drawn up a draft plan for a product test system, was re-examining the qualifications of agencies that approve cosmetics and skin care products, and was screening candidates for a safety commission, » said a SFDA spokesperson. In order to help cosmetics companies to better understand this new legislative framework, Premium Beauty News is organising a conference on the 14th of October 2010 in Paris, with the participation of members of the SFDA who are in charge of the evaluation of cosmetic products.

Masterclass on natural and organic certifications to be held in New York,"This new Masterclass will be hosted alongside HBA Global Expo 2010. It will take place on 29-30th September at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Centre in New York City Organic Monitor has arranged the Natural Cosmetics Masterclass following the recent news that Whole Foods Market, a leading natural product retailer, will only be marketing certified organic cosmetics next year. Retailers are demanding certified products in response to consumer confusion about natural and organic beauty products.  Indeed, Whole Foods Market is the latest in a number of organic and natural product retailers in the USA that already made a commitment to third party verification schemes.  According to Organic Monitor this trends is similar to what happened in Europe where certification has already become a prerequisite for retailers when considering new personal care products. “The same trend is also catching on in Asia where leading natural food retail chains such as Country Farm are increasingly seeking certified personal care products,” adds the market research firm. With this new Masterclass, Organic Monitor intends to help companies to take the certified route. Judi Beerling, Head of Technical Research at Organic Monitor, will critically review the various natural and organic cosmetic standards in North America and other regions. This first workshop will give details of the adoption criteria in terms of permissible / prohibited ingredients, processes and formulations. The second workshop will focus on the changing competitive landscape for natural and organic cosmetic makers, with a global analysis, highlighting the major market trends and opportunities to existing participants and new entrants. Since 2008, Organic Monitor has been hosting Natural Cosmetic Masterclasses at various international locations that include London, Paris, Nuremberg and Bologna."
US cosmetics industry calls for greater FDA role,"The Personal Care Products Council (PCP), the leading trade group representing the US cosmetics industry [1], has called for a new federal legislation that would strengthen and modernize regulatory oversight of the industry and create a greater role for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in assessing ingredient safety for personal care products. The Council detailed its proposal in a letter to key health policy leaders in the Senate and House of Representatives. “The proposal represents the culmination of more than three years of planning and research,” said the Council in a release. “For decades, the industry has had an impeccable safety record under the existing requirements implemented by FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Our products remain among the safest in the marketplace,” explained Lezlee Westine, the Council’s president and chief executive officer. “Nonetheless, we believe it is time to develop a more contemporary approach that includes a greater federal regulatory role.” Westine emphasized the proactive nature of the PCPC’s announcement, which is being made in the absence of any specific public health risk or legislative mandate involving personal care products, which remain safe to use. “Rather, the industry is responding to American consumers who are requesting and deserving more transparency from government and industry while ensuring their ability to keep pace with continued demand for innovative products.” Indeed, the initiative is following recurrent polemics regarding the safety of cosmetics and their ingredients in the US.  The introduction in Europe of regulatory provisions prohibiting carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic (CMR) substances in cosmetic products has also given arguments to several public action groups requiring a similar level of protection for US consumers.  This even led to the adoption of a specific legislation in California [2] and several other legislative proposals in numerous other States. The Council is seeking to create formal processes for FDA to review ingredients for safety at the request of the public and stakeholder groups and to review all safety determinations made by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel. No such FDA processes currently exist. Toward that end, the PCPC has worked on a five-point plan that includes: (1) Enhanced FDA Registration. Personal care products manufacturers who market their products in the United States would be required to: – Register with FDA all facilities where those products are manufactured.
– File with FDA product ingredient reports disclosing all of the ingredients used in those products; and
– Report to FDA any serious unexpected adverse event with a personal care product experienced by consumers. (2) Safety levels for trace constituents. When requested or on its own initiative, FDA would be required to establish safe levels for trace constituents in cosmetic ingredients and finished products. (3) New FDA Ingredient Review Process. Once a request has been made, or FDA unilaterally determines action is warranted, the agency would be required to review the safety of any ingredient intended for use in a personal care product and set safety use levels for such ingredient on a specified timetable. This initiative could dramatically increase the list of ingredients either prohibited or limited for use in cosmetics. (4) New FDA oversight of CIR findings. The Council’s initiative would maintain the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel [3], which currently assesses the safety of cosmetic ingredients, but FDA would be required to review current and future CIR findings and determine if they are correct. If there are instances in which it determines a CIR finding is not correct, FDA would determine by guidance or regulations if, or under what conditions, the ingredient can be used safely in personal care products. (5) FDA-Issued Good Manufacturing Practices. There are currently no compulsory Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) applicable to cosmetic products in the US, despite that numerous cosmetics manufacturers voluntary comply with the guidelines published by the Personal Care Products Council or other bodies. Under the Council’s plan, the FDA would establish industry-wide GMP requirements. The Council and its member companies have been proactively working with legislators to materialise their plan in a bill: HR 759, the Food and Drug Administration Globalization Act of 2009, introduced by Congressman John Dingell (D-MI). “Our companies commend Rep. Dingell for his ongoing work to better protect consumers and increase transparency. We look forward to working with the current and next Congress to ensure these changes are meaningful and attain the full force of federal law,” said Westine."
The FEBEA reinforces its support to exporting companies,"For an exporter of cosmetic products, the Certificate of Free Sale (CFS) is a real passport, an open sesame without which it is impossible to export to some countries. Concretely, the CFS certifies that the mentioned products can be freely marketed in their country of origin, in other words, that they comply with the country regulations. It enables requesting countries to check that the product complies with regulations sometimes more stringent than in their own, and to make sur that products were not just specifically formulated for export. In France, it is the French trade association (FEBEA) that, since 1968, delivers the documents under the authority of the Ministry of Industry. This is not a unique case since, in the United States, the trade organizations also issue the CFS. The FEBEA claims having issued several hundred of thousands of these export documents to all cosmetic companies who had requested them, members or not of the trade association, while specifying that it had been done ""under such security conditions that no company had been questioned"". The procedure for issuing a CFS has nonetheless been reinforced, since the FEBEA announced that its procedures had been certified by Intertek, as complying with quality assurance standard ISO 9001:2008. Should one see in this initiative a will to stand out, while since April 2010 1st, COSMED, the other association representing the companies operating in the sector, also has a ministerial accreditation, putting an end to more than forty years of monopoly? At the FEBEA, we were told that the two facts were unrelated. ""The certification process was initiated more than a year ago"", underlines Anne Dux, Director of Scientific and Regulatory Affairs. ""The implementation work lasted a short year, it involved twelve employees, representing half of the staff of FEBEA!"". It is actually the whole chain of issuing - from the packaging audit to the checking of the INCI list - which was put under scrutiny and in line with ISO requirements. For the Febea the aim is to ensure quality in the procedure of issuing and in the service provided to businesses, but also give even more credibility to its own documents in the eyes of foreign authorities. Because, as we were explained at the FEBEA, ""in the case a problem occurs, the receiving country could be entitled to ask for some details on the procedure of issuing"". In the event of a  problem which could be for example an accident with a non-complying product to Franco-European regulations but yet displaying its CFS. With 18,000 to 20,000 CFS issued annually, the need to consolidate the procedure of issuing seemed logical. ""And this will have no impact on the cost of the document issuing,"" said the FEBEA. The Certificate of Free Sale is currently required for export in some sixty countries, including heavyweights like as China, India, Russia, South Korea, and Brazil."
US retailer to require third-party certification of personal care products,"By next year, Whole Foods Market, the US leading retailer of certified organic groceries, will require all personal care products making “organic” claims to get a third-party certification before being sold in its US stores. The new requirements apply to all personal care products and cosmetics using the word “organic” in any way on the product label, including the use of the word “organic” in the brand name.  However, Whole Foods Market will not accept all third-parties certifications. Depending on the type of claims, different certifications are required: – All products making an “organic” product claim (e.g. “organic shampoo”) will have to be certified tothe United States Department of Agriculture National Organic Program (USDA NOP) standard, the same standard to which organic food must be certified under U.S. law. These products must contain more than 95% organic ingredients.
– Products making a “made with organic ingredients” claim must also be certified to the NOP standard.  These products must contain more than 70% organic ingredients.
– And products making a “contains organic ingredients” claim must be certified to the NSF 305 ANSI Standard for Organic Personal Care products, a consensus-based industry standard accepted by the American National Standards Institute and managed by NSF International. This choice is highly demanding since the NOP standard was developed for farmed foods, with no consideration for the specificities of cosmetic products. According to Whole Foods Market, this decision aims at ensuring that claims on product labels are accurate.  “Our shoppers do not expect the definition of organic to change substantially between the food and non-food aisles of our stores,” said Joe Dickson, quality standards coordinator for Whole Foods Market. “We believe that the ‘organic’ claim used on personal care products should have just as strong a meaning to the ‘organic’ claim used on food products, which is currently regulated by the USDA’s National Organic Program.” Whole Foods Market said to be currently working with suppliers to transition their label claims to the meet these standards.  The company said that “quite a few” of its suppliers will have “change their labels, reformulate their products and take other measures” to comply with this new rules."
Cosmetics firms accused of price fixing in Switzerland,"After a 18-month investigation regarding, in particular, the activities of the Association of manufacturers, importers and suppliers of cosmetics and perfumery (ASCOPA), the Permanent Secretariat of the Competition Commission (COMCO) has requested sanctions against several companies in the perfumes and cosmetics industry. ASCOPA’s membership consists mainly in high-end brands from the selective distribution channel.  L’Oreal Produits de Luxe Suisse, Chanel, Clarins, Parfums Christian Dior and YSL Beauté, are among the companies concerned by this request. The Secretariat of the COMCO, which conducts investigations and prepares the Commission’s decisions, is accusing ASCOPA member companies of “illegal agreements on prices and quantities.”  The Secretariat claims to have accumulated “increasingly obvious evidences that “that the companies concerned were able to harmonize their prices and protect their market share thanks to information exchanges”. L’Oreal’s Swiss subsidiary has denied any violation of the competition laws in Switzerland and said it would respond to the COMCO Secretariat allegations as soon as it will be notified the details as the procedure provides. The proposed fines are calculated based on each company’s turnover and depend on the severity of the violation. They can range from 17,000 to 25.5 million Swiss francs. The Competition Commission will adopt a final decision on the basis of the Secretariat’s report, comments received from concerned firms, as well as on possible hearings."
Health Canada endorses the ISO GMP standard,"In order help cosmetics makers to meet Canadian safety and quality requirements regarding cosmetics, Health Canada has just endorsed the use of the ISO standard 22716 on good manufacturing practices for cosmetics. Heath Canada reminds that the  Food and Drugs Act prohibits the sale of cosmetics that are manufactured, prepared, preserved, packaged or stored under unsanitary conditions, that may cause injury to the health of the user, or that consist of any filthy or decomposed substance or any foreign matter. Under the Act, ""unsanitary"" means: “such conditions or circumstances as might contaminate with dirt or filth, or render injurious to health, a food, drug or cosmetic.” The Canadian health administration encourages all cosmetic manufacturers to adhere to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs).  These guidelines are used to ensure product quality control and an effective approach to risk management. They set out standards for product manufacturing, testing, storage, handling and distribution, to ensure that each step of manufacturing is acceptable for quality and safety of the product. “GMPs do not provide specifics on how products are to be manufactured. Instead they outline the expected outcome of the processes. Each manufacturer, large or small, may have a unique means of achieving these outcomes,” says Health Canada."
Safety of cosmetics for babies: French health agency publishes its recommendations,"Along with the campaigns of inspections and controls conducted in 2009 on products for children under three years of age, the French Agency for the Safety of Health Products (AFSSAPS) has established a multidisciplinary working group regarding the safety evaluation of these products and the characteristics that need to be taken into account in assessing the safety for this age population. The recommendations of the working group have just been published and are about to be forwarded to the European authority for a better harmonization of regulatory requirements within the EU. According to AFSSAPS, the safety assessment of cosmetic products intended for children under 3 years of age must take into account: – the fact that, proportionally to their mass, the body surface of children of 0-3 years is more important than that of adults and that functional maturity of the metabolic systems may not be stabilized before 2 years of age,
– certain specific conditions of exposure, especially at the level of the seat area, which is highly exposed,
– the different types of products, especially not-rinsed products that can be applied several times a day with no limit. For rinsed off products, a retention factor of 10% was also adopted for the calculation of safety margins, where the manufacturer did not measure the actual effectiveness of flushing. Regarding the formulation of cosmetic products for children under 3 years of age, theFrench health agency recommends: – using the lowest number of ingredients and choosing those for which the toxicity profile is well known and with a history use sufficient to ensure safety; 
– distributing required toxicological data according to identified risk factors (area of application and / or product categories [rinsed off / non rinsed]). As far as the safety assessment of finished products, is concerned, the AFSSAPS recommends: – paying attention to the safety of primary packaging and to the opening and closing systems, as well as the physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics of the products,
– performing clinical trials on adults in order to assess skin tolerance and acceptability of the finished product, with the aim to extrapolate results to children under 3 years of age. Eventually, the Agency recommends not using cosmetics on premature babies as long as they are in a neonatology service. For more information, read the Agency’s reports on the assessment and safety of baby products (in French):"
Algeria tightens the conditions for cosmetic imports,"Algerian authorities have decided to strengthen the control of cosmetic products marketed in their country. A decree of the Ministry of Commerce imposes new conditions for the importation, sale and manufacture of cosmetics and personal hygiene products in Algeria [1]. According to this text, published April 21st in the Official Journal, producers and importers will now have to seek authorization from the Ministry of Commerce, prior to marketing any new product. They will have to submit a dossier containing a dozen pieces, including: – name and designation of the product,
– relevant precautions and instructions or information for use,
– indications on the qualitative composition of the product as well as the analytical quality of raw materials involved,
– results of analysis and tests conducted on the raw materials and finished products,
– results of tests and methods implemented regarding, in particular, the degree of skin toxicity, transcutaneous or mucosal,
– method of identification of batches, model and / or a draft of the labelling,
– name, position and professional qualifications of the individual or individuals in charge of the manufacturing, packaging or importation and compliance checks. This permit is issued upon ""opinion of the Scientific and Technical Committee of the Algerian Agency for the control of quality and packaging"", with the selected criteria not being specified in the text. Also according to the decree, the Ministry of Commerce has a delay of 45 days upon the date of receipt for filing the application for authorization, to grant or deny permission for marketing. The publication of this text was expected since the Algerian press had reported the will of the Government to cut down the import bill of cosmetics, but also foster the development of local supply.

Commission warns Sweden to comply with EU rules on cosmetics,"The European Commission says Sweden is infringing EU law on cosmetic products (Directive 76/768/EEC and its amendments) by imposing excessive requirements in the notification process. “The Cosmetics Directive establishes rules to be complied with by any cosmetic product made available on the market, in order to ensure the functioning of the internal market and a high level of protection of human health. The directive provides exhaustively for the harmonisation of national rules on the placing on the market of cosmetics including their packaging and labelling. Member States may not adopt national rules that exceed these requirements in this respect,” the Commission explains. Actually, the current Swedish law on cosmetics and hygiene products contains several requirements that go beyond what is required by the Cosmetics Directive, including: – notification of products already notified in another Member State;
– more information than required for market surveillance purposes which is limited to the address of the place of manufacture of the cosmetic products, or of their initial importation into the Community. According to the Commission, Sweden’s stringent requirements may hinder the functioning of the European internal market.  Therefore, the sending of the Commission’s Reasoned Opinion is the final stage before launching a legal action.  Should Sweden decide to ignore the Commission’s opinion, the case would be referred to the European Court of Justice. Excessive requirements introduced into national laws during the transposition process of European rules are a frequent source of litigation against EU Member States. Slighter legal variations from one country to another are also regarded a source of unnecessary complexity.  To address the issues, the European Union voted a new Cosmetic Products Regulation, (EU Regulation 1223/2009), that will replace the current Cosmetics Directive from 11 July 2013. The provisions of this new regulation will be directly applicable and will not required to be transposed into Member States’ laws thus limiting risks of infringement."
Certification of organic and natural cosmetic products in Europe: how to find one’s way,"At first, Laurence Mulon [1], reminds us that the first natural cosmetics were made in Germany in the 1920s ..., with Weleda in 1922 and Dr. Haushka (Wala) in 1929. While the first French brands only appeared in 1972 with Phyt’s and Paltz in 1976. And it’s only as of 2005, with the help of several media events, that bio cosmetics emerged from their elitist retail channels to conquer other markets. “Of course, it became necessary, considering, during all these years the profusion of emerging labels, to organize all these initiatives. Thus, the creation in 2003, of a European group of harmonization between six national organizations resulted, late 2009, in the publication of the Cosmos Standard. In addition, a European label, NaTrue, was created by several German manufacturers and published in 2008,” she underlines, ""Globally"", explains Laurence Mulon, ""as far as Cosmos is concerned, the indication of bio value corresponds to the bio plant introduced (plant water included). The ratio plant/extract or plant/final product must be considered. A number of ingredients will be concerned during a transitional period of three to five years… But some questions remain unresolved, such as the one on the choice of the logo…The novelty lies in the introduction of the 12 principles of green chemistry…"". Packaging are of course subject to a special status. ""Primary and secondary packaging"" she explains ""must be designed to minimize direct and indirect impacts on the environment during their whole life cycle"". She also underlines, ""the relevance of using cases, unit-doses or wet wipes should be reassessed"" and she adds, ""that plans should be made to have evidence provided during the certification stage of  each element of the packaging,"" bearing in mind that ""some materials are prohibited, such as PVC-based plastics and their derivatives, polystyrene and any materials containing constituents derived from GMOs, biodegradable plastics based on corn starch ...” ""The label offers three level of certification"", explains Laurence Mulon, (natural cosmetics, partly organic natural cosmetics, organic cosmetics), ""but importantly the label presents a novelty by introducing the concept of product categories (13 categories have been defined) inside of which are defined specific certifications criteria"". Currently 282 cosmetic products are certified. The certified companies are essentially German. ""The label emphasizes on limiting packaging to favor recyclable packaging or packaging made of renewable materials"", she underlines, ""and products must be designed for multiple use purpose (except samples)."" Eventually pressurized gas containers are not certifiable."
Nanoproducts: France recommends the precautionary principle,"Several studies suggest that some products containing nanomaterials may present risks to health and environment. It is in any case the conclusion of the French Agency for Environmental and Occupational Health Safety (Afsset), who just published the results of a collective expertise on risk assessment on nanomaterials for general population and the environment. Afsset found several hundred consumer products containing nanomaterials (cosmetics, textiles, food, sports gear, construction materials), for which the agency notes ""a context of scientific uncertainty"". The agency underlines that consumer exposure to manufactured nanomaterials and the environmental dispersion resulting from their consumption, prove ""to be extremely complex to evaluate, both qualitatively and quantitatively"", particularly because of the low traceability of nanomaterials in products intended for consumption. As for studies on risks to health and environment, they represent only 2% of published studies on nanomaterials, and are often affected by many biases (absent or incomplete characterization of nanomaterials, studies conducted on synthetic molecules not deriving from finished products, studies on far higher doses than actual exposure, etc..). In an attempt to better assess the extent of risks Afsset selected and analyzed four types of products incorporating nanoparticles: antibacterial socks (silver nanoparticles), self-cleaning cement, sunscreen (nanoparticles of titanium dioxide), and sugar powder (food nanosilice). These products are widely used and representative of different routes for direct exposure (dermal, by inhalation or by ingestion), but Afsset said that in this area, ""findings of a study conducted on a specific case cannot in any case be generalized or extrapolated to another product in the same category"". Regarding sunscreens, the agency notes that if, until very recently, various studies showed that there was no passage of nanoparticles of titanium dioxide (TiO2) through the skin barrier, "" results of some more recent studies show, on the contrary, the existence of a skin passage and the possibility for these TiO2 nanoparticles to be found in the deep layer of the epidermis"". Afsset considers that the risk to human health cannot be excluded for sunscreens containing TiO2, ""given the uncertainties on the potential for skin penetration and phototoxic activity"". With regard to ecotoxicity, no consistent data is really available. Given this uncertainty, on behalf of the precautionary principle, Afsset recommends acting without delay. The agency thus recommends: – making nanomaterials traceability mandatory, which requires a compulsory declaration from the actors in the industry,
– implementation of clear labelling mentioning the presence of nanomaterials in products and informing on the possibility of release during usage,
– going as far as prohibiting certain uses of nanomaterials for which the usefulness is low compared to potential hazards, at a press conference, Martin Guespereau, Afsset’s Director for instance, declared he was in favor of banning antibacterial socks, given the potential risk and low social utility,
– harmonizing French and European regulations to apply the best practices, especially with a revision of REACH in order to take into account specifically manufactured nanomaterials regardless of tonnage. From this point of view, regulations concerning cosmetics anticipates several points. The new Regulation (EC) N° 1223/2009 of 30 November 2009 provides notification and assessment of the safety of cosmetic products containing nanomaterials (applicable from January first, 2013) and indication of nanomaterials in the list of ingredients. Moreover, given the urgency to progress on the knowledge concerning exposures and potential hazards of nanomaterials, Afsset also makes recommendations for elaborating a revised approach on health risk assessment that is appropriate to nanomaterials specificities."
France: new rules for advertising on cosmetics,"""The updating of this rule (formerly known as ""Health & Beauty"") responds to a need to adapt to some changes that have appeared in the advertising discourse specific to the sector, but also to marketing and scientific developments that characterize the new products which are precisely promoted by the ads"", says the ARPP (previously named BVP) in a statement. As the procedure requires, the initial draft was submitted to the Joint Council for Advertising (Conseil Paritaire de la Publicité) - composed equally of representatives from NGO (consumer and environment) and advertising professionals.  In its opinion, the Council has placed particular emphasis on issues such as the statistical significance of samples used for surveys or refering, in advertising, to techniques such as facelifts, as well as refering to ARPP’s new Code of Sustainable Development for all entries related to environmental protection. According to the ARPP, the new Code of ethics has taken into consideration all of its recommendations. Among the important points introduced by the new Code: – Presentation of performances including figures: Beyond clear display concerning the nature of tests carried out (clinical or customer satisfaction), sample size and average scores on the general population, new rules set limits for any further presentation of more typical results on a smaller proportion of the sample ; – Use of allegations such as “without” / “free”: Such allegation can only be used, provided it is presented in a positive way and only aiming to be informative. Hence, professionals want to avoid proliferation of claims such as “without parabens”, “without preservatives”, “phthalates free”, which could give way to stronger consumer suspicion towards a number of substances, even though they admit there are real expectations from a “growing part of the public” for such information; – Products claimed as “organic” or “natural”: A cosmetic product can only be described as “natural” if the final product contains a minimum of 95 percent of ingredients identified as ""natural"" or ""of natural origin"", and it can only be described as ""organic"" if it contains 100 percent of ingredients derived from certified organic farming and / or if it has been certified ""organic"" by a certification body and / or if it can be proven that it was developed according to published specifications equivalent to those of acknowledged certification bodies. New advertisements will have to comply with these new rules as of March 1st, 2010. All ads are concerned, regardless of the broadcast medium used.

France: getting ready to display environmental information for cosmetic products,"Lagging behind on the subject, for a long time, when compared to a number of its European neighbors, France has chosen to work extra hard on environmental protection. The country’s aim? Get through sustainable growth and green economy within thirty years. In a country where all political sides have long viewed what directly or indirectly looked like an ecologist with the mocking eye lent to dreamers and lunatics, such a conversion cannot be achieved without difficulties or tensions. Yet, two years ago, the country undertook a huge project to ""turn greener"" all of its public policies: the ""Grenelle Environnement"". Environmental information of consumer products, one of the consequences of this new policy, was one of the issues to be debated at the last breakfast organized, on December 17th in Paris, by the BeautyFULL Club, an association of professionals in the beauty industry. Hervé Rebollo, Director of Economic and International Affairs at the French Federation of Beauty Companies (Fédération des entreprises de la beauté, FEBEA), has reviewed for us the situation concerning the different projects and how they could affect the cosmetics industry. ""This request is a ground swell initiated by the public opinion, explains Hervé Rebollo, it is relayed by politicians, eco friendly personalities, NGOs, consumer associations, and by professionals."" For him, no doubt about it, ""you may have your own opinion about this request but it’s impossible to go against it."" Especially now that it is backed up by a law. The law called ""Grenelle 1"", passed in the wake of discussions held at the ""Grenelle Environnement"" stipulates that: ""Consumers must have access to sincere, objective and comprehensive environmental information, on the global characteristics of the pair product / packaging ( ...). Information about environmental impacts of products (...) will be progressively developed."" [1] There is a second law, known as ""Grenelle 2,"" a law which is still under consideration by Parliament, which sets the deadline, stating that consumer information should begin gradually – this point is important, it is not a big bang that is expected, but a gradual onset – as of January 1st, 2011. The goal is very ambitious given the practical difficulties and the financial magnitude of the project. It is also the Grenelle 2 bill which specifies the nature of this environmental labeling. It should refer to ""the equivalent carbon content of products and their packaging, as well as the consumption of natural resources or the impact on natural environments which are attributable to these products during their lifecycle"". The method of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), as defined by ISO [2], is at the heart of the project. For practical purposes, the ADEME [3] and the AFNOR [4] were entrusted the task of proposing a method to achieve this information display. A referencing system of best practices [5] was published in October, but it is only a general method, which must be amended with proposals from sectorial workgroups. ""And we are monitoring this issue closely since we are in charge of the secretarial work of the workgroup 4B, dedicated to cosmetic products and beauty industry,"" underlines Hervé Rebollo. Of course, all this has a cost. To achieve an LCA is not easy and companies will have to mobilize important human and financial resources. The difficulty is also more important for SMEs, which have fewer resources than large groups, which will have to process thousands of references. ""And this does not only concern manufacturers of finished products,"" warns Hervé Rebollo. ""Suppliers will have to participate by providing their clients with the information they need."" And apparently, no subsidy is to be hoped for. The workgroup for cosmetics chose to test the method on shampoos. According to Hervé Rebollo, ""this is actually the best selling item, all networks considered after shower gels"". This guarantees a good visibility of the new information when it is achieved. And shampoos are also the items ""for which there is the most available data, and also they are rinsed products and the issue concerning the impact of our products on aquatic environments is to be considered"". Work is underway, data has been collected from industrials ""and we should very quickly see the outcome"". Note that the use phase is to be taken into consideration: for instance, the energy needed to heat the water during a shampoo has a signficant impact on the results. However, for the time being, the comings and goings of consumers to the stores have not been taken into account in the method used for analysis. Many issues need to be clarified, including the practical details concerning the information to consumers: labelling or posting on the point of sale, or both of them? The question of the inclusion of this French requirement in the European context is also unsolved. For companies in any case, ""the subject should be at the heart of concerns for the 10 or 15 years to come."""
Canada: antiperspirants reclassified as cosmetic products,"The decision to reclassify antiperspirants was adopted this spring following a detailed review of the claims, directions for use, composition and presentation of products currently marketed in Canada. As a consequence, Health Canada’s Cosmetic Division is now accepting Cosmetic Notification Forms for antiperspirants. Notification to Health Canada is mandatory for all cosmetic products sold in Canada. Aluminum-based antiperspirants must therefore comply to the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, Cosmetic Regulations, and other Canadian legislation applicable to cosmetics.  It is the responsibility of the manufacturer/importer to ensure that a cosmetic product placed on the Canadian market is in compliance with all relevant regulatory requirements. The quantity of ingredient(s) in the product must also comply with the limits outlined in the classification document entitled Product Assessment Against Criteria: Antiperspirants, and/or the Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist. Products claiming treatment of hyperhydrosis or extended duration of effect based on modification of organic function are considered drugs under the Food and Drugs Act. They are then considered to be subject to the Food and Drug Regulations or the Natural Health Products Regulations (NHPR) depending on the active ingredient. Any product making such claims may submit an application with supporting data to the Health Products and Food Branch for assessment. Accordingly, Health Canada has listed acceptable and unacceptable claims for cosmetic antiperspirants. Acceptable:
– Antiperspirant
– Reduces (or provides protection against) underarm perspiration
– Reduces (or provides protection against) underarm perspiration due to stress
– Protects against wetness
– 24 hour antiperspirant effect
– Extra effective Unacceptable :
– Antiperspirant for hyperhydrosis/problem perspiration
– Persistent protection (i.e. persistent protection, usually significantly greater than 24 hours, based on a mechanism of action that modifies organic function)
– Stops or prevents perspiration
– Helps check, halt or stop underarm wetness, dampness or perspiration
– Helps keep you dry In the United States, antiperspirants are classified as drugs. In New Zealand, Australia, and the European Union, they are cosmetics."
The Paris City Council warns people about skin-whitening products,"The Paris City Council wishes to warn people concerned, mostly women, of the dangers of whitening dark skins and especially from the use of some products, illegal or diverted from their original use. The campaign includes a serie of poster displays, an educational comic strip entitled Ebony Beauty and an educational booklet on the dangers of lightening creams. It is mainly focused on the Parisian districts mostly affected by this phenomenon (eighteenth, nineteenth and tenth districts). The Paris City Council evaluates that about 20% of women of African origin living in the French capital use lightening products, a number of them containing hydroquinone and topical corticosteroids the use of which, for such purposes, is prohibited in cosmetics. Several police operations aiming to dismantle networks importing and distributing illegal products have already been conducted in Paris in previous years. However, the demand for these creams remains high among women who consider they are more efficient than legal products. The French Federation of Beauty Enterprises (FEBEA), which includes major French manufacturers of cosmetic products has endeavored to point out that this issue was related to the use of illegal products, which consumers often buy on the internet and that safe solutions were available. Such products meant to whiten or lighten the skin are widely used in Africa, India and Asia, and in communities originally from these countries, established in Europe. In India, their use has recently been condemned by some politicians and members of Parliament."
Cosmetics for babies: French authorities want a more accurate assessment,"The General Directorate for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) and the French Agency for the Medical Safety of Health Products (AFSSAPS) found that cosmetic products marketed for babies in France complied with standards, i.e. regarding their composition, their microbiological quality, labeling and content of the regulatory file. ""The compliance rate for samples tested is even high when compared to results usually observed for cosmetic products for adults"", they note in their report. Since last fall, the two administrations in charge of the control of the French market have processed to a total of 32 inspections, including among the suppliers of advertising boxes distributed by maternities, under suspicion since last year by the Committee on Sustainable Development in Health (C2DS). French authorities have also analyzed 79 cosmetic products for children under 3 years of age. ""Our overall assessment of the products tested is good,"" said on her side Nathalie Homobono, General Manager of DGCCRF. In spite of this favorable report, Afssaps and DGCCRF pinpoint ""some deficiencies regarding the quality of documents provided in support of the specific assessment on the safety of these products"". Current regulation in Europe compels manufacturers of cosmetic products for children under three years of age to make a specific assessment regarding the safety of products, but it does not specify the particular tests to be performed. On a total of 47 products tested, no assessment was found for 3 products marketed by the same company and 44 evaluations were considered perfectible (that is 93%) by Afssaps. The companies concerned have positively modified the quality of assessment certificates, but the DGCCRF and Afssaps consider that at this stage, actual improvements cannot be considered sufficient. A draft of recommendations has been developed by a working group under the responsibility of Afssaps. This document is currently under public consultation and should be completed by the end of this year. Its purpose is to provide operators with guidelines that may enable them to improve the quality of their evaluations. Finally, French authorities have indicated their will to maintain, as part of their inspections, particular vigilance on cosmetic products intended for children under three years of age. France will submit the results of its findings to other countries in the European Union to call their attention on the need to strengthen controls on these products in the European market and to harmonize the methods of safety assessment."
"""It is necessary to rationalize raw materials in the catalogue”, Dr Sylvain-Romain Cotte, regulatory expert","Premium Beauty News - What are the areas where you bring your contribution the most? Sylvain-Romain Cotte - After having spent many years in the industry, I created my company, at a time when regulations on cosmetic products were becoming considerably more complex in Europe. On the one hand, the ban on animal testing had been planned and secondly, authorities were setting very ambitious standards in terms of safety and scientific knowledge regarding substances used by manufacturers, in particular with the adoption of REACH. In co-operation with the French Federation of Beauty Enterprises (FEBEA), I assisted the first French companies who initiated audits to test the compliance of their manufacturer premises with Cosmetics Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) [1]. Needless to say that for SRC Consulting, work was plentiful. We operate in areas as diverse as: – organization, by audits of organization for regulatory affairs,
– compliance with French and European regulations (audit, setting-up and management of European legal records on products, assessment on product safety for human health, regulatory validation of communication media and advertisement),
– support for the launch of products on overseas markets,
– Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) for Cosmetics (audit of industrial sites with regard to GMP Cosmetics, accompanying the action plan for compliance),
– regulatory watch (setting-up of a customized regulatory watch, …),
– training (in a number of schools  and universities and through in-house training). Premium Beauty News  - In this increasingly complex regulatory framework, what are the main difficulties encountered by companies in the cosmetics industry? Sylvain-Romain Cotte - Strangely enough, in a world where information sources are more and more available, I feel that the biggest difficulty is finding the right piece of technical information and, above all, to be able to transpose it into industrial practice. Hence the need to get support from experts, but here again, it is not easy to be accompanied by the proper consultants, the ones that have the “industrial reflex” that is to say the knowledge of the operational capability of the company. Then I think the final difficulty is to analyze and assess the risks of regulatory non-compliances to make the proper decisions. Premium Beauty News  - What are the regulatory ""emergencies"" of the moment? Sylvain-Romain Cotte - As far as France is concerned, undoubtedly the implementation of GMP for Cosmetics.  The “Made in France” must be the benchmark for quality in the cosmetics and perfumes industry worldwide.  Then, information and application of the new European Regulation on Cosmetics, and eventually the regulatory watch on ingredients and data computerization. Regarding GMP, operators are now at the budgeting stage, either as manufacturers, for the implementation of the text and to obtain the certification, either as brand owners, to delegate outsourced audits. Premium Beauty News  - What will the entry into force of the European regulation change? Sylvain-Romain Cotte - It will first help clarifying responsibilities of the different actors in the sector, what is going to change in their relationship. It will often involve a new organization of companies in terms of setting-up and management of European legal records. It also changes the assessment of the product safety.  Eventually, it will, in my opinion, encourage in some cases a rationalization of raw materials in the catalogue! Premium Beauty News  - You are launching next month in Paris, Les Matinales de la cosmétique ™ (The Mornings of Cosmetics), can you tell us more? Sylvain-Romain Cotte - In a fairly difficult economical situation, I wanted to create a new concept in professional meetings, both friendly, relevant, operational, effective and economic on highly specific topics related to the cosmetic industry. The number of participants is intentionally limited in order to stimulate discussions. The themes addressed will not only be on regulatory issues, they will also concern subjects related to other issues such as markets, distribution, sustainable development, etc.. with each time, participation of key experts. The frequency of Les Matinales de la Cosmétique™ will depend on the needs of professionals, they will probably occur on a monthly basis. The first meeting on Tuesday November 17, 2009, will specifically focus on  the theme: ""European Cosmetic Regulations: The obligations of the liable person"". I therefore invite all interested professionals to join me at 14 Avenue Georges Mandel - 75116 Paris (Metro Trocadero) from 8.00 sharp (opening at 7:30 am) to 9:45.  The participation fee is 50 € per person. And do remember that seating is limited to 15 attendees. For more information: contact@src-consulting.fr For this first event, I will moderate the meeting with the participation of a surprise speaker, a manufacturer from a prestigious French cosmetic company.  The second event, is scheduled on December 15, 2009, on a very operational issue too."
Health Canada publishes new cosmetic ingredient hotlist,"Health Canada has revised its hotlist of cosmetic ingredients.  The September 2009 Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist replaces the March 2007 version. Several entries were modified, mostly for clarification, and five entries were added: – Cyanoacrylate-based adhesives. This ingredient has been added as a restriction due to safety concerns with products with quick skin bonding properties.
– Diethylene glycol (DEG) (111-46-6).  This ingredient has been added as a restriction due to toxicity concerns.
– Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) (117-81-7).  This ingredient has been added as a prohibition to reflect a declaration of ’toxic’ under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act due to health concerns.
– Glycerin (56-81-5).  This ingredient has been added as a restriction due to possible contamination of diethylene glycol (DEG) in glycerin.
– 1-Naphthol (90-15-3), and its salts.  This ingredient has been added as a restriction due to risk of sensitization. Health Canada has developed the hotlist - a list of substances that are restricted and prohibited in cosmetics to help cosmetic manufacturers satisfy the requirements for sale of a cosmetic. The hotlist is reviewed and updated a few times per year as new scientific data becomes available. Click on the image here below to retrieve the September 2009 Hotlist:"
FDA study: lead level in lipsticks not a safety concern,"After a report released in October 2007 by the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics (CSC), an advocacy group coalizing nonprofit health and environmental organizations, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decided that further follow-up of lead in lipstick was needed. In order to ensure the safety of cosmetic products, FDA scientists have developed and validated a method for determining total lead content in lipstick using microwave-assisted digestion and analysis employing inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).  This new FDA method is highly sensitive, with a detection limit estimated to be 0.04 parts per million (ppm). “In conducting their study, FDA applied a method that determines the total lead content of each of the products tested, not the amount of lead to which a consumer who used the product would have been exposed. This rigorous method destroys the entire product and releases all of the lead present in the product for analysis,” commented the Personal Care Products Council, which represents the cosmetic and personal care products industry. The FDA applied its method to the same selection of lipsticks evaluated by the CSC and found lead in all of the lipsticks tested, ranging from 0.09 ppm to 3.06 ppm with an average value of 0.97 ppm [1] , significantly higher than the highest lead level of 0.65 reported in the 2007 CSC study. However, FDA does not consider the lead levels that it found in the lipsticks to be a safety concern. “The lead levels found are within the range that would be expected from lipsticks formulated with permitted colour additives and other ingredients that had been prepared under good manufacturing practice conditions”.  The agency adds that acceptable levels of lead in lipsticks cannot be compared to those settled for food products as “lipstick is a product intended for topical use, and is only ingested incidentally and in very small quantities”. The Personal Care Products Council agreed.  Lead levels detected in lipsticks are “safe and well below limits recommended by international regulatory and public health authorities,” the Council said in a statement. “Consumers who use lipstick ingest only a tiny fraction of the lipstick they apply, and much of the lead that is ingested in that tiny fraction of lipstick is not biologically available because it is trapped inside larger particles and excreted by the body”. Dr. Sean Palfrey, a professor of pediatrics and public health at Boston University School of Medicine and medical director of Boston’s Lead Poisoning Prevention Program, agreed that the levels are still low, but wondered if they could build up to more toxic amounts, especially in foetuses and children. The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics called on the FDA to “immediately set standards to require manufacturers to minimize lead in lipstick to the lowest achievable levels.”"
REACH may require much more animals and funds than anticipated,"“As toxicologists, we support the aims of REACH - it is the biggest investment into consumer safety ever.  However, we feel that legislators have underestimated the scale of the challenge,” say Thomas Hartung [1] and Constanza Rovida [2] the authors of a study funded by the Trans-Atlantic Think Tank for Toxicology at John Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, and commented in the August 26 edition of Nature. The full analysis appears as an electronic prepublication of the September 2009 edition of the journal ALTEX, Alternatives to Animal Experimentation. Hartung and Costanza have calculated that REACH may require 54 million research animals and EUR 9.5 billion (USD 13.4 billion) over the next 10 years, which represents 20 times the number of animals and 6 times the cost anticipated in previous estimates. Currently, the EU uses approximately 900,000 animals at a cost of EUR 600 million (USD 847 million) per year to evaluate new chemicals, drugs, pesticides and food additives. When REACH was voted, it was expected that 27,000 companies would submit 180,000 pre-registrations on 29,000 substances. Instead, some 65,000 companies made more than 2.7 million pre-registrations for in excess of 140,000 substances. REACH aims to complete data collection on these substances by 2018. However, in recent decades Europe has tested some 200-300 new chemicals each year, making REACH an unprecedented challenge. “Toxicologists do not have the appropriate tools to meet these expectations,” claim the authors of the study. According to them, 90 percent of the projected animal use and 70 percent of the projected cost would come from research into reproductive toxicity testing. “A revision of test approaches especially for reproductive toxicity is essential. There is no alternative to REACH, but there will be no REACH without alternatives,” says Hartung. “Clearly, the exact numbers will only be known once all the registrations are submitted and testing proposals are received, but, based on the information that we have and our discussions with industry, the numbers provided in this study are thankfully very wide of the mark,” commented Geert Dancet, Executive Director of ECHA, the European Chemicals Agency. According to ECHA, Hartung and Costanza’s study overestimates three things: the likely number of substances that will be registered under REACH and requiring a full data set, the likely number of tests and laboratory animals required, and the likely costs for conducting the tests. “The original estimates on the number of animals still hold,” concludes ECHA, that is to say that 9 million laboratory animals would be involved in the tests required and that the costs for conducting the tests would amount to 1.3 billion euros."
SGS to certify compliance with the EFfCI’s GMP guidelines ,"The set of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines developed by the European Federation for Cosmetic Ingredients (EFfCI) are designed to help both EFfCI members, and others within the industry, to minimise or eliminate incidents of contaminations, mix-ups and other errors by controlling all the components that can affect product quality. EFfCI has entered a long-term agreement with SGS, so as the inspection, testing and certification company will offer the possibility of GMP certification, based on EFfCI’s GMP guidelines, to the members of EFfCI as well as to non-members who want to manage and improve the quality and safety of their cosmetics products."
What standard for natural and organic cosmetic products?,"After six years of intensive work and an international public consultation of three months, the European Cosmetics Standards Working Group has released the final outcome with the publication of Cosmos-standard, which harmonises the minimum requirements for organic and natural cosmetics of Europe’s leading certifications bodies: Soil Association (UK), BDiH (Germany), Cosmebio and Ecocert (France), ICEA (Italy) and Ecogarantie (Belgium). Combined, these agencies provide certification to about 1,000 cosmetic companies and 10,000 products Certification of the new Cosmos standard is expected to begin in September 2009, once the agencies will have harmonized the key points of the subsequent control plan. The objective of this new Standard is ambitious and goes beyond the harmonization of European rules as concerned certification bodies clearly show their ambition to go further with the setting of an internationally accepted standard for organic and natural cosmetics. “Other certification/inspection bodies that are not members of the group will have the possibility to apply to use this Standard. The procedure for application and authorisation will be opened as from September 30th, 2009” explains Francis Blake of Soil Association. However, according to Organic Monitor, a market research agency specialising on natural and organic products, “Cosmos is losing impetus because of its lengthy gestation period. A number of new initiatives, introduced in the last 18 months, are gaining momentum and could outpace Cosmos”. Organic Monitor says that the NaTrue certification, which was launched in May 2008, with the first certified products coming into the market at the end of the year, is growing in popularity, “partly because it is backed by some of the leading brands of natural cosmetics in Europe”. Furthermore, a number of developments are occurring in the USA, where three separate initiatives are now moving forward with the backing of large cosmetic manufacturers. The frontrunner is Natural Products Association (NPA), which launched its natural standard in May 2008. Over 200 products are now certified according to the NPA standard. Burt’s Bees is one of the main supporters of the NPA standard, providing US $1 million to raise awareness of the new standard and NPA logo. The National Science Foundation (NSF) standard is expected to gain popularity. The NSF 305 standard is for cosmetic products that contain a minimum of 70% organic ingredients. Developed by leading organic cosmetic companies, it has recently received official recognition by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The main rival to the NSF 305 standard is OASIS, supported by large companies like Aveda and Hain Celestial. Organic Monitor also notes that similar developments are occurring in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific where a number of private standards have been introduced. Organic Monitor expects standards that provide regional coverage to be the most successful. The company considers that NaTrue is winning support because of its uniform labelling scheme, while Cosmos will not replace any of the existing symbols and logos. “For this reason, initial interest in Cosmos is expected to mainly come from companies who already have products certified by Cosmos member organisations,” says Organic Monitor. The NaTrue standard is also taking the lead for a possible global natural and organic cosmetics standard. It has already entered an equivalency agreement with NSF for its made with organic ingredients standard. A similar equivalency agreement with NPA for the natural standard is scheduled to be signed in July."
FDA warns consumers on bacterial contamination risk in skin products,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced yesterday (June 08, 2009) that Clarcon Biological Chemistry Laboratory Inc., a skin care manufacturer headquartered in Roy, Utah, is voluntarily recalling some skin sanitizers and skin protectants marketed under several different brand names because of high levels of disease-causing bacteria found in the products. The contamination was revealed during a recent FDA’s inspection of the Clarcon facility. “Analyses of several samples of over-the-counter topical antimicrobial skin sanitizer and skin protectant products revealed high levels of various bacteria, including some associated with unsanitary conditions”, the agency reveals. The inspection uncovered serious deviations from FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements. The FDA adds these findings are particularly concerning because the products are promoted as antimicrobial agents that claim to treat open wounds, damaged skin, and protect against various infectious diseases. “Some of these bacteria can cause opportunistic infections of the skin and underlying tissues,” FDA adds.  Such infections may need medical or surgical attention, and may result in permanent damage. The FDA is warning consumers to not use any Clarcon products and to throw these products away in household refuse."
EU trade partners in dilemma with ban on animal testing,"Campaigns from animal rights groups in Europe have gained public support against the use of animals for testing the safety of cosmetic products.  In September 2004, the European Union officially prohibited the use of animals for testing finished cosmetic products. More recently, on 11 March 2009, two bans entered into force prohibiting any further testing on animals to assess the safety of ingredients, whether or not an alternative method is available, but tests measuring long-term toxic effects are temporarily exempted and will be phased out on 11 March 2013 only. These bans have alerted the cosmetics industry in countries such as China and Japan, where animal tests are still the prevailing method to assess the safety of cosmetic products. The European Union prohibits the sale of cosmetic products that contain ingredients tested on animals for the purpose of meeting the requirements of own legislation on cosmetics, wherever in the world the tests were performed.  While this question is not entirely clear, it is likely that ingredients tested on animals in a non-EU country for meeting the requirements of this country would not be concerned by the ban and that manufacturers in these countries would still be allowed to export their products to the European Union. However, while their products may still be legally imported into the European Union, China and Japan have understood it may not be sustainable from a marketing perspective. On the other hand, European companies exporting to China and Japan may have to conduct animal tests to get their products accepted by local authorities. The latest edition of China’s Hygiene Standards for Cosmetics effective on 1 July 2007 still requires using animals for tests of toxicity, such as acute oral toxicity test, acute dermal toxicity test, dermal irritation/corrosion test, acute eye irritation/corrosion test, skin sensitisation test, skin phototoxicity test, subchronic oral toxicity test, subchronic dermal toxicity test, teratogenicity test, and combined chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity test. Alternative non-animal based tests are still in their preliminary stage of development in China.  However, Chinese authorities are working to shift to alternative methods and have started to trigger a decrease in the use of animals based testing. Japan’s law requires using animal tests to assess the safety of products classified as quasi-drugs, such as skin-lightening products, suntan lotion and hair growth tonics that can be advertised as medicinal, and companies are expected to carry out animal testing whenever they add or change ingredients. In 2005, Japanese authorities created the Japanese Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Methods, but the project was lacking staff and funds.  The secretariat for the Center is now under the responsibility of the National Institute of Health Sciences. But the country first needs to adopt a legal framework to officially aim at decreasing the number of tests performed on animals."
"Taiwan creates agency to supervise drugs, food, cosmetics","Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan just passed a bill creating an agency to supervise safety issues related to food, drugs and cosmetics placed on the market. Under the Department of Health (DOH), the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA) will take charge of issues previously handled by the DOH’s Bureau of Pharmaceutical Affairs, Bureau of Food Safety, Bureau of Food and Drug Analysis and Bureau of Controlled Drugs."
MEPs call for more prudence on nanomaterials,"MEPs deplore the absence of a proper evaluation of nanomaterials in the European Union. They say nanomaterials potentially present significant new risks due to their size, such as increased reactivity and mobility, possibly leading to increased toxicity in combination with unrestricted access to the human body, and possibly involving quite different mechanisms of interference with the physiology of human and environmental species. The Parliament calls for the provision of information to consumers on the use of nanomaterials in consumer products: all ingredients present in the form of nanomaterials in substances, mixtures or articles should be clearly indicated in the labelling of the product (e.g. in the list of ingredients, the name of such ingredients should be followed by the word ’nano’ in brackets) on the model of what it will soon be compulsory for cosmetic products. Thus the report calls specifically on the Commission to evaluate the need to review REACH concerning: – simplified registration for nanomaterials manufactured or imported below one tonne,
– consideration of all nanomaterials as new substances,
– a chemical safety assessment for all registered nanomaterials, featuring exposure assessment. MEPs also ask the Commission to evaluate the need to review worker protection legislation, and the development of adequate testing protocols and metrology standards to assess the hazard of, and exposure of workers, consumers and the environment to nanomaterials over their entire life cycle, including in the case of accidents, using a multi- disciplinary approach."
Cosmetic innovation under REACH,"Premium Beauty News - First of all, what is Reach? Laurence Mulon - REACH, stands for Registration Evaluation Authorization, of Chemicals. The regulation came into force on 1 June 2007 with the aim to assess the risk of chemicals with regard to human health and the environment. Its scope covers all chemicals placed on the European market in quantities exceeding one 1000kg per year. REACH stands on a basic principle: “No Data, No Market”. Furthermore, REACH also includes compulsory data sharing provisions within the frame of the evaluation procedure, with the aim to reduce tests performed on vertebrates. Premium Beauty News - What is the outline of the registration procedure? Laurence Mulon - Registration became compulsory on June 1, 2007. However, the substances that were already sold in Europe and were duly pre-registered before this date benefit from extended registration deadlines. The deadline depends on the tonnage band and the hazardous properties of the substance. The staggered deadlines are: 30 November 2010, 31 May 2013 or 31 May 2018 Registration is costly and it is likely that some substances that suppliers will deem unprofitable as such will be withdrawn from the market. Another consequence should be the increased cost of registered substances. Premium Beauty News - How can REACH be accommodated with the other regulatory requirements already applicable to cosmetics? Laurence Mulon - The legislation governing cosmetic products in Europe is constantly evolving. Tests on animals have been banned for both finished products and the ingredients (within a detailed schedule), the labelling of fragrance allergens is now compulsory and the use of substances classified as CMR 1 and 2 has been prohibited, such as the use of some glycol ethers. As far as cosmetic ingredients are concerned, REACH adds another regulatory layer to the rules applicable to cosmetics. However, the two sets of regulations may be divergent and sometimes contradictory, in particular regarding the toxicological evaluation of substances used as cosmetic ingredients. with testing on animals is allowed contrary to the directive.  While tests on animals are forbidden by the regulations applicable to cosmetics products, there are compulsory under REACH.  The European Commission subsequently had to clarify this point ad has indicated that the toxicologic evaluation could be performed using animals for any use but cosmetic. Premium Beauty News - In such circumstances how is it possible to combine regulatory compliance and innovation? Laurence Mulon - There are plenty sources of inspiration and innovation available to cosmetics and perfumes manufacturers, whether they choose to use determined chemicals or natural substances. The first ones are covered by REACH but for the latter ones the situation is more difficult. Indeed, REACH is not the best tool for natural substances as it is not adapted to the specificity and complexity of botanicals. That is the reason why concerned trade bodies have issued a common position regarding the use of natural substances. They submitted this position to the European Commission on November 2007 and to ECHA at the end of 2008. Premium Beauty News - In your opinion, what is the best way to behave under REACH ? Laurence Mulon - I have the conviction that the constraints that REACH imposes should stimulate the emergence of innovations. The sourcing of new raw materials being simultaneously environment-friendly and ethical and « natural », may be a solution. Another way is to innovate through greener manufacturing processes and through the development of new formulations. Eventually, organisational innovations are also required, based on the concepts of substance (instead of raw material) and of sustainable development at every step of the supply chain. Premium Beauty News - What about innovation in the future? Laurence Mulon - In the past, the beauty industry and beauty products have already been submitted to this kind of innovation-stimulating regulatory constraints.  In the future, regulatory requirements should continue to complexify themselves.  NGO should also increase their pressure through the media.  These new requirements are becoming strategic trigger to innovation."
EU scientific advisory committees elect their chairs,"On 26 and 27 March 2009, the new European Commission scientific committees on consumer, health and environmental risks held their inaugural plenary sessions.

New EU cosmetics regulation: what’s changing?,"After one reading, the European Parliament agreed on 24 March 2009 on a compromise text negotiated together with the Council and aiming at simplifying procedures while strengthening certain elements of the regulatory framework for cosmetics. The new legislation will take the form of a European Regulation, making it immediately enforceable as law in all EU member states simultaneously. At the difference of the Directive currently applicable to cosmetic products [1], the new text will not need to be transposed into national law in each member states, thus not giving room for diverging interpretations. As part of the simplification of administrative procedures, the text creates a single EU-wide register for cosmetic products and increases the cooperation between market surveillance authorities. In replacement of the various national procedures, the text introduces an EU-wide compulsory notification system of cosmetic products, including the obligation to declare the presence of substances in the form of nanomaterials before placing products on the market. The required information will be transmitted to the Commission through electronic means. Undesirable side effects induced by cosmetic products will also be monitored at the European scale. For the first time ever, a European legislation addresses nanoparticles as such. As requested by the European Parliament, the new regulation introduces a safety assessment procedure for all products containing nanomaterials, which could lead to a ban on a substance if there is a risk to human health. Cosmetic products containing nanoparticules will have to be notified to the Commission six months prior being placed on the market. In case of concern regarding the safety of a nanomaterial, the Commision will have to seize the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) for giving an opinion. Members of European Parliament (MEPs) also pushed successfully for any nanomaterials present in cosmetics to be mentioned in the list of ingredients on the packaging. In the list of ingredients, concerned substances will be followed by the word “nano” in brackets (e.g.: Titanium dioxyde [nano]). MEPs have also introduced a definition of a nanomaterial as “an insoluble or bioresistant and intentionally manufactured material with one or more external dimensions, or an internal structure, on the scale from 1 to 100 nm.” This is the first time that a definition of nanomaterials is introduced in European law. The Commission will have to adapt this definition in line with scientific and technological advances. However, environmental organisations and the BEUC, the European consumers’ organisation, have criticised the s narrowness of the definition’s scope. On the use of product claims for cosmetics, the Commission is asked to adopt a list determining common criteria. Such a list aims at harmonising the opinion of public authorities in the various member states concerning what claims are acceptable or unacceptable for cosmetic products. The regulation provides for strict rules for the use of substances which are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction (CMR). The use of those substances is basically forbidden in cosmetics and they can only be used in exceptional cases under strict conditions, which have been tightened up by the compromise. The proposed text also addresses substances with endocrine-disrupting properties, that will be regulated when European or internationally agreed criteria for identifying them or at the latest five years after the Regulation has entered into force. The existing provisions banning animal testing for finished cosmetic products as of 2004, with a phasing-out period for animal tests on cosmetic ingredients by 2009/2013, are unaffected by the new regulation MEPs adopted the proposed regulation with 633 votes in favour, 29 against with 11 abstentions.  The Council must now approve the same text so that it becomes law and comes into effect in 2012 Download text here:"
EU ban on animal testing raises questions,"On 11 March 2009, two bans entered into force.  The first ban prohibits any further testing on animals to assess the safety of ingredients, whether or not an alternative method is available, but tests measuring long-term toxic effects are temporarily exempted and will be phased out on 11 March 2013 only. In brief, it is now illegal to use animals for assessing the skin irritancy, phototoxicity, corrosivity, percutaneous absorption, genotoxicity, ocular irritancy and acute toxicity of cosmetic products. But using animals to perform carcinogenicity, photoallergy, cutaneous sensitivity, toxicokinetics, reprotoxicity, teratogenesis, toxicity – sub chronic and chronic, and photomutagenesis tests remains acceptable until 11 March 2013. Furthermore, there are grey areas regarding the so-called “multiple purpose ingredients”. Certain ingredients are not only used to make cosmetics but pharmaceuticals, or detergents or whatever else. These ingredients are therefore submitted to other regulations that may require performing animal tests. Scientists from other industry sectors in Europe, such as the pharmaceutical, chemical and food industries, are all legally obliged to use alternative methods where they exist. But where there’s none? Another limit is REACH.  Indeed, the EU regulation for the Registration, Evaluation, and Authorisation of Chemicals requires just about all substances produced or imported into the EU in quantities of more than one tonne, to be tested, even if these substances are part of an object. REACH applies to all substances, regardless of whether they are new or not.  The difficulty is that the vast majority of substances will be tested on animals because REACH requires it, not because of their use in cosmetics but because of other uses, and the non-availability of alternatives. Eventually, there are also grey areas in the second ban that entered into force last week. The ban prohibits the sale of cosmetic products that contain ingredients tested on animals for the purpose of meeting the requirements of the EU Cosmetics Directive, wherever in the world the tests were performed, but what about ingredients that have been tested on animals in a non-EU country for meeting the requirements of this country? The use of animals for testing finished cosmetic products has been prohibited since September 2004. The impact of this initial ban was low as “the European cosmetics industry had already moved away from testing cosmetic products on animals some time before this,” claims the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA) in a release. However, certain finished products may nevertheless be tested on animals to comply with the regulation of non-EU States. That is the case of cosmetics exported to China. In order to be sold in this country, cosmetics must be tested on animals (the tests are performed by Chinese authorities in accredited laboratories). The situation is similar for Chinese products imported in the European Union.  These products are not concerned by the EU bans because they have not been tested on animals to meet the requirements of the European Cosmetics Directive, but those of overseas regulations. Considering the answers to the questions above it is unlikely that these claims disappear.  Voluntary certifications, such as the Leaping Bunny Program or the Humane Cosmetics Standard of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV), will certainly try to address grey areas and loopholes of the legislation in order to continue to sort “cruelty-free” products from the others. These certifications may help consumers to sort products complying with their personal convictions, but they may also add to the confusion by implying that in the context of a general ban certain some companies are more ethical than others! Testing ingredients on animals is now banned irrespective of whether there is an alternative method available. Actually, validated alternatives exist for only four of the seven categories of tests for which the ban is now effective. Companies have no option when it comes to assess the ocular irritancy, skin sensitivity or toxicokinetics, for instance. Does that mean that new ingredients may be used while some important information about the safety would be lacking?  The Cosmetics Directive would not permit it, as its second article, providing that “a cosmetic product put on the market within the Community must not cause damage to human health” is always applicable.  However, it is not unlikely that ingredient innovation be partially blocked by the ban as long as additional alternatives are not available. Difficulties may occur when long-time used cosmetic ingredients become suspicious. In such a case, the Directive provides that “where serious concerns arise as regards the safety of an existing cosmetic ingredient a Member State may request the Commission to grant a derogation” in order to perform animal tests. However, this option is strictly limited and derogations are only granted in exceptional circumstances."
French Health Agency sifts through organic cosmetics,"The survey was conducted last year over 30 product samples corresponding to 28 different products gathered from the whole French territory by AFSSAPS and DGCCRF inspectors. 22 out of the 28 products were certified organic or natural products (Ecocert, Visagro, ICEA-AIAB, BDIH), while 6 were only labelled as “natural / organic product”. Furthermore, 12 products claimed to be preservative free and 16 claimed to be paraben free and / or phenoxyethanol free. The later were using other preservatives such as benzoic or sorbic acid, benzoic alcohol and dehydroacetic acid. Eventually, despite a restrictive use of preservatives, the Agency deems the microbial quality of tested products is “satisfactory”.  Nevertheless, batches of a product contaminated with pseudomonas putida bacteria have been withdrawn from the market. Another product was notified a lack of microbial protection that could lead to a contamination during its foreseeable period of use. The most surprising results came from the chemical analysis of the products.  Indeed, tests revealed that 6 products claiming to be “paraben and / or phenoxyethanol free” contained traces of methylparaben at a concentration varying from 0.01 to 0.04%.  Another product, claiming to be preservative free contained traces of benzoic or sorbic acid salts. However, according to the Agency “concentrations detected are 20 to 60 times lower than the maximum limits permitted by the regulation.”  Actually, the presence of these traces could result from their use in the raw materials, in particular in ingredients from botanical origin. Concerned companies would not have deliberately misled consumers buy would have failed to correctly control their supply chain. In parallel, the DGCCRF has warned manufacturers that highlighting the absence of a specific preservative in the product’s formula, while the product would contain other types of anti-bacterial agents could be considered as misleading for the consumer.  “Providing consumers with information that is voluntarily incomplete, might be considered as misleading about the actual product’s formula,” states the control body in a release."
Transatlantic partnership for “Made with Organic” cosmetics,"Brussels-based Natural and Organic Cosmetic Association (NaTrue) and US-based Quality Assurance International (QAI), are partnering for the mutual recognition of their respective “made with organic ingredients” standards for personal care products. NSF/ANSI 305 Made with Organic Personal Care Products is a consensus-based standard for personal care products featuring organic ingredient specifications. NSF/ANSI 305 was recently adopted as an American National Standard by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). It was developed by NSF International with the participation of key stakeholder groups, including organic personal care manufacturers, trade associations, regulators and organic product retailers. The NSF/ANSI 305 standard allows “made with organic” claims for products with organic content of 70 percent or more that comply with all other requirements of the standard. Products covered by the standard include rinse-off and leave-on personal care and cosmetic products, as well as oral care and personal hygiene products.  The standard specifies materials, processes, production criteria, and conditions that shall be met in order for made with personal care products to make organic label and marketing claims. Quality Assurance International (QAI) is a USDA-accredited certifying agent who provides organic certification of products within the NSF/ANSI 305 standard. NaTrue, which launched its natural cosmetics label last year, just announced that 100 products have been certified as of February 1st 2009. According NaTrue the partnership was made possible as both the NaTrue-Label and the NSF/ANSI 305 standard, whilst not identical, share “the same fundamental objective”. In order to help manufacturers to demonstrate compliance with both standards, QAI and NaTrue are developing a guidance document to identify the differences and analyze gaps. By consolidating two certification processes into one, this initiative is expected to create important cost-savings and time- savings for interested manufacturers."
Triclosan: European experts cautious about safety,"The SCCP, one of the three independent non-food panels of experts that provide the European Commission with scientific advice, considers that “the continued use of triclosan as a preservative at the current concentration limit of maximum 0.3% in all cosmetic products is not safe for the consumer because of the magnitude of the aggregate exposure”. The SCCP opinion [1] is based on new toxicological data provided by the industry. In particular, data from the percutaneous absorption studies conducted with triclosan [2] indicate that it was relatively well absorbed through the skin in all species tested. However, “the use of triclosan at a maximum concentration of 0.3% in toothpastes, hand soaps, body soaps/shower gels and deodorant sticks is considered safe,” the SCCP says. Any additional use of triclosan in face powders and blemish concealers at this concentration is also considered safe. Actually, the SCCP considers that well documented studies on human exposure show that that triclosan is safe in these cases. Nevertheless, the use of triclosan in other leave-on products (e.g. body lotions) and in mouthwashes is not considered safe for the consumer due to the resulting high exposures. Eventually, the SCCP says that before a final conclusion on the safety of triclosan in cosmetic products can be reached, the potential development of resistance to triclosan and cross-resistance by certain micro-organisms must be assessed. This aspect will be discussed in a separate opinion and is also investigated by the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks."
Cosmetics for babies: safety assessments must be improved,"Polemics that sparkled during the Autumn 2008 in France aboutthe safety of baby care cosmetic products, led the Agency to tighten its controls on products intended for children of less than 3 years old. A first set of eighteen inspections was subsequently performed on a panel of forty products (wet wipes, foaming gels…), with the aim “to take stock of the data available and the work already conducted by manufacturers,” but also “to verify that firms do comply with their obligations”. Inspections did not reveal major discrepancies with regard to ingredients in the products, microbial quality or labelling. As far as these areas are concerned, controlled products duly complied with applicable regulations. However, the AFSSAPS pointed out safety assessment loopholes. Inspections revealed that companies would partly fail to comply with the specific assessment requirements applicable to products for children less than 3 years old.  This additional assessment has been required since November 2004. The Agency said that requests for additional information were sent to several manufacturers who presented “incomplete” data. Furthermore, the Agency suspended the manufacture and sale of a product for which this specific assessment was missing. According to the AFSSAPS, methods used by cosmetics makers for assessing the safety of products for young children do not give satisfaction.  A dedicated working group was created within the Agency, with the aim to identify what are the key issues for this specific assessment and in order to issue official recommendations.  A first meeting was held on October 2008 and concerned companies were consulted."
Europe updates its regulations for cosmetic ingredients ,"The directive 2009/06/EC of 4 February 2009 [1] prohibits the use of phytonadione and of diethylene glycol (DEG) in all cosmetic products put on the market of the European Union. The prohibition of phytonadione (a man-made form of vitamin K) in cosmetic products is due to the fact that this substance may cause cutaneous allergy and individuals so affected may be denied an important therapeutic agent. Concerning diethylene glycol (DEG), scientific experts of the European Union consider that it should not be used as an ingredient in cosmetic products, but that a maximum concentration of up to 0,1 % of DEG from impurities in the finished cosmetic products can be considered to be safe. This is the reason why, in spite of this substance being banned for use in cosmetic products, presence of residual traces are admitted up to 0,1 %. Furthermore, the directive has restricted the use of toluene, a substance classified as a CMR substance of category 3, of diethylene glycol monobutyl ether (DEGBE) and of ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (EGBE). Toluene is subsequently limited to 25 % in nail products and its inhalation by children should be avoided. The use of DEGBE as a solvent in hair dye products is limited to a concentration up to 9,0 %. The use of EGBE as a solvent is limited to a maximum concentration of 4,0 % in oxidative hair dye products and 2,0 % in non-oxidative hair dye products. Member States shall apply those provisions from 5 November 2009. However, they shall apply the provisions concerning the substance toluene from 5 February 2010.

Canada to restrict the use of four chemicals in cosmetics,"Canadian Minister of Health, Leona Aglukkaq, and Minsiter of Environment, Jim Prentice, have announced that assessment measures of batches of chemical substances used in Canada have concluded that five of them are potentially harmful to human health (thiourea, Pigment Yellow 34, Pigment Red 104, isoprene and epichlorohydrin), while three others appear to be of concern to the environment. “Although Canadians’ exposure to the five substances of concern to human health is very low, regulations are being proposed for four of these substances to prevent them from being used in the future without undergoing a new series of assessments. In addition, two of these substances will be added to the Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist to prevent their future use in cosmetics,” the Government announced. The substances that will be prohibited ain cosmetics are epichlorohydrin and isoprene, which are sometimes used to manufacture lipstick and other personal care products in the USA and Canada. Three other substances were found toxic to the environment: siloxanes D4 and D5, and 2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenol or TTBP. Siloxanes D4 and D5 are used as emollients to soften the skin. Siloxanes are found in most personal care products on the market in Canada and the United States. The siloxanes are also used in textiles, paints and coatings, antiperspirants, sealants, lubricants, plastics, non-medical ingredients in pharmaceuticals, silicone polymers, food additives, surface treatments. The final assessments conclude that siloxanes are not a concern for human health, based on the amount of these substances that an individual would be exposed to through the use of various products, including personal care products.  However, siloxanes D4 and D5, which are widely used in products across Canada, are considered as entering the environment in relatively large quantities, stay in the environment a long time (persistent), and may harm fish and aquatic organisms. “To limit the amount of D4 and D5 that is released to the environment, the Government of Canada is proposing to set a concentration limit for D4 and D5 in products. This will minimize the amount of D4 and D5 in personal care products that is released to municipal wastewater streams when they are washed off,” the Government explained. The third substance (TTBP), a fuel additive, will be managed so that releases to the environment will be reduced below levels that can be measured. The Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 requires every new chemical substance made in Canada or imported from other countries since 1994 be assessed against specific criteria. In 2006, Canada completed the major task of systematically sorting through the approximately 23,000 existing substances introduced into Canada before the creation of stronger environmental legislation. This exercise was called ""categorization."""
Canada opens consultation on heavy metal impurities,"The purpose of Health Canada’s guidance is to determine and communicate appropriate limits for heavy metal impurities in cosmetic products, particularly limits for lead, arsenic, cadmium, mercury and antimony that are known to have significant toxicological properties. Actually, these heavy metals, as well as chromium, are prohibited as intentional ingredients in cosmetic products sold in Canada. “Yet impurities exist due to the persistent nature of these substances and the fact that they are found in the natural environment,” Health Canada points out. The draft guidance provides that “heavy metal impurities in cosmetic products are unavoidable due to the ubiquitous nature of these elements, but should be removed wherever technically feasible” and that heavy metal concentrations in cosmetic products would be seen to be technically avoidable when they exceed the following limits: “These levels are based on background levels found in cosmetic products sampled in Canada and are in line with acceptable levels of impurities in other jurisdictions,” Health Canada comments."
Terms of payment in France: consequences of recent regulatory changes,"As far as business to business trade relations are concerned, the shortening of settlement periods is, together with the end of slotting fees, the most important innovation of the recent Law for the modernization of the French economy. “For the first time, a law aims to shorten settlement periods, which used to be very long in France,” Frédéric Manin said. The law provides that the settlement period cannot exceed 45 days from the last day of the month, or 60 calendar days, starting from the date of the invoice. According to Frédéric Manin, this new threshold combines the advantages of transparency and, for the first time, of possible sanction from public authorities. “There are derogatory provisions, but they need a formal agreement within a defined industry, they are submitted to restrictive conditions and can only be temporary,” Mr Manin explained. Furthermore, no “rebate” can be claimed to compensate shortened payment terms subsequent to this new regulatory framework.  Such rebates are admissible only when they are applied as to compensate a real commercial service, not the mere application of the law shortening payment terms."
China to require full labelling of cosmetic ingredients,"According to Chinese media reports, Beijng authorities will require cosmetic products, whether imported or locally-made to be marked with all their ingredients. Current Chinese regulations [1] require cosmetics to be labelled with the following indications: – name and address of the manufacturer,
– name and address of the importer / distributor or of the legally registered agent in China (for imported goods),
– name of the product [2]
– net quantity,
– date of production and ‘quality assurance period’, or, batch number of production and expiry date,
– storage conditions that are required to guarantee the minimum durability of the product and its safety (if necessary),
– safety precautions and directions for use,
– country of origin,
– production license and hygiene license numbers (or registration numbers, for imported cosmetics), and the number of the corresponding product standard. Of course, these mandatory requirements are to be labelled in Chinese. If confirmed, China’s requirement for a full labelling of cosmetic ingredients would align Chinese regulations on Europe and US laws, both requiring cosmetic producers to disclose the lists of ingredients in their products. The new requirement is set to be effective before June 2010 and the sales of products failing to meet the new policy would be prohibited at that time."
What’s new with intellectual property rights in France?,"Premium Beauty News - The law governing intellectual property rights in France was reinforced recently.  Could you give us more details? Matthieu Bourgeois - This reinforcement of the legislation is mainly due to the “law for the modernisation of the economy”, in French loi de modernisation de l’économie or LME, dated August 4 2008. The new law primarily focused on improving the protection of brand licensees. Whether they hold rights on a trademark, a patent or a design, licensees are now entitled to participate in intellectual property infringement proceedings against a third party, even though in the event where their license contract would not have been published by the French trademark office (Institut National de la Propriété Industrielle - INPI). The previous situation, which was a major obstacle to fight infringement behaviours, is now outdated. Secondly, the LME provides that all litigation related to intellectual property rights shall be the jurisdiction of the French civil court (the Tribunal de grande instance). It is something new for copyrights that used to be in the jurisdiction of commercial or labour courts. Litigations between employers and employees, where intellectual property issues are more and more frequent, should no longer be submitted to labour courts (Conseils des prud’hommes). This may decrease the number of cases that employees submit to courts, as they will have to file two proceedings, thus implying additional costs. Premium Beauty News - What about trademarks?

Matthieu Bourgeois - The LME authorized the French government to implement the main provisions of the Singapore Treaty [1] . The implementation has been fulfilled through the Ordinance N. 2008-1301 of the French government of December 11, 2008 [2] , which simplifies and improves the trademark registration proceedings in France. However, this text is a bit disappointing, as it does not contain anything new about the scope of protection of trademarks, while certain provisions of the Singapore Treaty dealing with non-visible signs, such as olfactory signs, for instance, would have made possible to introduce some changes in this area. Unfortunately, the divergence between the French law - which still refuses olfactory signs as trademarks - and the OHMI, the European office in charge of European trademarks - which accepts the validity of such signs as trademarks [3] - is still pending. Premium Beauty News - Did the law also change the rules governing patents?

Matthieu Bourgeois - As far as patents are concerned, there are two important news in the LME. On the one hand, the patentability field is extended to “technological sectors” [4] , and to the second therapeutic application [5] . On the other hand, the LME provides that a patent holder has the possibility to limit the scope of protection of its own patent, in order to escape to the nullity that would be raised by the adversory party during infringement proceedings. Once again, French lawmakers have greatly improved the protection of owners’ of intellectual property rights. Indeed, the nullity of patents was often raised when their scope was not sufficiently described."
French health agency slashes Cattier,"The French Agency has suspended the manufacture and sale of a body and hair foaming gel produced by natural and organic cosmetics maker Cattier.  The Agency says key documents are missing in the product’s information package. French and European regulations require cosmetics manufacturers to keep an information file readily available to control bodies for each product placed on the European Union market.  According to the French agency, Cattier has no been able to show the assessment corresponding to the concerned foaming gel. Subsequently, the specific assessment regarding products intended for children’s is also missing. The AFSSAPS detected these key pieces were lacking on the occasion of an inspection conducted in the company’s facilities on October 14, 2008.  The Agency said Cattier failed to provide enough additional elements until December 15 and therefore decided to adopt a precautionary decision and to suspend the production and sale of the foaming gel. In the wake of a strong media buzz and polemics regarding the safety of baby care cosmetic products and their distribution of in maternities, the AFSSAPS announced its intention to tighten controls over cosmetics intended for children of less than 3 years old.  Furthermore, since the outset of 2008, the French control body had been operating series of controls focusing on natural and organic cosmetics. In 2009, the Agency wants to evaluate the safety assessment methods specifically developed by manufacturers of baby care goods Otherwise, the AFSSAPS also announced reinforced controls for other product categories, in particular so-called ethnic products, including skin whitening and skin lightening products, as well as hair curling and hair straightening products."
French and European authorities question chemical exposure,"In a draft report published on November 19 [1], three EU scientific committees [2] assess the applicability of the so-called Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) approach to the human health-related risk assessment of chemical substances.  Based on the concept of “safe levels of exposure”, TTC is an approach that aims to establish a human exposure threshold value below which there is a very low probability of an appreciable risk to human health. The European Commission asked the three scientific committees to review the available scientific literature as well as a Colipa [3] report which stated that while being a useful additional tool in the absence of chemical-specific toxicology data, the TTC concept did not provide a full safety assessment of cosmetic ingredients and impurities, in particular regarding local effects at the site of application. In their conclusion, the three scientific bodies say that: “The principle of the TTC approach in itself is scientifically acceptable. However, the application of this principle in terms of risk assessment for safety evaluation of a chemical is dependent on the quality, quantity, and relevance of the underlying toxicity database, and a reliable estimation of the exposure to the chemical in the respective field of application.” So far, only limited information and knowledge exist on the levels of exposure linked to a wide variety of consumer products, such as cosmetics, where ""complex exposure scenarios"" and ""multiple exposure routes"" have to be considered. This preliminary report comes just days before a 30 December deadline to pre-register substances for safety screening and registration under the EU’s chemical regulation REACH.  Conclusions can be commented upon until 2 January 2009. In parallel, on the occasion of a scientific conference on the links between human fertility, children development and chemical exposure, which was held in Paris on November 25, French Minister of Health, Roselyne Bachelot, and her colleague Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Minister of Ecology, announced they would call upon the French Agency for the Medical Safety of Health Products (AFSSAPS) to assess the risks posed by cosmetics during pregnancy and for young children. Two months ago, after polemics regarding the distribution of cosmetics in maternities, the Agency already announced its intention to tighten controls over cosmetics intended for children of less than 3 years old. At the same time, the Agency also announced the creation of an ad hoc working group that would evaluate the safety assessment methods specifically developed by manufacturers of baby care goods. French Health Minister also said she will launch a campaign to inform pregnant women about the possible risks linked to the exposure with certain chemical substances in a variety of products, including paints, pesticides, etc. (not specifically in cosmetics!) and would consider the possibility of a logo identifying products containing substances that are toxic to reproduction. However, such a labelling system should be dealt with at the European level where the rules governing cosmetic products are currently under revision.  “[We do] not think this is something which is suitable for individual countries to take forward unilaterally and hope that the French raise this during the current negotiations on the revision of the cosmetics directive, where a discussion can take place among experts on cosmetic products,” a spokesperson for the British Department for Business, Enterprise & Regulatory Reform (BERR) told The Independent last week. French authorities have also announced a review of carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances (CMR) classified in the third category of the group. Indeed, CMR substances are classified according to three levels of toxicity: CMR1 are substances that are known to be toxic, CMR2 are substances that are likely to be toxic, and CMR3 are possibly toxic but need further assessment. While CMR1 and CMR2 are forbidden for use in cosmetics, the use of CMR3 remains possible.  However, the French cosmetics trade body (FEBEA) denied any use of endocrine disruptor [4] in cosmetics products. According to the trade body, there is a lot of incorrect and misleading information regarding this matter. For instance, FEBEA said the cosmetics industry does not use bisphenol A and only uses one phthalate (diethylphthalate or DEP). According to the SCCP [5], DEP is not an endocrine disruptor, FEBEA said.  Similarly, the parabens that are authorised for use in cosmetics (methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, iso propyl-, butyl-, and iso butyl-parabens) are considered as safe for use by the SCCP. “It is important to stress again that any ingredient used in a cosmetic product, whether natural or man-made, must be safe,” added CTPA, the UK’s cosmetics trade body. Actually, what would be the meaning of a logo warning women of a potential risk, while French and European legislations stress that cosmetics must be safe? Whether the legislations are inefficient and must be changed, or the logo story is a scaring nonsense."
