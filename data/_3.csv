"""We aim for 300 million euros within five years,"" Marie Sermadiras, Cosfibel","Premium Beauty News - What targets did you define when you became the Head of Cosfibel? Marie Sermadiras - Cosfibel has existed for 20 years: it is an SME held by its founder, which is rare enough in this industry, so this new chapter will be marked by continuity, by preserving its heritage, while bringing some form of transformation. The idea is to modernize the way we work, while upgrading the secondary packaging and gift sectors. If we have a closer look at statistics, the group achieves a 90-million turnover right now, and I intend to reach 300 million in three to five years. Premium Beauty News - How do you mean to do that? Marie Sermadiras - Our strategy is divided into three key points to work on over several years. The first consists in preserving our historical strengths: creativity, with our in-house design studio, reliability, which is in our DNA, and customer knowledge. Then, we aim to keep going with the diversification initiated two years ago. We are known for serving the luxury segment in the cosmetics industry, but we also work for the wine and spirits, delicatessen, and retail sectors, and increasingly often with the fashion, watchmaking, jewellery industries, etc. Our diversification is also geographic, as we are consolidating our offices in Shanghai and NYC, and industrial: we have been enhancing our production capacities. We have a historic plant in Barcelona, a workshop in Porto, Portugal, and we recently purchased two plants in Belgium. We aim to keep purchasing new sites, mainly in Europe, to benefit from know-how with metal, wood, and cardboard. Right now, our plants mainly work with cardboard and RPET, and we would like to diversify our materials. The third priority is innovation, to modernize our trade and put our sector back in the spotlight. Premium Beauty News - What are your innovation projects based on? Marie Sermadiras - Innovation is based on our CSR approach. We have obtained the Ecovadis Platinum certification level, a great way to have our work acknowledged, as we have been changing our methods in terms of eco-design, supply chain, to become greener, and ethical and social issues. But the next step involves finding new materials. We have been making much progress with open innovation research in collaboration with partners, laboratories, research centres, our suppliers, but also our customers, to invent new materials or select materials that are not used in our trade and adapt them to our own constraints. We aim to develop as many solutions as possible to help our customers change their own methods and combine CSR and luxury: for example, more sophisticated RPET to give the impression of false leather or velvet, recycled leathers, textiles made from paper pulp, recycled textiles, linen supply chains more interesting than cotton… materials represent a real issue. The same goes for sealing systems. Just like for materials or technical processes, we registered multiple patents to get 100% mono-material sealing systems with friction or zip-free systems instead of magnets. All this considerably changes our packs recyclability. Premium Beauty News - Is pack & gift compatible with a CSR approach? Marie Sermadiras - It is an integral part of the consumer experience. Premium or luxury brands do need these tools to be convincing: they are still a major purchase driver. However, methods really need to be changed. We need to adopt more virtuous approaches, reduce quantities, place eco-design at the core of our strategy, and work on the supply chain and logistics, in particular to target weight. The ode to lightness is gradually becoming a luxury code. It invites us to rethink the way we design pack & gift and work on materials to make them lighter. It is one of the key changes to make. Premium Beauty News - How do you stand out from your competitors? Marie Sermadiras - Using innovation, these new materials and systems that will help change our methods. The other key point in our DNA is the fact that we are willing to go even more upstream with our customers' marketing teams. I come from this world, so I am familiar with marketing and consumer expectations. We are positioned as a creative partner that designs experiences, like the unboxing specialist. We aim to support our customers in creating this experience to increase the perceived value of their products. And we are doing this on the global level, since we are lucky enough to have about twenty offices around the world. It helps adapt to each country's marketing codes and draw inspiration from markets that are usually one step ahead, namely the US and Asia. Premium Beauty News - You have your own plants in Spain and Belgium, but you also outsource part of your products in China. Have you set up a relocation strategy, like a number of market players? Marie Sermadiras - We do outsource manufacturing, but we have all tailor-made products designed by our design studios. We also have our own teams on-site at partner plants. Given the context, I deliberately adopt the opposite approach to this massive relocation, because I prefer to talk about balance. Time-to-market in Europe is longer, paradoxically, than in Asia. If I send a brief to China, I will have my product earlier than in Europe, even with maritime transport. Right now, in Europe, we do not have the same capacities, especially since everyone has brought part of their production back. In addition, raw material and energy prices have risen much more than in China. So, relocation is very well, but we need to find a balance to diversify sourcing. It also helps guarantee the safety of our supplies: it is the biggest issue for our customers, and also the greatest risk."
"""Albéa is an increasingly sustainable and agile company,"" François Tassart","Premium Beauty News - The Albéa Group's Cosmetic Rigid Packaging Division was recently renamed Cosmetics & Fragrances. How did you come to make this change? François Tassart - Mainly for the sake of clarity for our customers. This name reflects our markets rather than our packaging solutions and allows us to be better identified across the industry. Premium Beauty News - What is the weight of your division today? François Tassart - Make-up (lipsticks, mascara, etc.) remains our core market, even if the skincare category (jars, bottles, etc.) has grown significantly in recent years. We also manufacture perfume caps, with a made in France offer for the premium sector. In total, this represents a turnover of $450 m, achieved with 14 sites and 8 countries. We cover North America, Europe and Asia, via Indonesia and China. In the field of beauty packaging, we are the player with the broadest geographical coverage and the most varied technical expertise. This allows us to serve global leaders as well as local players and indie brands. In Indonesia, for example, 50% of our manufacturing activity is dedicated to local brands. Premium Beauty News - How has this activity developed since the start of the pandemic? François Tassart - Globally, the phenomenon was the same in other sectors: an acceleration of pre-existing trends. To sum up, our customers expect packaging solutions to remain just as desirable but also, increasingly virtuous, supplied in compliance with all safety requirements, within short deadlines and with volumes that can vary very quickly. These last points - speed and flexibility - have become very important: there is now a huge demand for agility! Our main customers ask us for reduced time-to-market and to have the ability to respond to the so-called TikTok effects, which can suddenly increase demand incredibly for some references. To meet this, we need to work with intermediate stocks or with plants capable of tripling their production for a reference in a very short time frame. Since September 2021, global demand has picked up strongly, with higher trends than in 2019, except for lipsticks, where the upturn took longer. Demand for perfumes has skyrocketed, and with the massive inflow of Chinese consumers into this market, it should continue to grow very significantly. Finally, there has been a trend towards the regionalisation of supplies. This ""relocation"" is noticeable not only in Europe but also in Asia, for agility purposes but also logistical constraints. The lack of sea freight capacity and congestion issues in ports has led to an explosion in prices and longer lead times, which encourages customers to buy locally. Premium Beauty News - How do you manage tensions on supplies? François Tassart - It's a real challenge! We thought we had gone through the worst of it in 2021 when the momentum of the recovery caused raw material, transportation and energy costs to skyrocket. We sat down with all our customers to explain the situation, break down the increases in our costs and explain the impact on our prices. After all, materials account for almost 30% of our costs! Their responses were quite reasonable. But the war in Ukraine has rekindled the upward spiral. All this means that we had to secure our supplies by increasing our stocks. Thanks to these measures and our global network, there were no disruptions and I would like to pay tribute to the tremendous work of our teams. But this obviously comes at a cost: about a $30 million impact on our cash flow in 2021. But cash is what allows us to continue investing in parallel. Fortunately, some customers are ready to work with us to secure their supplies. Premium Beauty News - How has it affected the sustainable transition of beauty packaging? François Tassart - Unlike what happened in 2008, sustainability efforts were not called into question. On the contrary, demand for new solutions, more virtuous packaging and transparency has only increased! The challenge is to combine responsibility and desirability and accelerate this transition. Premium Beauty News - How is this transition organised at Albéa? François Tassart - Our goal is to produce 100% recyclable packaging by 2025, even if it is initially reusable. In our business segment, this is a real challenge because we manufacture a great variety of products, often small in size, with many components and different materials. We are innovating more than ever, to create single-material packaging (lipstick tubes, make-up cases, etc.), refill solutions, and to use recycled or innovative materials. We are rethinking our manufacturing processes, testing the injection and decoration of new materials, preparing the substitution of raw materials that are likely to disappear (SAN, POM), and securing those whose use will increase. These are not trivial changes; they have technical consequences (adapted moulds, new expertise). A lot of investment will be needed within a short time frame to make these changes while guaranteeing the security of supply, product conformity and quality. Much work remains to be done to reach a circular economy and we all must accelerate together. Ensuring this change while maintaining the level of consumer satisfaction and desire means protecting the reputation of our customers. It's a real partnership. Today, even in the case of luxury products, packaging does not represent more than 3% of the total price. There is a real issue of value sharing in this transition! Premium Beauty News - In three words, how do you see the future of make-up and perfume packaging? François Tassart - Responsible, agile, reliable. These are the topics we work on the most with our customers!"
Sabic confirms it will produce circular polymers in Europe by the end of 2022,"At its European site in Geleen, in the Netherlands, where it invited the French press for a preview, Sabic confirmed the start-up at the end of this year of its chemical recycling plant, built in partnership with Plastic Energy [1]. The plant will produce circular polymers from used plastic that would otherwise have been destined for incineration. These polymers are accredited by the ISCC Program (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification Plus). These new food contact grade polymers from Sabic's ""advanced recycling"" process were used in a world first by Origins, an Estée Lauder brand, to produce the tube for Origins' global bestseller, Clear Improvement Active Charcoal Mask. The tube was made from polyethylene-PE and the cap from polypropylene-PP, both from Sabic's certified circular technology. Launched last year as part of a joint initiative with Albéa, the development meets The Estée Lauder Companies' sustainable packaging goals, including increasing the amount of post-consumer recycled (PCR) material. The strategic partnership will reinforce Origins' commitment to convert at least 80% (by weight) of its packaging to recyclable, refillable, reusable, recycled or recoverable solutions by 2023. Origins Natural Resources' long-term goal is to convert all of its face mask tubes to recycled plastic by 2023. ""Through the use of this innovative technology, Origins, The Estée Lauder Companies, Sabic and Albéa are pushing the pace of development needed across the value chain to drive a circular plastic economy,"" confirmed the Saudi-based chemist. At its Dutch site, Sabic has a circular plastics pilot unit that has been in operation for two years and an R&D laboratory to validate its customers' developments. Other cosmetic brands are expected to use these circular plastics for their future packaging. L'Occitane en Provence recently introduced a new range of tubes made from ""recycled content containing Tacoil from the Plastic Energy company"". Tacoil is also produced in Geleen, where the production cycle will be organised into three units. After dissolution, the used plastics, mainly from the Benelux, will be depolymerised by Plastic Energy in a thermal anaerobic conversion process at 600°C, with a treatment capacity of 20,000 tonnes. This process breaks polymer molecules in two: one part is converted into gas to power the plant, and the other goes to the Pyrolysis purification unit, from which the resulting recycled oil (Tacoil) is then directed to the Sabic steam cracker, which uses it to produce the circular polymers of its Trucircle portfolio. Based on existing flows, and when properly separated upstream, pyrolysis has an efficiency of around 70-80%, reported Sabic. For those who doubt the quality of chemically recycled polymers, Sabic says its process ""always relies on a sound sorting system prior to converting the used plastic into a high-quality raw material."" It can be used to recycle a mix of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), including, for example, cosmetics and multilayer packaging. Sabic uses ""a mass balance accounting system to trace the flow of materials along a complex supply chain, from the feedstock to the final product, following predefined and transparent rules. These rules then define the volume of product that can be classified as circular."" The process also saves CO2, according to the chemist. ""Each tonne of certified circular polymer produced from recycled mixed waste plastic (rich in polyolefins) diverted from incineration with energy recovery can avoid about two tonnes of CO2 emissions, throughout the production process,"" specified Sabic. The company conducted a life cycle assessment (LCA) [2], the results of which indicated a reduction of up to 2 kg in the greenhouse gas footprint per kilogram of PE or PP resin based on the energy recovery of used plastics. For its part, Plastic Energy, which already carries out chemical recycling in Spain at Seville, is continuing its development on the Spanish site with TotalEnergies and aims to commission a unit capable of processing 33,000 tonnes of post-consumer plastic waste by early 2025. In France, the company is announcing, with the same partner, the opening of a 15,000-tonne plant on the Grandpuits site by 2023, and with ExxonMobil, a 25,000-tonne plant, under construction, on its Gravenchon petrochemical site."
"""We now have robust solutions to tackle plastic pollution,"" Suvi Haimi, Sulapac","Premium Beauty News - What is the philosophy behind Sulapac's alternative materials? Suvi Haimi - We founded Sulapac in 2016 with the aim to tackle plastic pollution and fight against climate change. The idea was to develop materials with the advantages of plastics without the drawbacks. The design philosophy of Sulapac is to mimic nature: to create a bio-based material that can replace conventional plastics but that can be digested by naturally occurring microorganisms and break down into carbon dioxide, water and biomass, leaving no traces behind… similarly to a piece of wood. Based on this philosophy, we have developed a series of materials made from wood and plant-based binders for applications in four market areas: straws, packaging for cosmetics, packaging for nutraceutics (supplements), and cutlery (forks and knives). Premium Beauty News - What types of materials are available? Suvi Haimi - As far as cosmetics and supplements are concerned, we currently offer six grades with various properties and bio-based content, including a barrier material for water-based emulsions. For our first grades it was necessary to have specific moulds, this why we developed more universal solutions. Various aesthetics and colours are also available. Premium Beauty News - But you can also develop tailor-made solutions, as you did for Chanel? Suvi Haimi - Indeed, our core expertise is to create and test new recipes according to the needs of the customers. Chanel needed a customized creation because they had very specific aesthetic criteria and they wanted to add camellia seed shells in the material used to create their biobased jar lids. We faced specific challenges because of the hydrophilic properties of the camellia seed shells. It took more than 40 trials before we were able to find the right material recipe. But it was fascinating to combine by-products like camellia seed shells and FSC certified wood chips to create a unique high-end packaging material. Now, we have proficiency in also utilizing unusual side streams without compromising the functionality of the final product. It helps us to reduce the environmental footprint of packaging even further. This achievement is the result of years of collaboration with the Chanel innovation team, which also led to the creation of bio-sourced perfume caps for 'Les Eaux de Chanel' collection. We tested various recipes for their aesthetic results but also for the result on the machines. Premium Beauty News - Today you also offer solutions for water-based formulas. What are the limits of the Sulapac materials? Suvi Haimi - The creation of a barrier bio-based material for water-based formulations was a great achievement that allowed to widen the span of products we can pack with Sulapac materials. Tests have even demonstrated better oxygen barrier properties with our material than with conventional plastics! However there are still limitations. To date we do not have any bottles or tubes, we are investigating these opportunities but at the moment our solutions focus on jars, lids and caps. Premium Beauty News - What is your vision of the future of beauty packaging? Suvi Haimi - We now have robust solutions to tackle plastic pollution and climate change linked to packaging. While plastic production is expected to continue to grow globally, we offer the possibility to maximize the use of recycled and plant-based biopolymers that have the same advantages of conventional plastics without their drawbacks. We are aiming to change the whole packaging industry in the future with the aim to solve the problems that conventional plastic pose! Our solution differs from other bioplastics such as PLA, because our material biodegrades fully in nature and not only in industrial composting condition. Also, we do not use any harmful or toxic additives that are many times used with bioplastics. We are very strict in the use of materials that mimic natural substances. Our material is recyclable, both mechanically and chemically, in the same streams as other bio-polymers. However, while the technology is available, infrastructures are lacking in most countries. We consider the rise of chemical recycling around the world will improve the situation. Furthermore, unlike other plastics, in the event our material would leak into nature, it would slowly degrade in nothing else than carbon dioxide, biomass, and water, and would never create toxic load nor permanent microplastics. We are currently building a consortium in Finland, in partnership with recycling infrastructures, to create a loop accepting our material that can be effective recycled. We think we have the potential to change the packaging industry and the various sectors where plastics are used! We're still a small size player and have to grow to build up a reputation on the market and reach the critical mass to participate in global launches. Global brands such as Chanel are leading the path and helping us to change things."
"""We tackle every aspect of packaging sustainability,"" Denis Maurin, HCT","Premium Beauty News - Can you first share with us your vision of the latest developments in the cosmetics market? Denis Maurin - While the markets in Europe and the USA were dramatically affected by the pandemic, we have made the demonstration of our ability to adapt ourselves throughout our various divisions! We really pushed diversification opportunities as far as we could, in particular in skincare. We're also expanding into new categories, including hair and body care, where we're growing a lot. Some brands are recording huge successes in these new segments, where consumers in are more loyal than in makeup. As far as we are concerned, we have started to recover from the challenges of COVID period and see the rise of a new era. We have built successful partnerships with fast-growth indie brands in the USA and in Europe. In Asia, until recently, the market has been less impacted by COVID. Local competition is increasing on domestic markets forcing the brands to adapt and to differentiate themselves. Some brands are growing more prestige, more luxury, and invest a lot in packaging. The approach in China is a little different, where brands are focusing on makeup and haven't quite made the jump to sustainability yet. Premium Beauty News - What about the supply chain difficulties, shortages and raw material price hikes? Denis Maurin - We have numerous supply chains - in Korea, China, Europe and the USA. Consequently, we were not as impacted by sourcing difficulties. However, longer shipping time and cost increase overall is something we must deal with and is pushing us to find creative solutions for our customers. The way we see the future is that we need local, easily and quickly available standard packaging options. We want to be flexible and agile to be able to develop products consistently in Asia, in the US or in Europe depending on our customers' needs. The key to success is to be able to rely on one diversified network with regional supply chains. Premium Beauty News - What are the main innovations HCT is presenting at Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna? Denis Maurin - We'll have the largest booth ever this year. Following the acquisition from kdc/one, we are combining our booths to present our full range of capabilities. Which are really huge! We are building the largest sustainable stock catalogue in the industry. One of our goals at Bologna will be to educate people about sustainability and what does it means for us. The four pillars of our vision are: Designed for Recycling, PCR materials, Bio-sourced materials and Re-fillable solutions. Our DFR (Designed for Recycling) range includes a large portfolio of mono-material innovations, including a 100% PET recyclable packaging collection (pencils, lipsticks, lip glosses, compacts, palettes), 100% PP items (lipsticks, lip balms, serum sticks, pumps, jars), and aluminium, tin and other full metal packaging. We'll also showcase mascaras and lipglosses with glass bottles and aluminium caps, that are free from plastic components, except for the stem that can be easily separated prior to recycling. As PCR Materials are becoming the norm, we'll showcase a wide array of stock options for all market segments. We also offer various options with bio-sourced materials. As it is very hard to develop fully compostable materials that can be used as primary packaging, we have developed innovative composites that reduce the content of plastics. Since this new material is not recyclable or compostable, we recommend utilizing a refillable application. Creating a keepsake container with a refillable aspect will significantly lower the use of single-use plastic as well. In many cases, paper pulp is also a solution that is offering more innovation for primary and secondary packaging. Eventually, we see re-fillable packaging solutions as offering a lot of advantages with regard to sustainability. We have a comprehensive collection of refill innovations and reusable applicators!"
ESEPAC and ESP students reinvent the luxury perfume experience,"The five teams, each of them gathering students from both schools, have presented their products to a jury chaired by Marc Lechanoine, Global Senior Vice President Creative Design & Packaging Innovation, The Estée Lauder Companies. Overview of the five competing projects: Perfume made visible: Les Sceaux Sceau features four solid perfumes, along with an applicator and a pouch to carry them. All the components are packaged in a wooden box. The fragrance is visible or not since the scented wax can be used as a light tattoo, thanks to ideograms engraved on the applicators. Users can decide to stack the boxes or not. Smart-Perfume: ""What if your smartphone became your perfume?"" The Smart-Perfume concept is a ""nomadic"" perfume device that allows consumers to carry out their perfume together with their smartphone. The perfume is contained in a refillable 15 ml aluminium bottle that slips into a leather pouch attached to the back of the phone with a magnet. The pouch is fully customisable. The bottle can be refilled both at the shop and at home thanks to a connected wooden base that allows to recharge both the phone and the bottle. VIP Perfume Room The concept lies in a mysterious room that gives a whole new experience when creating a fragrance. It starts with a key that grants access to a secret room where a unique fragrance is created (customised bottle and fragrances). The key to the creation room is used as an applicator. After this first experience, the consumer will have the opportunity to make the bottle a real jewel. Every time the bottle is refilled in store, a jewel to insert on the perfume case will be offered. This concept is part of a respectful and sustainable approach to the environment, notably through the use of recyclable and recycled materials for the bottle and its accessories. Stylux Ouréa The concept Stylux Ouréa is inspired by gua sha stones and the sensations of massaging. The students created a fragrance applicator that allows the stone to turn on itself, simulating the massage sensation. Ergonomically, the three curved sides of the cap are designed to fit the shape of the fingers, making it easy for the consumer to apply. Aesthetically, the multi-faceted glass bottle is reminiscent of the shape of a precious stone. Very Instant Perfume The Very Instant Perfume concept comes in three parts: – A small capacity refillable flask (15 ml) with a 3D visual inside equipped with a roll-on. The flask is made of plastic and gold/silver metal, and protected by a leather pouch. – Rotating fountains in shops. Made of glass columns, they allow to choose one's fragrance. – A limousine that can be booked on demand to refill one's perfume and enjoy a luxurious experience. Students from the different teams will also present their projects on stage in the PCD Talks room, during Paris Packaging Week, on 29 & 30 June 2022. The projects will also be displayed on the ESEPAC and ESP stands."

"Quadpack expands capabilities at its injection site in Kierspe, Germany","The Barcelona-headquartered beauty packaging manufacturer and provider is anticipating a strong rise in the demand for beauty packaging in Europe. The group is investing over EUR 6 million at its German manufacturing facilities (ex-Louvrette) in Kierspe. According to Quadpack, skincare is predicted to grow 10% in 2022, with the 'clean beauty', haircare, and dermo-cosmetic segments driving the demand. In this context, the group anticipates the plant's 2022 sales to increase in line with 2021, which was up 25% over the previous year. The EUR 6 million investment will go towards the expansion of the facility's injection-moulding and assembly capacity. Quadpack's Kierspe plant is being expanded to meet increased demand, in particular for airless packaging. The investment is dedicated to staff expansion, new moulds, and injection machines and assembly equipment optimised through Industry 4.0. A manufacturing enterprise system (MES) is being installed to improve lead times, efficiency and supply chain agility, while gaining greater control of manufacturing operations. The MES will connect to SAP S4/HANA Cloud in 2023 as part of the company's digital transformation. Note that Quadpack had already invested 2 million euros in 2021 in a high-speed production and decoration line at the Kierspe site. Once complete, production capacity will grow across all popular product categories, with airless capacity receiving the biggest boost. Part of the investment is also intended for the creation of an in-hose decoration unit at Kierpse. Thus, in complement to the acquisition of decoration specialist Stefan Wicklein Kunststoffveredelung GmbH in Steinbach am Wald in 2021, Quadpack will be able to offer specialist decoration services and know-how at both the Steinbach and Kierspe plants, where a 900m2 facility will be dedicated to decoration. The integration of decoration capacities on the Kierspe site will also contribute to reduce transport costs and delays and therefore to accelerate time to market and decrease CO2 emissions. ""Already a reference in thick-walled PET injection, Quadpack aims to become an industry standard for sustainable manufacture and decoration,"" said Quadpack COO Fabrice Revert. To ensure sustainable production, Quadpack's manufacturing facilities run on 100% renewable energy and operate a continuous programme to reduce waste. The Kierspe plant holds an EcoVadis Silver Medal and is ISCC-certified. SAN and SMMA production is being gradually shifted to PET and rPET for greater recyclability. Quadpack is also testing different innovative decoration techniques and working with ink, varnish and foil suppliers to research more sustainable materials. ""As the market recovers and environmental consciousness grows, there is greater demand for our 'Made in Europe' solutions. Our investment in Germany brings production closer to home for the majority of our client base. Our goal is always to improve our service to customers, while ensuring a positive impact on the planet,"" added Revert."
"""Our glass decarbonisation process is underway,"" Thomas Riou, Verescence","Premium Beauty News - How advanced is Verescence in its decarbonisation programme? Thomas Riou - Our roadmap, which we presented to SBTi [1] last October, has recently been validated. This is a key step because it is important to have our actions reviewed and validated by independent experts. It focuses firstly on reducing scope 1 (emissions linked to our process); scope 2 (emissions from electricity producers that we use in our process), but also on quantifying and reducing scope 3 (investments, transportation, raw materials, etc.). The bulk of our emissions, (i.e., 60%), are concentrated in scopes 1 and 2. Our roadmap comprises specific projects, defined steps and a detailed evaluation of the necessary investments. The period between 2019 and 2034 must result in a 40% reduction in our CO2 emissions, bearing in mind that between 2016 and 2019 we had already reduced these emissions by 10%. In France, for example, the progress made will be even more significant, with a 50% reduction in our emissions between 2019 and 2030. Reducing the consumption of fossil fuels during the melting process is essential in cutting down on emissions. This part alone represents 40% of the effort we will have to make by 2034. But there are many other initiatives that need to be implemented and where we are already involved, such as the recovery of waste heat, the supply in green electricity, the use of PCR glass, etc. Premium Beauty News - So for the combustion part you have opted for electricity as a transitional solution, to what extent? Thomas Riou - In terms of electrification, two technologies are available: either the furnace is fully electric or it is a hybrid furnace running on about 80% electricity and 20% gas. The technological choice will depend both on the amount of PCR cullet we will use and the availability and the level of decarbonisation of the electric supply we can use. Because our roadmap also takes into account the decarbonisation of our electricity to have 80% of electricity coming from renewable sources by 2025. And this target comes with a clear strategy to buy green electricity produced only in the country where we operate. Because if your purchases are made elsewhere and the networks are not connected, the approach is not right. Reaching 80% by 2025 will therefore depend on the maturity of the projects in each country. Premium Beauty News - Tell us more about this maturity? Thomas Riou - We are present in France, Spain, the United States and South Korea, and everywhere our choices will be driven by this desire for renewable electricity. In Spain, we have already signed a contract for a supply of more than 10 years of green electricity with the Iberdrola Group, which will enable us to reduce our electricity emissions by 80%, i.e. 11,000 tonnes of CO2, or 6% of our worldwide emissions at group level, by 2021. Spain is a very advanced country in terms of renewable energy. There are real concrete projects near our factory. In France, energy is already highly decarbonised due to nuclear power, so there are fewer projects of this type. In the United States and South Korea, we are working on it. There are many discussions underway, but these are countries where it will take a little longer. However, I think that things should move very quickly in the next three years. Premium Beauty News - Over what period will the transition to electrical power take place? Thomas Riou - It will take place when we upgrade our furnaces, which have a lifespan of about 10 years. The first furnace to be upgraded will be in Mers-les-Bains, France in 2025 and the last one a little after 2030. By then, we will have changed our technology completely. Premium Beauty News - What is the impact on both costs and output at a time when the industry is already being hard hit by soaring energy costs? Thomas Riou - There is no doubt that all decarbonisation projects will require very significant investments. Our 2030 roadmap will require an additional investment of over 20 million euros. We are calling on the States in which we are operating to support our company in these massive changes. We are working to ensure that the introduction of new technologies will not affect our performances, but we cannot exclude that decarbonisation will result in additional costs that will have to be supported by the market. Premium Beauty News - Verescence is participating in the VERCANE (VERre CArbone NEutre) research and development project, supported by ADEME, which aims to identify the different sources of energy capable of powering glass production sustainably, tell us more about it. Thomas Riou - The Vercane project is a huge research project that is focusing on several levers such as hydrogen, biogas and electricity. Working on this French project will mean that we will be able to find other ways of improving the future. After 2034, it will be 2050 with a Carbon Neutrality objective, but this will require research and development work in the coming years."
A recycled and recyclable mono-material tube for L'Occitane en Provence,"When re-designing two tubes of its Almond collection, L'Occitane en Provence was seeking a resource-friendly solution and teamed up with cosmetic tubes specialist Albéa and polymer supplier LyondellBasell. Both tubes were made from LyondellBasell's CirculenRevive polymers, which are produced using an advanced molecular recycling process to convert plastic waste into feedstock to produce new polymers. ""Our CirculenRevive products are polymers based on advanced (chemical) recycling technology from our supplier Plastic Energy who converts end-of-life plastic waste streams into pyrolysis oil feedstock,"" said Richard Roudeix, LyondellBasell Senior Vice President of Olefins and Polyolefins for Europe, Middle East, Africa and India. Indeed, Plastic Energy's patented technology - dubbed Thermal Anaerobic Conversion (TAC) - transforms previously unrecyclable plastic waste into what they call TACOIL. This new recycled raw material can replace oil to produce virgin plastic for use across a wide range of applications. This raw material, which quality is identical to a virgin material, complies with the standards of the main final end markets including food, medical and cosmetic packaging. Plastic Energy's TACOIL was the source material for LyondellBasell, which transformed it into polyethylene (PE) and then allocated it to the product for tubes and caps using a mass balance approach. Recycling plastic waste and reusing it for the manufacture of new packaging helps to reduce the consumption of fossil resources and contributes to the fight against plastic pollution. ""Advanced recycling can effectively process contaminated or multi-layered plastics and films that pose challenges for mechanical recycling, making it a complementary solution to help address global plastic waste,"" said Carlos Monreal, Founder and CEO of Plastic Energy. The reduced impact on climate change obtained thanks to plastics created with Plastic Energy's TACOIL (compared to virgin plastics) has been assessed by a life cycle analysis [1] carried out by independent consultants. Using the recycled PE supplied by LyondellBasell, Albéa manufactured mono-material tubes and caps for L'Occitane en Provence. ""This packaging is the holy grail in terms of responsible packaging today. The tube and cap are designed for full recyclability and made of 93% recycled polyethylene (PE) content. On top, both are made of PE for higher-quality recycling, confirmed as recycling-ready by recycler associations in both Europe and the US. This light mono-material packaging is in effect closing the loop, and that's quite a breakthrough,"" said Gilles Swyngedauw, VP of Sustainability and Innovation at Albéa Tubes. As part of their efforts to reduce their environmental footprint, L'Occitane signed up to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Global Commitment for a new economy for plastic in 2019. ""We are accelerating our circular economy journey and are engaged to reach an overall 40% recycled content in all our plastic packaging by 2025. The use of advanced recycling technology in our plastic tubes is an exciting step forward. Collaborating with LyondellBasell and Albéa was key for success,"" concluded David Bayard, R&D Packaging Director, L'Occitane en Provence."
"""We will only make recyclable tubes,"" Nicolas Yatzimirsky, Albéa","Premium Beauty News - What is the situation of Albéa's Tubes Division today? Nicolas Yatzimirsky - The Group's Tubes Division currently represents a little more than half of its turnover. We are continuing to develop with the recent acquisition of the Indian company Abdos Lamitubes, which allows us to have three new production sites in India (Assam and Uttarakhand), but also in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and another one in Lagos, Nigeria. India is naturally a strategic market while growth in sub-Saharan Africa is very strong, even if volumes are still low for the time being. Albéa Tubes now has a total of 24 production sites, which allow us to be even closer to our customers in every corner of the world. With the sale to Silgan of our business unit in Brazil, South America is one of the only regions where we do not have an industrial foothold. We do not plan to resettle in this dynamic region for the time being, but our return in the long term is one of the options we are considering. Premium Beauty News - How did rises in prices of raw materials and supply chain disruptions impact your Division? Nicolas Yatzimirsky - Like all packaging manufacturers, we have experienced significant increases in the price of raw materials, but also of cardboard, transport and energy costs. The imbalance between supply and demand linked to the upturn in the global economy in the post-Covid period was exacerbated by a series of exceptional events that affected the factories of several major raw materials suppliers. However, our teams have made huge efforts to both anticipate and react as quickly as possible, in particular by increasing our stocks, which has helped us meet orders but on the other hand has weighed on our cash. So despite these cost increases, we have been able to avoid supply disruptions for our customers so far, which they appreciated. Our teams did a remarkable job. Premium Beauty News - Recently, Albéa announced several innovations, both in terms of material reduction and recyclability. Is the future of tubes necessarily ecological? Nicolas Yatzimirsky - Unquestionably! For instance, Albéa was one of the first to develop recyclable toothpaste (and cosmetic) tubes, and we are continuing to convince our customers to move in this direction. We have also launched a tube made partly of paper, in partnership with L'Oréal, and we are developing increasingly lightweight tubes and caps that require much less plastic. Our very latest cap was eco-designed to ""visualise"" the material saving. This allows to renew the aesthetics of tubes and to make them stand upright to do without secondary packaging. As a packaging supplier, we are doing our share. But we have to admit that plastic is still not recycled enough! Even though the carbon footprint of a plastic tube is very low compared to any other packaging material, its lightweight means that consumers do not always realise the potential value of recycling. And as long as packaging containers are poorly recycled, it will be difficult to implement a true circular economy for used plastic packaging. Like our clients, we have made key public commitments concerning the recyclability of our products and the reduction of our carbon footprint. By 2025, 100% of the plastic packaging manufactured by the Group will be reusable or recyclable! To meet this challenge, we have worked on all fronts: changes in resins, use of alternative materials, of recycled materials, lightening, etc. But the future of tubes stands in their recyclability! Today, chemical recycling technologies allow obtaining a material whose aesthetic and functional performances are similar to those of virgin material. Capacities are still clearly insufficient, but they are developing, thanks to the involvement of key manufacturers in the market. Premium Beauty News - What is your take on the increasing regulatory constraints and maybe even the signing of a global treaty on plastic pollution? Nicolas Yatzimirsky - Regulatory constraints on plastic recycling are a good thing. The more plastic is recycled, the less plastic pollution there will be, and the more people will accept plastic material in their homes! An industry cannot last if it goes contrary to the expectations of citizens and consumers... And the lack of recycling also weighs on the development of a circular economy for plastics, as the amount of recycled plastic available is still far below demand... As far as Albéa is concerned, we are already well prepared with a comprehensive portfolio of solutions to meet both societal environmental expectations and brand positioning... But we want to move further and faster. We want to act collaboratively, with all the players involved in the packaging value chain, to develop plastic recycling, define new market standards, and continue to offer desirable packaging solutions that define our industry. Premium Beauty News - Is the implementation of a truly circular economy possible for plastic tubes? Nicolas Yatzimirsky - I believe that no packaging or material can claim to achieve complete recyclability. But we can imagine that 60 to 70% of plastic will be recycled in the coming years, which would already be a significant improvement on the current situation. To facilitate the elimination of fossil-based plastics, some solutions exist or are already under development, in particular biosourced resins that do not compete with foodstuff. It should not be forgotten that plastic is a relatively new material, whose technology is far from being fully harnessed. Its lightness is an important environmental asset; for the rest, we have already made a lot of progress and I am confident in our collective capacity for innovation! Premium Beauty News - When will refillable tubes be available? Nicolas Yatzimirsky - They could probably already be designed. But there are concerns regarding their acceptability and the cost/benefit ratio: it is not certain that the logistics of recovery, cleaning, refilling would be less impactful on the environment than good recycling... Premium Beauty News - What is your vision of the future of this market? How does Albéa intend to position itself in this context? Nicolas Yatzimirsky - I sincerely believe in the future of tubes and plastic. This universal packaging is light, practical, competitive, hygienic, it protects formulas and offers superb opportunities for decoration. Its carbon footprint is relatively low. We will set new standards that will make it recyclable everywhere, and work with our ecosystem to develop effective recycling at scale. Yes, we will soon almost exclusively only make recyclable tubes! In 2018, when, along with several other clients, we signed the Ellen McArthur Foundation Commitment, 2025 seemed a long way off and the roadmap ambitious. After a pandemic, a major supply crisis, rampant inflation and now a war in Europe, in a demanding regulatory environment, 2025 is fast approaching. We have shown innovation, determination, collaboration, ambition - now it is time for a collective leap forward to meet our commitments to the planet, our stakeholders, and our children."

Sand and fire: towards sustainable luxury glassmaking,"Derived from the alchemy between sand and fire, glass bottle manufacturing requires high energy quantities. The environmental footprint is considerable, in particular in terms of CO2 emissions. Highly energy-consuming, the production of a single 100-ml bottle typically composed of 200 grammes of glass in a standard gas furnace (they are the most widely used) results in 180 grammes of CO2 emitted [1]. As part of the transition towards more sustainable luxury glassmaking, various eco-design techniques already contribute to reducing the energetic content of bottles. On the industrial level, several projects are under study, or being tested. Since the carbon footprint is roughly proportional to the glass weight, the first approach consists in lightening the bottles. According to Gérald Martines, a bottle half-lightened in terms of glass weight emits twice less CO2 during production. Recently, several major brands have chosen this solution, which proves one can get free from the usual image of luxury associated with a heavy object. Another approach consists in using post-consumer recycled glass during the manufacturing phase. ""The carbon footprint is reduced by 2.5% for every 10% of PCR,"" says Gérald Martines. Several initiatives already involve this strategy, like Girl by Rochas, which contains 40% of PCR, or the limited edition of Chanel N°5, based on 15% of recycled glass. Beyond 40% of PCR, glass loses a bit of crystalline transparency, without losing its functional qualities. ""Why not imagine that this cultural point, which is subjective, can change, and that slightly less 'crystalline' glass can become the modern symbol of responsible luxury?"" asks Gérald Martines. Lastly, ""and it is by far the most efficient strategy,"" he adds, giving consumers the possibility to keep their own bottles and refill them could reduce the CO2 footprint of a bottle by 50% at the first refill, and up to 90% at the ninth. ""To be perfectly accurate, one should take into account the impact of refills, which does reduce the benefit, since it varies according to the refill methods chosen by brands,"" explains Gérald Martines. Of course, all these options can be combined to further optimize the environmental impact. Another way to make considerable progress towards low-carbon glass consists in improving the production parameters, emphasizes Gérald Martines. Today, the heating systems used for glassmaking furnaces are usually based on natural gas combustion. This process represents emissions of about 270 kg of CO2 per tonne of glass, i.e. about 5,000 bottles of 100 ml, and also results in emissions of nitrogen oxides, nitrogen being a secondary greenhouse gas. Electric furnaces offer an alternative to gas furnaces. By default, they are powered with the standard energy mix of the national network. Therefore, the carbon impact varies from one country to another, depending on how they produce electric energy. In France, where nuclear power prevails, the impact is of 143 kg of CO2 per tonne of glass, i.e. 47% less than gas furnaces. On the contrary, in Germany, coal remains the main source of electricity production, so it is more environmentally friendly to choose the gas solution. For those willing to pay more, there is also electricity derived from renewable energies (hydraulic, photovoltaic, wind-generated electricity…). German glassmaker Heinz Glas chose this option to power one of their furnaces. They obtained CO2 savings of 56% compared to a gas furnace (the calculation takes into account the energetic 'extra cost' to store electricity, which cannot be avoided given the sporadic nature of renewable energies). Oxi-fuel combustion is another possibility consisting in, with a gas furnace, using oxygen as comburent [2] rather than air (the latter contains 80% of nitrogen, which is useless in this process). This alternative saves 15% of CO2 and reduces the emissions of nitrogen oxides by 83%. This experimental model is currently used to produce flat glass. What's more, the use of green hydrogen as fuel is a solution put forward and tested by Slovenian glassmaker Steklarna Hrastnik since 2021. Based on renewable energies, hydrogen reduces carbon emissions by 26% to 40%, according to Gérald Martines's estimations. The balance is impacted by the need to store the electricity used to make hydrogen. Lastly, 20 European glass packaging manufacturers united as part of the ""Furnace of the future"" project to design and develop a large-capacity hybrid furnace. This project set up by the FEVE (Federation of European manufacturers of glass) combines different options, since it will be based on 20% of gas, with an oxy-fuel combustion process, and 80% of green electricity. According to the FEVE, this model will help reduce CO2 emissions by 50% to 60%, compared to standard gas furnaces. A prototype should be presented in 2023. ""This solution offers better efficiency, plus it is safe in terms of energy supply,"" highlights Gérald Martines. Given the results of the benchmark carried out by the expert, for now the most environmentally friendly manufacturing solution remains the electric furnace powered with renewable energies for a 56% reduction of CO2 emissions. ""Right now, it is the best solution, but all possibilities are interesting and complementary, because they are more or less easy and quick to implement. In the long run, the European project will represent the best alternative given the current state of the art, but this technology of the future will only be operational in five or ten years, because it requires a specific furnace. Bearing in mind that a furnace has a service life of about 20 years and represents a huge investment, the transformation process will move forward as the furnaces currently used are renewed,"" concludes Gérald Martines.

Axium Packaging streamlines its production with a new site in France,"Axium Packaging, a group specializing in the production of jars, bottles and closures in PET, recycled and bio sourced PET, PP and PCR PP for personal care and food markets, has moved into its new production facilities; a 22,000 sqm industrial building acquired during the 1st semester of 2021. Located near the city of Saint-Etienne, France, the premises have been entirely reorganized to enable the installation of Axium Packaging headquarters as well as production plants from Acti Pack, specializing in PET and RPET bottles and jars, and from Loire Plastic Industrie, specializing in plastic injection of boxes and closures. Today, the site gathers more than 175 staffs. Six months of work and a total investment of 16 million euros were required to achieve the whole operation. After a transition period in order to allow the companies' move in the best conditions, the two production units are fully operational again. The new production hall of Loire Plastic Industrie, with a surface area of 4,000 sqm, integrates an automated and computerized machinery of 25 injection moulding machines, a maintenance and tooling preparation area as well as a finishing area for assembly and contract packaging. As far as Acti Pack is concerned, the new production workshop with a surface area of 5,500 sqm has seen the installation of 25 injection stretch blow moulding machines equipped with an automatic packaging line. A tooling maintenance area completes the new installation. In addition, new common storage solutions are available to meet the requirements of strategic development from the group: a storage hall with a surface area of 11,000 sqm to store up to 12,000 pallets of finished products and all raw materials and components necessary for the production. Computerized stock management ensures traceability and FIFO [1] management of complete storage. With this new site, Acti Pack and Loire Plastic Industrie are forecasting their production capacities to rise by more than 15%. New industry 4.0 oriented equipment integrated the two production workshops at the beginning of 2022. ""Complementary in their plastic packaging portfolio, Acti Pack and Loire Plastic Industrie benefit thus from a closer cooperation to strengthen their products and services offers and their development strategy,"" said Axium Packaging in a statement. Bringing together all French production also leads to a slight reduction of the group's environmental impact, in line with its CSR approach based on two main pillars: the development of eco-designed products and the increased use of recycled and bio-sourced materials, as well as the standardization of the group's code of conduct. Formed in 1999, Axium Packaging is made of five companies specialising in plastic packaging: Acti Pack (PET bottles and jars by injection stretch blow moulding), Acti Pack CZ (products by ISBM of PET and EBM), KKT Kaller-Kunststofftechnik GmbH (packaging in PET and HDPE), Loire Plastic Industrie (injected boxes and closures), LAPAC (plastic injection of closures and sticks). The group currently employs about 380 people on several European sites for an aggregated turnover in 2021 of 62,8 million euros."
"""Creating solutions that change everyday life,"" Xavier Joseph, Aptar","Premium Beauty News - What is Aptar Beauty + Home's global strategy based on today? Xavier Joseph - Generally speaking, Aptar's mission consists in transforming ideas into solutions that change people's daily lives. As for the Beauty + Home division, we are focused on three strategic pillars to become the best partner for Prestige Beauty. These pillars are the following: perfumes, from prestige to masstige, which keep upgrading, and we support this movement; skincare, an increasingly important field for Aptar which covers prestige skincare, anti-ageing, but also dermocosmetics, for which we are a valued partner, and the mass market premiumization, with an eco-design focus to meet new consumption models with singular, responsible solutions representing significant progress. As markets increasingly go digital, we also work on developing multiple solutions compatible with e-commerce. Lastly, and this is something quite new, again, thanks to digitalization, we have been completing our offering with additional services related to our dispensing and airless businesses. Premium Beauty News - Could you tell us more about these services? Xavier Joseph - We use digital technologies either to get to know our consumers or for more technical issues. Basically, we are connected to forums via partner agencies to have access to thousands of conversations: this way, we are always at the top of knowledge for every theme and category. And we can use this knowledge to serve our customers. Now, as regards technologies, we have been working with a startup, Monolith, a key player in the field of algorithms, AI, and predictive models, to sort of ""un-risk"" our customers' new product development programmes. In the near future, by feeding algorithms and based on the rheological characteristics of formulas matched with those of the pump types in our catalogue, we will be able to predict compatibility and functionality chances. It is a huge advantage when it comes to helping our customers enter the market faster. Ultimately, Aptar is now a shareholder in the Chinese startup YAT, which is unique in that they combine an influencer forum, on-demand product design and development, and e-commerce. We aim to offer our packaging solutions for new developments, but also to acquire more knowledge about our customers, influences, and interactions between packaging and formulas. Premium Beauty News - How do you combine packaging innovation and ecodesign? Xavier Joseph - There are three main priorities, per order of obviousness and relative accessibility. The first consists in designing fully recyclable products, mainly mono-material pumps, like our latest Future pump fully based on recyclable PE, and all our airless packs. All our innovations should also satisfy eco-design criteria to be easily recyclable. The second priority has to do with providing solutions based on PCR, and the last one with offering experiences involving refills or reuses. Some of our perfume pumps can be unscrewed, we have refillable lipsticks, and our premium airless solutions Serumony Reload and Gaïa can also be refilled. Plus, we have other projects to come over the course of the year. It should be said that it is a very active field in which players test a lot of solutions. We aim to position ourselves on this value chain, depending on these experiments. In addition, new circular economy models are not the same all around the world. For example, in Europe, bulk products in physical stores are more developed than elsewhere. People are more aware of ecoresponsible matters. On the contrary, convenience and the quality/price ratio still prevail for American consumers. In China, sustainable practices mainly concern social classes wealthy enough to take these issues into account. However, regulations can be changed overnight if the government decides they should. It is a possibility we are always ready for. The whole industry is under pressure, but thanks to Aptar's size, we have implemented processes that help us handle market instabilities. We have also developed quality partnerships, both with our suppliers and customers, so we can deal with these shocks the best way possible. Our history, trade expertise, and the quality of our relationships make it much easier for us to deal with volatility. Aptar comes from the Latin word aptare, which means ""to adapt"". Historically, we have acted local: we keep regional supply chains and are more resilient than our competitors who produce everything in Asia. Premium Beauty News - You joined the group last April. What does your mission consist in? Xavier Joseph - As the Global VP Innovation, my mission consists in helping Aptar speak consumers' and our customers' language. I make sure the solutions we develop remain relevant as regards people's daily reality, today and tomorrow. I do this by injecting consumer knowledge upstream our innovation chain, so that major issues and ideas are not only technical. It helps us build up partnerships with customers based on innovation, not only on our ability to supply components. I also have to take care of the whole communication and digital marketing aspects to make this a solution destination for consumers. This CtoB - Consumer-to-Business - bond consists in speaking women consumers' language, and creating content about life-changing solutions which can make them take interest in the technical aspect of their products. In addition, my mission consists in ""cross-fertilizing"" the group's other segments' resources, in particular pharmaceuticals. Health and beauty are connected, so we will increasingly build bridges between them as part of the broadened design of our dispensing solutions, which go together with digital solutions meant to enhance the user experience.

"Aura, formerly Priminter, redefines offering with accessories","Since Priminter had joined Groupe Pochet via Qualipac in 1993, the offering had been focused on two different businesses: promotional products and packaging accessories. Renamed Aura (in reference to the French words for 'unique ally', 'responsibility', and 'boldness') last September, the company now combines both specializations. ""Aura's mission consists in imagining, creating, and designing accessories in the broad sense of the word,"" explains Anne Bariaud. The offering is now structured in five categories: ornaments to enhance the look of primary packaging (plates, small chains, ribbons…), applicators adapted to beauty gestures (brushes, puffs, spatulas…), luggage (vanity cases, toilet bags, pouches…), accessories for launch animations (textile, mirrors, jewels…), and box sets to stage products. If product design and creation are tailor made in France, the company still relies on its network of French, European, and global partners for manufacturing. ""We have an in-house Creation Studio with a team of stylist-designers who track down, select and analyze trends to devise tailor-made solutions in line with brands' DNA,"" explains the Director. This historically Asian-based network has gained many local import partners in the Middle East, Europe, and France. ""Over the past few years, our belonging to a French group has strengthened our will to develop made in France and made in Europe products. It has helped us meet a rising, Covid-related demand from our customers,"" adds Anne Bariaud. This relocation approach is in line with a more global eco-design strategy - also a market expectation. ""We have implemented Le Cercle Vertueux (virtuous circle) By Aura, which consists in focusing on CSR at each product development phase, whether in terms of design, materials, responsible purchases, anything related to transport packaging, the sustainable use of the product, or its end-of-life,"" she adds. Aura offers a multi-material expertise enhanced by Groupe Pochet's multiple businesses, like glass, plastic, and metal, and by a broad range of materials and media, some of which are certified to guarantee their traceability. After a slowdown due to two years of pandemic, the company redefined its business to win back European markets. ""The Covid-19 crisis reduced our turnover by 30%, but we have noted a strong recovery in the last quarter 2021 and early 2022. We aim to reconquer the European market with this new offering and rely on the presence of the group to develop it on the global level,"" concludes Anne Bariaud."
[Special issue] What's new in beauty packaging?,"Whether it is about supporting the premiumization of cosmetic products while improving their environmental performance, or working from new, more sustainable materials, designing refillable and/or fully recyclable products, manufacturers and suppliers of packaging beauty are multiplying initiatives to meet the expectations of their customers and end consumers. Alongside environmental issues, suppliers also offer new dispensing solutions to match with the development of innovative galenics (powders, solid products, etc.), as well as new solutions to address the challenges of a rising e-commerce market. Another big trend, is the development of connected solutions.

LUXE PACK Los Angeles turning the lights back on,"One of the biggest takeaways in the past 2 years, is that nothing truly replaces the impact of in person business collaboration. LUXE PACK New York which wrapped up in October 2021 successfully proved that although, the live show experience may look slightly different, the impact of coming together to foster innovation, trends, and business bounce back is as powerful and needed unlike ever before. Therefore, the 2022 Los Angeles edition has been built to offer comparable layers of networking opportunities along with trend spotting. In addition to the impressive 2022 exhibitor roster, for the first time in Los Angeles, the show has confirmed an industry partner to supplement the variation of solutions that will be available, the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovations Institute. The C2CPII, is a global non-profit organization dedicated to powering innovation for the circular economy through framework and certification for products and packaging that have a positive impact on people and the planet. The team of experts will be available throughout the event to discuss how clean and circular products and packaging can be taken to the next level while communicating and validating those achievements to customers and retailers. In addition, the Institute will host a special interactive workshop, Made for Tomorrow: Designing Sustainable Packaging & Products with Cradle to Cradle Certified® scheduled for Thursday, February 24th. In true LUXE PACK fashion, the pulsating show floor will be complimented with an education program strategically designed to address the most relative of pain points, trends, and industry insight. Sustainability, digital consumer engagement, and Mono-dose packaging are a few of the industry talking points that will be addressed. Sephora's Principal of Product Sustainability will join executives from Novi Connect to discuss how novel technology solutions can expedite sustainability goals for both upcoming and already established brands.

PCR VS Virgin PET: What's Best For Your Brand?,"Both are quite eco-friendly. PET is the most recyclable plastic. And PCR (from PET) obviously won't add more waste to the world. Let's briefly compare them so you can make a more informed choice for your next product launch. Waste reduction isn't just a slogan. If you want that benefit, it will cost more than Virgin (new) PET. Now, a PCR package does not have to be made from 100% PCR plastic. In other words, it could be a combination of some PCR and some Virgin PET. However, after many tests we have discovered that 100% PCR is best for quality control. Plus, used PET material must be collected and sorted after-market to make PCR, resulting in higher labor costs than simply making new PET. While both materials rival glass in terms of beauty, PET plastic can be completely clear. To put it another way, it can be a glass substitute. Whereas the PCR material is somewhat milky. Due to the PCR creation process, there is also color variation from package to package. Depending on how you want to frame your marketing, this variance could be used as an advantage (eg. ""each piece is unique""). Neither material involves any compromise on beauty. Our special ""heavy wall"" construction is shatterproof, with a sturdy feel in the hand. It has a commanding presence on the shelf. And all the bottles and jars can be easily customized by spray color coating, printing, and hot stamping. The bottom line is that, if your brand story involves reducing waste and the Green lifestyle, then you may have to plan for the higher cost of PCR. Or you can get fully-recyclable Virgin PET packaging for a lower cost but with a more standardized and ""glass-like"" appearance. EPOPACK is a 30+ year Taiwanese manufacturer of eco-friendly cosmetic packaging. Our focus is on customizable PET and PCR containers that are both elegant and sustainable. Obviously this is a small space to explore this large topic. This is why we have dedicated project managers to discuss your needs in detail, and then put together a unique sample package so you can experience both materials yourself. For now we still have some Spring slots open for this free telephone consultation and sample pack. To learn more, email our project manager Amy Pan before the end of February: amypb@epopack.com"
Dermalogica chooses Aptar's fully recyclable mono-material pump Future,"Dermalogica has chosen Aptar's fully recyclable mono-material pump Future for their upcoming skincare launch. While traditional pumps may contain different materials, including metal components that can in some cases impact the recycling process, the Future pump is made from PE only, which aligns with the most common materials used to make skincare bottles - PE and PET, making the complete packaging, including pump and bottle, more efficiently recycled. ""The stakes have never been higher for the health of our planet,"" says Aurelian Lis, Dermalogica's Chief Executive Officer. ""Being the first prestige skincare brand to incorporate these mono-material pumps is a significant way we can create a cleaner earth for future generations."" The Future pump has received multiple industry certifications and earned recognition from the Association of Plastics Recyclers Meets Preferred Guidance Program and RecyClass, a cross-industry initiative focused on harmonized recyclability as well as from Cyclos-HTTP (the institute for Recyclability and Product Responsibility). Furthermore, since this pump is produced at Aptar's International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) certified manufacturing site, this solution can be made using ISCC certified material. Another important feature of the Future pump's innovative design is an incorporated, easy-to-use on/off locking system and a 360° degree actuator. The locking system has a ring which opens or locks the pump with an accompanying double-click sound. The 360° degree rotator allows to freely orient the actuator. Brands can choose from several different ring colors for customization. This design also renders Future compliant with the rigorous Amazon ISTA 6 protocol. Designed for e-commerce, Future's ISTA 6 compliance ensures that the pump withstands the risks associated with transport and distribution network pressures as well as necessitates less protective carton and paper packaging."
Texen takes over PRP Creation's flexible packaging business,"With this acquisition, Texen aims to strengthen their capacities in a segment that is expected to grow rapidly in response to the growing demand for more sustainable packaging solutions, including refills, and the rise of powder and anhydrous cosmetics. The financial terms of the transaction have not been disclosed. Indeed, Texen considers the development of flexible distribution systems (pouches and doypacks) to be instrumental in the transition of the beauty packaging business towards a more sustainable model. Actually, this industrial technology helps to lower the environmental footprint of packaging solutions for all beauty categories, including makeup, skincare and fragrance, thanks to the use of light pouches as refill systems. It also allows to create high-performance packaging that reduces waste (high product restitution levels) and limits the need for preservatives (airless systems). Eventually, thanks to PP/PE monomaterial options, for instance, it is possible to produce fully recyclable packs. ""We are thrilled to welcome this new activity as well as the team behind its development,"" said Texen CEO Rémi Weidenmann. ""The combination of our different areas of expertise, as well as Texen's global presence, represent a major growth opportunity for this value proposition, which offers significant eco-design benefits."" The move will allow PRP Creation to accelerate their growth by concentrating resources and investments on their core business: plastic packaging, and plastic bottles and caps. PRP Creation also said their aim is to better meet the growing demand and maintain their flexibility. The Oyonnax, France, -headquartered company will therefore integrate an in-house mould maker in the coming months and continue to invest in its industrial equipment through the acquisition of fully electric extrusion blow moulding and air-blown injection machines with IML robotization. ""This operation is strategic. It will allow PRP Creation to enter a new growth phase, driven by desirable, sustainable innovation,"" said Joël Viry, President of PRP Creation and the group STLinks. ""We thank all of our employees who have contributed to the development of this activity. We will accompany the transfer of the activity so that this differentiated offer continues to grow."""
Albéa merges tube head and cap for a record tube weight reduction,"For this first on the beauty market, Albéa has designed a single open-and-close system thus reducing the tube's components to only two. The two-in-one solution allows more than 80% weight reduction of the head+cap components, meaning 55% weight reduction for the whole EcoFusion Top tube compared to standard tubes [1]. If it changes the traditional aesthetics of tubes, this solution offers substantial environmental benefits. ""Reducing plastic use through weight reduction is a top priority in our responsible tubes roadmap"", says Caroline Hughes, Marketing Manager Albéa Tubes. ""As a single-component open-and-close breakthrough system, EcoFusion Top is the most advanced solution in weight reduction on the market. In addition, less plastic in the packaging means a smaller carbon footprint and a reduced environmental impact."" EcoFusion Top is made from HDPE to guarantee mono-materiality and recyclability. This two-in-one system will be available with various sleeve options such as bestselling Greenleaf for laminate tubes and the Thin-Wall technology for extruded tubes. This innovation is also adapted to the e-commerce market and complies with Ista-6 standard."
Berlin Packaging expands in the beauty space with Premi acquisition,"Headquartered in Milan, Italy, Premi has over 150 employees throughout Europe, the United States, and Asia. With research and development centres on three continents, Premi supplies a wide range of packaging products and services to a variety of cosmetic companies. In addition to its design and innovation capabilities in packaging solutions, the company also boasts a variety of other value-added services that allow it to deliver turnkey solutions for its customers, including formulation services, compatibility and stability testing, sustainability solutions, branding services, digital marketing, and more. Moreover, Premi offers customizable packaging solutions with no minimum order requirements through its online store, Stocksmetic. ""This is a key acquisition for Berlin Packaging. Premi is a market leader in the beauty packaging industry with incredible know-how for the design and production processes. By leveraging our combined footprint and capabilities, we will deliver unparalleled solutions to our customers,"" commented Paolo Recrosio, CEO of Berlin Packaging EMEA. Premi is the 19th acquisition by Berlin Packaging in EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) since 2016. All employees and locations for this acquisition will be retained, said the group in a statement. Last year, Berlin Packaging expanded its United Kingdom business with the acquisition of Raepak Limited, a supplier of plastic packaging for the cosmetics and personal care end-markets."
Cosmogen bets on sustainability to drive its growth in Latin America,"Jean-Christophe Van Geem is a Belgian citizen, but his Minas Gerais accent reveals a long-standing attachment to Brazil where he has been living for about thirty years. He has been representing Cosmogen in Latin America as Commercial Director for four years now. ""In Latin America, the cosmetics market includes a wide range of local businesses of varying sizes, from start-ups to giant multinationals. As sales manager, my main mission is to follow these companies and to listen to their expectations"", explains Jean-Christophe Van Geem. According to Van Geem, customers in Latin American have a different approach than in other parts of the world, such as Asia and the Middle East, where Cosmogen is also doing business. ""The difference lies in the proximity to the customer. We are used to connect and interact quickly. If you don't have that more personal approach, it doesn't work."" Cosmogen currently sales in seven countries in the region, with Brazil accounting for approximately 60% of the company's Latin American turnover. However, according to Jean-Christophe Van Geem, there is still a lot to do. ""It's a huge market. It would be risky to pretend that I know it entirely. But Cosmogen's product offering is very broad, so I can navigate the main segments of the cosmetics market, from skin care and hair products to makeup and perfumes."" For greater proximity to local customers, Cosmogen has entered into a partnership with C-Pack, a Brazilian manufacturer of plastic tubes for the cosmetics segment. ""As part of this collaboration, C-Pack locally produces the tubes for which we can use our various applicators,"" says the sales director. ""Local customers can rely on a local supplier and thus purchase a complete, fully assembled solution."" The disposable tube is made with green polyethylene (PE), a raw material from a renewable source. However, the applicator can be reused with another tube. Jean-Christophe Van Geem points out that the choice of a local partner like C-Pack is also strategic in terms of sustainability. ""The future is sustainability. There is no other way."" Cosmogen has recently developed numerous solutions in line with this market demand. Dedicated to solid cosmetics, the ReUse Stick, for instance, is the only single-material (PP) stick packaging on the market to be recyclable, waterproof and refillable. Each refill can save up to 56% plastic material. Another example is the patented R-Brush, a 100% mono-material brush, with no glue, and entirely made of recycled PET. ""Sustainability is a major concern of the Latin American cosmetics industry. For this reason, our growth depends on these sustainable products,"" highlights the manager. Without citing any figures (the company belongs to an investment fund that does not disclose this information), Van Geem emphasizes that Latin America is a ""relevant market"" for the French company. ""If you look at everything we've done since 2017, it was a real success for all parties. We are on a growth dynamic and we intend to continue at this pace,"" he concludes."
Trade shows: ADF&PCD and PLD Paris 2022 to build on their Parisian roots,"[UPDATE - December 7, 2021, 1:20 pm: The show has just been postponed to June 29 & 30, 2022] More than 650 exhibitors [1] and more than 10,000 professional visitors are expected for the next edition of the ADF&PCD and PLD Paris show, next January in Paris. ""For the moment, we are on the same trends as in previous years, and we have seen in recent months, during fairs organized by our colleagues, that there is a real desire to meet again among professionals,"" says Josh Brooks, show director. According to Christelle Anya, community and content director of ADF&PCD and PLD, the event targets ""three very complementary markets with many gateways."" In an unprecedented context, the ambition is to highlight packaging innovation more than ever, with an emphasis on the essential topics of the moment: eco-responsibility, material innovation, alternatives to plastic, digitalization, recharging, 3D printing. From this point of view, the ADF&PCD and PLD Innovation Awards ceremony are among the most anticipated moments of the show. For a better visibility of the innovations presenting during the show, a new gallery dedicated to the Awards and key trends for the coming year will be created. The innovations proposed by the ESEPAC and ESP (École Supérieure du Parfum) students, who were asked by Estée Lauder to eco-design ultra-luxury perfumes, will also be displayed, as well as the innovations of the ESIReims students, who have been asked by Shiseido and Huda Beauty to imagine innovative skincare and makeup collections. Finally, the program of round tables and conferences will also provide an overview of the major market trends(Beautystreams, Asia Cosme Lab), and to take stock of recyclability issues and of the future of plastics in premium and beauty packaging. Let's hope the resurgence of the Covid-19 outbreak will not negatively impact this event, which looks promising at a time where global demand is surging."
"Eviosys, Grown.Bio and Verescence create a 100% recyclable beauty gift pack","Eviosys, Grown.Bio and Verescence have harnessed their capabilities to develop an innovative set of products with the aim to set the tone for the future of cosmetic packaging and to better meet the expectations of consumers who are increasingly looking for products with the planet in mind. The limited-edition gift set includes 100% recyclable and refillable glass bottles, a carbon negative 100% home-compostable insert made from mushroom material, and a reusable 100% infinitely recyclable metal tin. All three partners are committed to five key goals: refuse options that not environmentally-friendly, rethink the gift set concept, reduce the packaging weight, reuse, and recycle materials. Supplying the outer metal tin, leading metal manufacturer, Eviosys, has adapted their original product to work well with the mushroom insert and Verescence's glass products. The metal tins made of recycled metal can be kept and reused for decades to serve another purpose at home, ensuring the circularity of the limited-edition set. After a long and purposeful life, 100% of the tin can be recycled to form new metal without any loss of property ever. ""We are always looking for sustainable alternatives to secure products within our metal tins, and Verescence and Grown.Bio were obvious partners for this venture. We're excited to be collaborating with them both on this gift set, combining the expertise of industry leaders and pioneers in sustainability to adapt traditional cosmetic products to be more eco-friendly,"" said Laetitia Durafour, Marketing Director of the Swiss-based group. The 100% home-compostable insert is manufactured by Grown.Bio from a carbon negative material derived from mycelium (the root structure of mushrooms) and agricultural by-products. At the end of life, it can be crumbled, mixed with soil to be used as fertilizer. They can also be biodegraded on a home compost or flower bed. Finally, the bottles supplied by Verescence are part of the French glassmaker's new range of high perfumery CARA. Thanks to their new standard screw neck (GPI 15 400), they can be refilled at home or in-store. Furthermore, since September, all standards from Verescence have been produced with 20% PCR glass. ""Since glass is infinitely recyclable, we wanted to create an eco-responsible gift set for the promotion of our new standard range CARA in line with the expectations of luxury brands. This collaboration with Eviosys and Grown.Bio allowed us to promote the most sustainable packaging options for our customers, as each component of the gift set is either recyclable, reusable or compostable. We also believe it can be a source of inspiration for brands in their quest for progress in sustainability,"" concluded Bérangère Raguenet, Marketing Director at Verescence."
Aptar's Inune: Four eco-designed fragrance sprays to meet all expectations,"With this new collection, the dispensing solutions specialist offers a series of spray pumps based on a single technological platform: a new patented mechanism. POM-free and 10% lighter than the alternatives on the market, the four new spray pumps have been designed to be interchangeable, perfectly suited for refillable perfumes and also recyclable [1]. Since their generalization in perfumery, spray pumps have significantly shaped the sensorial experience related to fragrances. However, expectations still vary, depending on personality, culture, season or even occasion. The Inune collection features four spray pumps corresponding to different ways to apply fragrances: – Classic Inune, which offers a spray described as ""short and targeted"", as precise and clean as it is quick, in order to apply the fragrance on a targeted body area, such as the neckline or décolleté. – HDS [2] Inune, described as ""breezy and broad"", which offers an ultra-fine spray and provides instant freshness while diffusing olfactory notes delicately and generously on the skin. – Precious Inune, described as ""long and luscious"", it offers an ""enduring, enveloping and languorous mist."" – Silk Inune, offers a spray described as ""continuous and ultra-soft, like a veil of perfume"" in order to highlight the sensorial benefits of fragrances. Every detail in Inune's design is in line with luxury codes: classic and discreet, the height of the spray pumps has been minimized and their mechanism is completely invisible. The spray pumps offer a particularly gentle action and the whole collection ensures a total olfactory neutrality as no metal components are in contact with the perfume. Furthermore, the collection follows an environmentally friendly approach. POM-free and 10% lighter than the alternatives on the market, the spray pumps are perfectly suited for refillable perfumes. They meet the new CETIE standard for screw bottles and are therefore easily interchangeable onto any glass bottle in line with the standard. For optimal recycling, Aptar recommends to leave the spray on the perfume glass bottle and place it in the glass recycling stream as most of them can also recycle the pump's metallic components (subject to local capabilities). ""Our teams have skilfully combined their extensive fragrance expertise in ritual gestures, perfume neutrality and integrity, luxury design and technology. All of which take our planet into consideration, in line with our circular economy approach, this new collection offers refillability or recyclable solutions for our partners,"" said Xavier Joseph, Vice President Global Marketing and Innovation, Aptar Beauty + Home."
Verre Infini 20 to become the standard glass composition of Verescence,"Verescence has formalized the launch of Verre Infini 20, a new glass composition that was announced at the Édition Spéciale by Luxe Pack show, last September. With Verre Infini 20, the glassmaker offers a formulation that combines 20% PCR [1] and a glass tint adapted to the aesthetic requirements of luxury brands. Above all, Verre Infini 20 is becoming the standard glass composition of Verescence. Already produced in France and Spain, this glass composition will be gradually deployed in the United States in the first quarter of 2022, then in South Korea in 2023. ""Since September 2021, our biggest furnace in France and our Spanish furnace have been operating successfully with this glass composition. It is thanks to the commitment of our major customers that Verre Infini 20 becomes the standard glass composition of Verescence. It is a paradigm shift in the beauty industry that we are proud to support for sustainable luxury."", says Thomas Riou, CEO of Verescence. This new formulation will therefore not only be intended to appeal to brands that want to take the path of sustainability without accepting the aesthetic alteration linked to a high content of recycled material, it will be the benchmark production of the group, which thus takes a new step in its efforts to reduce its environmental footprint. ""We have invested more than one million euros to adapt our furnaces to the production of recycled glass, which also contributes to the reduction of our CO2 emissions (5% lower emissions). Globally and from 2022, nearly 75% of our productions will be made from PCR glass,"" highlights Alain Thorré, CSR Director of Verescence. With this new initiative, Verescence continues its efforts to impose PCR glass in the luxury industry. The first version of Verre Infini was launched in 2008. At that time, it was composed of 100% PCR glass and was available in a series of standard designs for perfumery and skincare. However, the greenish aspect of the glass, linked to the use of recycled glass, had hampered the success of the initiative. In 2015, the glassmaker thus proposed a new version: the Verre Infini Neo, made from 65% of factory cullet (crushed glass rejected form a previous manufacturing batch and reused by the manufacturer, also called PIR [2] glass), 25% recycled post consumer (PCR) glass and 10% virgin mineral raw material (sand, sodium, limestone). A reformulation that removed the slight green tint of the initial version. Verre Infini Neo succeeded to attract the attention of several prestige brands, including The body Shop, or Henry Rose."
Soaring production costs are putting the glass industry under pressure,"The enthusiasm created by the recovery in the consumption of beauty products is hiding tensions that are pushing to caution the main players in the market. Around the world, production costs have skyrocketed in recent months, whereas they had fallen only slightly in 2020. This is due to the increase in the price of energy, raw materials and maritime transport, as well as various bottlenecks that make it difficult or expensive to obtain some ingredients. The glass industry, which is very energy-demanding, has been hard hit. Simone Baratta, Business Perfumes Beauty Unit Director of the Italian glassmaker Bormioli Luigi, considers that, compared to the beginning of 2021 the increase in production costs is considerable and that it is mostly due to the explosion in the costs of gas and energy in general. He fears that this increase will continue in 2022. A situation not seen since the oil shock of October 1974! ""Everything has increased! Energy costs of course, but also all the components that are necessary for production: raw materials, pallets, cardboard, transport,..."" confirms Étienne Gruyez, CEO of Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie. For the premium glass industry, this increase in costs is occurring against a backdrop of a sharp increase in production volumes. ""We are seeing an increase in activity with a return to pre-Covid levels,"" notes Thomas Riou, CEO of Verescence. ""However, we believe that we should remain cautious. The market, which has been depressed for two years, has not yet stabilised at this stage."" To deal with this increase in demand, the Pochet Group restarted a furnace, which had been shut down during the pandemic - and ""hired and trained some personnel,"" notes Éric Lafargue, Sales Director of the Pochet du Courval Group, ""although we had no certainty"" that this high level of demand would be maintained over the long term. The question is therefore to know what part of these costs will be absorbed by the margins of the different players in the sector and if a part of them will be passed on to the selling prices. Glassmakers interviewed by Premium Beauty News are unanimous in saying that volume increases will not be sufficient to compensate for the rise in production costs and that the sector is now in danger. Most of them, therefore, confirm they have started negotiations with their clients to obtain an adaptation of their purchase prices. ""Today our margins have been severely eroded. Glassmakers lost a lot of money during the crisis, and we thought we would be able to recover thanks to the return of volumes at the time of the recovery. We see that the recovery is there, but not profitability,"" emphasizes Étienne Gruye. ""The situation is very critical after a penalising 2020 year with high fixed costs,"" confirms Thomas Riou. The analysis is identical in Germany or Italy. For Rudolf Wurm, Sales Director of the German glassmaker Heinz Glas, the industry has now entered ""a complex situation where our margins are seriously jeopardized"". ""The paradigm according to which volume growth could be sufficient to compensate for rising costs no longer works at all. We need to generate margins, with the help of the market, if we want to maintain the same quality of service and products,"" explains Simone Baratta, for Bormioli Luigi. This sudden and unexpected change in conditions of production has led to the mobilisation of industrialists who, for the most part, have already launched cost-cutting programmes, while also alerting their customers to the risks of sustainability of the sector. Agility, inventory carrying, energy savings, preservation of the peripheral business fabric, major players have put in place various action plans. ""Our priority is to protect small businesses that depend on us. These VSBs/SMEs are indispensable in the ecosystem,"" declares Thomas Riou for Verescence. If all players optimise their operating bases, the crisis will only be overcome through negotiations that take into account the specificities of the glass industry. A revision of prices, a review of the storage policy or the taking into account of cyclical delays, or all together: each supplier has its own priorities but all of them have entered into negotiations. ""We have strengthened our exchanges with our customers to optimise our capabilities and control our stocks. We are also negotiating agreements with our customers to pass on all or part of the sharp increases in energy and raw material costs, etc.,"" says Éric Lafargue. Although the approach demands clarity and pedagogy, a consensual outcome seems essential for the future of the sector. ""In some cases, when a customer refuses to accept a price increase, despite the detailed information we submitted to him, we may have to refuse to produce because it would no longer be profitable,"" explains Étienne Gruyez. ""We need the support of our customers to sustain the whole industry. This crisis has shown how strategic suppliers can be in the value chain. It's a whole ecosystem, if there's a component missing, the product is not complete,"" insists Éric Lafargue, for Pochet. ""This extraordinary situation requires an extraordinary response,"" says Simone Baratta. The Head of Bormioli Luigi fears that this situation will ""slow down manufacturers in their innovations and investments."" Manufacturers insist that the increases they consider necessary would represent around ten cents, at most, if they were passed on to the price of the final product. But this increase could be largely absorbed by the margins of brands, some of which have announced record profits in a row. A positive situation, which shows the good health of the industry, but which must benefit all its actors, some glassmakers argue."
Albéa commits to reduce its absolute carbon emissions by 46% by 2030,"""For the past fifteen years, Albéa has put sustainable development and CSR at the heart of its activity,"" highlights the company. This is reflected, among other things, in a constant commitment to reduce its GHG emissions and to develop circular and low environmental impact packaging solutions. To accelerate its transition, Albéa has revised its carbon emissions objectives for 2030 to support the stabilization of global temperature at +1.5°C. For the Group, this means in concrete terms: A 46% reduction of its GHG emissions on scopes 1 & 2 by 2030 (versus 2019). To achieve this objective, Albéa will initiate various action levers. The first is to keep reducing the group's electricity consumption, which represents 95% of the scope 1&2 emissions. ""Over the last 10 years, Albea has built a network of energy experts across its 31 facilities to drive improvements. An annual dedicated budget will support this continuous effort,"" says the company. The second lever of action is green energy. A significant step has been made in 2020 through the purchase of Energy Certificate Attributes (EACs): Since then, 39% of the electricity used by Albéa worldwide is renewable. In Europe, this rate is close to 100%. Albéa is now assessing PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) and on-site solar solutions as a long-term project. Besides this engagement on scope 1 and 2 emission reduction, Albéa claims to be actively working on its scope 3: all indirect emissions in the value chain. Thanks to its Responsible Packaging Program the company has a specific focus on GHG emissions during the product design and production processes. ""The selection of new materials with low GHG emissions, designing out waste in the products and production systems will have a significant impact on Albéa's scope 3 in the future."" In addition, the company continues to engage within different initiatives. Some weeks ago, Albéa signed the French Business Climate Pledge, joining companies from various industries."
Bormioli Luigi is adapting its glass production to make-up,"Bormioli Luigi, which specialises in luxury bottles for the perfume and cosmetics industry, is now expanding its offer to new territories with a range of customisable glass standards for lipsticks and mascaras. With already some 3 million glass components produced each year for the make-up sector, mainly foundations for clients such as Chanel and Dior, the company, which is therefore not a newcomer to this market, wishes to gain momentum by demonstrating all the possibilities offered by this infinitely recyclable material and thus broaden the categories of products that use it. To address this new market, the Italian glassmaker will rely on the industrial facilities of its fellow company Bormioli Rocco, from which it acquired the ""tableware"" division in 2020. To increase its capabilities in the masstige segment, the Group has installed an IS machine at the Azuqueca site in Spain and plans to continue its investments to have a total of three lines dedicated to cosmetics locally. At the MakeUp in Paris trade show, on October 20 and 21, Bormioli Luigi presented two customisable glass standards: a refillable lipstick bottle and a mascara or lipgloss vial, with caps, stems and wipers made in partnership with Pibiplast, for a turnkey offer. The lipstick was created using a pressed glass technology derived from the tableware industry, allowing the production of thin walls. For mascara and lipgloss bottles, produced in standard blown glass, the technical challenge was to comply with the small tolerances required for the inside of the neck to correctly position the wiper. This is much more difficult to achieve in glassmaking than in plastics processing. As part of this ""back to glass"" initiative aimed at introducing glass again into as many categories as possible, Bormioli Luigi is making available all its glass decoration techniques for the customisation of packs, including its INSIDE lacquering, which is particularly suitable for mascaras where the bottles are often opaque. ""We can therefore offer our standard solutions to a brand that would then be able to decorate them in its corporate image, but we are also available to brand owners looking for a specific and unique solution,"" explains Federico Montali, Business Development and Marketing Manager - Prestige Perfumes, at Bormioli Luigi. The Italian glassmaker is convinced that glass has what it takes to appeal to make-up brands. It is a high-end material that can both be recycled indefinitely and contain a significant amount of post-consumer recycled material (PCR). In Italy, Bormioli runs several furnaces with 15% PCR glass continuously and a 40% PCR glass will be available at the Spanish site as soon as it opens. ""Up to 40% of PCR glass has little effect on the tint of the glass. This poses even less of a problem for use in make-up where the products are coloured,"" emphasises Federico Montali. For even greater flexibility, the glassmaker has implemented an innovative technological solution called ""Your PCR"", which allows an additional 10% of PCR glass to be added to the feeder at the end of the annealing process, thus increasing the percentage of recycled material on specific lines when requested by the customer. Finally, UV protection can be applied to the glass and - for safe use - the Safe Glass option is also available. This option allows the bottle to be reinforced by lacquering, making it highly resistant to shocks and preventing the scattering of splinters, in the event the glass should break."
Taiki Cosmetics unveils resolutely sustainable applicators and masks,"At MakeUp in Paris 2021, the Japanese-based supplier of accessories, applicators, packaging and full-service solutions for make-up and skincare products, has unveiled a series of brand new sustainable products. In line with market demand, Taiki Cosmetics has made the choice of sustainability for its applicators as well as for its skincare facial masks, but with the aim not to make any concession on quality and efficiency. For their new sponges, Taiki has chosen to reduce the use of petrochemical derivatives, without opting for fully biodegradable solutions ""which have the disadvantage of being prone to deterioration"", explains Alix Bellanné, Marketing & Communication Director at Taiki Cosmetics Europe. The company therefore introduced three new eco-designed solutions as soft, washable and performant as their traditional counterparts: – Cellfine, a universal NBR sponge for all formula types that contains 28% less petrochemicals than standard NBR sponges thanks to Taiki exclusive production process adding small air bubbles to the material. According to the company, smoothness and makeup results are even improved! – Blooming Blenders, a collection of blending sponges made of Wet PU, a special material using 20 to 30% of natural plants powder replacing petrochemicals. – Ecoporous 70 (PU), a premium material for high-end sponges and puffs allowing to replace 70% of the petrochemical ingredients by biosourced substances, offering the same luxurious feeling and even application. Antibacterial treatments are available as an option for each product. Taiki also launched at MakeUp in Paris a 100% natural origin (lyocell, organic cotton, banana...) non-woven eye patch impregnated with a formula that can be certified organic. Dubbed Eye Patch Cure, the patch is housed in a recycled and recyclable PET jar with a PP lid. According to the company, the packaging allows a 50% reduction of the formula quantity, compared to what would be needed in single-use sachets. Following the same naturalness path, the company also presented a series of 100% natural non-woven masks made from different types of natural fibres: Banana Eyepatch (75% banana fibres + 25% wood pulp), Aloe Vera Mask (20% aloe vera powder + 80% wood pulp), Bamboo Charcoal Mask (20% bamboo charcoal powder + 80% viscose), Green Tea Mask (20% green tea extract + 80% wood pulp), Snow Lotus Mask (lyocell and lotus fibre). Particularly impressive, the Black Konjac Mask is made entirely from dehydrated konjac root and bamboo charcoal. Impregnated with 3ml (eyepatch) to 15ml (face mask) of lotion the mask is rehydrated in only 5 min and is ready for application. After use, it just has to be rinsed off with clear water and dried, until the next use… Eventually, Taiki Cosmetics has added to a new brush specially designed for the application of solid cosmetic products to their One Cut collection. As the other items of the range, the wand is cut in a single piece of wood (red wood, walnut, willow, beech, birch), it has no aluminium ferule and the tuft is made of synthetic fibres. Several decoration techniques are available and different shapes can be created."
ADF&PCD and PLD Paris is preparing for a major 2022 edition,"ADF&PCD and PLD Paris is now a key trade show for packaging professionals? Josh Brook - ADF&PCD and PLD Paris offers an absolute focus on innovation and provides a vision of the future of packaging for everyone. Targeting the niche markets of beauty, aerosols and dispensing, and since 2020, premium beverages, it is the benchmark event in packaging. Talks, Awards, exhibitor stands - innovation is everywhere. Our visitors and exhibitors alike know that this event is much more than a showcase, it's a place for meetings and exchanges where projects come to life. Clients and their teams come with their objectives set for real projects to be carried out. The event has a friendly atmosphere, which facilitates connections and networking. It is held in Paris, the world's capital for luxury and beauty industries, so it is close to where brands are located. Decision-makers in marketing, packaging and purchasing do not miss this event, which takes place right on their doorstep. Finally, let's not forget that this is the first event of the year: it sets the tone for the months to come and launches the dynamics of creativity and business. What are the main themes of the 2022 edition? Christelle Anya - These three events, which are fully complementary, are focused on innovations and market trends. The main themes that we will be addressing through our programme will be mainly oriented towards eco-responsibility, a key issue for brands and consumers alike. We will highlight material innovation, PCR, alternatives to plastic, sustainable solutions, and progress and challenges around recyclability in the cosmetics industry. We will also address the latest trends in terms of design, production, digitalisation, e-commerce, sampling, intelligent packaging, refill, and 3D printing... which are at the heart of companies' ambitions. And the highlights? Christelle Anya - The ADF&PCD and PLD Innovation Awards ceremonies are amongst the most eagerly awaited moments of the event. These are highly respected prizes, overseen by prestigious and impartial jury panels. The awards offer exceptional visibility to the participating companies and is a springboard for many of them. Over the years we have seen a real buzz around the Awards, with entries from all continents across the globe. This year will mark the first face-to-face PLD Innovation Awards. In addition, of course, there are the other inspiring highlights that make ADF&PCD and PLD Paris such a success: the conferences and round tables featuring the best experts in the sector, the prestigious Pentawards gallery, the networking events and the guided tours. What will be new in this 2022 edition? Josh Brook - We are strengthening the innovation aspect with a new gallery dedicated to the Awards and key trends of the coming year, as well as the presentation of student projects. Visitors will be able to see the innovations imagined by ESEPAC and ESP students on the eco-design of ultra-luxury perfumes (a competition sponsored by Estée Lauder), as well as, for the first time, innovation projects by ESI Reims students. This first edition of the Talents Challenge is initiated once again by Easyfairs, in partnership with the school, and sponsored by Shiseido and Huda Beauty. We will create or improve networking and relaxation areas such as the VIP Lounge, the Cocktail Bar and the Champagne Bar. What also sets the 2022 edition apart is that it goes beyond the timeframe of the exhibition and relies on online events. The pre-show webinars are designed to highlight new products that should not be missed, which will help suppliers and brands to plan their visit. All of our online events over the past few months (Digital Days, Innovation Talks, awards ceremonies, etc.) have helped to connect, inform and inspire our community. The exhibition is highly anticipated after a 2021 edition held online! Josh Brook - Although the health context did not prevent virtual meetings, we could not physically look and feel the packaging and materials on display, and this physical aspect is of major importance in our market. We see great willingness on the part of both suppliers and brands to return to events and to meet face-to-face again. So the feeling is quite positive, quite confident, and we look forward to bringing this community together again in January."
"Albéa introduces low impact, recycled makeup and skincare packaging range","""Makeup and skincare packaging is about different packaging types welcoming different formulas, made from different technologies and with their own levels of complexity. The challenge is high as it requires to reconsider our processes and product design, and to carefully select the right materials for cosmetics applications,"" says Aude Charbonneaux, CSR Manager at Albéa. ""Our first priority is to reconsider the type of plastic resins used in the packaging, moving from non-recyclable resins to recyclable resins such as PET & PP, available also as post-consumer recycled resins (PCR)."" In order to support brands in their CSR transition, Albéa worked on the optimization of its supply chain to ensure secured sources of recycled materials. The company is now offering a full range of stock PET and PP based packaging integrating 30% to 100% of post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastics in the total pack to lower the use of virgin material: – The ""BIM"" product range features 3 sizes of round compacts that are perfect for face and eye makeup. All of them are made of PET for the cap, cover & plate and include 30% of PCR PET. – The ""Cheeky"" & ""Bloom"" lipsticks both showcase a cap & base in PET with 30% recycled material. – The ""Clear Touch"" Face stick is a 100% PET conception available with 50% PCR PET. – Best-seller ""Mémoire"" & ""Sunset"" mascaras are now available with 100% PCR PP for the cap & 100% PCR PET for the bottle. Other options of sticks, mascara and jars are also available with PCR PP content. Albéa also offers solutions integrating chemically recycled material and produced in its ISCC (International Sustainability in Carbon Certification) certified plants.

"Refill, Lumson's new frontier","Refills not only create perfect interaction with consumers who are forever looking for products with an element of customization, but also increase this perception. What's more, consumers already use refill systems on a regular basis – just take the food industry, which introduced refillable products years ago – so the cosmetic industry was inevitably going to have to start looking in this direction too. ""Re Place – Lumson's new glass jar with a refillable system (inner cup) – is one of the refills designed by our centre of excellence to be easily removed and replaced, and provides the perfect answer to the market's demands. In the new circular design systems, refills are an effective solution given their extremely positive impact on the environment, while also encouraging new more ethical and virtuous habits among more mindful consumers"", explains Matteo Moretti, CEO of Lumson. The first in a series as ""For Lumson, redesigning, rethinking new refill systems will become more and more a priority, and attests to our unwavering commitment to sustainability, without overlooking technical, aesthetic and product protection functions."" Lumson, who is long time focused on the circular economy's 3Rs – Reduce, Reuse, Recycle – applying them to its whole portfolio, has adopted three new key concepts for the refill sector: Re-Think, Re-Gen, Re-Act. – Re-Think, rethinking packaging with an ECO-design approach. – Re-Gen, to give the glass jar a new life. – Re-Act, the consumer plays an increasingly active role and customizes their product by simply replacing the inner cup. Re Place uses two Lumson 50ml glass jars: Deluxe and Unique, whose respective distinguishing features are an elegant, classic shape and rounded lines with a refined look. Both feature an extremely thick jar bottom for a POSITIVE LUXURY approach. The plastic inner cup – which has been specifically designed to allow a protection to be applied on top – after use, can be easily removed from the jar and disposed of through the recycling chain. Both components can be customized – giving the individual packaging elements their own distinctive, eye-catching identity – using various effects and decorations: from simple but elegant screen printing, to more sophisticated inner lacquering that enhances and adds further value to the lines and thickness of the glass. A thousand and one ways – and maybe more – to turn Re Place into a unique packaging, one that echoes Lumson's identity and character."
Steklarna Hrastnik takes a first step towards carbon neutral glass,"The main source of carbon dioxide emissions in the production of glass is related to the energy consumption required for the melting of the raw materials. While 100% electric furnaces do exist, there are currently hardly any glassmakers using them and they need to be powered by fully renewable electricity to claim carbon neutrality. To deal with that issue, Steklarna Hrastnik has used so-called ""green"" hydrogen as a sustainable fuel to melt glass for a first batch production of the ""carbon free bottles"". Indeed, hydrogen can be produced in several ways, one being when an electric current splits water into oxygen and hydrogen. To be fully sustainable and carbon neutral, this process, called electrolysis, requires the electricity to come from a renewable source of energy. In such a case, hydrogen is considered as being ""green"". For the production of their first batch of carbon free bottles, Hrastnik1860 has used green hydrogen produced by electrolysis thanks to solar cells. The main raw material was made from external cullet collected from waste recycled glass. ""Oxygen and hydrogen were used as fuel. The only emission produced in the glass making process was water vapour instead of carbon dioxide,"" said the company in a statement. Of course, the cost of such a process is not trivial, since the manufacture of ""green"" hydrogen is relatively expensive compared to natural gas, for example. Steklarna Hrastnik, however, said they are ready to invest in industrial production capacity for brands that would be ready to make exceptional efforts in terms of sustainability and decarbonisation. ""To date, the company has a capacity to melt 200 kilograms of carbon free and 100% PCR glass,"" said Peter Čas, CEO of Hrastnik1860. For the industrial scale test, which will be done in 2022, the company will source hydrogen from a third party producer but ""in the future our aim is to produce green hydrogen as our own fuel for industrial glass melting,"" added Čas. Steklarna Hrastnik believes to be able to produce their own hydrogen within two to three years. ""We want to be at the forefront of the glass industry when it comes to sustainability,"" claimed Čas. Actually, after years focusing on reducing gas emissions, a technological breakthrough is now required to reach the carbon neutrality goal by 2050 set by EU regulations. Hrastnik1860 plans to decrease their carbon footprint by more than 25% by 2025 by replacing a third of their fossil fuel consumption by green energy, and by increasing energy efficiency by 10%. In the longer run, the company's ambition is to reduce their carbon footprint by more than 40% by 2030 and going neutral by 2050."
"WWP Beauty enters the ""refill revolution"" with new stock packaging collection","The full-service supplier has launched a new collection of refillable stock packaging solutions designed to reduce the environmental footprint of cosmetic products. Dubbed ""Refill Revolution"" the collection features five packaging solutions targeting all beauty categories. Furthermore, each of the components in this collection features a refillable design with measured carbon emissions reduction: – Refill Revolution Airless Pens. Touchless, sensorial and integrated applicators that reduce carbon emissions by up to 60% after three refills. The applicator options include a cooling metal roller ball applicator for spot treatments and eye serums, a triple micro roller ball applicator for targeted eye and lip treatments, and an oval brush applicator for concealers and liquid complexion products. The smart, low-profile design of these pens make them an easy refill system to integrate into an existing cosmetic line.. – Refill Revolution Multi-Use Face Stick. A patented design that produces 72% fewer GHG emissions after three refills when compared to a standard, non-refillable face stick of the same size and shape. Additionally, this component features a multi-purpose, direct-apply design that produces minimal refill waste and can be made with PCR content. This option is adapted for color cosmetic and skincare formulations. – Refill Revolution Multi-Use Body Stick. A patent-pending design featuring an intuitive, easy-to-use refillable system with a mono-material refill cartridge and the option to add PCR content. This component reduces GHG emissions by up to 71% after three refills and is an option for body care, personal care and hygiene products, and skincare. – Refill Revolution Powered Up Pump. A design that preserves formula integrity, easy to refill, with the option to add PCR content for increased sustainability claims. Can be used for color cosmetics, skincare and haircare products. – Refill Revolution Refill & Go Bottle. A portable, compact design that can be refilled and taken on the go. It can be used for a wide range of cream or gel-based formulas in color cosmetics, skincare, body care, personal care and haircare. ""This collection of intuitive refillable packaging was designed with components that could be used across all categories of beauty to show brands the possibilities of applying a refillable program to their existing line,"" said Michael Tognetti, Global Sustainability Senior Director, WWP Beauty. ""Using our Eco-Analyzer tool, we have generated validated sustainability claims and carbon emissions reduction percentages to show our customers the sustainable impact refillable packaging has."""
DSM relies on Albéa's sustainable tubes for their sun care prototypes,"Royal DSM plans to move most of its sun care formulation prototypes into tubes made by Albéa. According to the company, tubes are the packaging format that delivers the most significant sustainability impact as well as safety and hygiene benefits. ""In addition to protecting from microbial contamination, the tubes also deliver on cost of performance with minimum product loss (versus spray formulations, for example) and provide the use of use for consumers,"" said DSM in a statement. While the move toward more sustainable beauty and personal care products is nothing new, DSM says that consumers are increasingly paying attention to the sustainability of packaging. According to a recent study from Mintel, this trend affects all countries of the world. Actually, 83% of Malaysian adults said they would like to see more innovative sustainability ideas from big beauty brands, while over half of German adults said they believed that eco-friendly packaging for grooming and beauty products are plastic-free. ""Given that the cosmetics industry produces more than 120 billion units of packaging annually1, the opportunity to have a positive impact on the planet through progress in more sustainable packaging is tremendous,"" underlined DSM. In addition, rising consumer concern about packaging safety and ease of use is fuelling demand for contamination-free packaging that can help deliver peace of mind to consumers. Thanks to the partnership, the two companies can provide customers with a complete sustainable solution in sun care. Indeed, Albéa's tube used in DSM's formulation prototypes combines the 3Rs of increased sustainability: recycled content, recyclable-ready and reduced weight. Albéa's tube is composed of the light eco-design looking SLIM cap combined with the downgauged web leveraging the Thin-Wall technology for a reduced weight solution. The tube also incorporates a maximum level of Post-Consumer Recycled (PCR) content, the tube reaching 38% of PCR (62% excluding the cap) for a tube D35, 50ml thus participating to moving towards a circular economy. Albéa]'s tube perfectly complements DSM's recently launched PARSOL EHT, a highly efficient, eco-friendly UVB filter. DSM also offers to the industry its free online formulation tool, DSM Sunscreen Optimizer, which now includes a feature that supports customers with real-time eco-classification and ranking for formulations in development and on the market. ""To make our offering more sustainable, we need to work together and strive to introduce sustainable practices at every stage and in every area of our operations,"" says Gaelle Bathany, Global Director Sustainability DSM Personal Care and Aroma Ingredients. ""This requires shifting our mindset as well as taking many small but thoughtful steps in the right direction."" ""Two leaders combine their expertise, mindset, innovation capabilities as well as social and environmental responsibility so that beauty and personal care brands can ultimately deliver on their own commitments to their stakeholders,"" added Caroline Hughes, Head of Marketing, Albéa Tubes."
Premium packaging: sustainable solutions are taking shape at Luxe Pack Monaco,"Central to brand issues, the ecological transition of the premium cosmetic pack was undeniably the main concern of the event. The choice for the most relevant solution was once again fuelled by interesting innovations. The possibility of recycling is validated by the use of the same material for the whole packaging. To this end, solutions were expected for the different materials. Concerning plastics, Aptar Beauty + Home presented Pure, a tube and cap both made of polypropylene (PP) for an entirely recyclable set, as well as Future, launched last May, the first single-material pump made of polyethylene (PE) for personal care markets. In the same vein, Albéa showcased its extruded tubes with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) caps, as well as a new range of rigid packs (mascaras, sticks and jars) made of 100% PP or polyethylene terephthalate (PET) for skincare and make-up applications. Also in the spotlight at Cosmogen, ReUse, a patented stick made entirely of PP, recyclable and refillable, as well as rBrush, a make-up brush made entirely of recycled PET and without glue. Italy's Eurovetrocap has relied on its Zero In ·Pack entity to develop two mini collections playing on these two aspects of plastic circularity: #mono and #recycled. In particular, the company has designed a single-material PP dropper. Finally, Eurovetrocap has also invested in a triple extrusion machine allowing to combine recycled PE for the core and virgin PE for the internal and external walls. Among the materials associated with eco-design, wood can be considered with no additional materials, in particular for caps at Pujolasos with Woon, a cap with a screw thread made entirely of certified natural wood. As with the Woodacity range presented by Quadpack. Holmen, the Swedish forestry and paper industry giant with Iggesund, has been working on the development of a jar concept with a refill for skincare products, made exclusively from wood and its waste. The Conic prototype offers a transparent plastic-looking container made from wood oil while the conical refill is made of wood fibre. Verpack and Cosfibel also offer all-paper/cardboard boxes and wedges with no need for additional closing elements. To provide a global vision of its single-material solutions, Cosfibel has also presented its ReBel collection of 9 boxes made of 9 inspiring materials for eco-design, ranging from cardboard to cork, as well as different types of woods (ash, paulownia) or aluminium. Procos, for its part, highlighted the different versions of its 100% cardboard Yoga Light e-commerce box. Texen Beauty Partners has launched its all-cardboard skincare and make-up collection, palettes and boxes, sticks and lipstick packs. The choice of FSC-certified cardboard guarantees all the expected features from packaging: protection, resistance, design... The ""all-aluminium"" approach is also an important consideration for g. pivaudran for the design of caps where the weight and the insert are made out of aluminium or even partially recycled aluminium. The specialist in this inspiring eco-design material also reported on its progress in the field of recycled aluminium, an alternative that could soon open up production prospects for products in the sustainable luxury sector. For its part, Axilone presented its compact case made of 98% aluminium, including the mirror. Sometimes still in its infancy from a technical point of view, the ""refill"" approach is nonetheless gaining ground, in all categories. Glassmaker Bormioli Luigi - which is working to strike a balance in its activities between the three categories, namely perfume, skincare and make-up - is targeting directly the last two markets with a refillable glass jar containing a removable glass cup that the consumer can buy again in the shop and replace in a simple gesture. The same approach is taken by the Pochet Group, which promotes ""Luxury in a different way"" with the Odyssée jar, a 2-in-1 jar that combines a case and a lightweight glass refill. The refill can be closed with its recycled plastic cap and change into a product on the go. Tubes, airless bottles and sticks dedicated to solid formulas, Cosmogen has put forward all the possibilities of use and application in a refillable version with the ReUse range and its different independent applicators. Aptar Beauty + Home presented a trio of refillable innovations. The Private Refill, a lipstick case secured with a unique and customisable key that clips and unclips the mechanism and guarantees the brand exclusive use of its refills. In addition, the brand has launched premium airless and refillable solutions: Serumony Reload and Gaïa. Among the launches, one should also note the development by g.pivaudran of an all-aluminium refillable case for the Cartier Nécessaires à parfum collection. The trend for solutions that protect contents from contact and contamination by bacteria and viruses is taking hold through approaches that have become indispensable in the field of product testing, but also through the coating of containers. Altus Coating, which specialises in the creation of UV varnishes, UV lacquers and tints, introduced AlSafe, its latest antimicrobial innovation suitable for all surfaces and packaging materials. This UV-curable coating incorporates a clear, colourless component that destroys contaminants over time. The solution would also significantly reduce the use of disinfectant solutions, which are known to release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the atmosphere. This technology is compatible with the use of bio-sourced varnishes. But it is of course in retail that the subject is most relevant. For secure in-store testing, the contactless solutions offered by Adhespack, Dapy and Orlandi offer new possibilities. Inspired by ticket vending machines, the Ticket Sent technology from the Brazilian company Adhespack delivers a cardboard box impregnated with perfume and equipped with a QR code to connect with the brand. Simple and flexible, requiring no energy source, it has already been adopted by the Puig Group for a wide range of uses. Orlandi presented Multiscent 2.0, a new solution based on a technology patented by the Brazilian start-up Noar. The innovation lies in the access to a connected diffuser, which can accurately reproduce up to 20 different fragrances on demand, in ""dry smell"", with no airborne particle residue. Dapy's patented automatic tester delivers a dose of perfume directly from the bottle via a spray triggered by motion detection. The tester can be adjusted for all perfumes and bottles between 85 and 130 cm in height. Other significant launches at the show included Pochet's Coiffe Eternelle, a premium perfume cap whose components (weight, insert, overcap, magnets) can be separated for easy recycling. And Aptar's Inune platform. Compatible with the Group's different spray options (Precious, Silk, HDS or classique), the Inune mechanism, crimped or screwable, is invisible, with no metallic contact with the juice and POM free. By enabling sprays to be interchangeable, the platform offers an innovative approach by multiplying the possible variations without creating any additional industrial complexity."
Chanel and Finnish start-up Sulapac develop bio-based perfume caps,"Inspired by Mademoiselle Coco Chanel's favourite places Les Eaux de Chanel was first introduced in 2018. From the beginning, the range was conceived with sustainability in mind. The brand says its glass bottles are thinner and lighter than traditional perfume bottles, which means a smaller volume of raw materials and optimized transport. Furthermore, the corrugated cardboard that is normally hidden was transformed into clean, simple outer packaging whose lack of lamination or glossy coating makes it easier to recycle. Since 2021, all of the 125 ml bottles in Les Eaux de Chanel collection are topped with a cap made from plant-based materials developed in partnership with Sulapac. The cap is composed of three layers, made out of 91% bio-based materials obtained from renewable resources and FSC certified wood chips. The design and aesthetics of the bottle cap were especially important as they had to meet Chanel's rigorous packaging development standards and ""every detail was carefully thought out,"" said Sulapac. This includes the sensory nature of the material, its resistance to fluctuations in temperature, the sound the bottle makes when the cap is put on, the grip, and the depth of the satiny matte finish on the iconic double C engraving. According to Sulapac, the cap is the result of a two-year close collaboration between the two companies and it took no fewer than 48 tries to reach the final product. Chanel was one of the first companies to invest in the Finnish start-up in 2018. ""This first product launch of our collaboration with Chanel, is a remarkable milestone for us. It proves that Sulapac meets the highest quality standards,"" stated Suvi Haimi, CEO and Co-founder of Sulapac."
Stoelzle Glass Group makes the most of glass decoration techniques,"For several years, Stoelzle Glass has been interested in the durability of decorations as much as that of glass packaging. A concern that led in 2018 to the launch of ""Quali Glass Coat 2.0"", a glue-free and solvent-free powder coating. The group's development teams have been working with external experts on new eco-friendly inks. As a result, the group has introduced an environmentally-friendly black printing ink made from end-of-life tyres. Developed from rubber waste, exclusively for Stoelzle, in partnership with a service provider who supplies the carbon powder 100% made from end-of-life tyres, the ink provides a deep black silk-screen effect. According to Stoelzle, the bottles decorated with this ink are unlikely to be distinguished from those decorated with traditional black inks. ""The recycled ink saves carbon and contributes to reduce rubber waste at the same time,"" explains the glassmaker. The recycled ink decor is available in dark black colour as well as in shades of grey and is available in all three decoration sites of the Stoelzle Group, in France, Poland and the UK. Usually, embossing is done directly via the mould during the production of the bottles. Stoelzle has developed a cold end embossing solution, which can be applied to the bottles like a label and remains invisible. ""The secret of this outstanding decoration technique is the perfect cutting of the embossed features,"" says the company. The embossing can be done on flint bottles as well as on already coated ones. There's almost no limitation in terms of colours: gold, silver, multicolour, gradient, whatever suits best. In addition, embossed bottles can still be recycled. As far as screen-printing techniques are concerned, the Stoelzle decoration teams have set themselves the goal to further develop them in order to allow utmost fine, distinctive, detailed, and almost photo-realistic artworks. The screen-printing is still based on classic inks, but on a much higher level of quality and broad choice of colours. This latest edition of the Luxe Pack Monaco trade show also provided an opportunity to review technologies that were presented previously. For instance, the Quali Glass coat 2.0 technique, Stoelzle's special powder coating process, has won the ""coup de coeur"" at the Formes de Luxe Awards for being both ecofriendly and appealing. The innovative, eco-friendly powder coating is completely solvent free and helps save up to 77% of CO2 emissions compared to standard lacquering and was used for decorating the Perfume Gun collection of home fragrances by Parfums Frédéric Malle (The Estée Lauder Compagnies). Applied to amber bottles, commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry, the 40-micron powder coating gives a perfectly smooth surface with a beautiful high-end matt finish. Stoelzle Glass also provides another type of powder-based decoration named Tigital. The new technology allows to achieve photo-realistic artworks whilst saving 85% of C02 emission compared to classic screen printing. According to this technique suits well for very small lots and allows a high level of flexibility."
Silgan debuts sustainability-enhanced Pearl 2 airless system,"The global provider of pumps and sprayers in the beauty, fragrance, personal care, home, and healthcare markets has introduced a new generation airless system called Pearl 2. According to Silgan the new packaging has been designed to deliver all the benefits of standard airless systems, such as formula protection from oxidation, 360-degree dispensing, and a high-evacuation rate to help consumers get out the last drop. In addition, Pearl 2 also offers ""materials designed for recyclability, a robust e-commerce design, and broader technical capabilities."" ""Pearl 2 was designed with our customers' needs in mind. Our focus in developing the product was on three key areas: sustainability, e-commerce, and improved performance,"" said Guillaume de Demandolx, Vice President, Fragrance and Beauty for Silgan Dispensing. To provide a higher level of sustainability to the new airless system, Silgan Dispensing patented a new plastic spring technology that enables the removal of non-recyclable materials and metal, which led to the dispenser being made almost entirely of a single polyolefin. As a result, Pearl 2 has been certified by RecyClass to not have a negative impact on current European-colored containers recycling based on third-party laboratory testing using the Recyclability Evaluation Protocol for HDPE containers [1]. ""Sustainability continues to be a top expectation when it comes to packaging and was our first priority. Finding solutions that do not disrupt today's recycling streams without sacrificing quality and performance is often elusive,"" continued de Demandolx. ""Today's recycling infrastructure has challenges in sorting the small round packages typical in beauty products, so we focused on designing Pearl 2 with the right mix of materials compatible with the recycling stream."" According to Silgan, Pearl 2's robust design and overcap also allowed it to pass third-party e-commerce testing protocols. The pump can withstand changes in air pressure, which means that it won't leak during transport or air travel. ""E-commerce has become an important channel for brands to reach and target consumers, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. If a product breaks or leaks during transport, consumers can develop a negative perception of the brand. Packaging that protects throughout online shipment is critical for a positive brand experience and growth within this fast-growing channel,"" said John Ferro, Vice President of Marketing and Innovation at Silgan Dispensing. In addition, Silgan Dispensing also improved Pearl 2's performance. According to the company, the airless system offers a high compatibility and consistency of performance across a variety of different formulas and viscosity levels. It also offers a longer stroke length to provide maximum dosing control in an ergonomic, one-handed dispenser."
Luxury bottles made from shatterproof glass-like eco-friendly plastic,"When we say ""Heavy Wall style"", it means a material that is extremely durable, with absolutely no compromise on beauty or luxury of the lok and feel. At EPOPACK, all of the PET plastic is done in the Heavy Wall style. It requires special machines and expertise to produce, but the results speak for themselves. The term Heavy Wall refers to the container's surface, which is very sturdy. – it is high-clarity and appears to look like glass – its sturdy construction makes it shatterproof, crack proof, and chemical resistant – it is not heavy in weight — in fact it is lighter than glass and acrylic – it does not require multiple layers, and so it is thinner than glass and acrylic – it is rated International Recycle Code #1 (the most recyclable plastic) Because PET plastic is used so widely in food and beverage containers (like water bottles), some people assume that it may be a flimsy or cheap material. In terms of cosmetic packaging, this could not be further from the truth. When done in the Heavy Wall style, PET containers are strong, striking, and quite luxurious. PET Heavy Wall bottles and jars can be customized and decorated in many ways, including printing, hot stamping, spray or injection coloring. Several of our caps and attachments are also made using PET Heavy Wall for the same robust construction (and of course to have single-material packaging that is more convenient to recycle). Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is rapidly becoming the world's preferred packaging material. It does not contain bisphenol-A (BPA) or phthalates, and is fully recyclable. PET plastic is rated International Recycle Code #1, making it the most eco-friendly plastic on the market. It also has excellent physical and chemical resistance to contain nearly any cosmetic. And we manufacture our PET bottles, jars, and attachments to be ideal for hair care and skin care products PET is a great substitute for glass. It is high-clarity in appearance, but also shatterproof for more secure shipping and handling. It also has a lower Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) than glass. And compare the sustainable and high-end PET plastic to other plastics available: – PET plastic is rated International Recycle Code #1, making it the most eco-friendly plastic on the market. – PP (Polypropylene) has poor transparency and is rated as International Recycle Code #5 – AS (Acrylonitrile Styrene) / SAN (Styrene-Acrylonitrile) is acid sensitive, easier to crack, and is lowly rated as International Recycle Code #7 – Acrylic / PMMA (Poly Methyl Methacrylate) is acid sensitive, overly bulky, and is lowly rated as International Recycle Code #7 – PETG has a higher raw material cost, and is lowly rated as International Recycle Code #7 PET is the clear winner. In order to get the quality and beauty of glass with the security and convenience of plastic, EPOPACK pioneered the development of Heavy Wall PET material. The PET used in our cosmetic bottles and jars is still fully recyclable and completely customizable in terms of colors and decorations. But it is also sturdy and glass-like in feel and appearance. Try the ideal combination of beauty & sustainability in cosmetic packaging. See for yourself the difference when bottles and jars are done in PET Heavy Wall. We'll be happy to send you samples.

Cosmogen relies on mono-materials with two patented innovations,"Cosmogen is making a strong comeback at Luxe Pack Monaco, after the business disruption caused by the pandemic. ""During the lockdowns, we focused on preparing for the post-crisis situation, by injecting available liquidity into innovation,"" explains Priscille Caucé, CEO of the company. The Cosmogen teams were first interested in the emergence of solid cosmetics, in particular for skincare and make-up formulas, which are increasingly developed in solid stick format. These new waterless, economical and nomadic formats appeal to young consumers. After an in-depth study of the market needs for this type of product, Cosmogen launched Stick ReUse: a mono-material (PP), recyclable, watertight & reloadable (56% of plastic saved with each refill) patented stick, the only one to date to combine these four assets, said Cosmogen. The tube can be filled from the top or from the bottom and can therefore be adapted to the different industrial tools of the customers. The Stick ReUse is available with two exclusive removable applicators: a brush for cleansing and complexion and a cold metal applicator for massage. Currently available in 15ml size, the ReUse Stick should soon be available in 30ml size, especially for sun sticks. Cosmogen is also completing its wide range of tubes with removable applicators with a solution dedicated to hair care. The new Detox'n ReUse tube provides an applicator that can be screwed onto a 100 to 150 ml tube and 50 mm in diameter for applications such as shampoos, hair care and treatments, in particular scalp scrubs. Always in search of sustainable solutions, Cosmogen presents rBRUSH, a patented mono-material makeup brush, entirely made of recycled PET, without glue. After having reduced the number of components in its brushes, the French company also sought to increase the proportion of recycled synthetic fibres in the tuft. After several tests, it successfully reached 100%, thus opening the way to a brush entirely made of PET. According to the LCA [1] tool used by Cosmogen to measure the impact of its sustainable innovations, this brush provides a 49% reduction in the impact on global warming."
Quadpack makes shape customisation of airless pumps possible,"Quadpack has created a new range of airless solutions with the aim to help brands to better express their identity through packaging while protecting their formulas. Dubbed ""Canvas Airless"", the new range offers the ability to explore ""never-before-seen"" shapes in airless products. The range is made using a two-phase process based on a patented bag-in-bottle technology with collapsible pouch, an evolution of the bi-injection blow moulding technology acquired by Quadpack in 2019. Developed in conjunction with Inotech, the two-phase process lowers investment and reduces development time compared with bespoke piston airless packs. First, the inner pouch and outer container are bi-injected and joined together into a single, compact preform at Quadpack's airless manufacturing centre in Germany. Then, the preform is blown into the desired shape. With preforms to be stocked in all three of Quadpack's key territories – EMEA, the Americas and Asia Pacific – brands can rely on local supply for late differentiation. ""Canvas Airless provides a blank canvas for creative design,"" said Quadpack Head of Market Development Pierre-Antoine Henry. ""With one mould for infinite shapes, it enables greater freedom of expression. Brands can choose oval, square, convex, concave and other forms – and all without additional outlay or time delay. It sets the new standard in airless packaging, offering accessible added value, along with all the benefits of airless technology."" As a bi-injected, two-layer, pouch-based pack, Canvas Airless uses 15 per cent less plastic than piston airless equivalents and it can be made with a choice of materials. The new range comes with an LLDPE pouch and PET outer bottle as standard, both recyclable materials. Current outer options include rPET and PETG, while inner options include surlyn. Further sustainable materials will be available in future, while a metal-free pump and refill formats are both on the product development roadmap. The Canvas Airless range will be commercially available from January 2022, said Quadpack."
"""Consumers are now taking interest in manufacturing methods"", Roctool","Saving on materials, saving on the finishing stage, quality gains for all resins, including transition resins, avenues leading to new designs, the Roctool Beauty Solutions technology meets the expectations of a market looking for rational manufacturing methods to produce eco-responsible products. By inductively heating and then rapidly cooling the mould of a plastic pack, this technology simplifies the production of thinner-walled premium parts with unparalleled surface qualities, whether glossy, matt or textured, thus bypassing the need for secondary decoration steps. ""Today, there is a lot of questioning about the pack as a whole, about the quantity of material used, but also about the material used and the design. To address all these challenges, pack manufacturers need help. We want to stand out as a solution that is complementary to the know-how of processors in the beauty sector by opening up possibilities in terms of moulding, material saving and surface rendering,"" explains Mathieu Boulanger. ""Either the converter is proactive and equips himself with our technology, as is the case with Texen, with whom we concluded a non-exclusive partnership agreement last year, or it is the brand that proposes the technology directly to its suppliers,"" he continues. ""The use of induction allows controlling the temperature, allowing the material to be more fluid and therefore to perfectly match the surface of the mould. This means we can reduce the part thickness, offer material savings, but also find the right temperature to sublimate the resin, whether it is standard, recycled or biosourced,"" specifies the manager. The Roctool equipment also allows for high value-added surface effects. The company will be giving a conference on this topic [1] at the Luxe Pack Monaco trade show. Also during the event, Roctool will premiere a replication of a velvet effect with no completion stage. ""These new Velvet effects result directly from the surface of the tooling and give a fabric appearance to a plastic part, with no painting or coating steps required,"" details Mathieu Boulanger. The Clinique brand of The Estée Lauder Group chose the Roctool technology to apply it, in collaboration with the packaging developer Pinard, to the bottles of its flagship product, the Clarifying Lotion. The group says it intends to roll out this process to its entire portfolio of brands. ""At The Estée Lauder Companies, we invest and innovate at every stage of our packaging processes to expand sustainable solutions and enable our brands to deliver premium, quality experiences to our consumers,"" explains Daniel Ramos, Senior Vice President, Global Packaging, Estée Lauder Companies. Like other big names in other sectors who have also been won over by the Roctool approach, the cosmetics giant sees an opportunity to develop cutting-edge processes for sustainable prestige packaging. ""Consumers are now taking interest in manufacturing methods, and brands who know this, are relaying this message. We are in line with this approach and the next few years will see the use of the Roctool technology grow in very specific areas of beauty, but always keeping in mind these three key priorities: reducing manufacturing steps, moving to 100% eco-responsible transition resins while offering a higher level of design,"" concludes Mathieu Boulanger."
Chanel and Group Pochet join forces to create a recycled glass bottle for N°5,"When in 1921, Gabrielle Chanel overthrew perfume conventions, choosing for N°5 a laconic bottle, stripped out of all decoration, she also opted for a high quality glass that would enhance the attractiveness of the fragrance's juice. However to keep a pioneering and timeless spirit, even on the occasion of one's 100th anniversary, it might be necessary to reinvent oneself, even imperceptibly! In order to provide N°5 with a bottle featuring a part of recycled glass, while retaining incomparable purity, shine and transparency, close to that of crystal, the teams at Chanel and at Pochet du Courval have combined their expertise to rethink glass production. ""Our goal was to develop a high-end recycled glass that would meet the qualities of excellence and creativity of Chanel,"" explains Pochet in a statement. Creating this bottle proved to be a genuine technological challenge, as the crystalline transparency of glass stems from the purity of the raw material used to produce it. Glass used in perfumery is among the most transparent and high-shine, and recycling can alter its quality. In order to offer the highest quality of recycled glass, Pochet du Courval and its partners developed an innovative industrial process that allowed them to control each step in the value chain. ""Each detail was considered in depth: the colour, the qualities of transparency, purity and shine, as well as the resistance of the glass, were rigorously evaluated,"" added Chanel. Pochet has therefore designed an innovative sorting scheme exclusively dedicated to extra white glass. By guaranteeing the quality of the recycled glass, it was possible to use 15% PCR glass to produce the bottle. The 100ml N°5 Eau de Parfum limited edition is the first fragrance to benefit from this innovation, dubbed SEVA 3 [1], which will gradually be applied to the other Chanel perfumes starting in 2022. According to the two companies, their collaboration resulted in a virtuous achievements in more ways than one, as it encourages a circular economy, reduces the use of natural resources and lowers the carbon footprint, while maintaining the aesthetic of the perfume. ""On average, for 1 million bottles produced using SEVA 3, new-generation recycled glass, we save more than 25 tons of virgin raw material,"" adds Groupe Pochet."
Pennelli Faro introduces a monomaterial brush made from recycled water bottles,"The Italian designer and manufacturer of cosmetic brushes topped off their participation in OnBeauty by Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna with the launch of Ecosofy Solo, a 100% monomaterial brush made from recycled water bottles, free from metal pieces and glues. The entire product — including the handle, the ferrule, and the synthetic fibres of the tuft — is made of plastic granules sourced from post-consumer grinded and recycled water bottles. The brush is therefore easily recyclable and can even be disposed of with no needs for components separation. According to Pennelli Faro, it is ""the most sustainable cosmetic brush on the market."" The company also claims the product is made using 100% renewable energy. ""By 2030 all plastic packaging within the EU will need to be recyclable or reusable. With today's beauty consumer more environmentally conscious than ever, sourcing recyclable, reusable and overall sustainable packaging is no longer a luxury but a necessity for successful cosmetics and personal care brands. Traditionally, beauty applicators comprise a variety of different materials. But, in order to reach the maximum level of recyclability, a tool made from just one material is an increasingly attractive option. Currently, the most sustainable solutions among brushes and cosmetic applicators are made of recyclable materials, that can be recycled separately. In today's increasingly eco-conscious climate, brands and consumers are seeking out packaging that can be more easily recycled. Obtain an aesthetically beautiful and highly performing applicator that responds to the highest level of recyclability was a great challenge, we have grabbed this challenge as always with enthusiasm and we pushed it to its limits,"" commented Sara Zanafredi, CEO of Pennelli Faro."
Pure Trade inaugurates a Creative Lab in Paris and accelerates its international development,"Like many great entrepreneurial successes, Pure Trade first demonstrated an uncanny ability to rethink its business model when necessary. Created in 1996 to offer customers high-quality promotional items in a variety of sectors - from cosmetics to food and fashion - Pure Trade refocused on beauty in the mid-2000s. This market at the time represented 45% of its turnover. ""We quickly gained multi-material and multi-sector experience, but we were in danger of spreading ourselves too thinly,"" explains Stefane Ladous, the company's CEO. The decision quickly proved to be a wise one. ""It allowed us to reduce the number of suppliers, to gain agility and to make our sales teams more focused, and above all to extend our know-how to secondary and even primary packaging,"" continues the manager. Once the financial crisis of 2008 was overcome, the company embarked on a particularly sustained growth trajectory and supplied the most important groups in the sector, including L'Oréal, LVMH, Clarins, Coty, Puig, Interparfums, Shiseido, etc. Today, Pure Trade caters to over 50 premium beauty brands. The promotional products and packaging businesses account for more than 80% of total sales ($75 million in 2019), with sales equally distributed between the two businesses. The company produces, among other things, party boxes, make-up palettes, advent calendars, travel retail kits, kits, and various gifts with purchase. The remaining 15-20% of the business comes from accessories (brushes) and textiles. ""Our clients are predominantly premium and luxury brands, with stringent requirements in terms of quality, deadline compliance and specifications. The production must be 100% in keeping with the mock-ups and final proofs,"" explains Virginie Honoré, General Manager. In addition to respecting quality standards, Pure Trade offers a complete bespoke design service (creativity, design, development, manufacturing, management...), particularly thanks to its Design Studio, which has existed since the company's early days. ""With our industrial partners, we can offer many services, in different qualities, including very high levels of expertise. We are often entrusted with global campaigns (packs, luggage, accessories, etc.). Sometimes the client asks us to liaise with their pack supplier, and sometimes we even do the assembling using the products purchased by the client,"" Virginie Honoré continues. To reinforce its capabilities and save time in the creative process, Pure Trade recently equipped its Parisian headquarters with an additional 100 m2 for the creation of a creative space that is fully operational on September 2021, with a material library, a sample library, and the collection of different projects developed by the company. This new Creative Lab allows people to see, touch, test and experiment with materials and projects. ""It will allow us to save a great deal of time on developments, but also to strengthen the human relationship with our clients after this period of isolation. These are all key success factors for a company that works exclusively on made-to-measure products,"" emphasises Virginie Honoré. While a significant part of the network of partners is located in Asia (China, India), Pure Trade is increasingly developing its sourcing in Europe (Portugal, Spain, Eastern Europe), to meet the requirements of its regional customers in terms of lead times, volumes and CSR. ""But cost and know-how constraints can limit the choices. And besides, our suppliers in Asia have developed a great mastery of eco-designed materials,"" Stefane Ladous points out. The concern for sustainability has become paramount for both packaging and promotional items. From the design phase onwards, Pure Trade, which is positioned in the 1% of companies assessed by Ecovadis Platinum, proposes solutions to reduce the environmental impact, in particular, the use of alternative materials is being considered. ""The use of recycled materials is a booming trend and all the players are making real CSR choices, even if this sometimes means higher prices,"" continues Stefane Ladous. Based on the Champs-Élysées in Paris, Pure Trade employs around 65 people and has sales subsidiaries in Barcelona and London, offices in New York and Hong Kong for customers in the Asia-Pacific region and a team in Shenzhen in charge of supervising the sourcing (production and quality monitoring) and customers in mainland China. Little impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, with sales down by around 5% in 2020, the company expects to return to the 2019 level as of the 2021 financial year. In the context of a strong rebound in demand, particularly in Asia and North America, Pure Trade intends to continue its specialisation in the beauty sector to strengthen its know-how and product offering, while accelerating its international development, particularly in China, with the opening of a new office in Shanghai headed by Mona Lee, Managing Director of the Group in Asia. The Group will also strengthen its presence in the United States. ""We are in contact with suppliers in Mexico to offer a local import service in North America,"" says Stefane Ladous."
Édition Spéciale by Luxe Pack: The quest for sustainable luxury packaging,"As consumers demand right-sized, recyclable or recycled packaging that minimizes waste while protecting products and preserving their functionality, manufacturers are thriving to reinvent their products. In the luxury sector, the step challenge can seem gigantic as it is to reconcile the opposite. In the luxury sector, where it is much about reconciling opposite goals, the step may seem really high. However, exhibitors at the latest Édition Spéciale by Luxe Pack have demonstrated their inventiveness with a multitude of preview innovations. To reduce the use of plastic while moving up market, Verescence showcased refillable skincare jars with an inner cup made of glass. For increased sustainability, the patented solution can be produced in lightweight and / or partially recycled glass. In addition, the inner glass cup, such as the outer jar, are fully customizable. The French glassmaker has also revised its Infini glass portfolio and will now offer two options: Infini 20 (made with 20% recycled glass) and Infini 40 (made with 40% recycled glass). The goal is to appeal to brands that want to take the path of sustainability without accepting the aesthetic alteration linked to a high content of recycled material. On the contrary, Estal showcased bottles made from 100% post-consumer recycled (PCR) glass. The Spanish supplier intends to target brands that prioritize durability over aesthetics. ""During quality controls, we discard all products with functional defects, but we accept all aesthetic flaws in order to minimize the environmental impact of production,"" emphasizes Jan Garcia, Commercial Director. Bormioli Luigi has also developed their own refillable jar with a removable glass cup. Dubbed ""The Rechargeable"", this solution has a notched hanging system and the company is evaluating the opportunity to add it to its catalogue of standard models. The Italian glassmaker also launched a refillable lipstick system with a luxurious glass tube, as well as Skinlock, a screwless glass jar and cap that can be airtight closed thanks to a gasket. Also for a more premium appearance and to reduce the use of plastic, Baralan presented its first glass airless. The piston solution puts the product in direct contact with the glass, and is available in two versions (classic or refill). When it comes to the durability of glass, Heinz Glas places great emphasis on the manufacturing process. ""Currently, the big concern with glass is greenhouse gas emissions linked to gas ovens,"" explains Yolande Guillemot, sales manager. ""We are far ahead on this subject as we have had an electric oven since 1972 and we have only purchased green electricity since 2016."" Of course, Heinz Glas also offers lightweight and recycled glass through its Multigen solution, which allows taking into account various parameters of durability. Édition Spéciale by Luxe Pack has given special attention to start-ups offering alternative or recycled materials such as: Green Gen Technologies; which combines plant fibres with bio-based resins; Authentic Material which designs materials from natural sources (horn, shell, wood, leather, etc.); Carbiolice which develops plastic solutions of plant origin, biodegradable, compostable and environmentally friendly; Greenfib which designs a 100% biobased material, made from a castor oil derivative with added vegetable flour and mineral powders ... However well-known materials, such as aluminium, can also prove very interesting thanks to their almost infinite recyclability. Tubex thus developed aerosol cans made of up to 60% PCR aluminium and decorated with water-based varnishes and natural inks. Also working on aluminium, G. Pivaudran is continuing to test the production of high-end components with up to 15% PCR material. ""For matt parts, we are starting to get very good aesthetic results"", said Hervé Delaigue, Sales and Development Director. The company is currently finalizing the design of a weighted cap made of 100% aluminium partly recycled. When possible, plastics specialists seek to tap into the circular economy, with recycled materials and single-material solutions. Élidose, for instance, showcased its 100% polypropylene refill sachets, as well as new 100% PE solutions with a PE cap. Italy's Eurovetrocap has relied on its Zero In ·Pack entity to develop two mini collections playing on these two aspects of plastic circularity: #mono and #recycled. In particular, the company has designed a single-material PP dropper. Finally, Eurovetrocap has also invested in a triple extrusion machine allowing to combine recycled PE for the core and virgin PE for the internal and external walls. So many innovation avenues that should be further developed at OnBeauty by Cosmoprof Worldwide, from September 9 to 13, 2021, in Bologna, and Luxe Pack Monaco from September 27 to 29."
Quadpack seeks expansion in Asia thanks to partnership with Korea's LM,"The Barcelona-headquartered beauty packaging specialist has chosen the Seoul-based company LM as a partner to help it consolidate its presence in the Asian market. A well-established packaging manufacturer, with a strong presence in the derma skincare Korean market, LM will be responsible for the production, assembly and decoration of components from Quadpack's QLine portfolio, which gathers the company's exclusive ranges of packaging solutions. Along with the agreement with Yuga in China announced in February, Quadpack has chosen to establish partnerships based on a new, regional operating model that bets on local productions in order to improve service to customers while increasing the company's market share and strengthening the Quadpack brand. ""The big Asian packaging markets are measured in billion euros, with Korea alone worth EUR 1.1 billion. To conquer this region and to fulfil the objectives of our 2020-2025 business strategy, we turn to our trusted partners. With common values, complementary strengths and established reputations, these key industry colleagues will extend our reach and enrich our service, as we deliver solutions in the region, for the region,"" said Raj Savji, Quadpack Managing Director - Asia Pacific. ""Collaboration is in our DNA,"" added Quadpack CEO Tim Eaves. ""Quadpack itself started as a partnership of three companies in 2003: Belcos Packaging, Lenglart Packaging and Gadbrooke Packaging, each of which worked with partners worldwide. In fact, LM CEO Michael Lim is one of my oldest contacts from Belcos, going back nearly two decades. I am delighted to renew our friendship and welcome our new partner to the Quadpack family."" Quadpack aims to rely on these partners to further develop its QLine portfolio with solutions specifically designed for local markets through co-creation and collaborative innovation. In Addition to Yuga, near Shanghai, and LM in Seoul, Quadpack's presence in the Asia-Pacific region also includes an office in Tokyo, Japan, inaugurated one year ago. With a growing team, it is building relationships and fostering partnerships in this key Asian market. Longest-established in the region is the Melbourne office, which services Australia and New Zealand directly, with plans for stocking and local manufacture for faster time to market and a lower carbon footprint. Quadpack plans to replicate this operating business model based on partnerships for other regions."
European justice protects the original shape of a Guerlain lipstick,"The court observed that the shape of the lipstick, which is reminiscent of that of ""a boat hull"" or a ""baby carriage"" differs significantly from the norm and customs of the lipstick sector. It also deemed that the ""small oval embossed shape is unusual and contributes to the uncommon appearance"" of the Guerlain's lipstick. Furthermore, the fact that the lipstick cannot be placed upright ""reinforces the uncommon visual aspect of its shape."" Guerlain has made an appeal in September 2020 against the dismissal of EUIPO to protect the three-dimensional shape of its Rouge G lipstick. That decision was upheld by the Board of Appeal that found that the mark did not depart sufficiently from the norms and customs of the sector. The General Court of the European Union ruled in favour of the Guerlain brand. According to the Court, ""the public will be surprised by this easily memorable shape and will perceive it as departing significantly from the norm and customs of the lipstick sector."""
Luxe Pack Monaco is back. What will it look like?,"In this different year, what have you heard from customers? Fabienne Germond - We have been very attentive to our exhibitors (as well as to the luxury brands that come to the show) and heard that there was obviously a strong desire to meet up and share experiences of these extraordinary months. Nothing can replace physical meetings. First, because digital technology cannot replace the pleasure of seeing products in real life, of touching new materials, of feeling new formulae… Second, because professionals need to meet themselves face-to-face in order to share, build, make contacts, and implement projects meeting the requirements of the Luxury market. 18 months without a show… and we will be the first in September! There is an irresistible desire to come back to Monaco, to see product innovations and network in a pleasant environment, far from the interiors in which we have spent a lot of time this year! Everything that makes the difference and the charm of Luxe Pack Monaco. What can you tell us about the companies that have registered so far? Fabienne Germond - There are over 450 exhibitors to date, including the usual suspects of Luxe Pack, of course, and 69 new exhibitors with various profiles including designers, manufacturers of wooden packs and experts in decoration finishing, 3D printing, leather pack, primary pack, and RFID solutions: SICPA, TRACETOO, ATT, OBERIEON, and ELUCEDA. Luxe Pack Monaco's undisputed asset is that it presents international in luxury packaging leaders alongside small businesses mastering very specific expertise. The enthusiasm of exhibitors is very positive, and it proves that supply and demand need to meet. What safety measures are you going to implement? Fabienne Germond - Luxe Pack Monaco is committed to applying the strictest recommendations of the French and Monaco authorities and is working closely with the Grimaldi Forum to ensure the health safety of participants. We have already taken concrete steps to ensure a completely safe visiting experience. These include, among others: temperature checks at the show entrance, compulsory wearing of masks, hand sanitizing dispensers at hall entrances, admission conditions (Sanitary Pass, negative test, etc.). All these measures may be supplemented, if necessary, according to government instructions. What were the lessons learned from the hybrid edition last November with the My Luxe Pack digital platform? Fabienne Germond - Nothing can replace physical events, but we have learned that digital technology can play a very interesting role for our community as it frees us from time and geographic limits and, therefore, allows us to bring together supply and demand all year round, all over the world. Our My Luxe Pack platform is positioned as an online extension to our physical shows. It offers participants the opportunity to prepare for their visit, to discover the full list of our exhibitors and their latest innovations, and to select the conferences they want to attend. For those who cannot travel, it also allows them to stay in touch with the current highlight through the distribution of content (webinars, conferences, etc.) and being able to contact suppliers at any time. This platform will be available all year round, at the rate of our five trade shows, and it allows the Luxe Pack community to stay connected and in constant contact with the latest trends. We finally have a place that reflects the variety of the Luxe Pack brand, present on three continents. What is on the programme this year? Fabienne Germond - It is a dense programme with marketing topics around the notion of luxury in terms of positioning and evolution as well as conferences and technical workshops on issues and the acceleration of trends that take stock of what is at play in the industry. Three major business issues facing brands will be highlighted at Luxe Pack Monaco 2021: – Green. For twelve years, we have organised Luxe Pack in Green, which has become the benchmark event showcasing the best responsible solutions and initiatives of our exhibitors. Exhibition space, dedicated conferences, and awards ceremony are all tools that will be at your disposal to gain access to a real gauge of international green trends. Every day, dedicated conferences will be hosted by committed international stakeholders, such as BSR, Bain & Company, Positive Luxury, Moet Hennessy, and Chanel, among others. – China. The pandemic precipitated the luxury market's transformation in China. In this thriving new ecosystem, Gen Z is driving trends. In 2025, 50% of luxury purchases worldwide will be made by Chinese consumers: a market as essential as it is atypical for international brands. At Luxe Pack Monaco, we will offer a sensory and personalised experience that will give the keys to China: free individual consulting, expert round tables, and exhibition of specific products, in partnership with the brand intelligence agency Centdegrés. – New materials. Brand demand for eco-designed materials is accelerating. They are looking for solutions that go beyond the basic recycled version of conventional materials, be it glass, paper, or cardboard. This year, at Luxe Pack Monaco, visitors will discover innovative materials resulting from French public research serving packaging and luxury.

Coty to roll-out touch-less fragrance tester to retailers globally,"Coty will roll-out a digitally-enabled touch-less fragrance testing device intended for use at beauty retailers within the next 12 months. Real world testing of the units at brick & mortar retail stores begins this month in key European markets, followed by a planned trial in Asia later this year. According to Coty, this digital innovation offers customers a touch-less and a less invasive testing experience. While spray testers oversaturate the air, overwhelming the senses and surrounding environment, this device delivers a single droplet of liquid directly to an arm or a blotter. As stores are re-opening around the world, hygiene and safety have become an integral part of the experience at brick & mortar retailers. According to Coty, the creation of a new touch-less luxury ritual for testing will support those consumers that need to try perfume before buying, and ultimately will drive sales at stores. The device also collects data to allow Coty, in partnership with retailers, to optimize the placement of the testers and the customer experience by ensuring beauty advisors are on the spot when needed. To bring this touch-less fragrance tester to life, Coty has partnered with Êverie, a French start-up specializing in smart devices, micro-dosing and diffusion technologies, A multidisciplinary group from Coty have worked alongside Êverie over the past year to develop a connected easy-to-maintain and sustainable device. According to the company, this touch-less fragrance tester is able to work for weeks without a battery recharge and reduces perfume loss compared to traditional testers. It will be compatible with all Coty's fragrance testers and can be personalized to each of Coty's brands. ""With the return of in-person shopping, the health and safety of our consumers are always at the forefront of our minds. Deploying a single drop of liquid to the skin with the same restitution as traditional testers, this new technology eliminates unnecessary waste and offers a safe, contact-free alternative for testing,"" said Claire Catherine-Mercier, Vice President Retail Experience at Coty."
France's luxury packaging maker Groupe Pochet appoints new CEO,"So far, Xavier Gagey was in charge for the Group's Glass Division. He is taking over from Tristan Farabet, who is heading towards personal projects after having dedicated himself since 2014 to the modernisation of the Group's organization and its competitiveness. A graduate of the French National Electricity University (SUPELEC) and with an MBA from EDHEC, Xavier joined the Pochet group and its Executive Committee in 2018, as General Manager of the Glass Division, backed by a long and rich experience within the Arcelor-Mittal/APERAM Group, both in France and internationally. ""Strengthened by the fundamental progress made, along with the Group's positioning on new 4.0 technologies, a stronger team of talented people, an enhanced value proposition, particularly in terms of CSR, and a well oriented performance, the Group can now open a new chapter in its history,"" said the company in a statement. Irène Gosset, Chairman and shareholder of the Groupe Pochet has warmly thanked Tristan Farabet ""for his decisive action in the service of the Group over the past seven years and for the significant progress made. This positive momentum now enables us to look to the future with confidence and to open a new page in the Group's history."" The Groupe Pochet is a family-owned industrial company founded in 1623 that today is present on three continents with over 4,000 employees. The Group produces high-end packaging for the perfume, skincare, and make-up markets."
A failed recycling attempt transformed this family-run packaging business,"Back in 2004, Taiwanese manufacturer Patrick Pan made a small but meaningful discovery that would completely change the course of his family business. Patrick's factory produced acrylic cosmetic bottles at the time. Like many others, he was becoming more concerned about the environment. He wanted to see and understand the complete life cycle of his products. So he decided to volunteer at a local recycling station. One day, during his volunteer work, he immediately recognized a collection of bottles as coming from his factory. He asked the staff about the bottles, eager to learn more about their reuse and recycling. However, he was told that, since the material was rated a recycle code #7, the bottles would be very difficult to process. They would likely end up as pure waste. This shook him up. As a family operation, he was bringing his children into the business and planned on having them continue it for a long time into the future. But a legacy of waste is not what he wanted to pass on to his kids, or to inflict on their planet. He immediately went back to his team, and set them to work on transforming the business. There would be two essential points of focus moving forward: 1. They must switch to plastic material with an international recycle code 1, meaning the most sustainable material. 2. The bottles and jars produced from this plastic must still look and feel beautiful, so that luxury brands and consumers would be proud to use them. And from there, his company EPOPACK began to pioneer the ""Heavy Wall"" style of PET plastic packaging. EPOPACK's PET Heavy Wall containers are an innovative solution for luxury skincare and haircare brands looking for the charm of glass containers with none of the downsides, while being completely recyclable. The word ""heavy"" refers to their sturdy construction, rather than weight. In fact, PET Heavy Wall bottles and jars are lighter than their glass counterparts. However, they command a presence on the shelf. And they feel luxurious in your hands. It's an eco-friendly packaging that does not require a compromise on style. While at the same time making life easier for e-commerce and shippers by essentially eliminating breakages. Patrick's PET Heavy Wall containers came on to the market in 2005.

Samplicity wants to accelerate the development of intelligent e-sampling,"In the beauty industry, sample testing is the first purchase trigger. But far from being only an effective way to discover a product and recruit new customers: it is also an extraordinary information vector. For Valerie Jacob, founder of Samplicity, while recruitment is the key motivation for an online sampling campaign, return on investment and overall effectiveness can be maximised by accurately targeting distribution, by analysing the opinions of consumers on the product tested via the sample, and by offering targeted operations to member-consumers identified as having an affinity with the brand. "" Samplicity has disrupted this key acquisition lever for brands with cutting-edge technologies, deep learning, a real-time automated activation tool and proprietary smart data to make e-sampling particularly intelligent and powerful, from acquisition to retention,"" she told Premium Beauty News. In practice, the platform provides access to a qualified community, interested in beauty, eager to discover and buy differently. Campaigns can be pre-targeted and are all geo-located. Consumer feedback is collected, analysed by Samplicity and then shared with brands, after consent. The results are often instructive. This is how Samplicity was able to prioritise the main purchase criteria in a campaign on a foundation product. For French consumers, ease of application and the absence of demarcation thus largely prevail over the search for the right shade, even if the latter remains essential to the finalization of the purchase. ""From the outset, the platform was designed to activate effective marketing operations,"" Valérie Jacob emphasised. ""With our few decades of experience in the beauty industry, we have identified the type of data that brands need, the sources, the aggregations and the processing required, hence the name Smart Data. We can provide our clients with analyses and leads enriched with attributes of extremely fine granularity, including emotional motivations."" The aim is to provide brands with a genuine KYCB (Know Your Customer Better) tool, with a real-time updating of their data. Samplicity's architecture is perfectly suited to the new challenges of online engagement. This is evidenced by impressive consumer feedback rates: between 60 and 70% per campaign, with an average of 67%. Building a relationship of trust with users obviously involves absolute compliance with the RGPD regulation, but also a reasonable level of solicitation. ""The demand for samples is such that we have no recruitment problem. On the other hand, if our members remain highly engaged it is because we offer them samples that are tailored to their needs and we only interact with them when necessary, mainly via their personal space. We are not intrusive and we never give out their data without their explicit prior consent,"" insists the founder. And the strong commitment of participants is a major asset in a rapidly changing market. On the one hand, with the end of third-party cookies, the implementation of Apple's App Tracking Transparency policy and the limits of programmatic advertising (which 54% of consumers find intrusive), the media ecosystem is in upheaval. ""Not to mention the questionable relevance of look-alike criteria for perfumes and skincare products,"" pointed out Valérie Jacob. On the other hand, there is a demand for a more rational consumption in reaction to the criticised over-consumption, the ease of discovery and purchase, the desire to communicate differently with brands to put an end to the digital and energy pollution generated by it. Samplicity monitors every step of every operation to deliver reliable metrics that are not dependent on cookies or Google Analytics. The platform was built to be a flexible and scalable data collection and processing tool, with the possibility of creating tailor-made mechanisms depending on the brand, its product and its objectives. Valérie Jacob believes that brand e-sampling campaigns are too often limited to actions on social networks. The method is certainly quite effective in generating massive distribution, but much less effective in engaging customers and getting to know them better, measuring and optimising marketing activations. For more complete results, Samplicity can plug its mechanisms into any digital or social media campaign to accompany the mobile user all the way to purchase. The next step for Samplicity is to expand into the Americas and Asia, adapting its model to local expectations and data protection laws. Backed by its agile and robust technology, the company has already started to look for international partners, its current strategic priority."
Dow brings SURLYN™ on a circular and sustainable journey,"In a webinar hosted by Premium Beauty News, Dow - the producer of SURLYN™ - outlined the steps in a new sustainable journey for this polymer, which is highly regarded for its aesthetic qualities. Thierry de Baschmakoff, Luxury designer, Artistic Director, Brand Maker and Founder of the Luxury design agency De Baschmakoff, first recalled SURLYN™ is a very interesting material for designing perfume and cosmetic packaging well beyond the search for transparency. ""This material, which was known for one specific application, can now be seen from new angles,"" he said. For its part, Mark Langenhof, Business Development & Application Engineer within the Morssinkhof-Rymoplast group, one of the biggest Plastics Recyclers in Europe, points out that to date a lot of progress remains to be made in terms of plastic circularity. ""14% of plastic packaging is collected these days, and only 2% is recycled back into its original application,"" he said. Parts used in cosmetics are often small in size and can pass through screens at municipal recycling centres. This is why Morssinkhof-Rymoplast recommends the implementation of a deposit return schemes for multi-material packaging. ""SURLYN™ is a material that has brought freedom to designers of the beauty world for many years"", confirmed Shouhaib Mohamed, EMEA Marketing Manager for Cosmetic at Dow. ""In contrast, few people know that this material is compatible with HDPE recycling streams,"" he added. That's why Dow worked with COTREP [1] to confirm this key issue. Recycling solutions exist and SURLYN™ packaging parts, whether transparent or tinted, are already parly recycled. At Luxe Pack 2019, for instance, Dow had demonstrated, in partnership with the Italian company Premi, the possibility of creating elegant perfume caps using 40% of SURLYN™ recycled resin. ""Several retailers have already set up collection systems for cosmetic packaging,"" said Natacha Bitinis, EMEA Application Technology Leader for Cosmetic and Rigid Packaging at Dow. Thanks to this, mechanical recycling programmes dedicated to the SURLYN™ are studied, for which ""the cooperation of all stakeholders will be necessary"". Of course, volumes will be reduced at the beginning, and there will also be quality limitations that are inherent to the use of post-consumer recycled materials. That's why Dow is already thinking about the next step. ""In the short term, if we want to achieve scalable volumes and the same quality as virgin resin, then we also need to work on another solution, called advanced recycling,"" explained Shouhaib Mohamed. This technology complementary to mechanical recycling allows to break down mixed waste plastics into their original form to manufacture new virgin like quality polymers. With this in mind, Dow has signed a partnership agreement with the company Fuenix Ecogy, in the Netherlands. ""These technologies are well developed but requires a certain level of investment,"" he added. As advanced recycling allows to achieve identical performance to virgin materials, we are evaluating this option for many of our materials including SURLYN™."
iD Scent creates eco-friendly and long-lasting perfume sampling solutions,"The fragrance discovery specialist is innovating with two eco-responsible and versatile solutions for high-end perfume sampling. Scentdow and Scentpad offer the possibility to create an ever more sensual and sustainable customer experience and to open up new communication possibilities for consumers. brands. In the wake of the launch of Scentouch in 2019, both solutions have been designed for brands that want to combine fragrance discovery and eco-responsibility. Entirely made of certified paper (therefore recyclable), both solutions offer wide creative possibilities, thanks to their large printing surfaces, which also allow the possibility of carrying out all the finishing touches usually made on packaging (hot stamping, embossing, special cutting, etc.). The Scentdow sample looks like a card with a window to open. Once opened, thanks to a pre-cut tab, this window reveals the fragrance impregnated on the paper underneath. ""It opens like an advent calendar or an animated children's books. It is a source of surprise and pleasure...,"" said Maxime Caffon, CEO of iD Scent. In addition, the Scentdow scent card is designed to last over time with the fragrance lasting over several months. The card can also be optimized to simultaneously present two fragrances on its different faces: women's and men's, classic and special edition ... Highly focused on sensuality, Scentpad is inspired by make-up application gestures, and more specifically cushion compacts. The ""pad,"" or perfumed cushion, is placed inside a printed leaflet. It can be detached and used as an applicator to deposit the fragrance on the skin. Entirely made of paper, the ""pad"" is therefore renewable and fully recyclable. It allows for around 100 fragrance applications. ""In line with iD Scent's eco-responsible commitments, as well as those of perfume houses that support eco-designed and recyclable solutions, Scentpad gives a green boost to sampling solutions,"" added Maxime Caffon. Housed in a four-sided booklet, Scentpad offers a large space for the brand's messaging. Once removed from its location (where it can be repositioned), the pad reveals a QR code, that is therefore visible only upon its removal, as not to disrupt the overall aesthetic of the item. Brands are free to let their strategy and imagination speak to exploit the full potential of this feature. For these launches, iDScent renewed its collaboration with fragrance house Takasago, which had already developed the olfactory signature of Scentouch."
Eastman unveils recyclable resins for thick-walled cosmetics packaging,"Eastman's new Cristal One resins offer various solutions for cosmetic brands seeking both a beginning-of-life and end-of-life solution for thick-walled luxury packaging. The Cristal One range meets the California/ASTM guidelines for RIC1 designation [1] and has achieved APR Critical Guidance recognition for recyclability. Additional recognitions are under review and will be coming soon. According to Eastman, these innovative products are the first RIC1 materials that enable production of transparent jars up to 12 mm in thickness. Indeed, the Cristal One portfolio includes Cristal One, Cristal One Pro (tailor made to mould the thickest-walled parts), and Cristal EN (for thinner-walled packaging) and the corresponding Renew materials (i.e. options with 30% to 50% certified recycled content), giving brands options for addressing a large variety of application needs for skin care and colour cosmetic packaging with wall thicknesses up to 12 mm. Leveraging on these innovations, Aptar Beauty + Home's subsidiary FusionPKG is introducing a new jar using Cristal One as well as several new packaging solutions based on other sustainable resins from Eastman's Cristal Renew portfolio with high levels of certified recycled content [2]. FusionPKG also plans to work with brands to develop custom packaging using the full range of Cristal Renew with certified recycled content and Cristal One. ""With Cristal One recyclable resins and the broad portfolio of Eastman Renew materials, FusionPKG now can offer a more sustainable solution without compromise across our extensive portfolio,"" said Daniel Campbell, senior sustainability and packaging engineer, FusionPKG. ""What really stands out with these resins is how they allow us to create the crystal clear, high-end packaging we are known for, while still supporting key sustainability initiatives from our brands."" ""With the Cristal One portfolio, we are able to bring together the best of both worlds - recycled and recyclable - and still provide the superior performance that brands and innovative design houses like FusionPKG demand for their packaging today,"" emphasized Tara Cary, market development manager for Eastman cosmetics and personal care."

GEKA is bringing innovation to MakeUp in Shanghai,"With a well-established history in packaging solutions for cosmetics and with over 600 patents and 4000 brush designs to its name, GEKA is a true trendsetter that delivers innovative solutions to wide spectrum of customers in the beauty industry. ""When it comes to applying skincare products, the main challenges that end-users face are hygiene, wastage and product longevity,"" says Alexandre Daniellot, Global Sales Director at GEKA. ""We analyzed these three issues and developed a solution that combats them all. The fusionAPPLICATOR is hygienic and precise, designed to deliver products that stay fresher for longer."" Applying skincare solutions with cotton buds or flocked applicators massively reduces product sterility as the fibres can adhere to skin during application. Finger application also carries a high risk of introducing pathogens to the skin. In addition to this, both methods compromise dosage accuracy and cause product waste. The fusionAPPLICATOR features 50 micro-bristles made from pharma-grade material. These have a base diameter of 0.35 mm and tip diameter of 0.08 mm, enabling the smooth application of skincare products. Located in the middle of the device is a reservoir zone with no bristles to pick up the liquid or semi-solid formulas. Combined, these design characteristics deliver maximum precision, both in formula dosage and application. GEKA's design of the micro-bristles incorporates adjusted rigidity and specific geometry to ensure they are resilient and kind to the skin. The bristles have been developed to minimize spread, allowing them to reach hard-to-access areas while preventing any pick-up of contamination from the skin. The reservoir zone also means a higher dose of product can be administered per use, further reducing skin contact and maximizing hygiene. ""We're excited that our fusionAPPLICATOR has been recognized by the MakeUp in experts as a leading innovative skincare packaging solution,"" adds Alexandre Daniellot. ""This is a real honor, and we can't wait to meet everyone at MakeUp in Shanghai to show them the latest additions to our product range!"" MakeUp in is a series of international industry events, bringing global beauty brands across all segments together. This year, GEKA will be at MakeUp in Shanghai to make a mark, showcasing its advanced applicator designs. Find out more about the company's fusionAPPLICATOR at the event's innovation kiosk located near the entrance of the venue and meet GEKA experts at Booth G33Bis to discuss your specific requirements."
Augros automates the whole decoration process to boost competitiveness,"2020 was not the easiest ever for the French manufacturer! Particularly impacted by the decline in the luxury market, the company saw its turnover drop from EUR 17 million in 2019 to EUR 15 million in 2020. And the recovery proved to be slower than initially anticipated. According to Augros CEO, Didier Bourgine, the real economic rebound will take place during the second half of this year, in particular with the gradual restart of travel retail sales, which represent nearly 30% of the income of some luxury players. ""We were able to use this low level of activity to work on R&D and the injection of new resins that are more virtuous in terms of CSR, we also used this slowdown to accelerate our investments in our MSV surface treatment unit,"" explains Didier Bourgine. The company, which employs around 150 people and operates two production sites in France, can complete all the production steps of a high-end packaging, including decoration and surface treatment thanks to the acquisition of the French company MSV in 1998. This latter steps are now the focus of Augros Group's attention. ""We launched the duplication of the coating capacity with the implementation of a new state-of-the-art automated line, which is also more respectful of the environment. It will be in operation at the end of 2021,"" says the manager. Augros has long relied on the automation of its processes. Since the 1990's, the company has thus invested in the robotization and automation of its assembly and decoration lines in order to be able to offer its customers competitive prices together with top-of-the-range quality powered by reliable and repeatable processes free from human intervention. ""It was bold and differentiating at the time, and most importantly, it allowed us to survive the wave of offshoring by being more competitive,"" continues Didier Bourgine. If robots are a key element in the intensification of the company's productivity, Augros does not neglect human expertise and know-how! Valérie Guittet was thus promoted to the role of Quality Director of the Augros Group. She will be responsible for the Quality Organization at both Augros sites. In addition, as part of the strategy to produce more complex décor at the MSV surface treatment site, Augros has strengthened their expertise with the appointment of Philippe Avanzini, a recognized expert in the decoration of aesthetic parts in the automotive industry as Technical Director of their decoration division. ""Today, in the plastics industry as in the glass industry, decoration is becoming an essential and inexpensive means of differentiation,"" emphasizes Didier Bourgine. ""Flankerization will intensify as it was the case with the glassmakers a few years ago."" For the CEO of Augros ther is no doubt that ""combining competitiveness, proximity and speed,"" allows the company to regain market share against China, now ""more expensive"", too far away from Europe's luxury brands. Beyond quality and competitiveness, the main challenges for the next 10 years will be to develop packaging solutions that meet today's environmental challenges. According to Didier Bourgine, ""90% of the plastic used in Europe will be recycled."" For 2025, the Augros group has committed to the objective of ensuring that more than 50% of their packaging production will comply with the 3R (recycled, recyclable, re-sourced). In addition to offering recyclable materials to consumers, Augros is therefore seeking to generalize the use of recycled and decorative resins made with ""High Solid"" varnishes, which ensure a reduction of more than 80% of VOC emissions. While meeting the growing demand for ""re-sourced"" or ""refillable"" packaging offering. With a longer life cycle, the new solutions will have to be more aesthetic and of higher quality to induce and allow reuse and / or refill. ""Our real strength will be to work on complex materials - through their recycling circuit - while ensuring an aesthetic that meets the increased demands of consumers who are increasingly 'Green' and more and more demanding because they are educated in the luxury codes of this type of products. This is why, in the same way as we did for the automation in our plastics factory in France (Alençon), we are now intensifying our efforts in the 'systemisation' of varnish formulations and other surface treatment techniques capable of ensuring perfect aesthetics on any type of support, in particular recycled ones while being eco-responsible,"" concludes Didier Bourgine, convinced that the luxury experience is bound to become ""responsible""."
"Airtight lipstick A-TX2 by Lumson: safe, versatile, long-lasting","And for a lipstick like this, a cornerstone of all self-respecting makeup lines, packaging is needed that is both worthy and able to enhance the formula. It's not an easy task seeing as longwear lipsticks, the most requested on the market, are formulated with particular volatile raw materials which allow for longer-lasting color. Today, consumers demand products with lasting color that doesn't transfer and that are also resistant to the constant rubbing action of face masks. To make this happen, cosmetic laboratories have developed new generation formulas with the right mix of volatile substances enriched with innovative polymers, low or high melting point waxes, with the addition of active ingredients that contribute to reducing any damage, which might be caused by the long-term use of masks. Throughout this evolution, packaging plays an essential role because, besides being aesthetically pleasing to look at and practical to use, it has to live up to the important task of maintaining the integrity of characteristics of the product it contains. A task for cosmetic companies that becomes a true technological challenge of combining design, functionality, and safety. Lumson, a pioneer in the development of packaging in tune with new consumer habits and changing marketing needs, backed by its expertise in the world of lipsticks, has chosen to take on this challenge and to launch an air tight lipstick on the market: A-TX2. A-TX2, destined to become a best-seller, was developed to preserve formulas requiring packaging that is long-lasting. The A-TX2's characteristics are that of a sophisticated, yet versatile product: cap and base in ABS, cup available in POM or PBT, with a diameter of 12.7mm. The world of cosmetics packaging offers different solutions, especially when it comes to stylos, but few are available in the 12.7mm diameter of classic lipsticks, and for a premium positioning A-TX2 can be metallized without losing its airtight qualities. The characteristic of hermetic (airtight) packaging ensures that the product within doesn't dry out or deteriorate, while technological innovation combined with versatility make it a product in step with the times. Customization and aesthetic research are requirements in cosmetics packaging, especially if involving a product that is a master of seduction like lipstick, and Lumson doesn't disappoint, offering a variety of customization possibilities to give each product a little something ""extra"". Thanks to its characteristics, A-TX 2 by Lumson is the ideal solution for those who desire a safe product with immense appeal."
"""Clip-Case"" - Reusable compact by Albéa","""Clip-Case"" is designed to create a simple and intuitive consumer experience - a must when it comes to rechargeable concepts: When the powder is empty, the used-up case can be taken off by opening the cap to its maximum, getting the platform to automatically pop-out from the base. To change the pan, a simple slide back into the platform case and the pack will be as good as new. ""Smooth and quick manipulations are key to consumers that are willing but who will give up if the system takes too much time to be understood or achieved,"" explains Inès Coeur, Compacts Market Manager at Albéa. While shaping Clip-Case, the goal was to go beyond reusability by targeting circularity which is crucial for any Albéa innovation. Once the packaging has fulfilled its purpose, the materials shouldn't go to waste. ""Our sustainable roadmap for compacts targets to get PP/PET based products, include more recycled material and find lighter designs. Our ultimate challenge is obviously to reach recyclability. At Albéa, major challenges lead to milestone innovations… so stay tuned!"" says Inès Coeur. When it comes to a pressed powder compact, the end of life depends on how easy the disassembly of the non-plastic components is: ""We found a playful way to combine refillability and the sorting of the pieces before recycling."" Here, the metallic pan and the mirror can be easily disassembled. The plastic materials were carefully selected to design the pack for recycling and to allow in the future a great part of recycled materials, lowering even more its impact. To perfect the concept, the Albéa team is working on a ""metal-free hinge"". By removing this little metal component at the back of the compact, its recyclability becomes possible. Clip-Case is an allrounder that can be applied to many different compacts design (multi-pans palettes, square or round mono-compact…). Playful, the system can also be displayed as a tailor-made offer where consumers choose a formula that they pair up with their favorite version of the pack. ""We wanted to offer brands a flexible concept that can adapt to various needs and identities,"" adds Inès Coeur. ""Clip-Case"" is a breakthrough innovation in the packaging industry and a step further towards responsible packaging. This refillable compact embodies the commitment of Albéa, as a responsible company, to help make plastic more sustainable, and beauty more circular. Together with its customers and partners, Albéa is continuously exploring new ways, developing smarter concepts and using responsible materials - to protect beauty and the planet."
Eurovetrocap firmly commits to the creation of sustainable packaging,"To meet environmental challenges, all new Eurovetrocap developments are now driven by the reduction of the environmental impact, according to an approach based on the ""waste hierarchy"" proposed by the European Commission: if it is not possible to eliminate the need for packaging, the company opts for reducing it, reusing it or making it recycled and recyclable. ""Following this approach, last year we launched the Laura line, a landmark bestseller for our group, in a 90% recycled glass version, 60% of which is post-consumer, in 15, 30, 50 and 100 ml sizes. This is the highest recycled glass content available on the beauty packaging market to date. In parallel, we developed the Parigi Airless 50 ml jar, which combines sleek lines and reduced use of materials. Mainly made of PP, it has a very hygienic, POM-free and metal-free valve system,"" explains Simon Silvano, Zero In·Pack Project Coordinator. More recently, Eurovetrocap launched its first Refill range. It comes in a luxurious 50 ml glass jar, whose 100% recycled PP refill system includes a self-sealing cup and lid, and two 15 and 30 ml Airless glass bottles, also refillable thanks to a screw-in piston cartridge, equipped with a POM and metal-free pump. To go further, Eurovetrocap has created Zero In·Pack, a true internal start-up intended to accelerate the environmental transition of the company, in line with market expectations. ""This entity, a true innovation start-up, was created in 2000 and is our concrete contribution to the European Commission's ambitious objectives of a carbon-neutral territory by 2050, efficient economic growth uncoupled from the extraction of increasingly limited natural resources, and a territory that no longer leaves any population behind,"" said Giampaolo Hermann, General Manager. The name ""Zero In·Pack"" is in itself a statement of intent. While Eurovetrocap considers there is no such thing as a perfect packaging from an environmental point of view, the company has set itself the task of minimising the impact it generates, without compromising on the protection of the formulas and the aesthetic side. ""Cutting impact does not mean poorly looking packaging solutions,"" emphasized Simon Silvano. Central to the Zero In·Pack project is a lifecycle analysis tool developed with the Bocconi University in Milan. ""This tool allows us to guide our customers towards more sound choices in terms of packaging eco-design, in a quantified and tangible way, but also to make choices regarding the future product developments of the Eurovetrocap Group,"" said Giampaolo Hermann. By quantifying, from the design phase of the project, the impacts generated by a material, a manufacturing process, a type of finishing or an end-of-life processing, it becomes possible upstream to opt for lower-impact alternatives, at each step of the product's life cycle. ""The aim is to understand where and how environmental impacts are generated, how to lower them and eventually compensate them,"" concluded Simon Silvano. The company, which employs around 100 people for EUR 50 million in turnover in 2020, intends to build on this new service to continue its development in Europe, its main market, and in North America, where it is recording rapid development."
"Sustainable, flexible, economical: wood boosts the growth of Pujolasos","The growth of the company is clearly driven by the green wave which has made it possible to rediscover wood as a durable, flexible, elegant material, adapted to the needs of the perfume and cosmetics industry. ""It can't be denied that consumer awareness is shifting towards the use of wood as a sustainable and natural material associated with luxury,"" said Ángel Pujolasos, Chief Strategy Officer and co-CEO. Europe remains by far the main market for the company, which focuses on manufacturing caps for the perfume and cosmetics markets, as well as wines and spirits, with the latter being on the rise. ""At the moment, our main objective is to supply the perfumery and cosmetic sectors in Europe in general and, more specifically, in France, Belgium, Germany, Spain and Sweden, countries where the demand for wood-based packaging and accessories accelerated last year, despite Covid,"" added Ángel Pujolasos. Thanks to their commercial partnership with SGB Packaging, Pujolasos is also experiencing strong growth in North America. Beyond that, the company is represented by Identiscents in the Middle East and is currently in negotiations with distributors and agents in South America and Asia. To stimulate the interest in its products, the Spanish SME has strived over the last few months to answer key questions regarding the durability of wooden caps, in particular by improving their recyclability. These efforts gave birth to the series called ""Woork®"", ""Woodle®"" and ""Woon®"" (detailed here). ""These innovations meet the exact needs of our customers in terms of sustainability, compostability, recyclability and use of natural, sustainable and organic materials,"" explains Isabel Pujolasos, co-CEO. The very own qualities of wood also make it a very flexible product that perfectly suits to the needs for agility that characterize new trends in the perfume and cosmetics market. ""Much more than just being sustainable, natural and organic, wood is also a luxurious packaging material that is available for big capacities at very low cost when it comes to customisation,"" highlights Sergi Gonzalez, Sales Manager at Pujolasos. In concrete terms, creating custom designs is much cheaper for wood than for plastic or glass, and faster, since no costly or complicate mould is required. This makes it possible to serve niche brands as well as very large series. Eventually, the only limitation of wood is a texture that complicates decoration processes, but ""great progress has been made in this area,"" adds Sergi Gonzalez."
Stoelzle's French plant continues its modernisation and launches into spirits,"""In a difficult period for all glass manufacturers, the strength of the Stoelzle group has enabled us to maintain our focus on investments and to be ready today to support the new projects of our customers"", emphasizes Étienne Gruyez, Chairman and CEO of Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie and Director of the Perfumery and Cosmetics Business Unit of Stoelzle Glass Group. Inaugurated last January, the new furnace has increased the site's production capacity by more than 30%, bringing it to over 110 tonnes per day, or approximately 140 million bottles per year. Unlike the majority of glass manufacturers, which specialise in one product category such as Perfumes & Cosmetics, spirits, pharmaceutical and consumer, Stoelzle Glass Group maintains a presence across all these market segments. ""This gives us a strong capacity for resilience in the event of a crisis, because these different segments are rarely affected at the same time,"" adds Étienne Gruyez. The reconstruction of the furnace came along with the assembly of a new line capable of accommodating both spirits and perfumes production. In total, the site now has five production lines: four dedicated to perfumery and cosmetics and one for perfumery and spirits. ""This is a market that the Stoelzle group is already familiar with and to which the Masnières plant brings its expertise in perfume glass. It is also a way to speed up the dissemination of skills and innovations within our various business units. Our customers appreciate the group's presence in several segments because themselves are constantly on the lookout for new developments that may emerge in other sectors,"" says the manager. However, many other investments have been made and they are also contributing radically to the site's transformation. The modernization and automation of the in-house moulding facility continued, in particular through the acquisition of a new robot capable of automatically loading and unloading the machining equipment. While Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie already manufactures all of its pre-forming moulds in-house, this new equipment allows a significant increase in production capacity to ramp up the internalization of the production of final moulds. ""This is a very important element of responsiveness, which makes it possible to reduce mould production times to one or two days, where 15 days are necessary with an external supplier,"" explains Étienne Gruyez. At the other end of the glass production chain, the entire cold sector has been modernized, with new quality control machines, and the automation of packaging with new robots. Concretely, investments have been made at all stages of the chain, including within the sister plant Stoelzle Masnières Décoration, with the acquisition of a Kamman K15 automatic screen printing machine. In total, 20 million euros have been invested in Masnières over the last six months, adding up to the 15 million euros already invested by Stoelzle Glass Group from 2015 to 2019 to transform the 200 years old glassworks into a high-performance tool capable of meeting the challenges of the luxury market of the future."
"Aptar's world first mono-material pump, for 100% recyclable packs","To meet the demand for ecodesigned packaging solutions, Aptar made research on pump technology a priority. ""It was a most urgent issue, in particular in the field of Personal Care. We wanted brands to be able to put forward the fact that their packaging can be fully recycled, and a standard pump pack cannot be,"" explains Global Strategic Marketing Director Sabine Bouillet-Lubot. The distribution system of standard pumps is based on a complex technology involving various components, including metal, which cannot but complicate the recycling process. Conversely, the Future pump is fully made of polyethylene (PE), one the most common plastic materials – and also one of the most recycled in the world. Plus, it goes with a bottle based on the same material, so it can be fully recycled. And with a PP or PET bottle, the product can be more easily sorted. Future is also available in a post-consumer resin (PCR) version derived from the Advanced Recycling technology already used by Aptar, in partnership with REN. This process offers the same quality level as conventional resin. Tests were carried out to determine the new pump compatibility with various types of formula viscosities: it is adapted to hygiene and body and hair care products with two neck sizes, high (28/410) and low (28/400), and a 2-cc dose. A 1.5-cc neck dose is scheduled for late 2021. In addition, Aptar offers a full-pack option with 500- and 300-ml round bottles either biosourced or made of conventional PE, PCR or Ocean Plastic. The new Future pump also offers an innovative locking system compatible with e-commerce constraints [1]: a ring with a rotary mechanism to be put on or off. ""We paid particular attention to this new gesture, because it should be easy to understand. The ring between the bottle and the spout is coloured and striated. The pump also features an arrow and sounds a click when it closes. We insisted upon including these sensorial elements. As it is fully integrated, it also avoids using the disposable safety ring commonly found on standard pumps, so it is another saved plastic part,"" emphasizes Sabine Bouillet-Lubot. The 360° rotary spout makes it possible to hold the actuator in any direction and reduces risks of breakage for e-commerce. Aesthetically, the dip tube does not feature any visible mechanism, so it harmoniously fits in a transparent PET bottle. Thanks to this innovation, Aptar adds an exclusive sustainable solution to the company's portfolio – it should be available on the market very soon. As a member of the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Aptar further commits to reducing the environmental impact and supporting the Foundation's vision of the circular economy. Determined to fulfil the company's 2025 objective to make packaging 100% reusable, recyclable, or compostable, Aptar has been focusing on three main priorities: converting the product portfolio with recycled materials, recyclability, and reuse. ""Now that we have made a huge step forward with the first two priorities, we are assessing the reusability of our products. There are endless possibilities and countless solutions to explore, depending on our customers' strategies,"" concludes Sabine Bouillet-Lubot."
Sulapac biocomposite packs evolve to embrace water-based formulas,"Finnish bio-composite specialist Sulapac and beauty packaging supplier Quadpack, are enlarging the scope of possibilities for brands looking for sustainable packaging options with a new addition to the ""Sulapac Nordic Collection by Quadpack"": a 50ml jar designed for water-based formulations. The new reference features Sulapac's new bio-based barrier. Using a biobased and biodegradable material, the patent-pending technology allows to create a sustainable packaging solution for water-based products, which account for the vast majority of the cosmetics market. The inner part of the jar is made from this new barrier, while the outer part is made from the now well-known biocomposite material from Sulapac. The whole jar biodegrades in industrial composting schemes without leaving permanent microplastic behind. ""The new 50ml cosmetics jar is the perfect size for the most popular skincare products, from anti-ageing treatments to moisturising creams, as well as haircare, lipcare and men's grooming,"" explains Quadpack in a statement. The jar's barrier properties passed standard weight loss tests [1] at Quadpack's central test laboratory in Barcelona, Spain. First brought to market by international beauty packaging manufacturer and provider Quadpack in August 2020, the Sulapac Nordic Collection comprises 15ml, 30ml and 50ml jars initially designed for oil-based and waterless products. The Sulapac Nordic Collection is made at Quadpack's manufacturing facilities in Germany. Part of Quadpack's QLine product portfolio, it offers a sustainable alternative to conventional plastic packaging. Made of wood-based biocomposite material that mimics nature, it is suitable for industrial composting. Aimed at beauty brands with a genuine commitment to sustainability, it is a driving force in Quadpack's journey towards positive-impact packaging. Available in nine colours, the jars can be decorated using silk screening and pad printing. The material's natural texture can be left visible to emphasise a brand's sustainability claims. In addition, the Sulapac Nordic Collection has further been extended with a 200ml jar for waterless products. This additional jar is ideal for bodycare, allowing eco-conscious brands to launch a more complete range packaged in one of the industry's most sustainable materials."
Glass: A new generation of screw rings for perfume bottles,"As consumers expect brands to help them live more sustainable lifestyles, the need for environmentally and climate-friendly packaging is becoming increasingly important in all sectors. For perfumes bottles, this often means choosing solutions allowing them to be refilled or, at least, to easily separate the different parts and thus facilitate their recycling at the end of their life. But this change is not without important industrial, technical and aesthetic constraints! Replacing the traditional crimped finishes (known as FEA finishes) with screw finishes that allow the sprayer to be disassembled and reassembled, calls for the development of glass vials with suitable necks and compatible accessories (pumps, neck covers). At the same time, perfume brands want to stick to the aesthetic codes of existing bottles, with smaller pumps. Not to mention the fact that some markets, such as Saudi Arabia, which are often large perfume consumers, also require products to be sold with non-removable pumps. The challenge is therefore to promote the interchangeability of the FEA finish/screw finish. To this end, stakeholders in the sector (glassmakers, pump manufacturers, brands) have joined the Cetie [1] in a Working Group known as the ""Flaconnage Geometry Group"" [2] to develop new standards for interchangeable rings. Cetie's objective was to offer screw rings with the lowest possible height, allowing perfumers to use the same pump covers as their crimped counterparts while guaranteeing the consumer optimum unscrewing and screwing comfort. ""The creation of a Cetie standard allows avoiding the multiplication of incompatible technical solutions, patented separately by each player, by creating instead a harmonised solution, technically validated by professionals, and usable by all,"" explains Josquin Peyceré, Cetie's Secretary-General. In this case, the difficulty was to maintain the diameter of the casing, as the 1 mm thick plastic screw-threaded ring reduces the diameter of the glass finish by the same amount, as the glass finish always has to allow the 7.7 mm diameter pump to pass through. To offer maximum flexibility to fragrance houses, two standards have been produced and released in early May 2021 [3]. If the brand wishes to have the possibility of producing both formats (crimp finish and screw finish) on a given model of bottle. In this case, the most interchangeable version is equipped with a counter-bead, and it corresponds to a crimp finish with a counter-bead created for the purpose [4]. The alignment of the heights of the two rings and the diameters under the ring allow the glassmaker to use a single set of moulds for the body of the bottle, on which he adapts either a screw ring mould or a crimp ring mould. ""This solution is very convenient for creating a new item with a reduced investment for both types of rings,"" explains the Cetie. If, instead, the priority of the brand is to preserve the existing components by respecting the original design (in particular the very low finish of the FEA version), it will then opt for a screw ring with no counter-bead, which allows this finish to be barely 1.5 mm higher than the crimped version. This option is not suited for very heavy vials (> 200/250g) and is just wide enough for the pumps (through bore guaranteed at 7.8 mm, for pump bodies at 7.7). These solutions have been studied using the 15 mm FEA finish, which represents 65% of the crimp finish market. They are also available in other dimensions, mainly Ø13 and Ø18, then possibly Ø17 and Ø20 according to the needs expressed. Aligning to this new standard, Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie has developed a new standard 100ml cubic bottle. Following the new Cetie standard, this bottle can be made either with the new screw ring, which allows all the elements to be separated for recycling or with a traditional crimp ring. The design and aesthetics of the bottle remain unchanged, only the neck is changed, using a specific mould at the time of production. ""This new offer allows each customer the possibility to choose between the FEA or Screw neck finish depending on the brand strategy, the project and the adaptation time of their packaging lines,"" explains Stoelzle in a release. According to Stoelzle officials, many technical tests have been carried out on customer lines, which have led to the approval of the solution by many leading brands."
GSK partners with Albéa and EPL to launch fully recyclable toothpaste tubes,"GSK Consumer Healthcare (GSKCH) has partnered with two global packaging suppliers to launch fully recyclable toothpaste tubes across its specialist and science-based oral health brands, including Sensodyne, Parodontax and Aquafresh. In the wake of Colgate-Palmolive, Henkel and P&G, the oral care specialist aims to see over a billion toothpaste tubes per year become recyclable by 2025. To reach this goal, GSK Consumer Healthcare is switching its toothpaste tubes from aluminium barrier laminates to the Albéa's patented Greenleaf laminate technology. The switch-over will begin with Sensodyne Pronamel tubes, which will be available in fully recyclable alternatives in Europe this July. ""We are extremely proud to rollout our responsible Greenleaf tube packaging solution with an inspiring market leader such as GSK. Responsible packaging is now a must-have – and it requires close collaboration between a committed brand and a daring supplier,"" said Karl Graves, Business Director at Albéa Tubes. In a second step, GSKCH will bolster this transition with a second partnership with EPL Global to produce tubes in Platina laminate. ""We know that sustainability will dictate innovation and be the focus of our operations, today and into the future. We are committed to leading the pack in sustainable packaging - and already are ahead on this journey with Platina,"" said Parag Chaturvedi, VP of Operations, EPL Americas. Both Albéa's Greenleaf and EPL Global's tube have passed recycling-readiness tests set by the US-based Association of Plastic Recyclers (APR) and by Europe's RecyClass, meaning that the tubes will be recyclable and compatible with existing recycling processes. Furthermore, EPL's Platina tube-and-cap combination has been recognized as completely recyclable by the APR. This latest GSKCH initiative support GSK's company wide commitment to achieve a net zero impact on climate and a positive impact on nature by 2030. ""We have made the commitment that 100% of our product packaging will be recyclable or reusable, where quality and safety permits, by 2025.This is just one part of our ongoing sustainability journey, in which we are working to address the environmental and societal barriers to everyday health,"" concluded Sarah McDonald, VP Sustainability, GSK Consumer Healthcare."
Procos intensifies its international presence,"Procos also offers elegant, refined accessories and woven products to provide a wide range of secondary packaging solutions.

Procos places itself as the partner of brands from the Americas, acting locally with Procos Americas, Inc."
Albéa invests in sustainable 'made in America' production,"Seven of the 31 Albéa plants in the world are located in North America. The group's business in America accounts for 20% of the overall workforce. It is mostly focused on tube production (5 plants), but they also manufacture beauty packaging in Mexico and provide a turnkey offering in Canada. With five dedicated plants, the manufacturing of laminated and extruded tubes for the national and international markets is Albéa's most important business on the American continent. The installations and equipment were enhanced thanks to a 40-million-dollar investment since 2020: the objective was to gain competitiveness, quality, and capacities as regards sustainability. These developments helped reduce energy consumption by 30%, produce tubes based on PCR plastic, and install equipment for laminated tubes compatible with the Greenleaf technology, which makes them recyclable. The development and production of green tubes are a priority for the company: last year, they launched the disruptive innovation called Paper Tube, which was applied to La Roche-Posay sun products. This tube partly made of FSC-certified cardboard reduces the use of plastic by 45%. Also, Albéa set up a partnership with The Estée Lauder Companies to co-create a high-performing tube made of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene derived from complex mixtures of recycled plastic waste developed by SABIC thanks to an innovative technology. The plant located in Matamoros, Mexico, near the border with Texas, also benefited from considerable investments. Specialized for 35 years in the manufacturing of packaging for makeup – mascara, gloss, and lipsticks –, it has been able to broaden its packaging offering to pressed powders, skincare and haircare, as well as to perfume caps. With 1,250 employees, the site has all the cutting-edge technologies needed to transform raw materials and decorate products. ""We boast the largest portfolio of solutions available on the market,"" says Carlos Rubio, General Manager of the Matamoros site. All these investments helped double metallization capacities last year, made the use of PCR or biosourced resins easier, and reduced energy consumption by 20%. Lastly, the company's engagement for the community and its supporting women through various programmes make it stand out on the local level. Based in Canada near Toronto, the Orchard plant provides the group with an expertise in turnkey solutions for cosmetics, beauty, toiletries, and white label accessories. Thanks to a network of partners based all across North America, the company meets the agility and flexibility requirements of its customers – from mass market to indie brands – as regards finished products, with or without a formula. Orchard both has a team of specialized experts for all product development phases and takes advantage of Albéa's industrial capacities. Ecodesigned packaging and formulas are the main targets. ""Over the past six months, 85% of our projects were sustainable products. We aim to reach 95% this year,"" says Jennifer Raphaël, President of Orchard Custom Beauty."
Cosfibel continues their acquisitions and prepares for a new era,"""Thanks to adapted developments, the group succeeded in protecting its operating margins and constituted cash reserves to be able to react to market opportunities,"" said the company in a statement. Cosfibel benefited from the economic situation to plan ahead, restructure, consolidate its offer and its presence on the ground. It has reinforced its Urban Networks in Asia (Shanghai and Singapore) and Europe (Switzerland and the Benelux countries), as well as in France with the recent acquisition of BoiteAlu, based near Bordeaux, France. As part of the Cosfibel Industries business unit, BoiteAlu allows the group to reinforce its presence in metal packaging, notably for food and beauty industries. Furthermore, Cosfibel has also bought 100% of the capital of MMB, a proximity import trader based in Breda, Netherlands, that specializes in folding and rigid packaging for fine food market. In addition, MMB has an exclusive sourcing facility in Warsaw. Eventually, Laser Paris, a company specialized in essential oil devices designed in France and developed in Asia, has joined the group as a joint venture (51/49). With a local sourcing network, Laser has strong connections with brands in the pharmacy, parapharmacy, phyto-cosmetics and aromatherapy segments. ""These three acquisitions represent approximately $m15 of total annual sales - which compensates Cosfibel's sales decline in 2020 - and offer a high growth potential and strong synergies with Cosfibel core business,"" explained Cosfibel. In the short term, Cosfibel plans to continue expanding in fine food and luxury markets. However, the next chapter will be in new hands. After 20 years at the head of the company, Alain Chevassus is organizing his succession by appointing Marie Sermadiras as Executive Vice President, before taking up the role of CEO in 2022. In 2012, Marie Sermadiras founded ZenSoon, a booking platform dedicated to hair and beauty appointments, which has since become Treatwell France. In 2018, she joined L'Oréal as Strategic Advisor for the Corporate Venture Fund (BOLD) and most recently held the position of Global Chief Digital Officer of the Active Cosmetics division. ""She may only be 31, but Marie has a strong personality and vitality. She is full of positive energy. With values close to our own, she is a great listener and an inherent team worker,"" said Alain Chevassus. ""I will support her as Executive Chairman of the group, with the aim of preparing the transition from a SME to a medium-sized company with a great team and strong vision,"" he concluded."
SGB Packaging: a plural offering adapted to the North-American market,"Fed with in-depth knowledge of cosmetics packaging in all its aspects and influenced by the changing expectations of North-American luxury to indie brands, SGB Packaging has developed a significant offering of solutions for all beauty segments. The family company boasts a portfolio of standard and tailor-made products, including droppers, glass jars and bottles, airless packaging, plastic tubes and jars, Bakelite caps, wood, samples, secondary packaging, mascara brushes… Over the past few years, SGB Packaging has changed their offering according to the main market trends. They have developed various ecodesigned alternatives, from single materials or materials with RPET to biosourced resins. ""We aim to have a large number of possibilities at hand for brands, because all of them do not have the same approach,"" explains Lauren Gibli, Executive Vice President Sales & Operations. The broad range of airless containers, which offer a capacity up to 250 ml, is now also available with resins based on 30% or 50% of PCR or bio-resins. In the glass sector, SGB doubled their number of standard references, some of which are based on up to 50% of recycled glass. A new exclusive 100% PCR-based glass line called Wild Glass has completed the range: it is available in green or amber tinted glass. ""This line is about to revolutionize the market with a real unique environmental offering,"" says Shoshana Gibli. Wood is also part of the range of solutions, as can be seen with the Woom and Woodle caps developed by Spanish wood packaging specialist Pujolasos. The former is a glue- and plastic-insert-free cap made of wood and cork, which means it is fully biodegradable. The wooden part is threaded inside to be screwed on a jar or a bottle. The latter features an easily removable plastic insert, so materials can be recycled separately. The insert can be made of PCR plastic or another sustainable resin. In the field of sampling and single-use solutions, the SGB catalogue was enriched with solutions adapted to the sanitary context, like Livstick developed by Livcer. The test is presented in the form of a single-use wooden stick whose tip is coated with a lipstick formula. Inserted in a blister pack, it ensures optimum conditions for the test. The recent arrival among the partner selection of Ponzini, a leading manufacturer in the field of brow and mascara brushes, completed the portfolio of products with a range of 30 new standards meeting volume, separation and thickness requirements. These products are available injected, as organic filaments or fibres, and based on castor oil. In the dropper category in which SGB boasts a historical expertise, the offering was broadened with several innovations developed by their partner Virospack. The Childproof Locking Dropper provides the same performance as an aesthetic dropper, but it is also adapted to children, for the most risky products, like topical treatments with CBD. The Ring Dropper is a new version of the dropper with a big pushbutton switch which makes it all easier to use. The Zamac Tip Dropper, with a Zamak tip at the base of the pipette, is intended for the eye care segment and other targeted applications. Lastly, SGB Packaging added to this selection of packaging solutions an offering of turnkey services from product formulation to filling, including secondary packaging production. This global brand support helped the company get through a critical year 2020 and consider the new boom of the American market with equanimity. ""We have already observed a recovery, although women, who were confronted with their own image on screen during lockdown, kept taking care of their skins, hair, and bodies,"" says Shoshana Gibli."
"""Our business has shifted to cosmetics"", Marc Bruneau, Dapy","Premium Beauty News - The pandemic has created new demands at POS. You have for example developed a contactless perfume tester. Marc Bruneau - This new perfume dispenser is equipped with an infrared system, which detects movements and automatically activates the perfume spray. We have already marketed this tester for a perfume brand in the US, whose name remains confidential for the moment. Our system stands out from the competition by using the original perfume bottle as is. Many contactless systems only put forward the fragrance, we decided to also enhance the bottle to preserve the brand's identity. This tester, developed for different brands, was patented this year. Premium Beauty News - You are also introducing a new rechargeable luminous label. Marc Bruneau - The luminous label allows playing on the visibility of the brand. The first luminous label was introduced in 2010, but we are adding two innovations: the possibility of recharging it and of transferring it from one bottle to another to meet the ecological expectations of brands. This type of label is often used for liquor bottles but it can also find applications in the perfume world. Brands all want to remain as visible as possible, especially in nightlife areas where lighting is much less intense. Premium Beauty News - The pandemic has posed many challenges. How did you adapt? Marc Bruneau - The first challenge we faced was to restore our production capacity as quickly as possible. We were able to restart faster than expected in comparison to Western countries because our production line is in Asia. The second challenge, given the closure of bricks and mortar outlets, was to develop new markets, particularly online sales. For instance, we made prestige boxes for the Moon Festival in China last autumn. Premium Beauty News - How has your client base changed since the pandemic? Marc Bruneau - Before the health crisis, 60% of our business was focused on spirits, 30% on cosmetics and 10% on various other markets. Today, it's the other way round: 60% in cosmetics & perfumes, 30% in spirits and 10% in other sectors. Premium Beauty News - Can you give us some examples of recent collaborations with cosmetic brands? Marc Bruneau - We worked with Valmont in Switzerland by providing displays in their shops last Christmas. We were able to install window displays because their outlets were open. There are also other projects in the pipeline but I can't give you the names of the brands for the moment."
"""Innovating is making an idea feasible"", Jean-Louis Mathiez, Cinqpats","Premium Beauty News - Cinqpats is presented as a creator of innovative packaging, in particular for cosmetics. What is innovation to you? Jean-Louis Mathiez - Cinqpats's DNA is feasibility, in every sense of the word. We don't sell ideas or concepts. Our role consists in making ideas feasible. Innovating is about finding economically realistic technical means to overcome or get round difficulties… Premium Beauty News - Where exactly do you take action? Jean-Louis Mathiez - We need to work differently with each customer. Some of them only need help with design, while others ask us to manage whole projects, including by supervising production. Sometimes we also play a role in quality control with adapted specifications. Between these two extremes, there are endless intermediate situations. But we are always asked for solutions. Our team is still composed of five people with a great experience in product design, material science, and industrialization. We also have freelance partners who provide their expertise in design, marketing, and project follow-up. Independently of our customers' requests, we also work on our own projects: once we have registered patents, we offer them to brands. Premium Beauty News - Can you give examples of these various approaches? Jean-Louis Mathiez - Cinqpats has worked with Ghawali, the perfume brand owned by the Dubai-based Chalhoub group, to develop caps based on a design by Centdegrés. In this case, we had to find technical solutions, design and develop moulds, and launch manufacturing. More recently, we took part in an ambitious project for NextGen Beauty, German group Cosnova's incubator: we were to launch a foundation customization kit for the brand La Manufacture with five base shades which customers can mix to get the perfect foundation for their complexions or the mattifying or lightening effect desired. With Cosnova's R&D team, we developed a complexion-measuring tool to be added to the box and used at home. This small device is fixed to a smartphone camera, so users can accurately measure their skin's complexions among 50,000 shades, thanks to an application they download. It is made of 33 parts forming an optical system, a target with 24 reference shades, and a light diffuser. Perfectly in line with the DIY trend, this product has the advantage of being easy-to-use. The pipette helps pour the right quantity of each shade in the mixture given by the application. A cup is provided for it. It is both easy and extremely safe, since all bases are tested, and it is affordable. When it was launched in Germany in late 2020, it generated much enthusiasm among consumers. It should soon be marketed in France! Premium Beauty News - Are there any other ongoing developments? Jean-Louis Mathiez - Absolutely! We have patented a lipstick tube fully made of machined aluminium, which means we did not need a mould, and fully recyclable. It is a system with a sliding pushbutton switch inspired from vintage products, but modernized with an original braking system. The tubes are available in a standard 12.7 size or in a smaller, stackable size. All parts are produced with a machine fitted with CNC (Computer-Numerized Control). In practice, you just need to send the manufacturer a file to receive prototypes a week later. As for large-scale manufacturing, we have two options, depending on our customer-brand's needs: either in Asia, where they have a great experience in part machining for computers and smartphones, or in Europe, for smaller series. We have also developed a technical solution to make glass more accessible for foundations, with a flocked applicator (developed and industrialized). It is a purely European product: it is flocked in Germany, the plastic comes from France, and glass from Italy. We will soon be able to reveal more!"
Adhespack offers contact-free in-store fragrance sampling,"After having developed a pilot version of their new sampling solution for Brazilian brands Lux and Eudora, Adhespack launched the final model in December 2020. Inspired by queue ticket dispensers, the so-called Ticket Scent solution has been adapted using an Adhespack patented technology to bear the perfume as well as additional product information, such as photos and texts. The solution allows customers to interact with the product without physical contact with a tester bottle that could have be touched by other people or with a shop assistant. The samples are single-use and safe. In the midst of a pandemic, the solution quickly won over several international brands. ""Ticket Scent was conceived just before the pandemic, and appears as an excellent alternative at a time when consumers avoid sharing testers and stores are looking for safer, hygienic and individual options,"" says Volney Camargo, CEO of Adhespack and creator of Ticket Scent. Several brands of the Puig group - Carolina Herrera, Benetton, Antonio Banderas, Jean Paul Gaultier and Paco Rabanne - have thus opted for Ticket Scent to encourage perfume testing in airport duty free shops and shopping centers in Latin America, in the United States and in Europe. In Brazil, Ticket Scent is already present in some stores of nation-wide chain retailers including O Boticário, Eudora, C&A, Riachuelo and Renner. ""Customers want a safe, hygienic and single-use experience,"" points out Sérgio Picciarelli, director of marketing and innovation at Adhespack. ""It is also possible to apply a QR code on the back of the sample so that the consumer can buy later on e-commerce or access additional content,"" adds Daniel Almeida, sales director. Building on this success, Adhespack expects a 50% increase in its turnover in 2021. In Spain, France and the UK, Adhespack's solutions are distributed by Sampling Innovations. In Italy, their distributor is Publication Distribuzione. In addition, to work more closely with its international clients, the company recently opened a sales office in Madrid, and will soon inaugurate another one in California."
"Lumson launches TAL, the first aluminium touchless","It's safe. TAL uses pouch technology. The multi-layered pouch, equipped with a Hermetic Snap Closure System (patented by Lumson), has been studied to act as a barrier against external agents and protect the formula from any possible contamination. This technology guarantees that the product's purity and integrity remain completely untouched. It's sustainable. TAL is a sustainable solution for a variety of reasons. Firstly, because it's made of aluminium: not only is it the most common metal present on the Earth but it's also light, modern, and has many technical properties that mean it can be recycled an infinite number of times while maintaining its characteristics. Secondly, it's an eco-friendly choice as, after being used, the consumer can separate the aluminium components from the aluminium ones and recycle each part appropriately. A concrete answer, but at the same time one that is both safe and effective, to the cosmetic market's requests for sustainable options. It's versatile and customizable. Multifaceted and eco-friendly, aluminium is a material that is extremely easy to decorate. This versatility allows TAL to be customized with different decorations and finishes thanks to lithographic printing methods that can unite up to 6 colours. Packaging that, depending on effects and decorations, can be used for both mass market as well as luxury products. An example? TAL is offered in a ""luxury"" version with glossy effects or with satin-finishes and brushed effects for a look that is ""greener"". In any case, the result is always packaging that is contemporary and created with great attention to detail. It has a modern and minimalistic design, perfect for face & body and Hair care products. TAL is available in 3 sizes- 50, 75, and 100ml – with 500µl Half Moon matching pump for a design combo that is simple and sophisticated."
Meiyume adds a recyclable lipstick case to their aluminium packaging range,"While plastic - thanks to its low cost and versatility - is now ubiquitous in the makeup industry, Meiyume is reviving the early days of the lipstick tube, when it was made of metal. Patented in 1915 by American inventor Maurice Levy, the very first lipstick tube was made of brass. Dubbed 'Infinitely Recyclable Lipstick', Meiyume's new lipstick packaging pays homage to this heritage, with an added sustainable twist: recyclability. Crafted from 100% aluminium and fully recyclable, Meiyume's new lipstick tube works on a patented 'smart click system', allowing the lipstick cap to close snuggly and securely over the case body with a soft click. ""Solidly weighted, the container evokes a premium feeling,"" says the company in a statement. Drawing from their expertise in metal processing and parts decoration techniques, the Meiyume teams can customize the mono-material lipstick case in a variety of ways to reflect the customer's brand story. This is the second addition to Meiyume's sustainable aluminium packaging range, which was launched last year with the aim to provide plastic free recyclable packaging solutions to the beauty industry. ""Aluminium is one of the most recycled materials on the market today,"" explains Meiyume. ""Infinitely recyclable and highly durable, aluminium is 100 percent recyclable and retains its properties indefinitely in a true closed loop,"" the company adds. Despite the fact that producing aluminium requires a large amount of energy, it can be easily recycled with less than 10% of the energy needed to producing the initial material. In order to take one step further in their commitment towards the circular economy and the setting up of practices that will have real world impact on the environment, Meiyume has also recently become a member of the Sustainable Packaging Initiative for Cosmetics (SPICE). Co-founded in 2018 by L'Oréal and sustainability consulting firm Quantis, SPICE is an industry-led organisation gathering industry members committed to work together to develop solutions that will accelerate progress toward sustainable packaging for cosmetics. Après avoir développé une méthodologie de mesure de l'empreinte environnementale des packaging cosmétiques, SPICE en a fait un outil en ligne, ouvert à toutes les entreprises du secteur, pour leur permettre de mesurer et réduire l'empreinte environnementale de chaque emballage cosmétique, sur l'ensemble de son cycle de vie."
"Star Drop, a unique technology designed for precision","The 2021 makeup trends revolve around skin minimalism and nude finishes promoting a natural healthy glow. With face masks now essential objects of our everyday life through the COVID-19 pandemic, makeup brands turn to lighter, more wearable textures with sheer finishes: fluid foundations, skin tints or tinted serums, less dense than full-coverage foundations, with water-like texture that melts onto the skin to enhance glow and radiance. Brands tend to favor ""droppers"" or ""tottles"" as dispensing systems for these fluid and ultra-fluid textures. However, according to direct consumer feedbacks, the product flow is sometimes too quick to control properly. Another comment could be the pipette not being airtight enough and allowing the formula to run and smudge during or after use. This is why Aptar Beauty + Home has developed a clean and practical solution to improve the overall user experience for consumers. With Star Drop, Aptar Beauty + Home revolutionizes packaging for fluid and ultra-fluid formulas. Its soft bottle is easily ""squeezable"", even with just one hand, and dispenses just the right amount of product. Its smart dispensing system features a patented valve technology, SimpliSqueeze®, that automatically cuts off the product flow as soon as the pressure on the barrel drops, with an instant retraction effect sucking the formula back inside the pack. This intuitive technology ensures clean and controlled dispensing every time, with no leak hazard. Its ultra-precise pipette applicator - also patented - is transparent to see the product rise inside the tip to control and deliver the right amount of formula, drop by drop. ""Star Drop provides a satisfying – almost magical ! - feeling of control of the exact dose we wish for,"" says Patrick Bousquel, Skincare and Color Cosmetics EMEA Marketing Director at Aptar Beauty + Home. ""The gesture is super simple for consumers but the level of precision is unparalleled."" The combination of the SimpliSqueeze® technology and the high precision pipette guarantees a controlled and easy drop-by-drop dispensing with a clean finish. Packaging ergonomics allow a high restitution rate of the formula for end consumers. Its travel-friendly format is easy to customize and reconciles design with effortless functionality for any fluid and ultra-fluid textures, whether makeup or skincare: foundation, primers, highlighters, serums, facial oils, beard oils... you name it! Thanks to its incredible ability to dispense product with a high level of control with just a squeeze, it is the perfect match for high-value treatments or targeted serums. Star Drop is available in a standard 30ml format (mainly PP) and fully recyclable. Star Drop will shortly be available in full service. Ask for a sample! www.aptar.com/products/beauty/star-drop/"
Unipack wants to become a leader in sustainable packaging,"With a turnover increasing by more than 68% between 2017 and 2019, Unipack has demonstrated the suitability of its products to new market demand. Last year, in the context of a global recession linked to the pandemic, the company refocused its local market and on the development of new sustainable packaging concepts. ""We are very much focused at the moment on producing products using recycled raw materials such as PCR-PP and PCR-PET. We are also working on the development and production of products using bioplastics such as cellulose PP and we are achieving excellent results,"" explains Brian Chung, CEO of Unipack Korea. To achieve these sustainability goals, the company tries to build on all available solutions. On the one hand, they focus on the environmental friendly materials, and, on the other hand, they try to reduce the use of plastics as much as possible Unipack thus offers a large assortment of jars, pallettes, compacts, pump-bottles, including airless pumps, in PCR PP or PET, as well as in cellulose PP. The South-Korean supplier also offers several refillable packaging solutions with a removable inner part that contains the cosmetic formulation. These refillable systems are available for lipstick tubes, make-up compacts, and skincare cream jars. Moreover, the different components (the external and inner containers) can be produced using PCR PP, another type of recycled raw material, or a cellulose PP resin made using paper scrap. ""Cellulose PP is a raw material made by mixing cellulose and PP in an amount of 30%:70% or 51%:49% using some byproducts of the paper industry. This raw material has received the 'OKBIOSED ONE STAR & TWO STAR' certification in Europe, and one of its interesting features is that it can be used to produce packaging in molds initially designed for PP and ABS resins,"" adds Brian Chung. Unipack has also developed flexible pouches made from paper and a PLA film. These biodegradable and compostable solutions can be adapted to suit the needs of different product categories. ""In particular, we are developing eco-friendly paper pouches to replace mask packs and the tubes that are widely used in the cosmetic field,"" says the CEO. According to Unipack, the demand for sustainable solutions for cosmetic packaging is growing in Korea. The company wants to leverage on its home market to speed-up its innovations and develop in international markets."
Aptar: A foresight study to anticipate consumer expectations,"Conducted at the end of the initial lockdown periods in June 2020 and then on the cusp of the second pandemic wave in October and November 2020, the study surveyed 9,600 beauty and home care consumers in four major markets: Brazil, China, France, and the United States. The importance of the economic and social shock that hit consumers appeared clearly. Mood states analysis clearly demonstrate the rising levels of consumer anxiety, with 29% of consumers in a mindset dominated by fear. Facemasks have become the physical expression of consumers' disrupted routines and mindsets. For instance, 50% of Americans feel that they are not being adequately protected. 78% of Brazilians are worried about their loved ones. As consumers feared for their financial stability, many reduced their spending: 30% of disposable income was being saved in the US and France, while 40% of Chinese consumers postponed large purchases. These figures, however, point to the possibility of a dynamic recovery, provided that governments be show themselves able of restoring consumer confidence. ""Beauty consumption will gradually increase in the second half of the year and into 2022 if pandemic conditions ease thanks to widespread vaccination campaigns,"" says Aptar in a statement. Such a social and economic turmoil has led to significant shifts in priorities and to the rise of new consumer profiles. ""Our study revealed, for example, that COVID-19 led some consumers to re-evaluate the health of their homes and its impact on their mental wellbeing. That increased anxiety around hygiene and personal well-being is playing out significantly in the Beauty & Personal Care space,"" shares Marie Jacquemin, Consumer Studies Manager, Aptar Beauty + Home. When analyzing how much the needs and expectations of beauty and home care consumers shifted during the pandemic, Aptar discovered a new attitudinal segmentation, articulated around two dimensions - the behavioral intensity and the level of external help that they require from brands. In beauty and personal care, four consumer profiles came to light: – For the Unphased, predominantly male, it's ""business as usual"". – The Survivors, however, have ventured into DIY solutions to solve supply problems or relieve financial constraints. – While the Anxious [27%] are looking primarily for reassurance and, therefore, expect their trusted brands to provide safe and protective solutions. – Finally, the younger Reinventors [28%] perceive the pandemic as an opportunity to transform their lifestyle. Overall, the study revealed heightened consumer concerns around hygiene, effectiveness, and sustainability. ""After diving into the key findings, our teams are hard at work on our innovation workstreams to deliver touchless, at home, and antimicrobial solutions for each segment profile. We are particularly inspired by a project we call Scent with Intent which is going to help to reduce stress and anxiety at home. Other multi-functional product innovations aim to offer streamlined solutions for on-the-go consumers,"" explains Marco Burigana, Innovation Director, Aptar Beauty + Home. Once the crisis is overcome, in 2023 and beyond, Aptar's research confirms that the major pandemic trends of e-commerce and sustainability will become the norm, while concerns with hygiene, safety, harmlessness, and effectiveness of home care products will have become a reflex for many consumers. ""As consumers grapple with the ongoing impact of the coronavirus pandemic and evolve their behaviors, we plan to conduct further qualitative research later this year to help fine- tune our development pipelines and further assist our partners,"" shares Cécile Abeille, Communications and Digital Marketing Director, Aptar Beauty + Home."
Jabil to increase their production of paper bottles in Europe and the USA,"In the wake of the acquisition of Ecologic Brands in January, Jabil has announced huge expansion plans for their paper bottle technology with a USD 25 million investment in Ecologic's plant in Manteca, California, with the delivery of new equipment and automation, and the buildout of a new paper bottle plant in their Sustainability Center of Excellence in Tortosa, Spain. Creating the first paper-based scaled production in the market, this expansion will enable the production of hundreds of millions of new paper packages, said Jabil in a statement. In particular, it will allow Jabil to deliver Ecologic's innovative pulp molding technologies to new geographies. The technology developed by Ecologic Brands enables a significant reduction in the amount of plastic (up to 60% less) needed to manufacture rigid primary packaging. Briefly said, an outer paper shell is molded around a plastic insert which provides the barrier effect. This solution was chosen by L'Oréal for its Seeds Phytonutrients brand, launched in 2018 in the United States. Recently, L'Oréal announced their intention to extend this solution to some of their iconic brands such as Redken and Matrix. Jabil is making this investment in response to a significant rise of the demand for sustainability in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) market. According to Euromonitor, consumers reported that they are three times more likely to prefer paper-based packaging over alternatives that leverage metal or plastic. ""As consumers become more informed about the environmental impact of plastic waste, they are looking for new, sustainable packaging solutions such as paper. The challenge for packaging providers is the ability to scale production to meet this demand,"" said Jason Paladino, senior vice president of Jabil and CEO of Jabil Packaging Solutions. ""The expansion of these two facilities will result in a significant increase in packaging capacity for the North American and European markets, helping CPG brands in pursuit of challenging sustainability goals."" A global packaging giant, the Jabil group employs about 260,000 staffs across 100 locations in 30 countries."
Plastic prices: The European cosmetics industry is under pressure,"""For several weeks now, manufacturers of rigid and flexible plastic packaging have been experiencing serious difficulties in obtaining their supplies of raw materials"", warns Elipso, the professional association that brings together plastic packaging manufacturers in France. These problems concern the main virgin plastic resins, such as polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene (PE), but also more specific resins like certain ionomers (such as Surlyn) or ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene), which are also widely used to manufacture plastic cosmetics packaging. According to Elipso, between May 2020 and February 2021, prices for PP and PE rose by 30%. As for ABS, its price has increased by more than 60% in one year, according to Polyvia, the French Union of Polymer Transformers. ""In practice, all plastics are concerned,"" confirms Florent Tronquit, VP Supply Chain at Albéa, the French beauty packaging giant. ""But beyond that, almost all raw materials are under pressure, including metals,"" he adds. ""Our suppliers keep announcing price increases with immediate effects,"" also testifies Vincent Joffre, Sales Director at PRP Création. This situation has its roots in the health crisis and the 2020 lockdown measures and the subsequent fall in global demand. ""Some polymer producers, who had large stocks at the time, made the logical decision to reduce their production,"" explains Polyvia. But the rapid recovery of China, which was deconfined earlier than the rest of the world, led to an unexpected rebound in demand for polymers, which was associated with a sharp rise in prices. ""As a result, the flow of materials was massively redirected to Asia,"" observes Rémi Weidenmann, Executive Director of the PSB Industries Texen Group. This already tense situation was compounded by the disorganisation of logistics chains, resulting in a shortage of containers and a sharp rise in transport costs and deadlines. Finally, several incidents at key sites resulted in production stoppages and declarations of ""force majeure"". Hence, plastics converters were faced with untimely delivery cancellations and sharp price increases. ""Plastic packaging manufacturers struggle every day to ensure the delivery of packaging to their clients. They must constantly reorganize their schedules and production processes according to the latest information received, or even postpone deliveries when they cannot do otherwise,"" indicates Françoise Andres, President of Elipso. For the moment, in a context of still moderate demand in Europe, producers in the cosmetics sector have managed to withstand the situation. ""Up to now, we were able to find the raw materials we needed, but we were on the verge of discontinuing some specific productions in January,"" confirms Rémi Weidenmann. ""After the drop in demand in 2020 and in a context of low visibility, we had, like everyone else, very low stocks."" ""We were able to satisfy orders because the PET market is a little less tight. On the other hand, the research and testing work we had carried out on alternative ecological materials was suspended due to the lack of these materials, even though they are promoted by polymer manufacturers,"" adds Vincent Joffre. These raw material disruptions come at the worst possible time for European packaging manufacturers, who are already heavily impacted by the collapse in demand in 2020. ""Securing production means raising stock levels, which has a significant cost at a time when cash positions are under pressure,"" stresses Florent Tronquit. ""This crisis comes at the wrong time,"" adds Rémi Weidenmann. In this context, both trade associations, Elipso and Polyvia, are asking polymer manufacturers to show full transparency to guarantee the visibility that packaging producers need on the availability and supply of resins. With a major understatement: the destabilisation of the markets must not be exacerbated by players eager to increase their margins. For Polyvia, the current situation recalls the precedent one, when in 2015, raw material suppliers had been blamed for taking advantage of a ""momentary shortage"" to impose contracts ""with no possibility of negotiation."" Processors are also calling for more solidarity throughout the sector. ""At Albéa, we are in constant contact with our suppliers and clients, in a context where forecasts are particularly unreliable,"" says Florent Tronquit. ""The general trend is to not commit too much for the future; the different players are in a phase of growing awareness of what is at stake."" ""Broadly speaking, we have much less visibility than before, with shorter and less precise forecasts,"" observes Vincent Joffre. ""Our clients seem to want to narrow down their range to focus on blockbusters, which may make the recovery smoother,"" he adds. ""The more visibility we have on our future orders, the more manageable the situation will be,"" explains Rémi Weidenmann. ""We are happy to have completed the reorganisation of the group and to have given Texen a global organisation that gives us a vision of the market that is crucial in the current period."" While uncertainties about the emergence of virus variants and the speed of vaccination campaigns make forecasts difficult, Polyvia expects tensions to ease in several markets, particularly as production is ramping up in Asia. To be continued!"
Yonwoo invests in more eco-friendly airless packaging solutions,"""At Yonwoo we firmly believe that 'green solutions' must not be only 'eco-friendly' but also 'user friendly'. Meaning we want both our customers and users to get familiar with the eco-routine through intuitive and easy-to-use products,"" explains Joong-hyun Ki, CEO and President of Yonwoo. The Korean manufacturer took an early interest in the issue. As soon as 1997, the company started a study on safe material sources and processing methods for recycled and bio-degradable plastics. In 2009, Yonwoo developed the Paper Blow (overcap and bottle covered by recyclable paper), and in 2013, the first prototype of their 'One Material' airless pump. Today, very methodically, Yonwoo continues its efforts to develop ""green solutions"" based on the '3-R' (Reduce / Refill / Recycle): – Reduce: From the conceptualization of the product, the aim is to minimize the weight and number of components, thus the plastic use. Yonwoo is also working on reducing their standard bottles thickness to progressively put the eco-responsibility at the centre of their whole portfolio. – Refill: Like other packaging manufacturers, Yonwoo is also developing ideas to reduce the plastic use through refill systems. ""For example by refilling once our 'Noble Cream Jar', you are reducing your plastic use rate by 95%,"" highlights Joong-hyun Ki. – Recycle: Last but not least, we are also working on the most recyclable products possible by minimizing and simplifying the materials. The group's greatest achievement yet is the One Material pump series : fully made of the same plastic family, our users won't need to waste sorting before throwing them away. ""We are also making progress with recycled materials such as PCR PP, PET, and also Bio-based PE for our increasing tubes volumes. We are currently finalizing the PCR and Bio PE materials tests; with promising results, they are expected for later this year,"" adds the President of the Korean group. Today, nine of Yonwoo eco-friendly products are certified by ECOCERT. While an airless pump is usually made of 9 or 10 pieces from different materials, including metal for the spring, Yonwoo developed the first airless pump prototype made of only PE and PP back in 2013. However, the Korean manufacturer had to face numerous challenges before making this pump to perform at the same level as a standard airless in terms of dosage, high viscosity formula pumping and leakage performance. In 2020 after years of improvements, Yonwoo engineers achieved to make it as perfect as their standard pumps. And they went even further by applying the same technology to the Presto Jar, a completely different type of packaging suited for even higher viscosity formula. Same success for the 2cc / 3cc pumps which provide the strongest and most efficient pumping performance, so as the versatile 0.20cc pump. Another recent development, the EZ series also demonstrates Yonwoo's expertise in making both eco and user-friendly products. The company simplified its conception as much as possible to reduce the plastic use, while its refilling gesture by simply turning the inner bottle base is intuitive. Optionnally, the overcap and the outer bottle can be produced in recycled PCR PET, and the refill cap and inner bottle in PCR PP. ""Of course, its airless pump is built on our best airless technology to perfectly protect the formula, even the preservative-free ones such as organic cosmetics,"" concludes Joong-hyun Ki."
Quadpack partners with Yuga to strengthen their China business,"As part of this agreement, Yuga will offer Quadpack's QLine range to brands seeking ""the quality, performance and distinction"" of packaging products designed and manufactured in Europe. A manufacturer of metal and plastic packaging based near Shanghai, Yuga has been an official supply partner for Quadpack since 2010 and produces a number of Q-Line references. The company has started promoting the Q-Line make-up range and will extend its actions to skincare from April. Yuga's commercial team will also sell Quadpack's wood packaging solutions and the Sulapac pack line, an eco-safe biocomposite material. The move into China is part of Quadpack's 2020-2025 business strategy, which sets out growth plans in each of its key territories of EMEA, the Americas and the Asia-Pacific region. It follows last year's opening of a sales office in Japan and the appointment of Raj Savji as Managing Director - Asia Pacific, to develop Quadpack's presence in the region. ""China's domestic beauty market is worth EUR 52.5 billion and growing fast. What's more, it has shown itself to be incredibly resilient. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 and the subsequent downturn, China has been the first to recover. The market is mature and our products are a great fit. We are fortunate to be able to build on our partnership with Yuga - a relationship based on high levels of trust, shared values and proven results - to accelerate our entry into this market,"" said Raj Savji. Q-Line is Quadpack's own portfolio of packaging solutions, which are conceived, designed and engineered in Europe. The products are made at the group's Louvrette factory in Germany and the Quadpack Wood factory in Spain, as well as at the facilities of selected regional partners like Yuga. With Yuga's industrial capacity, components can be stocked, assembled and decorated locally. This inherent flexibility of manufacture and supply allows Quadpack to remain agile and deliver solutions in the region, for the region. ""In that case, one plus one equalling greater than two. Just as Quadpack has extended our reach globally, our facilities can support Quadpack's growth. We also have 20 years of experience and a strong network in China and we are excited to introduce the Q-Line portfolio to local brands. The larger brands are going global and looking for high-end packaging solutions, particularly in the skincare segment. Those that are of European origin are sought-after commodities,"" said Victor Wu, Yuga's CEO."
Save resources with Glaspray's airless and spray cartridge refill system,"GoTwist is Glaspray's name and identity for twist-up packages for skincare and fragrance products. The product line follows the basic 3R principle of Reuse, Reduce and Recycle. A twist up package is equipped with a cartridge refill system, designed so that the inner bottle can be easily replaced once empty. The canister is reusable and yields a 66% reduction of plastics by weight in the Twist Up Airless (TUA) full plastic package. The cartridge replacement system means less impact on the environment by reducing the amount of material used. PCR material can also be added to the equation further adding to the sustainability of these product lines. Glaspray offers three main twist up packages, – TUA (Twist Up Airless): a patented system for cosmetic and skincare products. – TUD (Twist Up Dispenser): inner glass vials with more inert environment for sensitive bulk. – Twist and spray: refillable solution for fragrance, facial mist, setting spray and sanitation spray. Each of the packages come with aluminum outer shells as standard. Option materials include plastic, aluminum alloy and wood. All these materials can be further decorated. PCR content, components that are easy-to-separate and refillable packaging are among top requests for sustainable package. Glaspray's twist up dispensing solution is a good choice to fulfill these requests and retain brand identification at the same time. There are many new policies from the industry or brands being implemented on sustainable packaging, and are likely to change with time as we learn all the possibilities. As an innovator in refillable packages, Glaspray's goal is to provide solutions to our partners to achieve their guidelines and standards of sustainability towards a true circular economy."
Hygiene and skincare: When sustainability drives packaging innovation,"Stimulated by new generations aware of the need for more reasoned consumption, the beauty sector is reinventing itself with sustainable models focused on packaging's environmental impact and ""clean"" formulas. See below the example of five brands which emerged over the past few months on the initiative of young entrepreneurs determined to help consumers reduce the footprint of their beauty routines. Launched thanks to an Ulule crowdfunding campaign, La Crème Libre advocates refillable skincare with a concept focused on the choice of container and content. The idea is simple: an attractive jar made of natural concrete based on sand, cement, and water which can be refilled over and over with skincare capsules. ""Our bathrooms have become real supermarket departments, with a large quantity of visually polluting products. We aimed to transform cosmetic jars into decorative objects with several lives,"" explains Veronica Susman, co-founder of the brand, her first entrepreneurial experience. Consumers choose their own jar(s) among the eight colours available, and then the refill among the ten references of cleansers, exfoliators, makeup removers, and skincare products. Free from any controversial ingredient, the 100% natural products from France are designed for the whole family. The jars follow the same principles and are handmade by a craftsman in northern France. They are differentiating in that they are biodegradable, highly resistant, and completely based on natural materials, including pigments. The refill capsules made of biosourced plastic are available in different sizes: 50 ml for skincare products, 150 ml for cleansers. The choice is mainly based on the texture. Every product is available in at least two textures. The cleanser can be a powder or paste, the makeup remover a cream or balm, which turns into oil, and then milk in contact with water. The exfoliator can contain grains – almond shell – or be upgraded as a mask based on fruit acids to reveal radiant skin. The moisturizing/antioxidant cream offers the lightest to the richest textures with the same cocktail of actives. There is only one refill price - EUR 29.90 - whatever the capacity. Available for free during the launch period, the jars will cost EUR 19.90 for 50 ml, and EUR 29.90 for 100 ml. For now, the brand is only available online at lacremelibre.com but is considering joining selective distribution networks this year. A reference in skincare refills, Cozie (for Cosmétique Objectif Zéro Impact Environnemental in French), has defended a bulk model for three years in the face care segment. Consumers can take their bottles back to their stores to replace them with new products immediately refilled in a fountain, thanks to a patented technology. ""The ultimate solution consists in not generating any waste, so consumers should be able to refill their packaging,"" explains Arnaud Lancelot, one of the founders. The 'Dozeuse' (dispenser) installed at points of sale is fitted with several fountains containing different skincare and hygiene products with clean formulas. Every time a product is refilled, a specific label is printed with the batch number, the 'best before' date, and the volume chosen by the user. Each glass bottle is deposited and sent to an industrial cleaning facility to be made available again. Similarly to this startup, several other players have embraced the bulk model to better meet consumer expectations in all distribution channels: L'Occitane en Provence in their stores, L'Oréal Professionnel, with the Source Essentielle concept in hair salons, Mustela in pharmacies, Léa Nature in supermarkets… and the concept is becoming commonplace in perfume stores. To further spread this practice, CoZie offers their technology to all brands and distributors interested. In spring 2020, the brand 900.care founded by two thirty-year-old entrepreneurs also emerged on the market thanks to a new 'made in France' idea: containers to be kept and refilled with solid formulas. The brand developed three hygiene products: a shower gel in the form of a ball, toothpaste pastilles to crunch, and a stick deodorant. ""Let's take the example of a shower gel. We throw away our empty bottles to purchase exactly the same ones, only full. It is an absurd system,"" explains Aymeric Grange, co-founder of the brand. The non-logotyped bottles with a minimal design are half based on recycled plastic and recyclable, while made to last. The choice of partly recycled plastic is based on sustainable values: resistance over time, reuse of the virgin material, energy-efficient manufacturing, and a lighter weight, compared to glass and aluminium, for enhanced transport. Developed and made in France, the solid formulas contain 95% ingredients of natural origin and the specifications are focused on sensoriality and efficacy. With this concept, the entrepreneurs aim to reach what they call ""imperfect eco-warriors"": consumers who prefer clean solutions without changing comfort-related expectations – this consumer category is gaining importance. The range should soon be broadened to all bathroom essentials. With a range of about forty references, including hygiene, skincare and cleaning products, new brand What Matters created by Charlotte Catton and Franck Ladouce also banks on the easy-refill trend, without compromising on sensoriality. The bottles are made of glass secured with an exclusive industrial technology developed by glassmaker Verescence to make both beautiful and resistant everyday objects. The ecorefill pouches can be recycled and reduce plastic consumption by 80%. All products are made in France with at least 99% ingredients of natural origin certified organic, vegan, and clean by Cosmos and Ecocert. Refill orders are placed on the brand's website, in just a few clicks, so the basket is adapted to the whole family's needs, habits, and profiles. Once the right questions have been answered, the brand can give advice about the quantities needed and the date when the products will need to be refilled. This way, the delivery frequency is reduced, which is also more responsible. A mere text message reminds you of validating the restocking order, which can be modified until four days before the delivery. Apart from the boldest concepts, brands and suppliers are also focused on transforming the environmental profile of their packaging, without trying to revolutionize consumption habits too fast. This approach is less spectacular, but it can be adopted on a large scale. That is how several oral care giants chose Albéa's Greenleaf Generation 2 recyclable tubes, so the packs of billions of toothpaste tubes used every year can be recycled at last. Following the example of the hygiene sector, the skincare segment has embraced this trend. In the US, the five founders of Ace of Air, who have launched a crowdfunding campaign, have devised a concept combining skincare and food supplements in containers which can be returned, re-refilled, recycled, and composted.

Woodacity: Quadpack's full-wood line of closure systems for fragrance and skincare,"While wood-based closure systems have incomparable aesthetic qualities and offer good sustainability benefits, most of them are multi-material solutions, a characteristic making them hard to recycle. However, several full-wood solutions are now emerging with the promise of fully natural and biodegradable zero-plastic solutions. Quadpack Wood, for instance, has just introduced the first items of their Woodacity range, a full-wood patented solution combining durability and innovation: three monomaterial caps for fragrance and skincare. ""Wood is technically challenging. A natural material with a well-known elasticity and water permeability, it's almost impossible to be used as a beauty packaging component without a plastic insert. Until now,"" explains the company in a statement. In order to remove all plastic parts from the caps, a team of designers, engineers and technicians investigated the material in different conditions, shapes and combinations. Their aim was to obtain from wood the same functional properties and stability as plastic. All stages of the manufacturing process have been redesigned, starting with the creation of controlled conditions for the drying, shaping and lacquering of the wood ""Woodacity is a project that seemed impossible a few years ago, and it's now a reality. It's a full wood innovation that brings sustainable added-value to beauty brands,"" celebrates Pierre-Antoine Henry, Quadpack's Head of Categories. The first three items of the Woodacity family include: – Solo Snap: A globally patented snap-on cap with a unique pattern of interior ribs providing safety closure to the formula with a 'click'. – Solo Push: A friction fit cap with a unique pattern of interior ribs, Solo Push provides safety closure to the formula with a smooth gesture. – Solo Turn: A full-wood thread cap with no plastic insert and a perfect match to Regula Glass, Quadpack's line of stock glass jars. The three caps are made in Europe with wood sourced from sustainably-managed forests. New developments are on the way, including Quadpack's own Q-line products that will have full-wood versions available. ""Woodacity is a new way of looking at wood innovation. Our goal is to have our wood products to be either mono-material, refillable or easily disassembled,"" concludes Pierre-Antoine Henry. Enough to improve the environmental profile of the entire pack!"
HCT creates a new generation of tubes with their Crimpless technology,"Launched at the end of 2020, under the name CLT (which stands for Crimpless Tube Technology), HCT's new tube collection has been designed as a way to stand up above the limitations of typical tubes by unlocking new aesthetic possibilities and functionalities. ""No longer restrained by 2D crimped ends, Crimpless Tube Technology revolutionizes the form and design of tubes,"" explained the company in a statement. Tubes can therefore stand like bottles while being more flexible than a regular bottle. Like tubes they allow a thicker formula to be dispensed. HCT's patent pending Crimpless solution also offers exactly the same decoration options as those of traditional tubes. It is also possible to emboss/deboss a logo, texture or pattern. Otherwise, a unique shape can be applied on the ends for an elevated and coherent brand image throughout the packaging. It is also possible to create multifunctional packaging by adapting different application methods on both ends sharing the formula. Crimpless Tubes are offered in various sizes in single, multi-layer or polyfoil tubes for optimal compatibility with the formulation."
Steklarna Hrastnik taps into the luxury market with a sustainable approach,"Premium Beauty News - How did you manage your transition to the luxury market, in particular for perfumes? Peter Cas - Our decision to enter to the luxury perfume market was based on the added value we can offer to our customers and our main competitive advantages: glass purity, exceptional flexibility as regards quantity and our capacity to produce the most technically demanding shapes. Over the past three years, all our investments were focused on improving our production activities and management to consolidate and increase our position in the luxury segment. For example, three years ago, we set up a five year roadmap for our Industry 4.0 transformation: it helps us significantly reduce time-to-market. It also guided us in our transition process from a general producer of tableware and packaging glass to specialist of packaging glass with technology recommendations. Today, our production capacities reach 285 tonnes of glass per day. All in all, our investment in this process amounted to 40 million euros, over three years. Premium Beauty News - Is it also a transition to a more environmentally friendly production? Peter Cas – Definitively! In 2020, we invested 26.2 million euros in our production capabilities. At the core of this investment is our new G furnace, which is based on the cleanest technology available today - the oxygen technology, which guarantees less energy consumption, but better productivity. Although production capacities increased, we prevented any additional environmental impact. In 2021, we will also finish our new on-site cryogenic oxygen plant, which will supply pure, sustainable oxygen for our new furnace. Sustainability plays a key role in our choices regarding production technologies. That is why we managed to reduce our CO2 emissions and energy consumption by 8% and 12%, respectively, in 2019, compared to 2015, while increasing our production capacities. In addition, three years ago, we started to develop the hydrogen technology as part of a pilot project. Last year, we became the first in our region to experimentally confirm the decarbonisation of glass melting with hydrogen obtained with renewable sources. The new G furnace is ready for this innovative technology. In the second production unit, the B furnace will be converted into a hybrid regeneration furnace, which will use 60% of green electricity. Both previously mentioned future low-carbon projects relating to the glass furnaces, will help replace our fossil fuel consumption by a third of green energy, increase the furnace's energy efficiency by 10%, and reduce our carbon footprint by a fifth by 2025. Premium Beauty News - Do you also apply this sustainable approach to your products? Peter Cas - Absolutely. In 2019, we also launched a pilot project focused on smart decoration and functionalization of glass products. A major aspect of the project involves eco design. As regards decoration, we aim to use only colours that do not contain heavy metals and to introduce organic additives for standard colours in order to make them more sustainable. Thanks to AI and augmented reality, which will be implemented, we will be able to closely monitor the whole process in order to optimize raw material consumption, like colours and solvents, as well as energy consumption. This project will be completed within two years. Premium Beauty News - Beside ecodesign, what are your innovation efforts focused on? Peter Cas - We developed smart packaging that creates direct contact between the shopper and the brand. Our smart bottles provide additional information that the brand choose to reveal to its consumers, like where was the specific fragrance made, which plant extracts it contains, etc. In addition, smart bottle also reduces the purchasing process time by making it possible for shoppers to access the brand's website when they want to reorder a product. Various features as sounds and colours may be added to the bottle during the promotion period so that it may pulsate according to music or change colour. Of course, the usefulness of additional functionalities depends on the fragrance itself. Despite the fact that the smart bottle is bearing the an electronic tag, it may be easily recycled. Yes, even here, our focus on sustainability remains present. Premium Beauty News - What are your expectations for 2021? Peter Cas - Forecasts are very dificult as the market remains unpredictable due to the current health situation. As regards the market demand, we foresee a tough first semester, but it should be followed with a strong increase, once vaccination campaigns will have led governments to lighten sanitary precautionary measures. Nevertheless, thanks to our capacity to serve targeted customers with adapted services and the best products in their category, we believe our growth and market shares will keep rising. Now, as for the distribution of standard and personalized products, we aim to keep increasing the standard part. The new shapes of different sizes and the new volumes for existing shapes will significantly help us to fulfil this objective."
Aptar develops an airless roll-on capsule for Lightinderm skincare device,"As beauty consumers increasingly seek dermocosmetic solutions for their daily skincare needs, devices that deliver salon-quality skincare treatments at home have boomed as a category. Taking inspiration from dermatological treatments, the Lightinderm skincare device was launched after 7 years of research and development within the auspices of Paris Santé Cochin - Europe's largest start-up incubator in the health sector located within the Hospital Cochin in Paris, France. The device uses the beneficial effects of certain wavelengths of light to treat the skin. ""While light contains potentially dangerous UVA and B, its spectrum also contains certain wavelengths capable of a in depth and powerful stimulation of the skin's self-repair processes. By selecting these wavelengths and associating them, it is now possible to go further than traditional cosmetics in order to treat a whole series of skin problems that have been poorly addressed so far"", explained Géraldine Decaux, founder of the brand. The device uses three types of regenerative light to transform and activate the encapsulated photo-active serums to trigger the skin's deep regeneration and rejuvenation mechanisms, when applied. Within the device, the airless roll-on capsule enables secure housing and delivery of different formulas according to the customer's preference and skincare requirements. For more than two years, Aptar Beauty + Home has developed for Lightinderm a removable capsule system with a personalized design. Inside the capsule, which has a guaranteed seal, is an airless piston designed exclusively for Lightinderm. One of the main technical challenges was also to combine materials resisting to the impact of light rays while being able to diffuse them effectively, so as to activate the active ingredients contained in the serum, while offering a food or medical quality grade compatible with the different formulas. After extensive laboratory and industrial testing, the designers hit on three materials - the combination of which remains a tightly guarded secret - for the final airless roll-on capsule, which is fully recyclable. The recharge capsule consists of three parts made by Aptar, combined with the glass roller ball through which the light passes as it evenly distributes the formula and mechanically massages the skin. ""The technical achievement of creating an airless roll-on capsule was made possible thanks to the cutting-edge technologies and expertise across various disciplines present at Aptar's industrial sites across France. Aptar's capacity for next-level research and large-scale testing, undertaken in close collaboration with the client, was key to producing this revolutionary product for Lightinderm,"" said Aptar Beauty + Home in a release."
French packaging and perfumery students reinvent fragrance testing (2/2),"For this year edition, under the sponsorship of Coty, five teams mixing students from ESEPAC and ESP have considered new solutions to facilitate in-store perfume testing and the distribution of samples while taking into account the current health context. The five teams presented all the technical aspects of their projects during a videoconference, thus allowing the jury [1] to assess the aesthetics, but also the functionality and the feasibility of the proposals. ""We were presented 5 innovative projects. The brief was fully respected and the solutions presented were of high quality. The highly detailed projects revealed very specific technical aspects, but also interesting marketing concepts,"" underlines Vincent Delavenne, Vice-President Coty Luxury Packaging. From January, the 5 projects will be progressively unveiled on the social networks of the ADF & PCD and PLD tradeshow. The winning project will be officially presented at the ADF & PCD and PLD Paris exhibition on June 22 and 23, 2021 during the PCD Innovation Awards ceremony. The 5 projects will also be visible on the joint ESEPAC & ESP stand during the Paris trade fair. After having presented two first projects last week, we continue the preview with the three following candidates. SAFE TOUCH Built with sustainable materials, this honeycomb structure offers a new way of testing perfumes, as well as solid or liquid cosmetics. It allows to discover the packaging, try the product on a blotter or extend the experience by applying it to the skin. OSMOBOX This modular testing system for perfumes is made from materials that can be dissociated from each other and reused to minimize the impact on the environment. Scent diffusion is controlled by a contactless movement sensor. The various Osmobox elements can be combined endlessly to create a test structure adaptable to all perfumeries. BEADSTHOVEN The Beadsthoven project wants to reintroduce emotion into perfume testing, thanks to ""perfume organs"" filled with colored and biodegradable perfume beads. This is a complete staging of the point of sale. The two other projects can be viewed here."
"A specialist in injected plastic parts, Albéa Plouhinec is reinventing itself","Behind face masks, lips require less make-up. But if the lipstick market is looking a bit dull for the time being, this does not mean the recognised expertise in the area of the Plouhinec site of the Albéa Group - mechanism and decorative parts - is not called upon for beautiful projects which fit in with circular economy. One of them is a 100% single-material packaging with recycled plastic for a brand of vegetable cosmetics, and the other is a refillable lipstick for a prestigious make-up brand. Supported by state-of-the-art equipment, its expertise in plastic injection, which can be used in many markets outside the make-up sector, is made available for any demanding company looking for an industrial partner combining quality, flexibility, responsiveness and agility. An opportunity that was seized by a young company in the health sector. When NG Biotech, the Breton company specialised in serological tests and a pioneer and leader in rapid bioanalytical tests, received approval from the Haute Autorité de Santé (French National Authority for Health or HAS) for its serological test, it chose to favour short circuits for the moulding of the plastic parts required for its various rapid diagnostic tests. Looking for a local supplier, it contacted the Breton Albéa site in mid-November. Both companies share the same industrial values and the same quality standards. From then on, everything went very quickly. Four weeks later, the first complete mould (16 cavities) was validated with the printing of several indications needed to carry out the test. An agreement was given to produce 3 million units. The machines started manufacturing a few days before Christmas and the entire order will be delivered in less than 3 months. ""The mobilisation of the teams - the site works 7 days a week - demonstrates the desire to promote the excellence of Brittany's production with the advantage of offering the customer the assurance of also reducing the transport-related environmental impact,"" reports Cyrille Guégan, Director of Albéa Plouhinec. Benefiting from high-performance machines that ensure competitiveness, industrial efficiency and very high quality, the site adapts its environment to the safety requirements that a new manufacturing process entails; for instance, the entire production line for NG Biotech test cases, including the packing stage, is fully automated. With 50 presses from 30 to 450 tonnes that accept all materials, especially new recycled materials, and nearly fifty machines for decoration, finishing (varnishing, lacquering, screen printing, etc.) and for precision assembly (ultrasonic welding, clipping), Albéa Plouhinec can produce from the simplest to the most complex parts, assembled and decorated at high speeds, in small or large runs (several million). Most of the machines have an integrated automatic camera control system and every production run comes with a quality report. ""We can manage a project from A to Z - from the design or eco-design to the delivery of the approved finished product,"" explains Cyrille Guégan. ""Thanks to our 3D printers, we can validate a concept in 48 hours. Like, for example, making a plastic shape impression in a metal mould. With this rapid prototyping, the customer saves time and costs. The site is also the group's 3D mock-up and prototyping centre."" The commitment to public health of the Plouhinec site also illustrates the ability of the women and men who work there to adapt to other potential markets such as medical, hygiene and cleanliness, the environment, as well as electronics and the automotive industry. This team of 230 people is also proud to defend Made in France know-how. The recent investment in two extrusion blow-moulding machines with in-line screen printing also opens up markets in the area of FMCG in cosmetics and beyond. Companies in the food sector, who favour short circuits and Made in France products, are currently evaluating the possibilities that the Breton site's expertise could offer them. In cosmetics, the plant is about to produce 200 ml bottles made of 100% recycled food-grade plastic for a natural and responsible skincare brand. The industrial excellence that motivates all employees daily goes hand in hand with respect for the environment. This leads the company to make eco-friendly counter-proposals - from the sourcing of the plastic material to the delivery of the finished product, including all stages of its processing. ""Since 2017, the plant has been reducing its energy consumption by 10% per year. Equipped with heat recovery heating, it declares a neutral impact of atmospheric emissions, and has adopted a recovery approach for all its waste,"" says its director. A true industrial partner at the service of the customer, Albéa Plouhinec is also fully dedicated to young people and the disabled. ""The societal commitment of employees is a value of sharing, which has been rooted for more than 40 years in the culture of the company,"" details the manager. Benefiting from a continuous training process and a management system in which well-being on the workplace is considered one of the pillars of quality of life, each year the teams pass on their knowledge and passion for producing while respecting the planet's resources, to more than 20 young people on a work-study basis. This commitment also applies to the integration of people with disabilities, either within the company or via adapted sub-contracting workshops, placing the company well above the legal threshold of 6%. ""Albéa Plouhinec is a trustworthy partner to efficiently and passionately lead any development project that promotes Made in France and favours short circuits while respecting societal and environmental values,"" underlines Cyrille Guégan."
Biotherm tests its first in-store refill technology,"""The Life Plankton Elixir Blue Fountain represents Biotherm's obsession to constantly better our processes and improve our packaging and formula to minimize our environmental footprint, and more specifically our impact on water and aquatic life,"" explains Giulio Bergamaschi, Biotherm Global President Some startups, such as French-based Cozie, have already developed refill solutions suitable for skin care products. But with this new pilot project, the L'Oréal-owned brand wanted to use the refill technology ""to create a unique and immersive consumer experience."" To address the cleanliness and hygiene challenges specific to skin care, Biotherm and Possible Future have opted for a three-step process: 1. Clean: Life Plankton Elixir's glass bottle is cleaned with water and completely emptied of any residue. The bottle is then dried with filtered air before being sterilized with UV light. 2. Refill: The bottle is placed on the refill set and filled anew with Life Plankton Elixir serum from a rechargeable tank. 3. Customize: The bottle is custom-engraved with a wave motif, symbolizing its regeneration and indicating how many times the bottle has undergone the refill process. The process takes place in front of consumers' eyes, with the help of a specially trained Beauty Advisor. ""This immersive experience marries a standard of excellence with technological performance to further Biotherm's commitment to helping save our planet,"" highlights the brand. The Life Plankton Elixir Blue Fountain not only prevents the formula to be contaminated during refilling operations, but also protects its fragile active ingredients, including the Life Plankton™ probiotic (5%), the hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. The aim is, of course, to reduce packaging waste. Already made of 25% recycled glass, the overall environmental footprint of the Life Plankton Elixir's bottle can now be reused. ""We can't use things and throw them away. We need to recycle. And, believe me, changing the industry is not easy,"" adds Giulio Bergamaschi. The solution also helps the brand to strengthen and enrich its relationship with its most loyal consumers during refill operations, while providing them with a unique experience."

The three remaining projects will be unveiled next week. SCENTER Inspired by the olfactometer, the SCENTER is a contactless solution, which faithfully restores the fragrance. It allows consumers to smell the product as well as get information and leave with a sample. The perfume can also be applied to the skin, always without contact. The SCENTER can be displayed in stores but also in the street, it is versatile enough to meet the needs of both brands and retailers. Indeed, several SENTERS can be combined to form a SCENTHUB. LE PARFUM SANS CONTACT (THE NON-CONTACT PERFUME) This solution retains the traditional gestures of the test with application on blotter strips. It consists of a contactless perfume dispenser, featuring a transparent for displaying an original bottle. Consumers just need to pass a blotter or their wrist in front of the detector, and the perfume is sprayed automatically. The blotter strips can also be distributed automatically. To be continued..."
"Refocused on beauty, PSB Industries wants to accelerate Texen's growth","For several years, right up until its recent divestment of its Healthcare & Industry division (Plastibell), PSB Industries has centered its strategy around Texen, its Luxury & Beauty division. The shift was initiated in 2017 with the sale of the Fine Chemicals division (Baikowski). Then, in 2018, the group sold its Agri-Food & Distribution division to Faerch Plast. Now acting as a financial holding company, PSB Industries intends to continue to push Texen's growth both organically and through new opportunities with a global leadership on the luxury and beauty packaging market thanks to a positioning centered around the environmental transition. ""The environmental transition is no longer up for debate. Following a global strategic review, we have repositioned the company in order to rise to the challenges based on a single mission: transforming matter into experience in a virtuous way. We will invest and seize opportunities to allow Texen to push the product and consumer experience in a sustainable manner, contributing to the circular economy,"" François-Xavier Entremont, President of PSB Industries, said in a statement. [For instance, Texen recently signed a non-exclusive partnership agreement with Roctool to use their ultra-fast heating and cooling technology of plastic injection moulds and tools.->https://www.premiumbeautynews.com/en/texen-uses-roctool-s-technology,17354] The company wants to use this technology with recycled materials in order to reduce the environmental impact of plastic packaging, while respecting the expectations of beauty brands regarding quality and aesthetics. Beyond environmental issues, Texen also intends to rely on a global, robust and homogeneous industrial platform. The company currently employs 1,200 people spread over eight production sites in Europe, the United States, Mexico and China, and three sales and trading offices, which are themselves in relation with numerous partners in Asia. This tool will be focused on innovation, with a priority given to a package's function and usage and the esthetic and emotional experience it offers. This implies ""a quest for quality, the internalization of high added-value expertise and new technologies, notably inspired by other markets and segments,"" the company highlighted. To carry out this roadmap, Texen's new executive committee is now led by Rémi Weidenmann, Managing Director, who joined the group in 2014. Furthermore, a new duo made up of Pierre-Yves Quéfélec, Senior Vice President of Sales, Marketing and Innovation, and Christophe Cabut, Senior Vice President of Operations, in charge of all the company's manufacturing facilities, is joining the company. ""We have formed a young and self-sufficient team capable of facing up to the challenges and disruptions our sector is facing,"" said Rémi Weidenmann."
Quadpack aims for Top 5 of European cosmetics packaging suppliers,"With several recent purchases, including German company Louvrette in 2019, Quadpack managed to integrate the Top 10 of beauty packaging suppliers in Europe and reach, the same year, a turnover of 131 million euros, i.e. 25% more than in 2018. Focused on both in-house manufacturing and sourcing, the group's hybrid business is structured around three sites dedicated to plastic injection moulding, wood activities, and decoration in Spain, Germany, and the US. Now well-established in Europe, the company meets the market demand with a local offering, shorter lead times and a well-controlled carbon footprint. Quadpack is mainly present in skincare, which accounts for 65% of their customers, makeup (25%), and perfume (10%). The current portfolio includes multiple solutions meeting brands' expectations, from airless development expertise, with Korean company Yonwoo, to green solutions based on cork or wood – the group is now a leader on this market – and ecodesigned airless ranges, jars and packs made with recycled materials, thanks to Louvrette's expertise. The German company's flagship line, Regula Jar, completed the catalogue and was lightened in accordance with the group's Positiv Impact strategy. The idea is to develop lighter products, both in terms of weight and material, while keeping the same sizes with recycled and recyclable materials. This line has also been broadened with PET PCR-based refills. New refill solutions are also under study for airless ranges. Today, sustainability is one of the five pillars of the Quadpack group's strategy, together with global expansion, agility, collaborative innovation, and workplace optimization. In light with these objectives, an agreement was signed in 2019 with Finnish startup Sulapac specialized in alternatives to plastic for the development of an exclusive line of sustainable jars and caps. Of course, like the market as a whole, the group had to deal with a slowdown due to the global 2020 crisis, but they are now ready and well-prepared for recovery, driven by new consumer expectations, Quadpack CEO Tim Eaves explains."
Hygiene-beauty bulk products: How to keep a clean container-content couple,"This approach to selling involves containers that can be refilled several times for the same use, and it has already implemented in all distribution channels: stores specialized in bulk and/or organic products, of course, but also brands' own networks (L'Occitane en Provence), professional networks, like hair salons (L'Oréal Professionnel's Source Essentielle concept), convenience stores, pharmacies (Mustela), supermarkets (Léa Nature...), and mixed channels chosen by startups (Panier des Sens, CoZie, Respire, 900.care…). However, safe reuse of the same container requires ""a traceability and industrial cleaning system,"" explains Citeo, the company specialized in packaging recycling. The objective is to guarantee the container/content couple hygiene. To avoid multiplying cleaning protocols, in 2019, the French professional association Réseau Vrac, which federates 1,500 members, including 560 distributors, set up a working group in partnership with the Cosmebio association, the Edencos cosmetology company, and the Ecocert body as regards material expertise. They aim to define standard cleaning protocols (cleaning, disinfection…) adapted to the different product types. ""Indeed, the protocols vary according to the types of cosmetics – rinse-off products, like shower gel and shampoo, or leave-on products, like creams, oils, and micellar water – and to the materials used for the containers,"" explains Lucia Pereira, Director of Legal Affairs of Réseau Vrac. ""Other than bottles and jars, tests are also performed on packs fitted with a pump or cardboard lids. As regards the materials we assess with an Ecocert expert, we selected PET, PEHD, glass and aluminium. We test the stability and safety of products packed in cleaned, disinfected reusable containers in accordance with the protocols defined."" The test results of the first phase were expected for late 2020. Ten companies joined the working group, including Jean Bouteille. As they are present in all distribution channels with their fountain, they want a standardized cleaning protocol for the whole chain. Since the company was founded in 2014, they equipped 400 points of sale with their bathroom solutions (liquid soap, shower gel, shampoo). Right now, they outsource packaging cleaning, but in 2021, they aim to acquire their own cleaning station in the French northern city of Lille. Then, they will develop this solution across the country. If they had initially selected reusable PET bottles (50 ml or 1 L), they eventually chose glass – the container range should be available in early 2021. ""This way, they can be reused even more often and a deposit system will be adopted,"" says Marketing & Communication Director Manon Carpentier. In the 53 points of sale where their dosing pump is installed, CoZie, finalist of the Citeo 2018 Circular Challenge, retrieve bottles and ship them to their own cleaning station in the Paris region, which is fitted with their own equipment. They are now considering creating new cleaning stations. CoZie chose glass for their products (face care, liquid toothpaste and sun milk). ""It is the best material as regards cleaning and drying. It is an inert material, so it guarantees the safety of our leave-on products,"" justifies Arnaud Lancelot, co-founder of the young company. And he is quite confident about the risk of breakage: ""so far, none of our customers has reported any problem"". But the company is now considering broadening their offering to soap and shampoo, so they are thinking about the use of these products and polling their customers to ""study other materials"". According to Vincent Joffre, Sales Director of PRP Création, a company specialized in plastic packaging, ""bottles intended for bulk products should satisfy three criteria: have a large opening to make cleaning and drying easier and faster, be made with strong materials to resist industrial cleaning and multiple rotations, and be transparent to validate the products' condition."" The company has just developed a range of three standard bottles (250, 400, 500 ml) that meet these criteria. Other than a large neck (38.400 for a 31 opening), they selected a co-polyester base for resistance to cleaning, Tritan by Eastman, and Total's PP Lumicene, which boasts good organoleptic properties, for the transparency criterion. PRP Création offers bottles with standard caps, dispensing caps, or pumps, and markets them starting from a minimum quantity of one packaging unit for standard bottles, and 5,000 units for customized pieces. As bulk products are gaining ground, it will be crucial to communicate with consumers to achieve zero risk with sensitive products. In this respect, the increasingly successful refill solution appears as an interesting alternative. PRP Création has developed a dual solution: a doypack-bottle fitted with a head and cap. The bottles are made of PET, R-PET, PP or PE and the packs are composed of a PET/Aluminium or PET/PE complex, or only of PE. ""This way, the brand can be sure consumers will fill in their bottles with the refills, which can be customized,"" says Vincent Joffre. Since the need for reassurance about hygiene emerged with the Covid-19 pandemic, consumers and distributors have definitely not lost interest in bulk products, especially in supermarkets. But no doubt their boom will compel everyone to pay particular attention to these issues."
P&G partners with Albéa to launch recyclable toothpaste tubes,"A few months after a similar announcement by Henkel, Procter & Gamble (P&G) is committing to switch their toothpaste tubes to recyclable HDPE tubes. The transition will start in January 2021 with the Crest and Oral-B global oral care brands and Blend-a-med in Europe. The full conversion of is expected by 2025 in North America and Europe. ""Toothpaste tubes are used by millions of consumers every day; however, its multi-material construction poses a challenge for recycling facilities around the globe. The solution to this is the HDPE – High-Density Polyethylene – tube, which provides the same product protection as current tubes, and which has been certified by North American and European recycling bodies to be compatible with existing recycling technologies. These HDPE tubes can be recycled where collection programs exist,"" explained P&G. Procter & Gamble is in discussions with several HDPE tube suppliers and has already reached an agreement with Albéa to start using its proprietary Greenleaf Generation 2 tube technology. Albéa's Greenleaf Generation 2 tubes are the first to be recognized as recyclable by the APR (Association of Plastic Recyclers) in North America and by RecyClass and SUEZ.circpack in Europe. ""These certifications confirm that the tubes can be recycled within the existing HDPE bottles recycling streams,"" said Albéa. To earn the APR recognition, Albéa Group had to demonstrate that its tubes could be converted into quality post-consumer HDPE resin that could then be reused to make new plastic bottles. RecyClass, an independent cross-industry European platform, certifies that Procter & Gamble's toothpaste tube is compatible with HDPE recycling and that the whole packaging (with its cap) does not have a negative impact on the European HDPE container recycling. ""Toothpaste tubes are not largely recyclable today; with the RecyClass certification for Albéa's Greenleaf Generation 2 technology used by P&G, however, we are on the right track towards increasing both the design for recycling awareness for tubes as well as increasing recycling quality and rates for the HDPE rigids stream in Europe,"" highlighted Paolo Glerean, RecyClass Chairman. In addition, SUEZ.circpack has tested the sortability of Procter & Gamble's tubes, confirming that the tubes will flow into the correct stream and be recycled with the HDPE materials. ""Our leading oral care brands touch millions of people around the world. This new packaging innovation will contribute to making the toothpaste tubes recyclable at scale in existing recycling streams, hence reducing our footprint and striving for circular solutions. It's no longer about if or what we can do, but how quickly we can do it,"" concluded Virginie Helias, P&G's Chief Sustainability Officer. In February, Colgate-Palmolive launched its first HDPE toothpaste tube. The launch of these HDPE tubes by major oral care players will thus enable millions of households to recycle their toothpaste packaging in existing recycling channels."
Heinz Glas commits to sustainable future with new generation,"Founded in 1622 and still in the hands of the Heinz family, Heinz Glas is now a major player of the global glassmaking industry in the cosmetics and perfume sector. Present in 13 countries, the group counts five production sites, 7 furnaces, and 27 lines for a production capacity of 542 tonnes a day. These plants are mainly based in Germany, but also in Poland, Peru, and India. In addition, Heinz Glas stands out thanks to a broad range of decoration techniques used on several sites. Plus, they are specialized in plastic packaging production, in particular perfume caps, so their customers enjoy a comprehensive solution. Thanks to these two activities, they are expecting a 329-million-euro turnover for 2020, for a sales force of 3,200 employees all around the world. Over the past two years, Heinz Glas has made various investments: the company purchased French glassmaker Saverglass's cosmetics and perfume division, constructed a new furnace in Poland to meet the rising demand for standard bottles, and, most importantly, an electric furnace powered with renewable energies at their main site in Kleintettau, Germany. The electric furnace will be operational starting from 2021. Heinz Glas aims to further reduce their environmental impact: they have made various investments over the past few years to substantially reduce CO2 emissions at every phase, from production to the finished product. ""Our objective is to become the most sustainable company of our industry. So, we continuously reduce our resource consumption,"" says Carletta Heinz. To highlight this commitment, Heinz Glas has developed the MultiGen concept, a combination of various improvement solutions aimed to produce ecoresponsible glass by using renewable energies, systematically lightening glass weight, and integrating recycled materials. The MultiGen Air option is focused on greener production processes, with electricity derived from renewable energies in Germany, Poland, and Peru, the new electric oven, and electricity-based plastic production, which will save 30% energy, compared to hydraulic power. MultiGen Feather plays on lightened design, and MultiGen Fire involves using PCR for glass and plastic. MultiGen Rainbow puts an emphasis on sustainable decoration processes, and MultiGen Circle consists in using recycled materials or materials derived from biomass (caps). According to Heinz Glas, these significant investments and innovations are justified by the growing part glass will represent in the cosmetics and perfume industry. Indeed, with its green virtues, this high quality material appeals to both young generations and brands in search of sustainable solutions. In fact, the company has been increasingly successful with standard ranges and their lightened equivalents for bottles and skincare. Innovations are also in line with digital and personalization trends, in particular the Times Square bottle launched in 2018. This ""smart"", refillable bottle with a removable digital screen offers unique personalization options involving videos, pictures, and information. And Amaz'n'Gaze gives access to the information, videos, or messages desired by simply scanning the bottle's decoration. Personalization is also achieved through digital decorations with flocking, depth, or crackle effects. Only moderately affected by this year's global slowdown thanks to a parallel business in the spirits sector, Heinz Glas is confident for the future: the Chinese market has started to recover, and they are planning to open a new production site there in 2022."
Baralan's strategy focuses on creativity,"Creativity is the magic of originality. It is the ability to go beyond, using imagination to give birth to endless possibilities and to develop new ideas capable of turning into concrete objects. Creativity is the combination of two essential elements: imagination and action. It means thus to innovate through a new perception which goes beyond the product itself. Imagination is at the base of the creativity and enthusiasm that Baralan applies in the continuous development of new ideas and innovative solutions. Baralan's motto is Cosmetic Packaging Solutions: the concept of solution clearly explains how Baralan supports its customers with the development of a project and the creation of complete packaging sets characterized by an original, eye-catching and contemporary design. Design is tangible imagination that goes beyond the limits of creativity. Therefore, Baralan's packaging is the result of a relevant creative process, of research, of experimentation and originality, and the result of an active listening to market requests, combining elements of functionality, aesthetics and usability. Starting from a simple sketch, Baralan experiments the most complex graphic processing and works in partnership with the key players of its value chain to realize its own products. The constant comparison with specialized teams sets the base to create reliable, versatile and quality sets of packaging, studied in every detail with related accessories. The creative driver turns out to be thus a fundamental feature for Baralan. Creativity is the art of choosing and, for Baralan, it is expressed also by the endless possibilities to personalize a packaging. This is done through the development of a customized design as well as an endless variety of decorating techniques. Design has multiple features: it is expressed through the study of shapes and sizes, but also through the innovation of materials and of the accessories studied for different intended uses. Linear and rounded shapes that express elegance and sophistication, are alternated with rectangular and squared shapes that give modernity and appeal to the product. A visual appeal which comes also from the creative details of the finishes obtained through various decoration techniques and from the choice of colors that allow to switch from the delicate effect of frosting to solid colors, or from simple transparency to soft shades. From glossy to matt, from opaque to degradé, from metallic to the most varied shades of colors: there are many possibilities to make each product unique and precious, personalized in every detail. First of all, varnishing that thanks to its versatility ranges from glossy to opaque, from full color to degradé. Metallization however, shiny or matte, never goes out of style and it is synonymous of prestige and high quality, reaching its climax with gold and silver brightness that create an elegant and refined effect. A delicate satin effect is instead the result of frosting, a simple but timeless treatment. Baralan's added value however is not limited to colors or decorations' finishing: the surfaces of the products are enriched also thanks to sophisticated techniques, such as silk-screening and hot stamping, that characterize the product with logos or texts transforming it in a finished packaging, ready to contain and protect the cosmetic formula for Skincare, Make Up or Fragrance. Creativity means thinking out of the box and seeing the world in a different way to make the difference. When creativity turns on, ideas come alive and the result is a packaging which amazes and fascinates. For Baralan, being creative means to have the ability to go beyond the ordinary and to develop products with the right balance between experience and innovation."
Sustainability: Cosmogen tubes and bottles now have removable applicators,"""Cosmetic application is a niche market, but the niche is endless,"" says Priscille Caucé, CEO of Cosmogen. Appointed at the head of the company last year ago, her mission was to boost the company growth by building up on innovation and CSR. As a first step, she set up an innovation department, bringing together marketing and engineers. Then, an innovation charter was implemented, requiring that 100% of Cosmogen's innovations comply with at least one of the 5Rs: Reduce, Recycle, Renew, Refill, Reuse. ""The goal is to quickly upgrade to two,"" says Priscille Caucé. The company has also started the relocation of its supply chain and production capabilities. ""When customers require it, we can now produce in Brazil and Europe with several industrial partners,"" explains the manager. As for Cosmogen's production partners in Asia, they are ISO 14001 certified. Similarly to all other companies in the industry, Cosmogen is also exploring the most sustainable material solutions. ""However, we're not at all bashing the use of plastic"", insists Priscille Caucé. The company's priority is to promote alternative solutions, in particular recycled materials, allowing to move forward on the path to sustainability while meeting the expectations of brands and customers. To that end, Cosmogen has successfully secured its PCR supplies. With eco-responsibility in mind, Cosmogen therefore adapted its main ranges of tubes and bottles with removable and reusable applicators. With Tint'N Reuse the company thus allows to keep the brush and to replace only the airless pump bottle, once empty. The formula is directly dispensed on the drop-shaped kabuki brush, then applied onto the face, before cleaning the brush after use. Launched last year for Tense tubes, the renewable applicator solution is now also deployed on the tubes of the company's iconic Squeeze'N range, which has been illustrative of Cosmogen's know-how in terms of innovative applicators for several years. ""The applicators are all removable, so they can be stored and reassembled on refills. This required the development of a specific refill tube,"" explains Justine Rechenmann, Product Manager at Cosmogen. Consequently renamed Squeeze'N Refill, the range, which is renowned for its patented On / Off closure system, now allows to keep the applicator - the true added value of the product - to recycle the empty tube and to replace it with a refill that consumes less material. The technology should soon be extended to the Needle Tube, a pack inspired by cosmetic surgery for ultra-precise application, whose ultra-thin aluminum cannula will also become removable. ""Depending on the formulas and the needs of the customers, the tubes can made in coex or single materials. Recycled materials can also be used,"" explains Maud Lelièvre, Marketing Director at Cosmogen. With their removable applicators, Cosmogen's range now fully take part of the 3R trend: Reuse, Recycle, Reduce."

Meiyume tackles plastic consumption with new aluminium packaging range,"With plastic being on everyone's radar, whether it be in the news or on our social feeds and consumers becoming more interested in conversations around plastic waste and plastic-free challenges, brands are being called upon to lead the way. Procter & Gamble, for instance, is preparing to launch refillable aluminium bottles in European markets in 2021 for its Head & Shoulders, Herbal Essences, Pantene and Aussie hair care brands. The group's aim is to reduce its overall consumption of virgin plastics. In that respect, Meiyume is launching the Infinite Aluminium range of bottles and jars. The aim is to provide beautiful, eco-friendly products that are thoughtfully designed to provide consumers and brands with alternative sustainable packaging options. ""Aluminium is one of the most recycled materials on the market today,"" explains Meiyume. ""Infinitely recyclable and highly durable, aluminium is 100 percent recyclable and retains its properties indefinitely in a true closed loop,"" the company adds. Despite the fact that producing aluminium requires a large amount of energy, it can be easily recycled with less than 10% of the energy needed to producing the initial material. ""Thanks to their durability, the aluminium containers are also the perfect solution for refillable concepts,"" adds Meiyume. Meiyume's Infinite Aluminium range includes both cosmetic bottles and jars. With bottle capacities from 100 to 250mL, and jar capacities from 60 to 80mL, the containers are compatible with most cosmetic formulas, whether cream, liquid, or gel. ""True to Meiyume's spirit of innovation, the team has found a way to craft the bottles and jars to give a smooth curvature bottom and a streamlined shape, achievements that are usually difficult to do with this type of material,"" details the company. A variety of pumps, caps and decoration options are available depending on the type of product. To address the latest consumer obsession for cleanliness, anti-microbial coating options are also available."
Procos targets luxury e-commerce growth with new premium green boxes,"As many countries in Europe implement new lockdown measures in an attempt to contain the second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak, brands and consumers are turning massively to e-commerce. To address the new demand, Procos introduces new shipping solutions with the Yoga and Yoga Light 2-in-1 folding boxes. The main difference between the two versions being their weight, as Yoga Light is about 20% lighter and about 5-6% cheaper. Procos' new shipment solutions consist of two parts each: – An outer shipping box made from corrugated cardboard, which remains discreetly simple with two adhesive strips on the top. However, the outer box can be customized on the inside with colors, patterns and prints. – An inner box in which the product is placed. The aim is to give this box the same value as a gift. It can therefore be customised at will, including through embossing, printing of photos and graphics, and matte or glossy finishes. With the gap between the functional simplicity of the outer shipping box and the elaborate appeal of the inner box, Procos wants to create a ""Wow"" surprise effect that transforms the experience of opening an online purchase. ""When opening the first shipping box and discovering the inner box, the consumer gets something very special. This moment becomes the first part of the product experience"", explains Stéphanie Havard, Operations Director at Procos. Procos wanted to provide brands with maximum flexibility for their e-commerce related operations. When delivered, these boxes arrive folded flat to save space. They can then be easily assembled and shaped for shipping to the consumer. To match the product, a wide range of sizes for folding boxes is available. Custom sizes are also possible. Yoga and Yoga Plus have also been designed to minimize the impact on the environment. Magnet and metal free, the boxes are only made from FSC-certified cardboard, a sustainable and 100% recyclable material. The Yoga Plus version has also been lightened to minimize the use of material and the energy required for transport. ""For 5,000 boxes, this represents up to 4 tons of CO2 saved,"" says Procos. Finally, depending on the needs of the brands, the boxes can be manufactured in Europe - in Germany or Bulgaria - or Chine. ""As part of our European Sourcing program, which was launched nearly two years ago, our strategy is to be able to manufacture competitively in Europe everything we produce in Asia. This is an asset in terms of the environment as well as in terms of flexibility,"" highlights Patrick Rissmann, Chief Business Development Officer at Procos."
"Ecoresponsible cosmetic packaging: very well, but how?","Is it more relevant to substitute plastic for glass? To choose refills? How to objectively analyse a product's carbon footprint? Are consumers ready to adopt lighter packaging? To answer these questions, brands need to adopt a global thinking approach and take into account available technologies, some of which have only just emerged. To help manufacturers in all beauty categories, Pascale Brousse and Gérald Martines, founders of the Trendsourcing agency and In•Signes, respectively, have conducted a pathbreaking study [1] which puts into perspective the various applications possible. As an introduction, the two experts warn about preconceived ideas. ""Plastic pollution has become much visible and is a real issue, but it should not mask the problem of climate change, which prevails over all others as regards systemic risks. As a matter of fact, materials considered less polluting, like glass and aluminium, actually emit a lot of greenhouse gases. It is the target that should be taken into account: all consumers are not ready for the same sacrifices,"" emphasizes Gérald Martines. ""We tried to explain that companies need to carry out a life cycle assessment and take into account all stakeholders. The first step consists in analysing all scopes in terms of sourcing, manufacturing, distribution, use…,"" adds Pascale Brousse. The study clearly shows the need to focus on the well-known three Rs: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. ""Provided they are taken in the right order. They are not on the same level. It is not because you choose one of them that you are over and done with the whole issue. Having recyclable packaging is not enough,"" highlights Gérald Martines. To start with, it is recommended to reduce anything unnecessary. ""We noticed that even luxury brands could lighten their packaging without compromising on desirability,"" note the two specialists. The notion of weight as a luxury marker seems to be losing ground to more uncluttered, minimalist versions. Other approaches aimed to simplify, lighten, or even remove secondary packaging should be mentioned, since the latter is widely perceived by consumers as ""overpackaging"". The second step consists in following the path of reusable packaging – the closest to the zero waste approach. ""If there is room for improvement, it is definitely in this field,"" explains Gérald Martines. Paradoxically, this approach puts the spotlight on the container. ""Why throw an object for which resources have been extracted and energy spent? We are re-adopting habits dating back to the 1950s – a form of country wisdom which involves not throwing an object with a value,"" he adds. This strategy is more or less easy to implement depending on the product categories. If things have already changed for perfumes and rinse-off products, skincare requires a longer transitional period. The study highlights initiatives like CoZie's, whose technology makes it possible to deliver skincare from fountains, and also via white labelling, as a first answer. ""The more brands will develop this model, the more economical it will be. We should bank on the fact that the bulk logistics chain will seduce many brands,"" says Pascale Brousse. In the meantime, the refill solution is finding its own place. ""It is better than throwing away the whole jar, but capsules and Doypacks remain single-use solutions. In addition, the strategy should be adapted to the target. Certain consumers, in particular in the luxury segment, are not particularly fond of the refill system. But of course, younger generations more sensitive to budget and environmental parameters will definitely adopt it. It is all about being in line with cultural changes,"" say the two experts. Again, the best is yet to come, with new technological developments which will eventually make it possible to recycle flexible bags – for now, these are based on plastic multi-layer materials. There is a last aspect to consider: the fact that packaging should be recycled. ""There are ecodesign recipes: packaging is not spontaneously recyclable, it should be designed accordingly. It should contain only one material or be easily separable, and above all, there should be a whole collection and sorting chain available. The European Directive will encourage this by imposing a double constraint by 2030: a minimum percentage of 50% recycled materials in packs, and the impossibility to market a pack for which there is no recycling chain. These two measures involving both upstream and downstream operations will help implement a circular economy,"" explain the study's authors. As regards plastic recycling, the study mentions various actions complementary to mechanic recycling, in particular enzymatic transformation, which is more natural and less energy-consuming, and above all, adapted to all types of materials for almost the same result as virgin plastic. Ultimately, as it is designed to be immediately applied to brands' needs, the study provides a broad portfolio of examples. ""It is a practical, pragmatic study filled with cases brands can draw inspiration from. They can just do their shopping,"" conclude Pascale Grousse and Gérald Martines."
P&G tackles plastic wastes with refillable aluminium shampoo bottles,"As several brands are experimenting with bulk sales and in-store refilling, P&G is choosing to supply those buying their shampoos with refillable aluminium bottles. The company plans to roll out the new bottles in Europe as of 2021 for Head & Shoulders, Pantene, Herbal Essences and Aussie brands. The 100% aluminium bottles will be refillable using refill pouches, made using 60% less plastic (per mL versus standard brand bottle, according to P&G). These pouches - the group's very first ones - can also be recycled, when they are collected and where local recycling facilities are available (which is not the case, for instance, in Belgium, Ireland, or Switzerland) The announcement was made at a live panel of sustainability experts at the Reuters Responsible Business Summit. The aim is to reduce plastic consumption. There is a huge potential since, according to P&G, 200 million households in Europe are using shampoos from one of their brands. In parallel with the launch of this refill system, P&G Beauty is on track to reduce virgin plastic usage by 50% in shampoos and conditioners bottles by the end of 2021 (compared to the level of 2016). According to the group's calculations, these initiatives will result in 300 million fewer virgin plastic bottles being produced yearly. ""We need to start turning the tide on the plastic waste crisis and there is no time to waste when it comes to protecting our planet,"" said Artur Litarowicz, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Haircare for P&G Europe. While recognizing that the launch of these reusable bottles and refills in 2021 is only the start, P&G believes this will contribute to making the reuse of packaging irresistible."
"""We have a radical thinking approach to packaging,"" Édouard Mauvais-Jarvis","Premium Beauty News - Given the emerging cosmetic packaging reduction expectations, what strategy do you think you will adopt? Édouard Mauvais-Jarvis - Nothing is easy in this field. There is no unique solution. We have defined an approach, which consists in thinking about the most relevant solutions depending on the uses of our different products. For example, for a bottle with a large capacity, like a cleanser, one solution could be to use a plastic material lighter than glass, derived from biosourcing or a recycled material, and which would be recyclable. Now, for more premium ranges, the products will remain quite heavy, but they will be refillable. We have chosen refillable packs for perfumes as well as makeup. Premium Beauty News - Will all Dior perfumes eventually be refillable? Édouard Mauvais-Jarvis - Having a very beautiful bottle and being able to refill it regularly is a real advantage when it comes to loyalty, and it is also a way to minimize the environmental footprint. I'm not saying we will do this in the short term, because it requires a number of changes, but we are trying to encourage these initiatives over time, wherever possible. Ecodesign offers other possibilities. We can also develop several sizes, like 100 ml or 30 ml travel products, and reduce glass weight in a few ranges. This solution helps reduce the source material's footprint, but also transport costs, the recycling load… Premium Beauty News - Do you think luxury consumers are willing to embrace these changes? Premium Beauty News - Édouard Mauvais-Jarvis - As regards lightening, there is a rather negative phase of surprise, because it questions established facts. It is this surprise phase everyone is afraid of. Whenever there is a real innovation, there is a risk of rejection at first. In fact, there will be a transitional period marked by two phenomena. On the one hand, consumers are used to a certain idea of luxury, and on the other, new luxury consumers have other priorities in mind: for them, new standards will prevail. There will be an inevitable cohabitation between ""old"" and ""new"" luxury. Premium Beauty News - Do you systematically have this whole reflection process upstream the development of a product? Édouard Mauvais-Jarvis - Absolutely. We do this for all our new projects: we have adopted a radical thinking approach to packaging. We aim to implement systematic improvement. Many disruptive projects are planned, and their launch depends on a few strategic choices related to the global sanitary situation. But we have already done a lot, like implementing a programme for reducing skincare packs by removing corrugated board and cellophane paper from almost 70 references. Over one production year, it represents enough packaging to wrap the Eiffel Tower. Global regulations also make things change for the best. Korean regulations set out limits in terms of secondary packaging, compared to primary packaging. China is also about to impose such reductions. All this will have an impact on our packs. Ten years ago, we also developed an environmental measuring tool for our products aimed to improve the average of all our products by 10%. And we have already doubled this objective. Premium Beauty News - Do you think the zero waste trend can apply to the luxury industry? Édouard Mauvais-Jarvis - The boom of digital technologies and e-commerce does not make it easy to reach a zero pack objective. It is hardly compatible, because you do need a container at some point. So, we will need to find a transposition of this to the luxury segment. Maybe it is the step that comes after refillability."
Stoelzle invests 20 million euros in its French site,"Stoelzle Glass Group intends to be ready for the market recovery! At a time when main glassmakers have slowed down their activity, the company has decided to invest nearly 20 million euros to rebuild the furnace at its production site located in Masnières, north of France. ""Even in these difficult times, our priority is to continue to invest in all of our sites. In France, the new extended furnace will allow us to maintain our position as a centre of excellence for the manufacture of high-end bottles and jars for international perfume and cosmetics industries,"" explains Étienne Gruyez, Chairman and CEO of Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie. Initially scheduled for the summer of 2020, the renovation was postponed to 2021 due to the crisis linked to the Covid-19 epidemic. Finally, the decision was made to take advantage of the current low industrial activity to undertake this key modernization. ""After contacting our suppliers, it appeared possible to start the furnace renovation in November, for it to be ready for production at the beginning of January 2021,"" adds Étienne Gruyez. For the moment, the entire industrial activity is idle. For the year 2020, the luxury and premium perfume market is expected to fall by 20 to 30% compared to the previous year, and a return to the 2019 level is not expected before 2022 or 2023. ""Today we have 4 to 6 weeks visibility on our production schedule, against 6 months before the crisis. The activity has slowed down considerably, all the brands have used up their stocks. As far as we are concerned, we expect a 20% to 25% drop for 2020,"" confirms the Head of Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie. For suppliers, it is difficult to predict how the market will react. If the end of the year - from the Black Friday promotions to the end of year holidays - could allow limiting the harm done, the low number of launches encourages us to put 2020 behind us. ""Our customers have delayed many budgets to 2021, especially for Mother's Day. We are counting on a real rebound in the second quarter of 2021,"" indicates Étienne Gruyez. ""But it is impossible to make more precise predictions, as there is still a lot of uncertainty. What is certain is that there is are significant changes in behaviours Increasing attention to environmental issues and an inexorable rise in digital technology. To attract customers who are staying at home, brands are once again turning to miniatures. The need to adapt to online sales will certainly give rise to important innovations."" With its new furnace and the concomitant installation of a fifth production line, Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie will increase its production capacity from 70 to 125 tonnes per day. ""In practice, this reconstruction is an opportunity to rethink a good part of the site. Beyond the increase in capacity, the whole investment was meant to also improve our energy efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of our production, from the purchase of latest generation machines to the installation of LED bulbs in workshops, including reducing air loss,"" emphasizes Étienne Gruyez. The new gas furnace for instance will be equipped with an electric booster, supplied with ""green"" electricity, allowing to reduce all emissions by 12%. Enough to further improve the glassmaker's proposals, that come with quotes on the environmental assessment of his offer, and proposals for improvement. ""These type of proposals are in high demand among brand owners, even if they remain attentive to costs. But actually, it is not enough to only take interest in the manufacture of the glass, it is the impact of the entire bottle, glass and decoration included, that must be considered."" To this end, Stoelzle uses benchmark software to measure the environmental impact of all the choices. A practice that is spreading throughout the industry! Hence, Stoelzle's bet on the future could not be more rational..."
"Albéa, SABIC and Estée Lauder to launch a revolutionary recycled tube","Origins will be the first prestige beauty brand to leverage SABIC's innovative, advanced recycling technology to produce a tube pack format made from previously difficult to recycle, post-consumer mixed plastics material. Indeed, by 2021, Clear Improvement Active Charcoal Mask, Origins' global best-selling mask, will be packaged in a tube made by Albéa and composed of a polymer resin produced using SABIC's polyethylene and polypropylene recycling technology. SABIC's advanced recycling returns hard-to-recycle plastics, otherwise destined for incineration or landfill, back to their basic building blocks. Once the plastic has been broken down to its molecular state, it is then used to create high- performance plastics akin to a virgin material. Based on this ground-breaking technology, which is capable of continually converting plastics back to the original polymer, SABIC has developed a certified [1] circular polymer, part of its TRUCIRCLE portfolio of circular solutions. ""This breakthrough with Origins, The Estée Lauder Companies and SABIC is an industry-first, paving the way for the use of advanced recycled, post-consumer waste into prestige beauty packaging thanks to an innovative source of high-quality resins. This co-development also highlights the importance of partnership and audacity across the value chain, which is crucial for accelerating the transition to recyclable and reusable packaging,"" explains Stephane Barlet, VP of Sales, Albéa Americas. In accordance with ELC's sustainable packaging goals, which includes increasing the amount of post-consumer recycled (PCR) material in its packaging, the strategic partnership will reinforce Origins efforts to ensure that at least 80% of its packaging by weight is recyclable, refillable, reusable, recycled or recoverable packaging by 2023. ""Exploring the uses of advanced recycled PCR has incredible potential to help drive the achievement of our sustainable packaging goals, and we are excited to bring this product to market,"" said Sushil Iyer, Vice President, Global Packaging, The Estée Lauder Companies."
L'Occitane en Provence broadens bulk offering,"Three of the brand's successful shower gel references are currently available in bulk fountains tested in three points of sale in Germany and Spain. For the first purchase, the price of the aluminium bottle and its content is the same as that of the commonly found shower gels packed in plastic bottles. The following fillings save 25% and are also less expensive than the ecorefill. ""We aimed to help our consumers adopt more virtuous consumption habits and see how they would react, but also how our advisors would receive this new proposal, because it gives them more work to do, since they have to refill the products. Also, we wanted to see how the fountain technology would behave,"" explains Corinne Fugier Garrel, Packaging Development Director of L'Occitane en Provence. After 12 months, sales results are encouraging, so the brand can deploy the strategy. ""Our consumers approved this move and many asked us about our perhaps doing the same for other products. So, we have decided to broaden the offering to two other references, a shampoo and a conditioner,"" says Corinne Fugier Garrel. Sales for the three references concerned have slightly increased, and the operation also creates more added value and traffic. ""The best news is the fact that consumers go back to our stores to refill their products: consumption patterns are definitely changing."" Likewise, our beauty advisors gave us very positive feedback: for them, it is an opportunity to create privileged moments with their customers. They can take the time to explain our strategy and commitment. As the brand is willing to keep making improvements, the technology will be enhanced for the deployment planned for phase two. ""We will make it possible for consumers to take the initial plastic bottle back to their store, so it is refilled. The new technology can do that. The idea is to give the project the best chance by providing as many options as possible. We aim to include over 30 points of sale across Europe and Asia,"" she explains. Obviously, refills have become a significant part of the group's packaging reduction strategy. ""We try to improve in this area with as many formulas possible. 25 references are already available with ecorefills, including two body care products,"" adds Corinne Fugier Garrel. L'Occitane has also been working on reducing the glass weight of skincare ranges and launching solid products minimizing packaging. As for plastic, on the one hand, the hunting season is open to anything useless, like cellulose and spatulas. The next Advent calendar will be made of thermoformed cardboard. On the other hand, the use of recycled materials is now a priority. ""We have been using recycled plastic for a long time in all our PET bottles. The average quantity for all our bottles is 35%. We aim to reach 100% by 2025,"" explains the Director. To achieve this, L'Occitane has partnered with Canadian company Loop Industries: they own a chemical recycling technology which helps obtain an rPET material of the same quality as the virgin material. In addition, the group has committed to integrating 50% recycled materials to other plastics. ""We also aim to use more recycled PE and PP in our packs, but the material is more difficult to obtain with a food grade. It is a challenge to take up."" Lastly, to Corinne Fugier Garrel, it is also necessary to work on product recyclability. ""Unfortunately, some materials are still composed of multiple layers, so they can't be recycled. As regards this particular point, it is up to our suppliers to develop and push for single materials. We are much concerned about this, so we have been working together with our suppliers to make progress,"" she concludes."
ADF&PCD and PLD Paris 2021 postponed to June,"Initially scheduled for January 20 and 21, 2021, the next edition of the ADF&PCD and PLD tradeshow is postponed by six months and will be held on June 22 and 23. Easyfairs, the company organizing the event, said the decision to move the dates has been taken in consultation with stakeholders across the industry in response to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. ""While Easyfairs had put in place an industry-leading programme of measures to ensure the safety of visitors and exhibitors at the event, the limit of 1,000 participants at events imposed by the French Government has made it impossible to organise the event on its original dates,"" they said. The decision comes as several Western European countries, including France, are experiencing a rapid rise in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations. Prime Minister Jean Castex recently warned that French authorities could impose new local lockdowns in a bid to contain another surge in the coronavirus outbreak. In such a context, the organisers of ADF&PCD and PLD Paris are planning a series of new initiatives to help packaging specifiers to discover the latest innovations, to get in touch with the main suppliers and to stay informed until the show can be held. An enhanced content offering will be rolled out in the digital space linked to the show, while a new virtual event is being planned. In addition, a small, exclusive event in Paris reserved for a select group of top brand owners and suppliers is in development. ""ADF&PCD and PLD Paris is known as the place where brands kickstart their innovation projects for the year; so, while we have had no choice but to change the dates of the main event, I am positive that we will continue to provide a strong platform for the market to do business in the coming months,"" said Renan Joel, Divisional Director for Easyfairs UK & Global's packaging events.

Lumson: Focus on safety and sustainability,"Do you think the current situation will change the consumers' approach and this will consequently foresee a change in the market demand? Romualdo Priore - Many habits have already changed. The increase in demand for skincare products doesn't come as a surprise, increased interest has already been around for some time, especially with younger generations like Gen Z, known for their greater awareness and knowledge about the world of skincare. The increase in skincare does not mean a decrease in demand for make-up, but rather, a growing focus on skin care and consequently, a reinterpretation of make-up in terms of ""make care"". New skincare brands have significantly changed both the market and their methods of approaching consumers, in turn affecting make-up which has been adapted and re-invented as make care. How is Lumson responding to these changes? Romualdo Priore - Today, the consumer favors options that ensure the integrity of the product and packaging plays an essential role in this. Lumson has the perfect answer to this necessity, offering airless/touchless solutions that guarantee product integrity. In addition to these products, our packaging options are extremely ample in terms of materials, design, and formats. These include glass jars, glass and plastic bottles, and dispensing systems. The company is proud to have a very vast portfolio that satisfies market demands with regards to safety, perfect dispensing of the product, and customization through a variety of decoration techniques. You mentioned Touchless, what does this term stand for? Romualdo Priore - All our airless systems (jars and bottles) have been renamed Touchless (Lumson's trademark) to highlight our safety features and they are based on four key pillars: – the use of a patented hermetic closure system positioned between the dispensing system and the bottle in order to protect the formula; – a mono or multi-layer pouch depending on the characteristics of the product; – the use of sustainable materials, including glass, plastic and aluminum; – the possibility to separate the various components in order to facilitate their disposal in the correct recycling chain. In addition to traditional airless advantages (complete easy dispensing of the product, sustainability for different types of formulas), these elements provide protection of the product from the contamination with air and other external agents. Could you better explain what are the sustainable materials in Lumson offerings and what is Lumson approach in ""being green""? Romualdo Priore - Terms such as reducing, reusing, recycling and biobased materials are fundamental elements to determine our concrete development strategies. We offer different packaging solutions made with recycled, recyclable and compostable materials and increasingly invests in the research and development of innovative eco-friendly materials aimed at guaranteeing high quality products. We've chosen to invest in process that optimises resources and in research looking for the most ethically and economically sustainable solutions. This process has name S.M.I.L.E: Sustainable, Measurable, Impact, Loyalty, Environment. S.M.I.L.E is an acronym that describes our way of being ""green"" and reducing the environmental impact: in a measurable and tangible way. The 70% of our current packaging portfolio falls within the parameters of sustainability. Today, more than ever, in a world that is increasingly oriented towards sustainability, the SMILE catalogue becomes a very useful tool perfect to go deep into our ""green"" proposal made of a variety of eco-friendly materials: PP/PE – PE Green – PLA- PET – R-PET – GLASS."
The Gift Lab banks on alternatives to plastic,"""The search for resource-efficient, renewable, recyclable or biodegradable new materials is a strategy fully in line with real global demand. We are therefore investing heavily to develop eco-designed and eco-sourced products,"" explains Alexandre Escarra, CEO. To this end, the company has carried out an in-depth analysis on the supply of alternative materials capable of meeting demands for sustainability, without however necessarily giving up the aesthetic and industrial advantages offered by the most used do date materials. New materials using natural fibres from renewable non-petroleum resources are now affordable and increasingly used in the gift-with-purchase sector. This is the case with bamboo or rice fibres, or fabrics made from oyster shells that The Gift Lab can provide to its customers. These innovations are complemented by the revival of long-used renewable plant fibres, but which had fallen in oblivion, like flax, jute, hemp fibres, or even ramie, one of the world's oldest fibre, made from nettles stems, a plant that grows, with no need for irrigation or pesticides! ""As we are committing to source and produce as closely as possible to our customers, we have also listed the traceability of each material and we provide the corresponding certifications,"" claims the company. In addition, vegetable alternatives have multiplied. Piñatex, made from pineapple leaves, ""Apple Leather"", made of apple cores and skins discarded from the food industry, the Bananatex fibre, the Vegea leather, originating from the fermentation of grape pomace, or the Muskin, obtained from the cap of the mushroom Phellinus ellipsoideus, are the best-known illustrations of the sector's transformation. However, these materials remain expensive. While significant demand from the fashion sector should allow a more common use in the future, their production is often limited to small runs and specific retail projects. For gift-with-purchase projects, more affordable solutions also offer significant ecological benefits. "" Paptic , for instance, stands as a biobased alternative to plastic for many designs and packaging,"" explains The Gift Lab. Soft to the touch, made from wood fibres, it can be sewn, zipped, welded, and can be decorated with stamping, embossing and varnishing techniques. It is both biodegradable and recyclable! More traditional, R-PET is now recognized and valued for its flexibility and affordable price. Another recycled plastic, R-PVB (recycled PVB) is used as a substitute to PU for the production of flexible films replacing leather. Alternatives to plastic polybags, made from sugar cane, seaweed or corn starch, can also help mitigating the impact of overwrapping in this industry. ""Some technologies are indeed still in their infancy, but today we can rely on a range of materials that allow offering many sustainable solutions at a very competitive cost. In particular, we can make pouches, from recycled materials, equipped with zips, the teeth and stoppers of which are in R-PET and the ribbon in a natural or bio-based material,"" emphasizes Alexandre Escarra. ""For the boxes, we can also make wedges made of mushroom or hemp fibres, or offer heat-soluble or biodegradable sachets and bags, based on cassava starch, corn starch or algae."" The Gift Lab currently employs around ten people and plans to close 2020 in progress, with a turnover of between 6 and 7 million euros. Around 60% of sales go to the fashion sector and 40% to the beauty market. Certified Silver by EcoVadis, the Company has a purchasing office in Shenzen, China, and a sales office is being opened in New York and should be operational soon."
Qualiform innovates in sustainability with Eastman's new copolyester,"Cristal Renew is a new sustainable resin made of 50% recycled content via mass balance allocation. According to Eastman, the material is indistinguishable from their heritage copolysters and allows using high levels of recycled content, without compromising the performance, colour and quality that have made Cristal the standard for cosmetic packaging. Cristal Renew therefore uses landfill-bound waste to create new high end luxury packaging for cosmetic brands, thus participating in the circular economy and reducing the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions per unit. According to the US-based provider of specialty materials, the new resin does not need retooling or requalification, making this an easy switch for manufacturers. The recycled content is certified [1] and Cristal Renew complies with all regulatory requirements, adds Eastman. Cristal Renew is part of a broad portfolio of sustainable resins now available to the cosmetics market. Earlier the year, for instance, Eastman launched Tritan Renew, a new grade of its leading copolyster. According to Eastman it also offers the same durability, performance and safety of original Tritan but now with up to 50% recycled content derived from waste plastic."
ADF & PCD and PLD Paris are preparing an exceptional 2021 edition,"ADF&PCD and PLD Paris will be back on 20-21 January 2021, at the Porte de Versailles exposition centre.

Perfume bottles - Glassmakers are accelerating their environmental transition,"Even if classics are playing their cards right, and even if China is perfuming itself again, and Europe is finding its way back to the shops, the situation is far from back to normal for glassmakers and even worse in Travel Retail, which has still not found its second wind. Stoelzle runs at 50% of its capacity, the same goes for Heinz Glas but ""occasionally"" explains the Company. On average, the French sites of Verescence are operating at 75% of their normal activity. At the Mers-les-Bains plant, two out of three furnaces are running. In Spain and the United States, the bottling activity is around 60% and 75% respectively. In this uneasy economic environment, producers are banking on their agility. For Heinz ""it is even a permanent concern"", and the same is true for Stoelzle who also boasts ""its level of service"". Verescence is reviewing its operating methods, accelerating its digital transformation and testing new tools. ""As an international Group with strong local roots, the crisis has reinforced our strategy,"" explains Jean-Luc Leblond, Sales and Marketing Director. ""Being more agile means further improving our flows by reducing the complexity of the supply chain."" Another avenue for growth is to adapt the offer to changes in demand. Like other categories, the perfume sector is also recruiting more on the internet. ""Visibility is indeed very limited in this segment, but it is an important area of development for our customers,"" confirms Verescence, who is already working on improving the resistance of the glass, with an innovative coating ""making it more resistant to shocks"". But the attention of glassmakers is mostly focused on circular economy and sustainable development. And this on several levels. Following the Citeo recommendations, they offer designs with a lower impact on the environment and that facilitate the recycling of bottles. A concern that has existed for more than twenty years at Heinz Glas. ""With a water-soluble lacquering, we can claim to have been a pioneer in the use of eco-friendly decorative raw materials,"" says Rudolf Wurm, Sales Director. Last year, Verescence delivered on its commitment to eliminate 100% of solvent-based solutions on its finishing lines. Beyond VOC emissions, the glassmaker who is studying - together with some of his customers - more eco-responsible decorative processes, has developed a tool to take into account the impact of finishing operations on the recyclability of a glass container. Stoelzle has been working for several years on the Quali Glass Coat 2.0, a new powder coating decoration process that reduces the CO2 impact by nearly 77%. ""We have also furthered this technology with the Tigital process (in partnership with the Tiger Company), which allows a photo-quality screen printing with a CO2 reduction of 85% while maintaining the possibility of recycling the glass,"" specifies Étienne Gruyez, CEO of Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie. More globally, as furnaces remain the main sources of CO2 emissions linked to glass production, manufacturers have announced several investments to reduce their environmental impact. For instance, at the beginning of 2021 Stoelzle will rebuild a furnace which ""will use the latest technologies"". Heinz Glas has opted since 2016 for a green hydroelectric source to supply its German sites, like with the new furnace at the Kleintettau site. To date, most of Verescence furnaces are new. ""They have, on average, gained 15% energy efficiency compared to the previous generations. Reducing the carbon footprint will inevitably be gradual and part of a long-term strategy, a furnace having a lifespan of around ten years,"" explains Jean-Luc Leblond. As for the circular economy component, all glassmakers have set up plans for the refilling of their bottles. Concerning their bottles and an increase in the cullet rate, all glassmakers have optimization projects in their sleeves. The German glassmaker, who proposes a glass with a PCR rate of between 10 and 20%, has decided to build a next-generation furnace ""allowing greater ambitions,"" reveals Rudolf Wurm. After the Infinite Glass launched in 2008, and then the NEO Infinite Glass in 2014 with 25% PCR, Verescence will very soon dedicate its main furnace in Mers-les-Bains to the production of glass with a 10% PCR content. While Stoelzle Masnières has significantly increased its cullet rate while maintaining glass quality, Etienne Gruyez considers ""it is more important to look at the overall impact of the bottle"". Despite their commitment to meet the perfume market's new requirements, glassmakers will not post a positive balance sheet for 2020. ""Our financial results will have deteriorated and we expect a year down by around 20% compared to 2019. To protect our cash flow, we have implemented significant savings plans and postponed some investments, with the will to preserve those linked to priority areas like CSR, quality and continuous improvement,"" explains Jean-Luc Leblond. Heinz Glas has taken a series of measures to cut down costs and minimize the economic impact. ""We are paying particular attention to the Company's cash flow, and to this end, we have engaged very precise management of our stock levels,"" notes Rudolf Wurm. For their part, Stoelzle officials believe it is still too early to have a clear vision of the 2020 balance sheet. ""Things are changing constantly and very quickly,"" confirms Etienne Gruyez. ""We have imagined different scenarios with up to 25 to 30% drops in sales. We will have to be as responsive as possible so as not to lose the few opportunities that will arise""."
(Re)Awakening : The Future of Beauty and an Era of New Semantics in the US,"Premium Beauty News - What are your methods for projecting the trends forecasting the future of Beauty? Leïla Rochet - First, we position ourselves as translators of the major trends that will impact the Beauty of tomorrow, both in terms of representations and archetypes, but also behaviors. Our vision relies on a Prospective Intelligence Method based on a thorough analysis of the market (articles, studies, magazines, online media, social media and Fashion Week), field visits and product analysis (deciphering product innovations and storytelling). Our reports are enriched with insights from studies, on top of the forecasting chapters, to help rethink your strategies and innovations. Sarah Schnebert - Our inspirations arise from various sources, from lyrics to the latest indie albums, to captions from Instagram accounts. That's what we love about semantics: by nature, words are an ever-changing force of society. Every generation reinvents words every day, a phenomenon that has accelerated in our digitalized life. All the modern wording we highlight or we reinvent in our reports are inspired by these insights. Stéphanie Muit - From disruptive looks to innovative fabrics, we are deeply inspired by Fashion and what's happening on social media, especially in makeup. In 2020, ""self platform"" like TikTok, Depop or Animal Crossing have revolutionized fashion consumption and influence. The same goes for the new ""see now, buy now"" trend, the gathering of both genders on the runways as well as the ""phygital"" Fashion Weeks. All these trends have challenged traditional norms, rhythm and seasonality of the Fashion industry that will impact beauty. Premium Beauty News - What do you mean by ""(Re)Awakening"" ? Leïla Rochet - When future reblossoms, the world will awake with new opportunities. We invite brands to stay ""awake"" and ""aware"" of everything that surrounds us and prepare for the new future. Today's unrivaled situation reshaped collective consciousness, forced consumers to reconsider their priorities, and shuffled their relation to beauty. Consumers are well informed and very aware of modern issues and will be increasingly demanding. They will look for brands with values and act with compassion during these difficult times. In our trend, Health (Re)Boot, we explore health as a new marker of Luxury and Beauty. Looking ""healthy"" was already key – and more important than looking young, in a 2018 survey by Philips, and this will accelerate with new territories of healthiness. We've moved from well-being to being truly well. The COVID-19 reminded us how vulnerable we are, how fundamental our skin is, as an emotional, intimate layer, but also as protective armor. Sarah Schnebert - For (Re)Awakening, the word ""awake"" is a direct reference to the post-woke world. Since the 2010's, the concept of ""wokeness"" has been so fundamental in the US, liberating but also culturally reshaping, in terms of feminism, inclusivity, LGBTQUA+ justice etc. It is truly a paradigm shift. American society is now adamant, uncompromising, especially when it comes to semantics faux-pas. We've moved on from ""influence"" to ""relevance"", and this is game-changing in terms of communication. Stéphanie Muit - The idea of (Re)Awakening is about rethinking values, priorities, how to be in sync with our identity, with the world. To be sustainable, brands need to meet these new demands and new consumer needs. In the era of Cancel Culture, they will be constantly challenged to question themselves, to better themselves. Premium Beauty News - What does this mean for brands tomorrow ? Leïla Rochet - As consumers are incredibly demanding, brands need to be ready to be called out, to face backlashes whenever they speak out. There have been a few examples unfortunately. In the (Re)Awakening era, they are being judged on their empathy and on their civic-minded attitude. We analyzed how US brands behaved during lockdown, from their call for solidarity to the way they acted. Some have embraced the role of ""care-takers"". The future of Beauty will lie in the hands of creativite drivers. For consumers, aspirational ""superficial"" perfection is out, they wish to portray the best version of their individuality, staying truthful and authentic, while cultivating and celebrating differences. This is even more significant in makeup, which has always been a tool for freedom and creativity.On Instagram and TikTok, makeup was used as a hedonistic force, fueling new aesthetics, with a surrealistic touch. By supporting this new freedom wave, and allowing consumers to express themselves, Beauty brands will generate intimacy and engagement. (Re) Awakening, Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation latest Makeup and Skincare reports. Since 2007, Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation is a Beauty Forecasting and Consulting office specialized in Beauty Innovation.

Metsä Board opens a new Excellence Centre for ever more sustainable packaging,"The Finnish packaging board giant is convinced that the growing consumption and demand for packaging is boosting the need for new and more sustainable innovations. To develop solutions for packaging today and into the future, Metsä Board has started up operations in its new Excellence Centre at their manufacturing site in Äänekoski, Finland. ""As the amount of packaging continues to grow, new, sustainable solutions are needed to replace fossil-based materials and ensure circularity. The Excellence Centre concept enables paperboard and packaging solutions that look at the entire value chain, and not just at its separate parts. With the material knowhow, competence and tools now available, we can optimise performance throughout the packaging lifecycle"", says Mika Joukio, CEO of Metsä Board. The centre, with its cutting-edge technology for R&D, packaging design and paperboard and packaging performance, aims to accelerate material and packaging innovation.

Virtual collaboration workshops have also been developed to enable joint development and co-creation when physical meetings are not possible. ""Renewable and recyclable fresh fibre paperboard can be utilised for packaging in many ways. Fibre-based packaging has a lot to offer, and together with our partners, we are able to explore the possibilities even more comprehensively,"" adds Mika Joukio. At Äänekoski, in Finland, Metsä Board now operates a world-unique industrial and R&D ecosystem including a next-generation bioproduct mill, a paperboard mill, a plywood mill, the Pro Nemus visitor centre, and a textile fibre demo plant."
Aptar and Shiseido invent a new versatile perfume bottle,"The new collaboration between Shiseido and Aptar has delivered a technological advance unprecedented in the history of perfumery. The result of a full year's intense work on materials, molds, forms and textures, l'Eau d'Issey the iconic fragrance from Issey Miyake, is now available in a revolutionary double pack concept named IGO / ISTAY. The ISTAY bottles pay tribute to the original design of L'Eau d'Issey fragrance bottles, and are intended to remain sedentary, unlike the IGO caps which complete them. Light and unbreakable, the IGO cap is ready to accompany its owner to the office, on a weekend getaway, or to the ends of the earth! Containing 20ml of fragrance and an integrated vaporizer, it clips easily on and off the ISTAY base, presenting an ideal travel format. Completely independent, it slips into a bag or suitcase, enabling one to perfume oneself anywhere, anytime. ""This exclusive product blends practicality, audacity and innovation. Its technical culmination is achieved in the women's version of L'Eau d'Issey for which the nomadic cover cap is fitted with a spherical actuator containing a safety device to guarantee a perfect seal,"" highlights Aptar. To give life to the Shiseido project, Aptar has created a high sub-assembly with a pump, flacon, push button and cap fitted with an atomizer. The aesthetics of the final product were another technical challenge. Both the men's and women's IGO caps mirror the colour shades of the original fragrances - the lacquer of the men's iteration and metallization of the women's - while ensuring optimal performance of the aluminium, leather and silver finishing. Eventually, ""the logistical feat of associating several teams located at different industrial sites - each charged with developing the diverse elements of the system - was crucial to achieving this stunning final product,"" adds Aptar."
Meiyume develops a sustainable moulded pulp beauty packaging range,"Traditionally used in cargo transport such as packaging dunnage or egg cartons, moulded pulp is made from a variety of fibrous materials with high cellulose content, such as recycled paper, cardboard or other natural fibres (sugarcane, bamboo, wheat straw). Moulded pulp has become increasingly popular for the packaging of FMCG as manufacturing maturity has been able to transform its quality and sophistication. ""With the market demand for renewable and recyclable packaging options growing, this material has been making its way across the packaging market in new and creative ways, including shoes and apparel, wine and spirits, as well as for electronics,"" explains Meiyume. In a continuous effort to bring together aesthetics, authenticity, and sustainability, the provider of packaging and retail solutions has reimagined moulded pulp to adapt the material the specific needs of the beauty industry. ""The high-quality and ultra-light material is finely crafted from plant fibres that are entirely biobased, recyclable and plastic free. Set to revolutionize the beauty packaging market, the eco-designed material can also be elegantly moulded into versatile shapes and sizes,"" highlights the company. Among the various packaging solutions tested by Meiyume is an eyeshadow palette. ""Eyeshadows have seen an increase in demand as customers look to accentuate their eye makeup, especially with today's face covering requirements. Each piece of the eco-designed palette can be customized according to the customer's needs to compliment and elevate the brand personality,"" states Meiyume in a release. From sourcing to product design, Meiyume's commitment to sustainability helps drive the circular economy and give its customers a better avenue to connect with the values of their end-consumers. ""Using Lifecycle Analysis based on ISO 14040, we look at all aspects of the products we create to reduce environmental footprint,"" says Gerard Raymond, President of Meiyume. ""By exploring new materials and production processes like we did with the moulded pulp range, we are able to develop mono-material products which are easier for consumers to recycle, but do not compromise on aesthetics,"" he concludes."
Pujolasos launches a wooden cap with a removable and recyclable plastic inner,"In a new effort to find innovative solutions to improve the sustainability of perfume and cosmetic packaging, Spanish-based Pujolasos recently patented a wooden cap with a glue-free plastic inner part that can be easily removed. With this innovation, dubbed Woodle, the wood packaging specialist intends to solve the problem of recyclability of multi-material components. According to the company, Woodle is ""the first wooden cap with disposable plastic inner for recycling."" The plastic inner is designed to be easily removed and then recycled after its useful life. It can be injected in PCR plastic or another type of sustainable plastic resin. ""This innovation is compatible with the majority of existing and potential developments, both in perfumery and cosmetics,"" adds Pujolasos. Also recently developed by Pujolasos, Woon is a glue-free monomaterial wooden cap, without any built-in plastic interior. The wooden part is threaded so that it can be screwed onto a bottle or jar. Last year, Pujolasos introduced another sustainable solution made of 100% natural and compostable materials. Dubbed Woork, the wooden cap then included a glue-free cork insert. The innovation was later adapted to fit on skin care jars. ""We have placed sustainability at the core of our company's strategy,"" Angel Pujolasos, the company's CEO, told Premium Beauty News."

"""Luxe Pack has a role to play in accelerating the recovery"", Fabienne Germond","Premium Beauty News - What changes will you make during the next edition of the Luxe Pack Monaco trade show, scheduled for November 2020? Fabienne Germond - This year, we are preparing for an applied and studious edition. After months of deprivation, market players are eager to resume face-to-face exchanges to gain benefits that have been lacking to them until now: in-depth project reviews, demonstrations of new features and understanding of innovations. To facilitate these exchanges, we make all the rooms of the Grimaldi Forum available to organize their meetings in complete confidentiality. We also wish to underline the community spirit which characterizes the profession and we offer exhibitors the possibility of hosting freely on their stand a young company of their choice or a small structure that presents innovative know-how. Thus beyond traditional exhibitors, visitors will have access to an enriched offer by those of start-ups, particularly offering packaging innovations aimed at reducing the environmental impact. We are also developing a digital platform that will increase the visibility of exhibitors and conferences to an international audience by relying on our networks and databases abroad. And of course, there will be logistical changes related to the health approach in order to deliver an experience that is both Covid-proof and user-friendly. Premium Beauty News - What are your goals and expectations? Fabienne Germond - Our main objective is to serve the market to speed up the current developments and future projects in a context where expectations are even higher than usual. We want to be present and play our part for all those who want to accelerate the recovery thanks to the show, and there are many of them. We have already registered more than 30 new exhibitors and still receive requests to this day. Premium Beauty News - The Luxe Pack Shanghai edition took place in July: a brave and daring choice. What are the results? Fabienne Germond - First show dedicated to luxury packaging in post-lockdown in Asia, Luxe Pack Shanghai closed its doors with a very good 13th edition! We welcomed 6,274 visitors, an increase of 23% compared to last year! Of course, we were strictly respecting health measures and social distancing for the safety of all participants.

Premium Beauty News - From your perspective, what will be the main repercussions of the events that have jostled each of us and the business world, will they influence the high-end packaging market? Fabienne Germond - This health crisis has undoubtedly accelerated emerging trends, especially in everything related to digital and sustainable development. Everyone will also have to rethink their supply chain, in light of recent months' events. But it is still a little too early to learn all the lessons from this crisis. The program has been completely reshuffled in order to be adapted to these recent issues and to provide the first answers and relevant analyzis. Premium Beauty News - Let's anticipate the IDICE events in 2020... Fabienne Germond - We are already preparing the 2021 events calendar, starting with Luxe Pack Los Angeles on February 2nd and 3rd.

The Special Edition by Luxe Pack is already scheduled for June 1st and 2nd, 2021, in Paris, on the occasion of Sustainable Development week. And of course, Luxe Pack Monaco will take place from September 27th to 29th, 2021."
Henkel to use Albéa's recyclable tubes for its entire oral care portfolio,"Greenleaf, the all-plastic laminate tube developed and patented by Albéa, has convinced Henkel. The Düsseldorf-headquartered group said it is about to convert its entire Oral Care tube portfolio to fully recyclable tubes produced by the French packaging supplier. Henkel owns and markets a variety of oral brands including: brands Vademecum, Theraxyl, Theramed, Denivit, and Licor del Polo. The Greenleaf tubes are entirely made of High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE). Their barrier web was lightened while preserving their capacity to ensure optimal formula protection for all applications. ""We want to foster a circular economy and pursue ambitious packaging targets. This joint development is a major step for us to further improve the recyclability of our packaging portfolio and is contributing significantly to our goal to achieve 100 percent recyclability until 2025,"" said Philippe Blank, Head of Packaging Sustainability at Henkel Beauty Care. ""By introducing Albéa's Greenleaf technology, we are now shifting more than 700 tons of packaging material per year into a category that can be utilized and recovered by existing waste recycling streams."" Greenleaf tubes are recognized by the Association of Plastic Recylers, in the USA, and by Suez.CircPack, in Europe, as being technically recyclable within the existing, effective HDPE bottles recycling stream. What's more, this tube-making technology uses a single-blown film thus ""reducing the product's CO2 footprint significantly,"" claims Albéa. Earlier this year, Albéa and Colgate announced the first launch of this type of tube in the United Kingdom. While toothpaste tubes are being used by millions of consumers every day, not many may know that classical tubes couldn't be recycled so far - actually, their multi-layer construction poses a challenge for recycling facilities. However, since oral care brands are increasingly adopting new recyclable solutions, effective recycling should could soon become a reality. In addition to the roll-out of the recyclable packaging solution, Henkel and Albéa are jointly working to improve even further and harmonize all single packaging components of the final product. ""We have a clear goal: Together we want to launch the world's first full HDPE tube in 2021, which will then include the cap as well,"" said Philippe Blank. Henkel has decided to debut the transition to the new tubes with Spanish toothpaste brand Licor del Polo. The whole transition process is expected to be concluded across all oral care brands beginning of next year. ""With Henkel, we are demonstrating that leading companies, with established brands such as Licor del Polo, are at the forefront of the sustainability challenge. What makes a difference is the brand's sense of purpose - and this is a value that Albéa shares with Henkel,"" concluded Zoran Joksic, Sales Director at Albéa."
Lumson launches new sustainable lipstick and shares vision on next trends,"Will there be ""revenge shopping"" for lip products? Romualdo Priore - Many people have hypothesized a collapse in the ""Lipstick Index"" theory, but I don't think it'll happen. I'm completely convinced that the opposite will occur. Not only will there not be any decrease in its popularity but once again, lipstick will come out of this crisis as a winner and might even become the symbol of ""rebirth"" after these difficult months. After all, the link between the female world and lipstick is very strong and the history of female empowerment runs parallel to the creation and success of lipstick. In 1912, Elizabeth Arden joined 15,000 women in a march for their rights, inviting them to wear bright red lipstick. Coco Chanel said that you can't start revolutions with lipstick… however, you can claim your identity and show off your determination with the right lip colour. Whoever ventured to say the Lipstick Index would suffer didn't consider that the use of masks is only temporary and the theory's resilience continues to be an indicator of economic health. I continue to believe that it's both a ""must have"" product and that, differently from other makeup products, lipstick or lip colours have an intrinsic kind of magical power. How do you see the future of lip products in terms of formulations and packaging? Romualdo Priore - There will be a return to sparkly and long-lasting formulations. Gloss and lip care products will be a category in overwhelmingly high demand, especially from the newer generations. Of course, traditional lipsticks won't be left out, including those in miniature formats that are easy for women to bring with them throughout their day, as well as lip glosses with different types of applicators according to the formulation type. Besides safety, there will be a lot of attention given to sustainability and Lumson has always been aware of this and conscientious of its use of plastic. In fact, the company has an important innovation in the pipeline in this regard: Lipstick PLA 2.0. The lipstick case is made from a bio-based material that is extremely high-performing and innovative, developed specifically for Lumson. With respect to the PLA that is already present on the market (a renewable and compostable material obtained from the polymerization of dextrose derived from cane sugar), the version developed for Lumson offers more advantages such as: resistance to high temperatures without deforming, better resistance to scratches and wear and tear, and its mechanism doesn't require any lubrification. We're talking about elements that are of particular importance for the cosmetic sector that make this lipstick a product with great potential. It's enough to think that today, the attention that the consumer world is giving to eco-friendly beauty products is growing and a good 60% of young people prefer brands and products that are sustainable. How will brands guarantee greater safety to the consumer at the point of sale? Romualdo Priore - Companies will have to keep in mind that consumers are going to be paying more attention to safety both during the choosing phase and the purchasing phase of a product. With regards to counters, the most serious brands are already in the habit of cutting a part of the lipstick bullet after a customer has tested it, while for glosses or lacquers, they've been using disposable brushes. For my part, I can say that like in all things, common sense is important. My past experience as a makeup artist has instilled in me a strict protocol with regards to product hygiene: it's best practice to take a small sample of a product and apply it so as to avoid using the actual product or applicator directly on lips. Advice that is not only applicable in a pandemic but that should always be the standard."
All4Pack Paris 2020: Focus on sustainable innovation,"If the results of the survey commissioned by the organizers of ALL4Pack [1] are to be believed, the health crisis has certainly consolidated the role of packaging in terms of product safety among French (with a significant generational gap, as 66% of senior citizens consider that packaging is ""extremely useful"" or ""very useful"" compared to 22% among 18 to 24-year-olds), but the aspiration for more packaging durability remains strong. Today, despite the pandemic, 1 out of 2 French people continue to buy products with less packaging, compared to 8/10 previously. The findings of the survey furthermore show that a substantial majority of the French (61%) believe that manufacturers do not make enough effort in the design of sustainable packaging. Nevertheless, there is no evidence of a ""red card"" from consumers. The majority of those surveyed placed themselves in the ""probably"" positive or negative categories illustrating an absence of certainty in this area, undoubtedly owing to lack of knowledge about the actions taken by manufacturers. ""Packaging will always be necessary. It is essential, but it has arrived at the end of a cycle. Its reinvention is for the future. Many innovations are emerging from manufacturers, but the general public is sadly unaware of them,"" comments Olivia Milan, director of All4Pack. Packaging therefore needs to be reinvented and the 2020 edition of All4Pack will thus be placed under the sign of change and sustainable development. Several innovations in sustainability will therefore be presented at the show: – Invention of a new recycled raw material made up of 100% recycled EPS (expanded polystyrene, the world's most-used material in the world for packaging) from post-consumption products; – Biodegradable packaging made from a new bio-based material which can be used as compost for agriculture; – Packaging that can be reused up to 1,000 times to fulfil the needs of e- commerce; – An innovative chemical recycling process to recycle mixed and contaminated plastics. For better visibility and a more fluid visitor itinerary, this year the various offers from exhibitors will be presented by material : wood, cardboard, metal, plastic and glass. The All4Pack show will offer many special highlights as well as a rich and comprehensive series of talks and events: – A comprehensive series of talks on sectorial issues, including new regulations and the circular economy. – The latest trends by material, packaging and intra-logistics innovations to understand the revolution that is taking place in the All4Pack Innovations area. – Meetings with the actors of change and exchanges on the virtuous practices of the circular economy on the new Objective Zero Impact forum. – A place for meetings and dialogue on 4.0 technologies and machine solutions, for the benefit of the environment, people and the industrial performance of companies. All happening at Le LAB By Geppia, Hall 7."
Bormioli Luigi perfects eco-friendly glass matting,"The new process can be used to recreate the feel and appearance of acid etched glass without the need for toxic or polluting substances. Actually, this new technology is based on the use of a water-based lacquer which vitrifies at around 600°C creating a satin finish on the surface of glass items. Compared to acid etching, Eco-friendly Matting provides a series of benefits, in terms of both function and appearance. ""It has a reduced impact on the environment thanks to the lack of harmful substances used in the process, it does not involve VOC emissions, nor the need to dispose of toxic waste,"" says Bormioli Luigi in a statement. This also means greater safety in the workplace. Indeed, when traditional matting processes are performed it is mandatory to adhere strictly to regulations designed to safeguard operators and guarantee safe transport of products and disposal of toxic waste. Furthermore, water-based lacquering can be used to create an end product which is 100% recyclable while processing waste is reduced to a minimum because any sprayed material which does not adhere to the container is recovered and reused, almost to the last drop. ""It should be stressed that containers treated with this kind of lacquer present no risk of material transfer, thus making the process suitable for use in the food sector for creating finishes on glasses and bottles,"" highights the glassmaker. In terms of the aesthetic results, ceramic lacquering is more versatile than acid etching, in fact it offers the possibility to use a wide range of coloured pigments and calibrate the intensity of colours. Eco-friendly matting can be used with masking techniques meaning it can be applied to selected areas of bottles and containers. Evetually, this solution is also compatible with additional processes, in particular decorations which can withstand firing at temperatures of up to 600°C. This new lacquering process is in line with the efforts made for several years by luxury glassmakers to reduce the impact of their products. After having made great efforts to reduce the weight of glass of their products, in particular with Ecoline, Bormioli Luigi now offers a more ecological decoration solution."
Orlandi and V-Shapes join forces to promote an innovative sampling solution,"Sharing the same values of independent and family-owned businesses, the Orlandi and V-Shapes companies have combined, as part of an exclusive marketing and business partnership, their complementarity, to offer personal care and beauty brands a new gesture in the flat sample area. This partnership is part of a development perspective of the V-Shapes sample, serving a wide variety of products: perfumes, creams, foundations, lotions, scrubs, hair care, and particularly in the current context: hydro-alcoholic sanitizers. Designed and developed by V-Shapes, the eponymous sample stands out by its extreme ease of use: a light pressure with three fingers of one hand on both sides of the packet is enough to open it by folding it in half to release its contents at the level of the created fold. The solution ensures 98% product restitution. Its design (protected by eight patents) also guarantees perfect product protection, avoiding any risk of oxidation or outside contamination. V-Shapes is proposed with six different opening systems, which makes it possible to package products with a broad spectrum of viscosity, texture, particle size. The V-Shapes sample, which offers a capacity ranging from 0.2ml to 25ml, is available in several formats to allow multi-media distribution including the press. It includes a rigid part (back) displaying the regulatory information (bar code, legal notices, etc.) and a flexible part (front), which can be decorated with up to 8 colours. This side is dedicated to the sample's personalization. ""As part of this partnership, we can provide the brand with all of our marketing expertise to enhance and customize its product,"" explains Philippe Ughetto, Senior Vice-president of Orlandi. The V-Shapes sample also fully meets requirements for sustainable development by offering different structure compositions: a recyclable and a bio-sourced solution (more than 80%). ""These solutions include the Ingeo biopolymer film from NatureWorks with whom we have signed a strategic partnership,"" specifies Christian Burattini, CEO of V-Shapes. A standard version is available for products requiring high barrier properties. V-Shapes will further evolve in the coming months to offer consumers an augmented reality experience on their smartphone. Precisely, to estimate which format, composition, opening system and capacity best suit the product, Orlandi and V-Shapes support the brand in its approach, by carrying out tests before going into production. There are three machine formats available (Alpha, Prime and Genesys) the technology of which is protected by several patents. In Europe, packaging and tests are carried out in the Italian and Estonian factories of V-Shapes; in North America, they are performed in Orlandi's production units. The sample, a marketing solution dedicated to consumers, to capture their attention, must now also, because of the Covid-19 crisis, offer them all the reassuring health safety features. The opening gesture of V-Shapes, which is contact-free is therefore 100% hygiene-proof. It is particularly suited for nomadic uses and POS distribution. With its format, its reduced thickness and its size, V-Shapes also fully meets e-commerce requirements, currently consumers' preferred distribution channel, in times when health instructions can still constitute a barrier to in-store experiences. The combined expertise of Orlandi and V-Shapes in flat sampling, which has led to this innovative solution gets the thumbs up from brands and fully meets the principles of circular economy.

Eastman launches first copolyester produced from molecular recycling,"This new generation of plastic has become possible thanks to the molecular recycling technologies implemented by Eastman and awarded last year at Luxe Pack Monaco. ""Tritan Renew is a significant step forward for Eastman as the first product to market using molecular recycling made possible by Eastman's Advanced Circular Recycling technologies. We have made considerable progress over the past year to create sustainable solutions that convert millions of pounds of waste into new materials,"" said Mark Costa, board chair and CEO of Eastman. In 2019, the company began commercial-scale recycling for a broad set of plastics to keep material from being sent to landfills or incinerated or ending up in the environment. Eastman's Advanced Circular Recycling technologies - carbon renewal technology (CRT) and polyester renewal technology (PRT) - have a significantly lower carbon footprint than production processes for products made from fossil fuel-based raw materials. Using methanolysis, advanced circular recycling breaks down polyester-based products into their polymer building blocks. These can then be reintroduced to the production of polyester-based polymers and the process can be made an infinite number of times, delivering a true circular solution. This process allows Eastman to incorporate up to 50% recycled plastic as a raw material for the manufacture of Tritan Renew, thus reducing consumption of fossil fuel and greenhouse gas emissions. ""Thanks to the rapid innovation of polyester renewal technology, Tritan Renew adds certified recycled content to its exceptional performance and delivers one of the most exciting sustainability solutions available,"" said Scott Ballard, vice president and general manager for Eastman Specialty Plastics. ""Tritan's toughness has been enabling durable, reusable products to reduce the waste from single-use materials since its introduction in 2008."" Eastman is producing Tritan Renew with certified recycled content for a variety of durable products, including reusable sports bottles, small appliances, and eyewear, as well as cosmetics packaging. The recycled content of these products is achieved through a mass balance allocation process certified by ISCC (International Sustainability & Carbon Certification)."
Safe in-store testing solutions for the post-Covid era,"Brands asked manufacturers to expand or adapt their catalogues. They soon did, and for limited costs. They developed alternatives to the standard lipstick, foundation, and perfume test solutions involving the successive use of retail-size products. ""This is no longer possible, so we have worked on hygienic, personal proposals that satisfied our customers' criteria,"" confirms Isabelle Louis, Marketing Director of Arcade Beauty. Suppliers have imagined different gestures to test lipsticks. For example, Livcer drew inspiration from the usual retail-size product application, but enhanced it with an innovation: Livstick. The sample consists of a wood stick slid into a single-use blister pack whose ends are coated with a small quantity of lipstick. ""Brands' specifications were very simple: it had to be visual, little cumbersome, so it can easily fit in drawers, cheap, and as green as possible,"" explains company founder Aude de Livonnière. The customizable blister pack is based on recyclable materials and the stick is made of wood. Livstick is available as a single-use blister pack or as a precut six-stick bar. It can either be put away in drawers or demonstrators' bags, or put on display. To develop this new product, Livcer invested in a new production tool which will be operational next August, so the sample can be marketed in September. Orlandi banked on a card-size proposal intended for different product types, which is delivered by a counter display or a cardboard-based dispenser. ""Consumers seize the card and try it immediately or take it away. It is a travel-size solution adapted to perfumes, skincare, and makeup, depending on the technique used,"" says Philippe Ughetto, Senior Vice-President of Orlandi. As regards lipsticks, the company has already received many requests for their product Color Kiss. This card is folded in the middle: users bite it by putting their lips on it to apply the lipstick. TouchUps follows a different principle: this biodegradable applicator consists of a cellulose capsule which looks like a mini-lipstick and is directly applied with the usual stick gesture. Orlandi has also designed another makeup solution by adapting the V-Shapes innovation to foundations and other fluid formulas (oil perfumes, creams, scrubs, shampoos…). V-Shapes is also a single-use card, but it can be opened with one hand by pressing on each end to form a V. The folding opens a protective cap which cleanly delivers a controlled quantity of product, whatever the viscosity. The content used is close to 100% and four versions are available: standard, compostable, 80% biosourced, and recyclable single-material. ""Beyond in-store testing, V-Shapes is interesting in that it is adapted to all channels, depending on its size or capacity: press, retail, digital sampling…,"" adds Philippe Ughetto. Arcade Beauty adopted the same R&D strategy based on their existing catalogue to quickly create a unique, safe gesture. Kiss-A-Peel satisfies all lipstick criteria. This small cardboard card contains a mouth-shaped dose of lipstick which you kiss after folding it. And to go even farther in displaying the broad variety of shades offered by brands, Arcade Beauty also devised a new presentation for labels/single-doses to be removed. It is adapted to lips, complexion, and eyes. ""Beauty advisors will play an even more significant role, since they will welcome consumers as soon as they walk in the store and guide them as they stroll, so they do not touch the products displayed. To support them in implementing these new habits, we have thought about a file with the brands' colours containing colour testing boards,"" explains Isabelle Louis. This labelling, dispensing technology has a huge advantage, since it multiplies the range of colours, while limiting the volume needed for distributors who lack space. Forget about testers posing health risks in stores: suppliers are inventing new, safe solutions. For example, based on their pre-perfumed, alcohol-free paper technology, IDScent has created Scentest, Scentouch, and Scentweave. Scentest is a perfumed card to be smelt which is either available as a self-service distributor or provided by the advisor. It is ecoresponsible and exclusively based on paper. Scentouch is a new gesture consisting of the bottle-opening gesture enhanced with the pre-perfumed card. The user takes the card out of the cardboard bottle and smells it or applies it on their skins. Lastly, Scentweave is a pre-perfumed ribbon which customers can tie around their arms for a perfumed immersion that lasts several days. ""Even without the current health context, the countless sprays used at points of sale are a real issue for beauty advisors and air quality. Our pre-perfumed, alcohol-free solutions provide a solution to this problem,"" explains Hélène Grenier, Commercial Director of IDScent. Most manufacturers offer blotters or pre-perfumed labels. Arcade Beauty has developed Scent Talker, a cardboard distributor from which consumers draw a Scentstrip, a small strip containing the encapsulated perfume. Other than V-Shapes, Orlandi also offers different sticker models in the form of spools, blotters and cards. Cheap, ecoresponsible, customizable, quick-to-implement, this mode of distribution on display or involving beauty advisors makes it possible for consumers to quickly discover products at the point of sale or at home. Digital platforms managed by manufacturers like Arcade Beauty and Orlandi are especially meaningful in today's context. Following campaigns launched by brands on social media, the samples are now directly shipped to consumers' homes upon their request for a more customized experience. ""It is a way to implement an even more reassuring, contactless testing strategy, since you receive the sample at home. In addition, as they are one of our brand's main concerns, consumers are considered as part of a caring approach,"" claims Philippe Ughetto. ""We are no longer a mere sample supplier, but a pure player specialized in new discovery ways involving the customer experience, data collection and optimization, and home delivery,"" he continues. Hélène Grenier confirms this assessment. ""Customers are those that request the sample, so they want to test the product and their perception is positive. Our e-sampling solutions are flat, liquid- and alcohol-free, which makes it possible to limit costs, they have a broad scope, and they simplify exports,"" she adds."

"""Our supply chains proved extremely solid,"" Marc Prieur, Aptar","Premium Beauty News - At the peak of the crisis, Aptar Beauty + Home remained reactive by providing their customers with everything needed to manufacture emergency products, like hand sanitizers. How was that possible? Marc Prieur - Aptar is a global group which owns plants all around the world, in particular in China. These sites were the first impacted by the appearance of the new coronavirus. The sanitary measures taken by the group in Asia (social distancing, disinfection…) were naturally copied and improved in Europe. As a result, we were able to react at the right time, quickly comply with regulations, and protect our employees, which is essential. In Europe, we decided to remain open throughout the crisis, but with very contrasted situations depending on the different sites. There were very significant declines in our activities related to certain product categories, while the demand rose for others. That is how some sites ran at full capacity to deliver packaging pieces for sanitizers (pumps, closures, and valves…). As a result, we were able to deliver our products to customers who were not specialized in this trade, like LVMH. As regards logistics, our regional business model, which involves local supply chains, was a real advantage. Long before the crisis, we had implemented a double sourcing system and security stocks. We demonstrated how solid our supply chains are. We did not experience any significant disruption, whereas some of our suppliers temporarily ceased operations. Premium Beauty News - What is the current situation at the different Aptar Beauty + Home sites around the world? Marc Prieur - Our sites are at different phases of the pandemic. Generally speaking, all our plants are operational, but not all are running at full capacity, of course. At certain sites, demand has decreased and we had to rely on technical unemployment solutions where authorized. In China, operations have resumed and things are almost back to normal. In Europe, we are only starting to see the end of the crisis. The situation is less clear in North America, but it is a very resilient market which, for us, is mainly oriented towards personal care, so demand remains strong. Latin America was affected later, so now they are in the middle of the pandemic. The situation is handled much differently depending on the countries. A few of our customers very well-established on the perfume segment have been seriously impacted, although direct selling networks, in particular online sales, have mitigated the impact of the lockdown period. Generally speaking, we have noticed that our customers in Brazil and in the rest of this area are getting organized for fast recovery. It could be achieved soon. But of course, the purchasing power should decline, especially in countries where the social safety net is weaker. Premium Beauty News - The situation is also much contrasted for the different product categories. Marc Prieur - Fragrances - both prestige and mass - are really struggling. It is the most impacted category, ahead of makeup. As for skincare, the situation varies according to product types. On the other hand, personal care and home care, which represent half of our global turnover, are doing well. Of course, sun care and hair styling have declined, but that was offset by the rise of hygiene. In Asia, operations have resumed. There are new projects and real dynamics, and it seems the demand will remain stable. In Europe, it will take some time before suppliers see the effect of consumers going shopping again. Some of our customers closed their offices for almost two months. They are now making an update on their portfolios and stocks. Although this crisis is like no other, we believe brands will first focus on stock reduction, and then, all of a sudden, we will need to deliver faster and faster, in an emergency. That is why it is so important to have very agile regional supply chains! Premium Beauty News – What do you think the market will be like in the short term? Marc Prieur - Again, it is an unprecedented crisis. People spent less money during lockdown, and those who benefit from good social systems did not lose all their revenues. Recovery plans are underway, but we still do not know anything about their content. Reality will vary a lot from one continent to another, even from one country to another. Premium Beauty News - What are the group's advantages in this new environment? Marc Prieur - First, our portfolio diversity. The Beauty + Home market was impacted, but the Food + Beverage market is about to make a good year. As for Pharma, consumption remains stable. Secondly, the crisis revealed both our supply chains' solidity and our regional organization's agility. We are an essential supplier for major global brands. Today, as everyone is talking about relocation, we cannot but notice that, at the end of the day, our business model is perfectly adapted to new expectations and emerging trends. Lastly, our innovation capacity. We are already working on new market trends and beauty product types which will emerge from the crisis! In addition, if environmental protection and sustainability were somewhat marginalized during the crisis, these issues will regain importance. The crisis might even boost change, because it was an opportunity to really become aware of those matters. Aptar invested a lot in this field, so we will de facto be well-positioned. Premium Beauty News - In conclusion, what would you like to tell your customers? Marc Prieur - Our trade will recover from this crisis, just like it did after the previous ones. But a mutual partnership between suppliers and brands will be the best way to deal with turmoil. Everyone needs to make the efforts needed. And we are delighted to see that there is a real constructive dialogue and everyone in our trade helps each other!"
"""Sustainability remains a key issue in luxury packaging"", Marc Pivaudran","Premium Beauty News - How did the Company cope with the confinement and then the de-confinement period? Marc Pivaudran - We stopped production for a month. This decision was motivated by the fact some brands and several suppliers had stopped their activities. We also had to take measures to guarantee the safety of employees. Throughout this period we stayed in contact with our customers to establish delivery priorities when production resumed, and to plan postponements precisely. Premium Beauty News - Did you encounter organizational difficulties? Marc Pivaudran - The reopening of the site on April 20 took place smoothly, our employees were reassured by the measures implemented in the premises: supplies of masks, hydro-alcoholic gel, temperature measurements, organization of flows, working shifts, etc. We regularly assess the situation with their representatives and make the necessary adjustments. Currently, 60% of the workforce has resumed work, i.e., between 100 and 110 employees out of a total workforce of 165. In practice, this situation facilitates the implementation of distancing measures. Our main suppliers are operational. We haven't had to deal with any specific organizational problem. We follow closely the needs of our customers and we adjust our organization according to priorities. Premium Beauty News - What is the situation like in terms of orders? Marc Pivaudran - There were fewer orders of course but the situation was not catastrophic! Some customers delayed by a few months some projects already signed or in development. While some projects were also put on hold. We are fortunate to be involved in the supply of major market references and to be very well supported by our historic customers who provide us with a sufficient load plan, some of them even offering to anticipate payments during this period. The current situation is indeed frustrating because we had an excellent start to the year, with a significant increase in production. But the Company's situation is sound, we have no worries concerning its long-term viability. As a precaution we requested and obtained a loan guaranteed by the State. The challenge now is to prepare for the future and a market recovery which could be very sudden, comparable to what happened during the 2008-2010 crisis. Even if it is difficult to draw a parallel with previous situations, we know that agility and the ability to respond quickly will be important assets when the crisis comes to an end. We have therefore maintained all of our investment plans, in particular the installation of a new anodizing line, even if its implementation was delayed. Premium Beauty News - What is your vision for the short term future? Marc Pivaudran - We have no short-term concerns but rather a lack of visibility. Asia is a important market for many of our customers and we received encouraging feed-back on the fact that recovery is strong and sustainable in the region. However, unknowns remain regarding recovery in air travels and duty free sales. It's too early to tell. At the end of the summer, we will be able to get a clearer picture of the situation. Premium Beauty News - What are the Company's strengths? Marc Pivaudran – First and foremost, our ability to innovate and our agility. I would add, what stands as an important component of our DNA: the drive to take up the most difficult technical challenges! This is where the Company and its teams express themselves best. Finally, one of the key axis of our CSR policy, which has been implemented for a long time and by conviction, is the reduction of our environmental impact. Today, this policy is perfectly in line with the expectations of consumers and brands. We are recognised as experts in perfumes, but we have recently signed some fine developments in make-up and skincare. We are looking to improve our position in these two categories. Premium Beauty News - At a time when the crisis has highlighted the drawbacks of the mass relocation of some productions, do you see an evolution in demands of brands? Marc Pivaudran - We have been contacted by customers who used to produce in Asia and who are now looking to secure their production in Europe. This movement started some time ago, but the crisis contributed this need. However, let's not be naive, the price equation will remain an important factor in many projects and our key competitive advantages stand elsewhere. Premium Beauty News - You had engaged, more particularly, in significant R&D work for the use of recycled aluminium, will the project continue? Marc Pivaudran - Of course! There is a real expectation on the part of our customers, and project studies are underway. While some obstacles are still to be overcome, we will probably be able to deliver the first parts in 2021! This issue shows that the crisis has in no way called into question sustainability commitments! Premium Beauty News - What is your vision of the major post-Covid trends to come? Marc Pivaudran - More than ever, environmental issues, the CSR policies of brands and of their suppliers, will be important issues in the luxury and premium sector. Relocations will accelerate in all sectors. The crisis will have a catalytic effect on all these trends. Premium Beauty News - What would you like to say to your customers today? Marc Pivaudran - Have confidence, you have, in common, with your French suppliers an exceptional know-how that will allow you to meet the most demanding needs."
"""The market needs agile suppliers"", Priscille Caucé, Cosmogen","Premium Beauty News - How did Cosmogen deal with the past few months? What is your assessment? Priscille Caucé - As far as Cosmogen is concerned, the results are positive! We managed to demonstrate our resilience and agility throughout the lockdown period. The figures speak for themselves: our order book increased by 10% over the first quarter, compared to the same period last year. Without the Covid-19 pandemic, 2020 would have been a record year! In practice, we had anticipated the lockdown: as soon as March 10, we made our teams take turns. So, when the quarantine period was announced in France, we were all already working from home. The fact that we anticipated it all helped us remain highly flexible. In terms of operations, it all went well - we are at our customers' service, more than ever. Our priority was to take care of our employees during this harsh period. Our watchwords were: ""respect and caring"". Our teams' solidarity and solidity also made Cosmogen really proud during lockdown. Premium Beauty News - This period also resulted in significant announcements, in particular the merging of Cosmogen's activities with those of PYC, your dispensing subsidiary. Priscille Caucé - This decision has nothing to do with the ongoing crisis. We saw the dispensing market's consolidation as an opportunity. We wanted our customers to benefit from a third player, but on a reasonable basis, by setting up an alternative to the current offering which would mainly target the high-end skincare segment. As a result, we are now involved in three trades: packaging and applicators, brushes & accessories, and dispensing. Premium Beauty News - You have also launched a ""safe contact"" offering! Priscille Caucé - During the crisis, our strategy was clearly focused on the future and on action: ""Outside of your comfort zone is where the magic happens!"" Throughout the lockdown period, we went on with our projects and worked on our offering and communication. We launched major projects, in particular in terms of innovation, and we reviewed our schedule to add even more launches. That is how we actually launched and registered the ""safe contact"" label, because our products - in particular several of our bestsellers - are perfectly adapted to the rising demand for hygiene as regards product application, and to this desire to no longer apply products on the face with our hands. Our current customers are very enthusiastic when we introduce our range focusing on these arguments. This approach meets a real consumer need. Premium Beauty News - As an SME, what do you think about your own situation as regards the concentration of suppliers and subcontractors? Priscille Caucé - In fact, this concentration movement offers much freedom, because the market also needs very agile players. We are a multi-material, multi-area supplier with a differentiating positioning on the market. Thanks to the diversity of our network of partners, we can satisfy requests of 5,000 or several millions of units. We set up partnerships with the suppliers with whom we have been working for several decades, but we do not have to use our own production tool. Premium Beauty News - How do you see your future in the short term? Priscille Caucé - We are neither peaceful nor worried. We are turned towards the future: we know that in the short term, economies throughout the world will be receding. And although we have made progress over the past few months, we know we may be impacted in the near future, just like others. The two months during which retailers closed will obviously have an impact on sales and suppliers. The situation will not be the same in all world regions. China and Asia should remain dynamic. Latin America will be impacted, but it should soon pick up again. In North America, the pandemic was a big shock, but we trust their ability to bounce back. We bank on innovation to meet our customers' expectations. The ""safe contact"" label is a perfect example. Premium Beauty News - The crisis also resulted in significant expectations in terms of ethics and sustainability. Some people even talk about a new trend: going hyperlocal. Priscille Caucé - Our strategy consists in localizing our production according to our commercial hubs to be as close as possible to our customers. Today, we produce in Asia, Europe, Brazil, for South America, and Mexico, for North America. In France, we produce a few ranges of tottles in partnership with Qualiform, and we have been exchanging with other partners in Europe to meet our customers' expectations in terms of agility, time-to-market, proximity… In addition, we keep intensifying our CSR commitment with new materials and developments. We now have an Ecocert-certified offering. Premium Beauty News - Any message for your customers? Priscille Caucé - We are here for you, we are operational, and we are on your side, as suppliers, to help you and co-create tomorrow's products with you!"
Aptar responds to the demand for refillable fragrances with new screw pump,"Pioneered by Thierry Mugler, refilling solutions for perfumes have made their way into the industry, with brands such as Louis Vuitton, Guerlain, Viktor&Rolf or By Kilian, among other, offering their customers with the possibility to refill the bottles of their favourite fragrances instead of throwing them away. Responding to the growing demand for more sustainable packaging solutions, the Essencia Screw pump allows fragrances glass bottles to be refilled and the pump to be reused. ""Contemporary fragrance consumers are increasingly demanding products that are both beautiful and sustainable. Offering refillable fragrances responds to key concerns modern consumers have around reducing packaging waste. The Essencia Screw provides eco-consumers with a simple means of refilling and reusing both the fragrance bottle and pump,"" explains the packaging provider. Thanks to an internal plastic ring, the metal collar of the new pump remains separated from the glass bottle, reducing the risk of friction that would cause the bottle neck to break as the pump is being screwed off or on. For the consumer, this ensures the bottle and pump can be reused numerous times. ""The aesthetic of the Screw pump is similar to a crimped pump, with a collar diameter that is the same as the FEA15 standard,"" explains Aptar Beauty + Home. The Essencia Screw pump is suitable for 15/400 threaded necks and is available in both 70μl and 100μl dosage, providing additional options for fragrance manufacturers. ""In production as of March 2020, Essencia Screw opens up a new segment in a mutating market, at a time when manufacturers and consumers alike are being challenged to look to a different future with hope. With the launch of Essencia Screw, Aptar Beauty + Home once again confirms its commitment to sustainability, delivering a modern, trendy product that will help drive the fragrance market of tomorrow"", concludes Aptar. With a similar goal, Aptar Beauty + Home also launched last year a screwable version of its La Petite pump, renowned for its invisible body."
"""We are disrupting decoration processes of cosmetic tubes,"" Valérie Lebelt, Albéa","Premium Beauty News - Higher sustainability requirements, reduced time to market, shorter series: the cosmetic tube market is undergoing major transformations! Valérie Lebelt - Undeniably! We have witnessed both a transformation of expectations and an acceleration of the market. First, the requirement for durability really took centre stage, with the development of more durable materials and a lightening of tubes. For plastic tubes, our range of tubes incorporating Post-Consumer Recycled or bio-sourced resins has expanded considerably. On the side of laminated tubes, they also make it possible to imagine multi-layer structures combining recyclability, innovation and formula protection. These changes also transform the way the body of the tube is printed. The most notable example is the paper tube that we presented with L'Oréal at the last Luxe Pack show in Monaco and which will be launched very soon on the market. Not only are the properties of the material different in production, but the brown colour of the paper also changes printing constraints. Another change: because of the rise of indie brands and the tendency of historic brands to imitate their test and learn practices, we are asked for shorter series. At the same time, the time to market constraint is becoming increasingly important. Today, development times for a new product are of 4 to 6 weeks. A couple of years ago, they were of 3 months... Finally, there is a growing need for differentiation. In the tube market, a highly standardized product, this differentiation mostly involves the decor, whose importance is further increased by the visual imperative, what we call instagramization, and the trend towards premiumisation. In short, we are always asked for more agility, responsiveness, innovation and reliability! And our ability to quickly and efficiently develop new decors is central to this transformation. Premium Beauty News - Is the Covid-19 pandemic impacting these trends? Valérie Lebelt - The current health crisis mostly highlights the importance of being able to rely on a flexible supply, – to avoid being immobilized by the disruption of a supplier or a country–, and of being reactive, to adapt quickly to sudden changes in the market. And there again, while tubes remain relatively standardized, it is our ability to transfer the decoration processes from one production site to another that will, or not, guarantee continuity of supply. Premium Beauty News - Hence a commitment to digitalization? Valérie Lebelt - It's much more than that, it's a real transformation in the way tubes are developed and decorated! Indeed some technical stages can be accelerated and their reliability increased thanks to digitization. But it also enables to manage projects in a collaborative mode, and ensure transparency from start to finish. A few weeks ago, I would have advocated the benefits of digital collaboration in order to exchange between technical departments, between manufacturing sites, and of course interact with our customers, and thus accelerate and increase the reliability of the development of a new decor. Today, I would add that this also allows quickly multiplying production in our different sites, in different countries, and thus make supplies more flexible and secure. Technically, digital printing obviously offers many advantages in terms of speed of execution, agility and personalization. All this looks very attractive but, in practice, buying a digital printer is not enough. Results can only be reliable if the upstream process is controlled. Going digital, means we get rid of end of line adjustments but on the other hand we generate new needs upstream. And because of the time to markets pressure, we must ensure that we master pre-press operations, the development of colours, the design of tools. Mastering the entire graphic chain is therefore both a quality and time-to-market issue. This is the core of our Decor & Development 4.0 programme. We called upon Esko, a graphic chain specialists who has become a real partner in the digital transformation of our decor development process. Esko provides us with latest generation tools, as well as a collaborative platform to manage projects - first for those related to a new décor, but with a focus on complete developments, including in particular the material, the cap, the applicator. First within Albéa, but with the aim of an integrated digital interface with our customers. Premium Beauty News - In practical term, how does this translate today for your customers? Valérie Lebelt - Very quickly, we understood that the work of standardization and control of decoration parameters, upstream production, could allow us to make a simulation regarding the results of the printed decoration, outside production lines, what we call proofing. Our customers always receive a real sample! What changes is that we can do without the production test which represents a significant cost and generates an additional delay of 4 to 5 weeks as well as the use of almost 300 kg of plastic material. Concretely, our work on the graphic chain allowed us to completely standardize the formulation of colours and printout results on the most common materials. We use proofing systems - small digital machines that allow printing the decor directly on the tube support and which can be calibrated with the machine - to obtain a result representative of what will be achieved with the production machine. This save a considerable amount of time and a huge cost reduction since it only requires 150g of material! And for our customers, they no longer need to make a trip to the production site! We estimated that the carbon saving corresponds to the lighting of a lamp bulb for 43 years. Premium Beauty News - What are the first feedbacks? Valérie Lebelt - I can tell you that customers who do not have the necessary resources to carry out the production test, really appreciated this additional service! For our other customers, it is obviously a change in habits with the fear that the sample received will not be as realistic as the end result. But actually, there is a keen interest from our customers, because the equation also includes time and cost savings. The development phase being cheaper, the commercial quotation is adjusted and they can receive their sample in just two days, against 4 to 6 weeks before. Premium Beauty News - What are the next steps? Valérie Lebelt - The current crisis prompted us to roll out this solution earlier than we had expected. This solution is already available in Europe for laminated tube decorations, it will also be available this summer for plastic tube decorations, but also for the entire development process of a new tube, including in particular the material and the cap - and our collaborative and secure platform will also be open to our customers. Developing a new tube has changed into a collaborative, efficient, quickly led project, resulting in time, money, plastic and carbon emission savings! The last stage will then be its introduction in the United States and then Asia…"
"3D printing, from Chanel's new mascara brush to the current health emergency","Two years ago, Chanel had made a statement in the global beauty sphere by premiering a mascara, the Volume Revolution, equipped with the first 3D-printed brush manufactured on an industrial scale. A product, which has since its launch, consistently ranked among the top 5 bestsellers in Europe. ERPRO 3D Factory recently signed Volume Stretch, Chanel's new mascara brush, also industrially produced via 3D printing. ""With this new launch of Volume Stretch, we are going even further on the 'crazy' side of the design, with truly differentiating shapes, to further improve eyelash lengthening. For us, this is a third incredible chapter written alongside Chanel,"" confirmed Cyrille Vue. The extremely precise shape of the brush is fitted with 5 sets of bristles implanted in ellipse with at the centre, a hollow core. A brush shape, which would have been impossible to achieve without the help of 3D technology. The material, like the previous model, is biosourced from castor oil. ""This material has amazing properties that we actually use a lot; recyclable and hyper resistant, it has existed for 70 years. What is more, castor oil is a plant that grows in fallow areas and requires very little water,"" added Cyrille Vue. As with all previous models, ERPRO owns the license for the patents filed. In the meantime, ERPRO 3D Factory has also participated in the E.Y.E. (Exhaust Your Ego) programme, which gives Chanel customers the possibility to personalize, from a dozen models proposed and according to the shape of their eyes, their mascara brush at the store counter. Lock-down measures having led to the cessation of its production lines, ERPRO very quickly endeavoured to manufacture products in demand by hospitals. ""We first started manufacturing protective visors which we offered to the APHP (Paris Hospitals), clinics and nursing homes. Then we manufactured spare parts for respirators which were sent to Spain, adaptors to fit on Decathlon scuba masks, thus diverting them from their primary purpose, to serve as respirators in hospitals. Most recently, we collaborated with the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) to develop new valves for respirators,"" explained the manager. At the heart of this unique context, 3D printing plays a central role. Its incomparable advantages when it comes to producing the most complex parts in no time, have made it an ally of choice in a context of emergency production. ""All the makers [1] of France joined forces to become in a few days an agile and nationwide production plant capable of manufacturing thousands of these parts and of dispatching them the following days. No other Industry is capable of doing that, among material converters,"" highlighted Cyrille Vue. Apart from its speed of execution, the technology also stands out through its ability to model complex, non-injectable parts. ""This crisis highlighted the fact that our country was home to clever industrial players, but that if we did not promote this 'made in France', this specificity would slowly disappear. Our political authorities must understand that it takes a minimum of sovereignty over the long term to ensure that this momentum is maintained,"" concluded the entrepreneur."
Aptar reorganizes its production to join the fight against the coronavirus,"As manufacturers of personal care and cosmetic products around the world have quickly mobilized to produce essential items such as hand sanitizers and anti-bacterial products to help health workers and all others in the front-line in the fight against SARS-COV-2, Aptar mobilized its world-class production capabilities to respond to the urgent need for large quantities of essential items like pumps and closures. Thus, Aptar delivered Satine and Euroflow pumps ""in record time"" to French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, one of the country's first major companies, when they decided to repurpose their cosmetics manufacturing facilities to produce hydroalcoholic hand sanitisers. The German subsidiary of French beauty giant L'Oréal also praised Aptar for its ability to quickly deliver GS lotion pumps which enabled it to begin producing hand sanitisers in mid-March, as lockdown restrictions were being enacted across Europe. ""Key to such successful outcomes has been Aptar's ability to leverage international manufacturing facilities despite strict controls on the movement of goods across European borders,"" explains the company in a statement. For instance, Aptar Italia produced GSA pumps for Spanish manufacturer Laboratorios Maverick, enabling it to speed up production of hand sanitizers for hospitals in the country. Similarly, bottles of hand sanitizer that were donated from the Groupe Rocher to the University Hospital of Rennes, in the West of France, were equipped with Aptar's GS lotion pump and transport safety clips. Furthermore, Aptar is not staying away from the solidarity movement. Aptar Beauty + Home's Full-Service team is deploying its capabilities to manufacture and donate bottles of hand sanitisers equipped with Aptar HighFlow pumps to pharmacies and clinics in the Auvergne-Rhône Alpes region, in France. In response to the urgent need for protective masks, one of Aptar's very own Product Design Engineers, based in Illinois, is making a difference in his community by personally 3D printing face shields and ear guards for local hospitals and fire departments. ""Aptar is particularly proud of the efforts of its employees during this challenging time, employees have been quick to reveal a commendable generosity of spirit. Upon their own initiation, workers at Aptar Italia raised EUR 12,050 for the local hospital, while employees at Aptar's Torello site in Spain have also begun raising money internally to donate to the Hospital General de Vic. In response, Aptar has committed to doubling the funds raised by staff,"" adds the group. Similarly, the teams of Aptar Charleval, Aptar Verneuil, Aptar Oyonnax, Aptar Poincy, in France, Aptar Madrid, in Spain, Aptar Ballinasloe, in Ireland, have undertaken diverse initiatives to help local hospitals. For its part, the group is committed to providing the best solutions and services to its partners, while focusing on the health and safety of its employees throughout the duration of the global Covid-19 pandemic. ""We have taken all necessary steps to protect our front- line manufacturing teams to ensure we can continue to produce products essential to fighting the pandemic, such as pumps and closures for hand sanitizers and anti-bacterial products, pharma solutions that help save lives,"" says Aptar. The Aptar group says it will continue to monitor and analyse its global processes and responses as the pandemic evolves. ""Our Covid-19 Global Action Team is meeting daily and has instigated the Covid-19 Exposure Control Plan to protect our employees and operations. This ensures business continuity while prioritizing the health of our employees will continue to be our primary focus during this difficult time,"" concludes the company."
Iggesund wants to become totally free from fossil fuels,"""The focus is now clearly on sustainability issues and it will stay there. We're also seeing that our customers' interest and expertise in sustainability is constantly increasing,"" says Iggesund Paperboard's Sustainability Director Johan Granås. The subsidiary of the Swedish forest industry group Holmen has invested more than EUR 380 million to increase its energy efficiency and reduce the fossil emissions from its production. In 2019, Iggesund Paperboard's two paperboard mills, at Iggesund, Sweden and Workington, England, both reported advances in reducing their climate impact and water consumption, on top of fantastic safety work all year. In particular, the Workington Mill achieved a production record for its Incada board in 2019 while also making it through the entire year without a single hour's absence due to a work-related lost-time injury (LTI). ""The mill's fantastic and systematic work to improve its work environment and safety over many years has definitely paid off! Workington's zero LTI result for 2019 is an inspiration and role model for all our workplaces,"" Granås says, visibly impressed. Thanks to significant investments in the transition of its energy systems from fossil fuels to biomass, Iggesund Paperboard mill's were operated on over 90 per cent bioenergy in 2019. The group's mills can thereby produce packaging paperboard with very low fossil carbon dioxide emissions. ""Our long-term goal is to be totally fossil free, and we've come a long way,"" Granås says. In 2019, the Iggesund mill in Sweden managed to reduce its energy consumption by approximately 90 GWh, which is equivalent to the energy consumption of 3,500 detached houses. All in all, the mill produced Invercote by using 98.6 per cent bioenergy, leading to a significant reduction of its carbon dioxide emissions. Furthermore, during the past year, the Iggesund mill has worked to make its energy operators aware that some of their decisions also impact the climate, and has encouraged them to include those aspects in their set targets. ""We've always said that it's not the big machines that make the paperboard, it's the people. And we've also applied that approach to the issue of greenhouse gases,"" Johan Granås explains. ""We're incredibly proud of the commitment our employees are showing to these issues! We've held trainings to raise awareness, and of course the climate debate of recent years has also sharpened the focus on these issues,"" he continues. Of course, as the goal of 100% bioenergy becomes closer, it becomes more difficult to further reduce fossil fuel emissions. ""But there's only one way forward for us and that's straight ahead,"" says Johan Granås. However, the climate footprint of paperboard is not solely due to the mills. Transport has thus become an increasingly important sustainability issue for Iggesund Paperboard. According to the company, the dramatic reduction of carbon emissions in the production process of Invercote and Incada has paradoxically led to increase the relative weight of transport in the paperboard's climate footprint. Some customers of the group in both Asia and America therefore wonder how shipping paperboard from Sweden to Japan or the USA can be a good choice in climate terms. ""Our calculations show that this is currently the case, but as other mills shift to using more bioenergy, we must reduce our own transport emissions to preserve our lead,"" Granås explains. He adds that Iggesund Paperboard is working closely with its logistics suppliers to find alternative transport solutions that further reduce emissions. When it comes to water consumption, extensive projects are being implemented at both mills. Last year, Iggesund Mill reduced its water usage by about 10 per cent but Granås says the company is not yet satisfied. ""We can still do more at Iggesund Mill to lessen our water consumption. The fact that historically our water usage has been relatively high is no doubt because for over 100 years our production has never been disrupted by any water shortage. We're fortunate to be in a location with excellent water resources."" Reducing water consumption of Iggesund Paperboard's paperboard mills is now one of the group's main goals for the year 2020 as a whole. ""During 2020 we will do more work on our key areas of sustainability – health, climate and water – so that we can continue to live up to the market's high sustainability demands,"" Johan Granås promises."
"Cosmogen features ""safe contact"" as a key point for cosmetics solutions","Cosmogen offers solutions that meet these new requirements of ""safe contact"". Whether it is a pack with integrated applicator (Squeeze'n, Cosmo +, Tense), a formula in a jar, tube or airless bottle with separate applicator (spatulas, brushes, Cosmoblender etc), a massage accessory (roll on, fresh pearl, ridoki) or hygiene accessory (cleansing ball), a large range of solutions exists at Cosmogen. It allows a great creativity for brands, for which differentiation and desirability of skincare and make-up products, remain key words. Cosmogen ""safe contact"" solutions: Download the full presentation of the application and packaging solutions. Cosmogen has integrated this request for over 10 years in the development of new products. The famous Squeeze'n range, that was born in 2006, keeps extending with new applicators. It is now available with recycled or bio-based material. It matches all requirements, from safe contact, to eco-friendly design, while protecting the formula and providing wellness and efficiency. As a reminder, it is characterized by a patented rotary on/off system, allowing to open, distribute, close, apply the formula and then wash the applicator. The Tense tube, born in 2015, also allows to apply formulas without any contact with hands, especially on sensitive areas around the lips or eyes. It has been redesigned so that its tip is removable and therefore washable. It also facilitates recycling since the components can be separated. Also, the development of applicators, such as silicone brushes and washable spatulas, makes it possible to avoid any contact with the formula. In other words, no more fingers in the jar! The evolution of materials, their combination with antibacterial agents (cosmoblender), further reinforce safety."
"""This unprecedented crisis spurs creativity,"" François Luscan, Albéa","Premium Beauty News - Albéa was highly responsive by reorienting its production and increasing strongly its supplies of tubes for gels and hydro-alcoholic solutions and of pumps for hygiene products. How was this possible? François Luscan - I am particularly proud of my teams and the efforts made in the face this crisis of unprecedented violence. When our Chinese factories started being impacted in January, we hoped the turmoil would only be limited to Asia. But being present in the region allowed us to learn quickly and, when the health crisis spread, to transpose some good practices across all of our sites. Fortunately, we already had a strong track-record in terms of health and safety, which have long been our priorities. We also anticipated, in theory, the onset of serious events, with business continuity plans, identified health advisers, stocks of protective equipment, governance plans. With the staff representatives and teams in charge of health and safety within the Company, I am extremely proud of what we all were able to implement, - and this on a global level -, and to disseminate the right practices within the Group. The anticipation and the perfect preparation of both the Company and the teams, enabled to keep our sites running and be operational and reactive. To this, I must add an exceptional spirit of cooperation and solidarity, within the Group and across the entire sector. When some of our customers called us on a Saturday because they were desperate to find packaging solutions for their production of hand sanitizers, everyone came together to provide them with solutions. The laboratory, the design office, the production teams and our entire supply chain made every effort to cope with the emergency. Employees went, in a short time, from a state of legitimate worry to that of a real commitment to the protective measures taken by the Company. From this exceptional period, it is the solidarity and the sense of cooperation of each and every one that I will remember. Of course, there were some exceptions, but behaviours were generally exemplary. Premium Beauty News - Gels and hydroalcoholic solutions… these products were usually seen in plastic bottles? François Luscan - It's true, but I think that needs far exceeded the usual production capacities. Our customers knew that tubes were readily available, they had the necessary expertise to condition them on their lines, and on the other hand, compatibility tests already existed. Concerning the pumps, they were already used for soaps, foams, skincare creams. Premium Beauty News - How is the container/content compatibility checked in such short notice? François Luscan - Fortunately, we also know how to work in anticipation! In particular, upstream our standard formulas, we constantly test new formulations, and we check their compatibility with our different tube structures. Fortunately, this was the case for hydro-alcoholic gels. What happened in China also allowed us to jump the gun. And, in such an exceptional situation, there was a lot of data exchanged along the value chain. Premium Beauty News - How was the implementation of barrier gestures disseminated in factories? François Luscan - The experience acquired at the start of the crisis by our four Chinese sites gave us a slight head start. When the epidemic spread, we duplicated the schemes of good practices, initially designed for China, and ramped them up. We set up training sessions, created explanatory videos, posters. Distancing rules implied rethinking the layout of workshops, of changing rooms, actually of all processes. The wearing of a mask became widespread. In sites located at the heart of hard hit areas, like our Bottanuco factory near Bergamo in Italy, after discussing it with the employees, we even implemented systematic temperature check-ups. Hence, shared workspaces are regularly disinfected, as well as all workshops and premises in case of suspected positive cases. Of course, we supply our employees with masks and hydro-alcoholic gels. Our site in Indonesia has for instance started producing visors and masks. Premium Beauty News - Hand sanitizers and hygiene products are in great demand today, but other categories are idle. How do these upheavals translate in terms of production? François Luscan - All our tube production units are currently running in Western Europe (particularly Argonne and Vandières in France, or Colchester in England), in Eastern Europe and Russia (with Łubna in Poland), India, Indonesia, Mexico, Brazil, the United States, South Africa! In some cases, considerable efforts were required to adapt the production chains, sometimes with less staff, in particular because vulnerable employees were asked to stay at home. This was the case for some sites in France and Italy. Demand for hygiene products and dermatological products sold in pharmacies also stimulates demand for pumps dedicated to foaming products or hand care products. Our sites in France, the Netherlands, the United States and Indonesia are currently responding to these needs. We also have to address a significant demand for the packaging of hair colouring kits. Our tube and hygiene pump sites are run at around 90% of their capacity. Conversely, the situation is more complicated for production sites specializing in make-up and perfumes. Mainly due to a drop in demand, because at the operational level, the measures taken in agreement with the employees enable our lines to run. Overall, I would say that our make-up and perfume sites are running at 50% of their capacity. Thanks to the remarkable support of our customers we were able to keep on producing and completing stocks, but we also had to recourse to short-time working in some sites. Finally, our activities dedicated to bags and kits for airline companies, are undoubtedly the hardest hit. We remain close to our customers, to prepare their next launches, even postponed ones or those requiring redesigning. And to reflect on the world to come! Premium Beauty News - What do think the post-crisis background will look like for the beauty world? François Luscan - I believe we can analyse what is happening in three stages. The first stage is that of the crisis, of our bewilderment. No one expected what happened, we were all taken by surprise. Companies in many countries are still at this stage, and there is no denying that it was a serious blow to the whole market. Then come will come the time for questioning, analysis, stabilization, with sites reorganized around a ""new normal"". People will start considering the recovery, to discuss projects. I think we have now reached this stage, at least in Europe. And before us there is the post-covid19 world. I recently saw the title of a report prepared by my teams on post-Covid trends: Nothing should go back to normal. Normal wasn't working. We are all hearing the need for change. In our business we are particularly attentive to our customers and their market research; and what these market analyses mostly highlight is a huge need for transformation. Our Innovation teams have ideas, launch projects. All indicators show that the crisis will accelerate the transformation of the society and of consumption patterns. Of course, there will be important differences depending of regions in the world, but expectations in terms of environmental protection, of packaging recyclabilty should be reinforced. We are also undoubtedly tending to even more transparency, safety and benevolence. We will have to reinvent ourselves, find new solutions meeting new needs. In summary, the economic and societal background will be, I fear, more difficult to deal with anything I have known, but there will be opportunities for innovation, in all areas. Thanks to the support of our shareholder but also of exceptional customers, and thanks to the commitment of our teams, we will show resiliency. Reinvent and reinventing yourself, even in times of crisis, remains exciting."
UK studio launches a competition for new hand-sanitizer pump designs,"Creatives, designers, makers and architects are all being invited to submit fresh ideas for hydroalcoholic gel and soap pumps to the ""Fountain of Hygiene"" competition organised by the British design studio Bompas & Parr. The various projects will go on show at the Design Museum in London from April 9 to May 7 next, health crisis permitting.

Contestants have until March 29 to submit their creations. A shortlist of projects will then be selected by a panel of judges. If conditions do not allow for an exhibition at the Design Museum, the entries will be shown online. Contestants are free to ""design or enhance sanitizer pumps, sprays, wipes, dispenser units or even gestures and rituals."" Bompas & Parr aims to use the means at its disposal to reduce the physical, social and economic impact of the virus. It also wants to highlight initiatives such as the LVMH group's use of its cosmetics production lines to produce hydroalcoholic gel, or the Washyourlyrics.com website by @neoncloth, which generates instructions to wash your hands accompanied by the song of your choice. Museum director Tim Marlow pointed out, ""Design has an important role in helping to solve many of the challenges that we face in daily life including some of those raised by the recent COVID-19 outbreak. We hope that the shortlisted entries of the Sanitizer Design Competition will demonstrate the importance of research and innovative thinking."""
"""We want to expand in the high-end segment,"" Vijay Shah, Piramal Glass","Premium Beauty News - Currently, what is the position of Piramal Glass on the global glass packaging business? Vijay Shah - We operate four glass manufacturing facilities in India, Sri Lanka and the USA and several decoration plants. Approximately 40 percent of our sales are in the high-end cosmetics and perfumery market, with a turnover of US$140 million approximately. During the 2019 fiscal, we have sold around 2 billion pieces of nail polish bottles, around 550 million pieces of perfume bottle, and around 60 million pieces of skin care jars. Our Cosmetics & Perfumery business has grown at a CAGR of 12 percent over the last decade and globally we have been working very with 14 of the global top-20 beauty brands. To further expand, upgrade, and modernize our glass manufacturing and glass decoration facilities in India, we are investing approximately US$98 million. We are planning a substantial greenfield expansion at Jambusar in India, brownfield expansions at both Jambusar and Kosamba - India, and expansion of our decoration facility at Kosamba, India. Premium Beauty News - PGL is also investing in state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment? Vijay Shah - We are focused on executing our Digital strategy to transform every aspect of our business to become a more agile organization. We have setup a dedicated Digital team and made substantial investments in digital technologies, including Internet-of-Things (IoT), Augmented Reality, Analytics, Cloud and Artificial Intelligence. By pioneering Industry 4.0 (Smart Manufacturing) best practices, we aim to make our production process faster, more efficient and elevate mass customization to new levels. As part of our data-driven approach and overall Digital strategy, we have successfully implemented multiple digital initiatives, including a real-time plant monitoring system to improve production efficiency, voice recognition and video analytics system to enhance productivity, and a real-time transportation tracking system to enable supply-chain visibility. Premium Beauty News - How does PGL addresses the sustainability challenge? Vijay Shah - In our glass-container manufacturing and decoration processes, our constant aim is to create value through the three pillars of sustainability - Economic, Social, and Environmental. Glass is a sustainable, fully recyclable material, which provides great environmental benefits. Over the years, we have made significant transformations in strengthening our core infrastructure and processes to accomplish our Sustainability Goals. We not only meet our global regulatory requirements but also make significant contributions towards building a globally sustainable ecosystem by deploying green initiatives. We have successfully reduced energy usage, cut carbon emissions and footprint, increased the amount of recycled glass, and created a safer and greener ecosystem. We are an ISO 14001 organization and we constantly invest in environmental preservation. As a part of our commitment to contributing to the global environment, we have tied up with 'Believers in Glass', the social movement that highlights the benefits of using glass. As part of our sustainability strategy, we have added renewable power sources in our energy consumption portfolio. We have successfully installed a Solar Roof-Top system of 4.4 MW at our India facilities and of 3.0 MW at our Sri Lanka facility. Solar Energy generation is not only contributing to green power generation but also helping us in rationalizing the energy cost. In the near future, we are planning to install more Solar Roof-Top systems and large-scale Solar-Farms. We have also successfully installed four Wind-Power systems generating 8.4 MW in India. All our furnaces are equipped to handle dual fuel systems and designed to create better efficiency and minimum emissions. To make the furnaces more energy efficient, few of them are equipped with an Electric Boosting system along with Natural Gas. Natural gas is preferred for combustion since it has very less content of sulphur, burns more cleanly than other fossil fuels, and emits lower levels of harmful emissions. As a preferred energy source, our furnaces use Natural Gas for more than 90 percent of the time. We have been recycling glass for more than three decades. Reusing used glass has vastly improved the environmental balance of our glass production. We regularly invest in the right infrastructure and processes to collect, sort, distribute, and recycle used glass, to scale up sustainability. We are maximizing the intake of cullet in our furnaces. For the production of clear and amber glass, we can use up to 60 percent of used glass. To increase the quantity of glass to be recycled, we have launched a Post-Consumer Recycled (PCR) glass campaign to support glass recycling by local consumers. Lightweight glass containers also reduce energy and raw material consumption, thereby saving resources. With our new production techniques and in-house expertise, the manufacturing of thin-walled, lightweight glass containers is becoming more feasible.

LPI is setting foot in Europe and stepping up its international development,"Determined to show that Chinese manufacturing can also be synonymous with quality and innovation, the LPI Group, which was present at the PCD trade show last January, will also take part to Édition Spéciale by Luxe Pack, on May 26 and 27 in Paris and Cosmopack in Bologna, Italy, from September 03 to 06, 2020. ""Innovation is one of the Group's strong value and the relationship to manual work is evolving in China to become, today, a social issue. The industry is facing several challenges: improving working conditions of employees, creating high added value qualified jobs whilst maintaining competitiveness in the face of rising labour costs. For Mr. Lao, the CEO of our group, the answer lies in automation and industry 4.0. In practice, this has resulted in the deployment of artificial-intelligence solutions developed by our teams and applied to injection moulding, assembly and the flow of components within the factory. The result is a significant reduction in waste and consumables, clean-room production conditions, an improved ecological footprint and a reduction in production lead times (4 weeks instead of 5 to 6 previously) In addition, LPI is the first factory in the world to automate the manufacture of injection moulding tools, thus halving the lead times (3 weeks to present the first elements of a 16-cavity mould) and offering a significant time to market advantage to customers,"" explains Olivier Faye, Head of Business Development & Innovation within LPI's European office. Founded in 1999, the Company has its roots in Yuyao, near Shanghai, and today has two production sites (Lao Plastic Industries and Joly Beauty), three sales offices in China (Guangzhou, Yiwu, Shanghai) and offices in Tokyo and Paris. The Group produces Airless, pouch and piston packs, but also atmospheric pumps, skincare jars, lipstick mechanisms, make-up cases, waterproof compacts and lip glosses. The skincare market currently accounts for most of its sales but the Group is seeking to develop its position in the make-up segment by offering innovative processes and packs. Dedicated to the injection of small and medium series, with a production area of 22,000 m2, Joly Beauty, the historic site, employs 700 people and offers on site packaging manufacture and the full range of decoration and surface treatment techniques. Mainly dedicated to larger series, the second site, Lao Plastic Industries, which was inaugurated in 2017, has a production area of 40,000 m2. According to LPI officials, it is the first fully digitalized and automated plastic injection site in China. ""The Group is to date, the leader in industry 4.0 dedicated to cosmetic plastic packaging. We were the first to take the leap towards fully automated injection lines. The objective is to produce higher quality, faster and at a lower price, while reducing the environmental impact. It's a virtuous circle,"" says Olivier Faye. ""For instance, our pumps and Airless systems are therefore manufactured and assembled automatically, from the injection to the packing phases. However, visual checks are still performed at the end of the production line, because automatic detection systems today do not equal the human eye."" Production in a controlled atmosphere provides guarantees of hygiene and cleanliness for the manufacture of containers meant for increasingly fragile formulas. Surface treatments, such as UV lacquering or metallization, are sensitive to dust, and there too, production conditions make it possible to reduce dust and waste levels, and thus reduce scrap levels and improve the ecological footprint of the production site. The Group also integrates an automated injection tool making line. ""The quality and dimensional precision of the moulds are essential for the quality of the final product and we are also positioning ourselves as a leader in this field."" The automation of the LPI site also includes the replacement of cartons and pallets by resin boxes and reusable packaging materials, which helps reduces consumables, costs and the environmental impact. LPI is also working on refillable solutions, on reducing the number of parts in pumps and on lighter solutions. Finally, to meet expectations in terms of eco-design, LPI has recently focused its efforts on sustainable plastic resins (PCR, biocomposites, biodegradable resins based on PLA or starch and ocean plastic waste, and seeks to develop partnerships with new resin suppliers on the market. Building on its industrial assets, LPI has set out to expand its presence outside of China with the opening of a sales office in Paris and Japan in 2019. The Group is also present in North America, through long-standing partnerships, and is seeking to enter the Brazilian market. ""The two factories of the Group, Lao Plastic Industries and Joly Beauty Packaging, who already enjoys strong partnerships with the leaders of the local Chinese market, have a strong growth potential to offer to major international brands, who would like to benefit from the advantages offered by the Group: time to market, quality, clean room production, competitiveness and environmental responsibility,"" adds Olivier Faye. Beyond these values for innovation and excellence, LPI boasts its CSR policy, with its new site, an example in terms of consumption and waste reduction, and which has adopted a proactive gender equality policy, and equality of pay in line with the market. ""We are aware of the high expectations of international customers, in terms of costs, quality, delivery times and reduction of the environmental impact. We want to work as closely as possible with their teams, with the creation in the future, of a real innovation and development pole in Europe, which will complement our pole in Asia,"" concludes Olivier Faye.

"SIMP, how to create a custom mascara brush in minutes?","SIMP currently offers its customers a choice of standard brushes from its catalogue or a custom development of their brush, in line with the desired make-up results. In the case of a custom development, the deadline is usually of 4 months, from the design of the functional mock-ups, including the pilot mould, to the creation of the final production mould. To meet time to market requirements, which are particularly tight in the make-up sector, SIMP now offers its customers a new service, ""Le Rendez Vous"", inviting them to come and create their own brush on site and obtain almost immediately a validated model. ""At this 'Rendez Vous', we will provide our customers with different families of bristles from our catalogue, which they will be able to assemble, mix and mix on a 7-scale model, according to the desired result,"" explains Laureen Decras, Marketing Director. The mascara formula is given beforehand to SIMP in order to test its compatibility with the various plastic materials proposed by the manufacturer for the brush. Once the scale model has been completed by the customer, it is immediately passed on to the moulding technician, who produces the model on site using different plastic materials with different levels of flexibility, thus changing the desired volume or precision effect. ""Our innovation is based on an injection tool, which is capable of moulding any type of bristle or brush from our catalogue immediately. This allows customers to skip the entire prototyping phase,"" continues Caroline Lechalupe, Project Manager. The customer then validates his choice of final material before moving directly to the production phase. As a result, this project is co-developed in one day instead of several months for a cost similar to that of a traditional approach. ""The aim of this process, involving the brand at this stage, is to enable the brand to put forward its own identity through the applicator,"" adds Laureen Decras. Following this principle, SIMP will launch, in early June, an application that will allow all its customers based around the world, to attend theses workshops via videoconferencing, thus allowing them to save time and travel expenses. ""They will be able to produce their own brush remotely via the application. The actual moulding will be performed at SIMP, and thanks to an immediate test panel our customer will be able to benefit from real-time feedback via a webcam to immediately assess the make-up result and the effectiveness of the applicator that he is in the process of creating, then through express shipment, a sample is sent to him,"" details the Marketing Director."
"In-store refill will be one of the main packaging trends in 2020, according to Mintel","While many have become familiar with the mantra 'reduce, reuse, recycle', the reality is that just 9% of the world's plastic waste is actually being recycled, according to a 2018 research from the United Nations, and next-generation technologies are only small pieces of the greater equation that will address and solve the waste and recycling crisis. Brands, manufacturers, packaging industry bodies, governments, and environmental non-profits need to work in harmony to improve recycling rates. In such a context, Mintel experts say that it is important that packaging manufacturers and brands act 'Ahead of the Recycling Curve' by developing and commercialisng recyclable package innovations even if the capabilities to recycle them do not yet exist. ""There is a dire need to explore technologies that are 'technically' recyclable now, and for the development of plastic alternatives - not just single-use plastics, but for all types of plastics and packaging. Time is of the essence; these technologies must be developed today, ahead of their ability to be recycled, rather than the other way around"", said Mintel Global Packaging Director David Luttenberger. Simultaneously, the rapid growth of independent packaging-free stores is driving retailers across the industry to consider how to create simple, branded, and engaging refill opportunities in-store. In-store Refill is this year's second main global packaging trend, according to Mintel. ""Regardless of the material used, the next iteration of the circular economy is clearly focused on reusability, alongside recyclability. With single-use now a toxic phrase for many consumers, refillable packaging is becoming more and more commonly known and used,"" added David Luttenberger. However, without the possibility to use packaging to communicate with consumers, branding can become challenging. ""Brands should look to offer memorable experiences through refill in order to create brand engagement, with those bringing some theatre to the refill moment most likely to succeed,"" explains Luttenberger. In the years ahead, consumers will usher in an era of conscious, rather than conspicuous consumption and will reward companies that take action on sustainability issues in a responsible way, aggressively rewarding brands that help them understand what is actually better, rather than what is 'less bad'. ""Successful brands, package manufacturers, and retailers will be those that develop, commercialise, and put to use environmentally responsible packaging based on science and facts rather than social media fiction and fear,"" concludes the market research firm."
Silgan Dispensing debuts new beauty care and aerosol solutions,"Sinfonia Crème, the latest addition to Silgan Dispensing's prestige skincare and color cosmetics portfolio, offers a softer and more luxury feel during activation, as well as a better dose control. Launched at the latest edition of the ADF&PCD and PLD 2020 show in Paris last month, Sinfonia Crème is based on Silgan Dispensing's most versatile pump, Sinfonia. The new pump offers dosages from 0.050 to 0.190 ml; it is designed for skin care and make-up products presented in small containers. Eventually, 53% of the overall Sinfonia's weight can be made of PCR plastic (post-consumer recycled). ""The addition of Sinfonia Crème to Silgan Dispensing's expansive skincare portfolio delivers on our customers' biggest demands: prestige, performance and personalization,"" said Sandy Gregory, Associate Marketing Director, Global Fragrance & EU Beauty at Silgan. ""The softer feel and wide variety of sizes, outputs, head styles and over caps all allow our customers to tailor the perfect solution for their needs and brand positioning."" Also at ADF&PCD and PLD 2020, Silgan Dispensing showcased Aerohead Plus, an addition to the company's aerosol product portfolio that will be locally manufactured in Europe and available in PCR. ""Offering a locally manufactured option of our Aerohead with a PCR option gives our European customers a whole new degree of advantages,"" said Jennifer Barnes, Product Line Manager, Home and Garden at Silgan. ""Between its smaller carbon footprint and use of recycled materials, Aerohead Plus is one of the best available aerosol solutions for brands to meet the sustainability demands being expressed by both consumers and regulators."""
"Bormioli Luigi, meeting the new needs of the market with two new anti-UV solutions","A colourless lacquering process and a filtering system introduced directly into the glass recipe: these are the two solutions contemplated by Bormioli Luigi, a leading manufacturer of high-end containers for the perfumery market, to give bottles and containers UV protection without affecting appearance. Both technologies are a response to the need to tackle the problem of the instability of perfumes and creams when exposed to light. These problems are increasingly frequent as a result of the growing presence on the market of products formulated with natural substances, which generally causes a change in colour (yellowing) or smell. The colourless, anti-UV lacquer, which contains pigments able to filter the light, is an initial ""ready-to-go"" solution developed to tackle these problems: the process has already been adopted by Bormioli Luigi, for secondary processing, in the production of several bottles. The advantage of the bottles treated with the colourless lacquer is that the glass remains transparent, unlike in the case of more banal solutions such as the use of full-body coloured glass or opaque coloured lacquers. The project for an anti-UV filtering system incorporated into the glass recipe currently being developed by the glass manufacturer goes a step further, creating a barrier effect in the material without adding any further layers, with advantages in terms of appearance, and in particular colour. This result can be obtained thanks to the addition of inorganic components to the standard oxides of the glass; the effect will have to be studied on the specific products, because the dosage required will need to be gauged according to the thickness of the glass. To test the efficacy of the new process, Bormioli Luigi has developed a system for the validation of the filter based on the Sun Test, an accelerated simulation of exposure to sunlight that reproduces the power of the midday sun, replicating in 24-48 hours what would occur in nature over about three years: this test is able to provide feedback on the filtering capacity of the glass in just two days. The presence of this innovative UV filter is also compatible with items that require the use of PCR; there are no limits to decoration and it can be recycled without specific conditions.

Parfums Malle are signing a first with the launch of refillable bottles with a Quali Glass Coat decoration,"It was at the PCD trade show, held at Porte de Versailles in Paris on 29-30 January 2020, that the glassmaker premiered this innovation, the same way as the company had unveiled at the PCD 2018 this new eco-responsible decoration technique, which uses powders ""containing no lead, mercury, cadmium or chromium,"" specifies Étienne Groulez, Managing Director of Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie. The glassmaker also presented at the show a new process, never seen before in perfume and cosmetics, which also uses powder inks (see box). The Quali Glass Coat 2.0 allows personalizing standard bottles serving the perfumery or pharmacy sectors, such as this amber glass selected for Perfume Guns, the new collection of home fragrances by Éditions de Parfums Frédéric Malle. With a thickness of 40 microns, its surface is perfectly ""smooth and flawless, with a stunning Premium matt finish."" The decoration of the bottles is performed by a semi-automatic machine, which produces series of between 6000 and 10,000 bottles approximately. The machine decorated some 14,000 units for the new Frédéric Malle collection. "" Today, we need to be flexible, agile and responsive,"" says Étienne Gruyer. Also, as part of its 2020 programme, Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie has started the study of an automatic machine, with a ""Quali Glass Coat-QGC 2.0"" decoration capacity of 4 million pieces. Currently, the glassmaker is in the process of validating volumes with customers. The installation of the machine is planned towards the end of the year. In addition to this first for the ""QGC 2.0"", which saves 77% of CO2 compared to the traditional lacquering process for a bottle with the same capacity (500 ml), Éditions de Parfums Frédéric Malle also comply with the re-use criteria requested by the new French Law on circular economy. The bottle selected by the perfumers is fitted with a screw ring, thus allowing refilling. ""A real demand"" that the studies received by the Company are highlighting more and more, agreed its Director. Tigital: an eco-friendly decoration characterised by the details and finesse of the printing Stemming from several months of collaboration between the Tigital Coatings Company and the Stoelzle Glass Group, the Tigital decoration technique is an eco-responsible decorative transfer (solvent-free and allowing an 85% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to traditional screen printing) composed of powder inks. Tigital has the same environmental characteristics as Quali Glass Coat 2.0, points out Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie. It can be applied on all types of substrates (bare glass, lacquering and QGC 2.0) and shapes, especially cylindrical. It stands out for ""its print quality with a level of details and finesse enabling to obtain an finish never reach before,"" highlights the glassmaker who can also manufacture small series."
"""Agility, Skincare, Asia… We must meet the new expectations of the global beauty packaging market"", Tristan Farabet, Pochet Group","Premium Beauty News - The announcement of the sale of Qualipac, your plastic and metal division patiently built and developed since 1991, had the effect of a bomb in the small world of luxury packaging. The press release refers to a ""fast changing environment"". Can you tell us more? Tristan Farabet - It's no secret that the high-end beauty packaging market is undergoing significant changes. First of all, it is a market increasingly driven by the Skincare category, which today represents 40% of the global market and 60% of growth, while conversely the perfume market is slowing down. It is also a market whose centre of gravity is shifting to Asia. At the same time, the pressure of environmental challenges calls for substantial investments. Finally, we must jump on the bandwagon of the transformation of Industry 4.0 production technologies, with the introduction of artificial intelligence in factories. A number of changes, which will severely strain our resources. Especially since our clients' expectations are also evolving at high speed, with in particular a growing demand for personalization of their customers and the increasing influence of indie brands. Many factors that require more agility on our part. These transformations indeed open the way to a whole lot of opportunities but they also require major adaptations and investments. This reconfiguration of our Group will give each of our activities more means and resources to help our clients meet their challenges. Premium Beauty News - Did concerns regarding the future of plastic as a packaging material have an influence on this decision? Tristan Farabet - Plastic is a material which has a rightful place in tomorrow's packaging and industry. But, in this sector too, massive investments will be required to meet future challenges, particularly in terms of environment. We are already observing a growing concentration of actors looking to reach the critical size enabling to absorb forthcoming R&D costs. Premium Beauty News - Pochet is returning to its former trade, chiefly a glass-making group. Is this the shift to a new diversification phase, which would be more geographic- than trade-related? Tristan Farabet - Pochet's history is almost four centuries old. During its long history, the Group has regularly had to respond to market changes. And history proves that it has always managed to adapt its strategy and its scope! In past decades, the Group, for instance, acquired a stake in Cristalleries Saint Louis, before reselling its shares in 1994, when it acquired the glassmaker Lalique, sold in 2008. In 1991, the creation of Qualipac, addressed the need for horizontal integration, to better serve customers. The Pochet Group has always managed and developed its portfolio of activities, and this adaptability has ensured its sustainability. Today, we actually want, as a first step, to strengthen our glass-making division with an accelerated investment strategy: transition to an Industry 4.0 factory, extension of our offer on the skincare market, acceleration in terms of CSR with the development of new eco-responsible solutions, reduction of our CO2 emissions, etc. But we will also explore all growth opportunities available. And among the important points of this process, there is the issue of the geographic diversification of our activities. And in this regard, Asia is at the heart of our thinking. We are also going to study market expectations in neighbouring segments and see to what extent our strengths and assets could allow us to provide relevant solutions. A similar reflection could also take place around emerging technologies. Premium Beauty News - Has the Group renounced to its one-stop shop strategy with a multi-material offer, or will it continue through a joint-cooperation with PSB Industries? Tristan Farabet - This strategy based on a comprehensive product offer to our customers, actually responds to a real need. It allows better supporting less expert brands and saving time. But it does not necessarily mean that we should manufacture all the packaging components, this strategy can be fully expressed through partnerships, in a logic of reinforced ecosystem. Premium Beauty News - What is the place of Solev in this new system? Tristan Farabet - Solev remains a Group subsidiary, with cutting-edge activity and technologies which, in part, serve the Group and also other customers. For Solev as for the whole Group, we are giving ourselves new leeway and new investment capacities. Premium Beauty News - Are environmental issues an important part of these investments? Tristan Farabet - These are today, key issues for the entire industry. We have several levers for action within the Group. First, with regard to all the production processes. For instance, for each product, we have succeeded in reducing our GHG emissions by 29%. Similarly, we have reduced our water consumption per tonne of glass produced by 60%. At Solev, investments made in 2018-2019 to improve the treatment of volatile organic compounds enabled to cut down emissions by 80%. We will continue our efforts in this area. The second lever for action concerns the product itself. It's about designing more eco-responsible products. This is, for example, what we did with SEVA, with the first premium glass, which relies on a specific recycling sector that only processes perfume glass, guaranteeing high quality recycled glass and requiring no treatment. All of these actions enabled us to obtain the EcoVadis gold medal for all our businesses: Pochet du Courval, Qualipac and Solev! And we intend to continue on this path to excellence. Premium Beauty News - For Pochet, what will the transition to Industry 4.0 consist of? Tristan Farabet - We are going to digitalize the production chain even more. The challenge lies in how to collect data throughout the entire production chain, process it, and use it to optimize and better control our processes. This could enable, in particular, to anticipate problems before they even appear and to reduce waste rates. The field of possibilities is huge, it is a considerable challenge."
Texen diversfies its eco-responsible solutions to serve all beauty categories,"In the wake of the innovative range of applicators Beautifull Lips, which was presented last year, Texen is focusing on the skincare category with the launch of Beautifull Skin, a stock jar, and a cap associated with a Mucell-made applicator. Attached to the cap, the applicator can be easily gripped for applying the cream on the skin and enhance the efficacy of skin care active ingredients. Easy to reposition on the cap, the applicator can be cleaned after each use to another. According to Texen, the Mucell injection can be decorated according to the theme chosen by the brand. Furthermore, as the applicator can be separated from the cap, the whole product is easier to recycle. Also with the aim to provide more sustainable solutions to its customers, Texen presented a series of 100% R-PP (recycled polypropylene) caps. Provided in black or white, the caps are a sustainable version of the company's best selling stock items. In order to avoid any contact with the formula (since R-PP is not food grade), the caps features a PE seal (therefore compatible with the PE-PP recycling process). During PCD, Texen also presented 'We R Mascara' a range of eco-designed mascara prototypes. The company used an eco-design software with the aim to offer real progress on most sustainability indicators compared to a classic mascara, while keeping aesthetic features at a high level and preserving standard technical requirements. The mascara bottles are made of R-PET (and are therefore rather suitable for waterproof formulas), while the brushes, supplied by Ponzini, feature 100% bio-based fibres (derived from castor oil). Eventually, Texen also showcased a 50 ml SAN-free refillable jar, with a PP insert and a transparent PETG outer packaging, as well as a lipstick with a glue and lubricant-free patented mechanism that can be covered with a tube in recycled plastic."
Exclusive mono-material airless systems by Wista,"By providing an entire airless system made of one single plastic resin (SUGARCANE BASED POLYETHELENE or optionally polyethylene), there is no need either to disassemble and select the parts of the packaging or incinerate it, making it easy to recycle and aligned with the rules and regulations in regards to recycling. The polyethylene resin has been used by the pharmaceutical industry over decades as primary packaging for drugs, due to its physical and chemical stability, and for being safe. The Post Consumer Recycled (PCR) Polyethelene is available on the market and the implementation of this resin allows the close looping and the ZERO WASTE concept. The use of the SUGARCANE BASED RESIN adds the benefit of carbon reduction: for each airless system produced by Wista, three times of its weight of carbon is captured from the atmosphere. The airless system is a one-way system that allows the dispensing of the formula and blocks the returning of the air into the packaging. The oxygen and the bacteria in the air when in contact with the formula accelerates the oxidation and the bacterial proliferation. Without an efficient airless system, the formula will be subject to contamination and oxidation. To minimize the risk of contamination, the addition of preservative is necessary, but side effects such as rash or allergies can occur. The trend towards natural formulas is growing, and by choosing Wista Airless Systems, it is possible to reduce a high percentage of preservatives in the formula without the risk of contamination. Another benefit of Wista Airless Systems is to improve the stability of the active ingredients and enhance the formula. Wista Airless Systems are produced under the pharmaceutical standards and the products are ready to be sterilized by the customers if necessary. To cover a wider range of formulas, Wista Airless System brings to the market two different concepts: – The Mono-Material UD Pump Airless System is available for dispensing pre-determined dosages. The UD Pump has been designed to allow its use for microencapsulated formulas, by preserving the microcapsules to break only after in contact with the skin. The UD Pump has excellent performance for high SPF formulas (over SPF 50). Its mechanism allows the dispensing without clogging the system [1]. – The Sage Airless System is a one-way valve with flow control. There are two valves in the system, one to block the return of the air into the packaging, and another one controls the flow of the product. Its performance for low viscosities' formula is unique, such as for hydro-alcoholic, oils, serum, gels, among others. Both systems are highly chemically resistant.

Understanding sustainable packaging alternatives for beauty products,"Product and packaging safety / compatibility, and batch number make it really difficult for cosmetics to be sold in bulk. If sold in bulk, brands need to insure that consumers won't use packaging from which molecules might migrate into the formula and render it unsafe. So packaging solutions need to be safe. So far, the safest option for brands is to continue to provide individual packaging for beauty products. Plastic pack is still one of the best options in the industry thanks to its lightweight, capabilities or functionalities, portability and ease of use. However, plastic is very controversial because of its negative impact on the environment. Several sustainable options are now available to the industry. Some more advanced than others, some more costly than others or that will take longer to implement. AND It's really difficult to get your head around the right solution! PLA (polyatic acid) is a polymer transformed from vegetal sourced (sugar cane or corn most commonly) so it is considered to be a good ""cradle-to-cradle"" solution since it's promoted as biodegradable. But biodegradability is questionable. We'll discuss this HERE: www.weezevent.com/mad-sustainable-workshop Since PET (PET - Polyethylene) is currently well recycled, you can have easy access to rPET (recycled PET) in the market. However plastics for cosmetics products need to be food grade. Considering that PET is coming from different sources for recycling, the food grade rPET is limited and more expensive. Today a lot of options are available for refillable pack. Bottle with separable inner parts, Jar with changeable part, etc. This could allow for unlimited design and options for brands, but you still need to transport them the different parts, and pack them in different items. So the impact needs to be finely considered. One may use glass to allow easier compatibility with the formula and easier brand development. However the positive environmental impact from the plastic-free may be outweighed by transportation carbon footprint due to higher weight of the product. And this is only the tip of the iceberg. What about the cost to the soil and carbon footprint of extracting natural or mineral materials? and the carbon footprint of the manufacturing process? All these solutions and ideas will be discussed at our workshop in London on the 21st of February 2020, to help you make up your mind about sustainable solutions in packaging. Workshop: How to navigate the sustainable packaging alternatives in beauty sector? London - February 21st From 8am to 10am In Mayfair (central London) Detailed program and registration here. www.weezevent.com/mad-sustainable-workshop"
"Roctool wants to entice the beauty industry with its ""high definition plastic"" technology","By acting on the temperature of the moulds and tools, Roctool makes it possible to produce plastic parts with unrivalled surface qualities. The high quality level makes it possible to skip the follow-up procedures such as decoration and painting that have an unfavourable carbon footprint. According to Roctool, and depending on the plastic resins used, the technology can thus meet current demands to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the environmental footprint, especially given that, it can also be used to create ultra-thin parts, shiny, matte and textured surfaces. ""Our technology allows no compromise between luxury and sustainability. Today, the two must go hand in hand. As such, we are pushing our research in several areas: with designers from around the world, suppliers of innovative materials, and of course with our customers, whose expectations we share,"" says Mathieu Boulanger, CEO of Roctool. Based on an ultra-fast induction heating process, the patented technology is not new but, until then, the beauty industry had not been a priority of the French company which had granted an operating license to PVL Beauté. Roctool's technology allows to replicate the surface of the mould directly on the injected part. According to the French company, it is suitable for most plastic resins, and offers ultra-premium surface qualities. For example, a PCR ABS resin moulded with Roctool technology offers a gloss unit (GU) of 85 and texture replication of 98%, compared to a GU of 53 and a 45% replication rate with conventional moulding. Roctool Beauty Solutions is therefore suitable for all types of make-up, skincare and fragrance packaging solutions (bottles, flexible and rigid tubes, jars and all types of lids and caps). Depending on the esthetical or functional purpose of the part, using Roctool's induction heating technology to control temperature in the mould allows the creation of ultra-thin parts, shiny, matt and textured surfaces (as well as the removal of defects like injection points, weld lines and all other material-flow lines). In order to better meet the expectations of its customers, the company currently collaborates with several suppliers of plastic resins and with injection specialists to acquire the required data to reach an optimal quality."
Sincoplas innovates with an alternative material dedicated to premium packaging,"Sincoplas is forging on with its innovation strategy. After having presented, with Qualiform, the first liquid spray plated plastic bottle, the French SME has built on its expertise in technical parts and its mastery of injection moulding to ""divert"" a highly technical material coming from the automotive and aeronautic industries, and imagine new packaging applications for the cosmetics and wines & spirits sector. In concrete terms, this material allows designing moulded parts with a magnetizable, metal haptic feel and a metal-like sound. The material's high weight - a density of nearly 4 - further contributes to the perception of quality. The material also offers very high chemical resistance and can withstand many decoration techniques: lacquering, varnishing, metallization. It is also possible to make exceptionally fine engravings directly inside the injection mould. Finally, to meet today's unavoidable sustainability requirements, a percentage of PCR material can be integrated in the process. ""This innovative solution relies on the advantages of the plastic injection process, while offering a finished product with characteristics close to the qualities of metal: cold haptic feel, high density, amazing chemical resistance, etc. Our teams have worked a lot on the best way to inject the material so as to give it an aesthetic quality at the press output in line with the premium packaging market, which to date, accounts for 90% of our revenues,"" explains Nicolas Leroy, Managing Director of Sincoplas. With this new material, the Company has imagined two premium solutions for caps and closures. These achievements were premiered at the PCD trade show, which took place on January 29 and 30, 2020 in Paris. ""Depending on the customer's needs, this capping solution can be an excellent alternative to Zamac, hence it can be used either as a feature part (cap, overcap) or as a technical part (to add weight). It also offers engraving possibilities with extraordinary finesse,"" underlines Julie Welté, Sales & Marketing Director at Sincoplas."
"The audacity of the Pacollection bottle, a case study of breakthrough innovation","The initial brief from the brand's marketing department concerned an original representation of a flexible metal. ""To respond to this atypical brief, we reviewed all the possibilities offered by the different metals"", explained Thomas Diezinger, President of TNT Global Manufacturing. From then on, the idea of calling upon the Promolib Company led by Murielle Frowein, a specialist in secondary and promotional packs, gained ground. ""Murielle is an expert in materials, especially flexible metallic materials. This is the option that we finally considered together,"" added Thomas Diezinger. ""Puig's marketing department was completely won over by this alternative to metal or glass. They really wanted to have an object which was the complete opposite of what was done in perfumery. Puig is a group that impels people to follow paths where no one has gone before. They needed people who were receptive to their curiosity,"" emphasised Murielle Frowein. Thirty mock-ups were then created, with molten metal as the new creative line. Once the project was designed, a visit to the production sites in China with the development and purchasing teams of the Puig Group resulted in bringing together, in a single production site, the two competences. ""The Promolib factory boasts real expertise, particularly in welding and the knowledge of materials. While the TNT Global Manufacturing plant knows how to deal with strong technical industrial constraints, in terms of tolerance, repeatability, quality monitoring to make the process viable,"" stressed Thomas Diezinger. Hence the know-how of the former company integrated the structure of the latter company and four specific automatic lines were created in TNT's Chinese factory, to manage the various manufacturing stages. ""It is unusual for two plants to work together hand in hand. Hence, this product only saw the light because of a deliberate desire to share,"" assured Murielle Frowein. Starting from a blank page, the various stakeholders adapted themselves to the constraints that followed one another, one stage after another, continuing the development of the product to its production phase. ""We had in front of us a considerate, pragmatic and reactive client who fully assumed the audacity of his project and the hazards specific to innovation,"" explained Thomas Diezinger. The service provider speaks of an effective and constructive collaboration led by an open-minded marketing department and by the organization in pairs of the development and purchasing departments imagined by Puig. ""This product is a perfect illustration of Puig's desire to develop products that are unlike any other, based internally, on a real partnership between, the marketing, development and purchasing teams and the suppliers. While using the know-how of the different entities and inviting them to work together in a very close way,"" summarize the two partners. The object consists of a pouch made of different superimposed layers of materials - expressing a supple and soft appearance -, welded together. The pouch is printed in a gradient of colours, covered with a protective film to prevent any potential aggression of the juices. A rigid plastic bottle designed to host the juice is inserted before the final hermetic welding. The filling operation can then take place the same way as for any bottle. After 12 months of development, the launch of Pacollection achieved a full hit. Aesthetic, sensory, atypical, unbreakable, nomadic, positioned flat, flexible, with a capacity of 62 ml, an unusual format on perfume shelves, it startled its customer base of millennials as much as the industry, and was awarded the Prix Forme de Luxe and then more recently, the NJPEC Award. ""This bottle is aimed more at a young public, who is found of nomadism, freedom, overcomes constraints; it is a 'go anywhere' perfume. The first feedbacks are very good,"" concluded Puig's packaging development department. From this fruitful collaboration emerged the entity TNT Promo France, a merger of the two protagonists involved in this great adventure."
"With What Matters, Verescence brings glass into the hygiene & beauty category","Longtime entrepreneurs, Charlotte Catton and Franck Ladouce wanted to develop an eco-responsible, uncompromising, made in France, project dedicated to all the everyday household products, with organic formulas and sustainable packaging solutions, refillable at will. ""We carried out an in-depth reflection on the choice of the bottle, without immediately finding the right available solution among standard eco-design materials. Our meeting with Verescence was decisive. Their safety glass technology can safely bring the glass material back onto bathroom shelves. This is one of the major innovations of our brand,"" explained Charlotte Catton, co-founder of the brand. This patented technology, developed by the world leader in glass containers, consists in applying a thin layer of polymer on the glass to absorb shocks, or in extreme cases of breakage, to keep the broken pieces in an envelope. ""The product retains all the properties of glass, namely a total recyclability, transparency, a premium appearance, a compatibility with formulas, while offering increased shock resistance,"" confirmed Samuel Joachim, Innovation and Development Director at Verescence. The bottles are translucent with a frosted effect so as to partially mask the pump, with an amber colour for household products and a white frosted colour for personal care products. ""We had to adapt some of the formulas to make sure they were fit for this type of packaging. Toothpaste, for example, comes in a small frosted glass pump bottle. Its formula, necessarily more fluid, however, holds on the toothbrush,"" underlined Charlotte Catton. Safety tests confirm results equivalent to that of toys for children from 0 to 3 years old and a validated mechanical resistance and decorability. ""The securing aspect of glass is one of the product's main communication arguments, supported by factual control data performed by a bailiff,"" confirmed Franck Ladouce. Both the brand and the service provider underline the technical and human commitment dedicated to this innovation. ""It was exciting for a small structure like ours to be able to collaborate with an industry player of this size. From the marketing department to technical services, everyone got involved in our project,"" highlighted the founders. ""The What Matters concept is fully integrated in Verescence's 'Glass Made to Last' CSR approach. It embodies the next step in eco-designed packaging, in connection with the 'Glassification' trend and the growing interest for refills"", added Astrid Dulau-Vuillet, Group Communications And Marketing Director. The entire What Matters range will be available online in the course of April on www.what-matters.fr, including the eco-refills, delivered according to the users' consumption, using a simplified purchase support system after placing the order via a text message. Based on the same concept, the start-up also aims to develop a BtoB offer."
Silgan to acquire France's Albéa's dispensing business for USD 900 million,"The U.S. packaging supplier headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, offers 900 million dollars to acquire the dispensing business of Albéa, a French company specializing in packaging solutions for the beauty and personal care markets. Expected to close in the first half of 2020, the proposed acquisition is subject to the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of certain customary conditions, including completion of the required works councils consultations. Albéa's dispensing business generated sales of approximately USD 383 million for the fiscal year ended 2018. It operates a global network of 10 plants across North America, Europe, South America and Asia. With this acquisition, Silgan would expand its position in the dispensing markets to include new foam pumps, fine mist pumps, lotion pumps, samplers and fragrance caps and closures for personal care and beauty products. ""This proposed acquisition would significantly enhance the scope and breadth of our market leading closures franchise by bringing new products and capabilities in the highly engineered dispensing category, such as fine lotion dispensing solutions for skin care,"" said Tony Allott, Silgan Holdings Chairman and CEO, in a statement. Silgan expects to fund the purchase price for this proposed acquisition with a combination of cash on hand and borrowings. ""If confirmed, this promising combination would leverage the two group's complementary business strategies and markets, with Silgan Closure's segment focused on food, beverage, home care and personal care and Albéa Dispensing Systems focused on beauty and skin care. At the same time, it would allow Albéa to focus its strategic ambitions on our Tubes, Cosmetic Rigid Packaging and Beauty Solutions businesses, where we hold leadership positions,"" added Cécile Thuil, Vice-President Communications at Albéa."
Understanding sustainable packaging alternatives for beauty products,"Product and packaging safety / compatibility, and batch number make it really difficult for cosmetics to be sold in bulk. If sold in bulk, brands need to insure that consumers won't use packaging from which molecules might migrate into the formula and render it unsafe. So packaging solutions need to be safe. So far, the safest option for brands is to continue to provide individual packaging for beauty products. Plastic pack is still one of the best options in the industry thanks to its lightweight, capabilities or functionalities, portability and ease of use. However, plastic is very controversial because of its negative impact on the environment. Several sustainable options are now available to the industry. Some more advanced than others, some more costly than others or that will take longer to implement. AND It's really difficult to get your head around the right solution! PLA (polyatic acid) is a polymer transformed from vegetal sourced (sugar cane or corn most commonly) so it is considered to be a good ""cradle-to-cradle"" solution since it's promoted as biodegradable. But biodegradability is questionable. We'll discuss this HERE. Since PET (PET - Polyethylene) is currently well recycled, your can have easy access to rPET (recycled PET) in the market. However plastics for cosmetics products need to be food grade. Considering that PET is coming from different sources for recycling, the food grade rPET is limited and more expensive. Today a lot of options are available for refillable pack. Bottle with separable inner parts, Jar with changeable part, etc. This could allow for unlimited design and options for brands, but you still need to transport them the different parts, and pack them in different items. So the impact needs to be finely considered. One may use glass to allow easier compatibility with the formula and easier brand development. However the positive environmental impact from the plastic-free may be outweighed by transportation carbon footprint due to higher weight of the product. And this is only the tip of the iceberg. What about the cost to the soil and carbon footprint of extracting natural or mineral materials? and the carbon footprint of the manufacturing process? All these solutions and ideas will be discussed at our workshop in London on the 21st of February 2020, to help you make up your mind about sustainable solutions in packaging. Workshop: How to navigate the sustainable packaging alternatives in beauty sector London - February 21st From 8am to 10am In Mayfair (central London) Detailed program and registration here."
ADF&PCD and PLD Paris wants to become the leading packaging trade show for premium FMCG brands,"ADF&PCD and PLD Paris 2020, the dedicated event for the aerosol, dispensing, perfume, luxury drinks and cosmetic packaging community, wants to bring new experiential features to inspire visitors. Among the new features and personal touches that have been introduced to ADF&PCD and PLD Paris 2020, a new Art Trail will showcase the work of a number of artists from the Paris region, with the aim to create an environment that will stimulate discussion around new approaches to creative and striking visual design.

Guerlain duplicates on the web the customization experience of perfume bottles,"Guerlain perfume lovers can now customize their perfume bottle online. The first in the list is the historic bee bottle, which was created in 1853 by famous French glass maker Pochet du Courval. The collar of the brand's perfume bottle, which can be refilled in stores with most of the Guerlain iconic perfumes, can be decorated with a grosgrain, satin, wide or narrow ribbon, but also engraved with a name or short message. The solution provides customers with an ultra-realistic 3D view of the final rendering, and allows them to carry out several tests and to display information about the products. Developed in partnership with Hapticmedia, a company specializing in online visualization and personalization for the luxury sector, the solution enables consumers to find on the new version of the brand's European online stores. The same personalization opportunities already available in the brand's boutiques. ""The 3D technical solution provided by Hapticmedia enhances the desirability of our iconic products.

It is available through several Guerlain e-stores in Europe, including in Italy, Spain and the UK."
Alternatives to plastic: Sulapac secures new funding and joins forces with Quadpack,"Business angels continue to pay close attention to growth and development of Sulapac. The Finnish start-up specialising in innovative and sustainable alternatives to plastic packaging materials has raised an exceptional 15 million euros to engine its scale-up and internationalization. Enlarged portfolio and new capabilities The funding comes from Chanel, who initially took stake in the start-up in December 2018, Mousse Partners, Sky Ocean Ventures, Bonnier Ventures, and Lifeline Ventures, accompanied with a group of private investors. ""The partners were carefully chosen with the emphasis on long-term support, commitment to sustainability, and expertise relevant to Sulapac's growth,"" claims the company in a statement. Thanks to this new funding, Sulapac intends to scale-up the production of its microplastic-free material and continue the development of new and improved formulas, including a flexible version of its ""Universal Material for Injection Molding"" that has been designed to replace plastic. Sulapac's patented material is biodegradable and made primarily from renewable raw materials, and combines premium look and feel with sustainability. ""We want to make Sulapac the number one sustainable material replacing plastic. Lifeline Ventures,"" explains Sulapac CEO Suvi Haimi. In parallel, Sulapac has joined forces with beauty packaging provider Quadpack. As a result of the partnership, Quadpack will launch the new Sulapac Nordic Collection in Spring 2020, which includes 15ml, 30ml and 50ml jars. New packaging types are also expected to be introduced to complement the portfolio soon. The partnership will allow to enlarge the production scope of sustainable beauty packaging made from the Sulapack's microplastic-free material and to broaden capacity for customisation for the packs. ""We've got thousands of enquiries from cosmetics customers all over the world about our Nordic Collection and it has been sold out already in August 2019. The partnership with Quadpack, one of the top 10 European providers of cosmetics packaging, ensures we can more effectively serve a wider customer base,"" says Sulapac's Head of Sales Ami Rubinstein."
Glass: Wheaton innovates with new decorative solutions,"For a guaranteed ""wow"" effect, Wheaton showcased Photochromic Spray, a new coating with an ink that reacts under the UV light. It is therefore possible to write on the bottle with a special light pencil. A way to create interaction between packaging and consumers as well as new possibilities for personalization. Another innovation from the Brazilian glassmaker, the Perfumed Screen, a screen printing involving perfumed ink to turn packaging into an olfactory communication carrier. It is therefore possible to imagine getting rid of testers and samples, since the bottle enables to discover the product! Wheaton is one of the world's five biggest glass packaging manufacturers and the biggest one in Brazil, with a special knowledge in packaging production for perfumery, cosmetics, pharmaceutics, food and housewares. With have 4 furnaces, 7 colour feeders, 23 production lines and exclusive line for samples production, protected area in the cold end line for pharmaceutical glass bottles and rooms with temperature control for cosmetics lines, the company can produce around 1 billion glass bottles per year or 365 glass tons per day. Wheaton produces its own moulds and offer decoration services in the same production site than for glass. ""We offer many decoration options for glass packaging. Colors, texture and effects can truly make a difference in a product and offer the best experience for the consumer with the brand,"" explains the company. The Brazilian glassmaker is also accelerating the pace in sustainability to meet market expectations. Wheaton therefore focuses in the reduction of water, energy and raw materials consumption, and on waste reduction."
Secondary packaging: The Adine Group is all set and ready to take up challenges!,"Premium Beauty News - Today you operate in three business areas, which allows you to offer large packaging solutions. Pascal Baroux - Absolutely! The Group consists of three business units with complementary know-how: Adine Cartonnages, which produces boxes, presentation boxes and cases, Chiffoleau, which is an offset and digital printing Company bought in 2018 and which produces exclusively packaging materials for the needs of the Group, and finally Thermoform which is an entity dedicated to plastic thermo-forming. Note that to offer a complete service to our customers, we opened a few months ago a folding-gluing workshop. Our machine population, which already consists of two cutting decks in the 74x104 cm format range, plus one for hot foil stamping for the finishing of various substrates, was completed, last April, with a MK Diana Easy 115 C folding carton gluing machine. Amount invested, EUR 800,000. Very versatile and ergonomic, this folder-gluer line stands out in particular thanks to its optimal accessibility around the various folding modules, be it, from the drive side or operator side, thus making its implementation faster. The settings are many, precise and easy to perform. Its flexibility of production allows processing many types of packaging such as straight line, auto-bottom and with 4/6 corners. In addition, thanks to the option ""miniature fold"", it is possible to very easily design smaller cases (open 75x55 mm or even 45x55 mm) or much larger and complex cases such as conical boxes or boxes for spirits or champagne bottles. Hence we manage to cover the entire value chain with the printing, box assembly, thermo-forming and, now, the manufacture of folding boxes and the gluing of sleeves, thus broadening our range of services dedicated to the perfume and cosmetics industry. Premium Beauty News - The takeover of Imprimerie Chiffoleau represented a real turning point? Pascal Baroux - Without a doubt, yes! But it was necessary to invest immediately in it to bring it to the desired level. The implementation a few months ago of a new Komori printing machine, worth nearly EUR 1.5 million was essential. This is the 5 colour Lithrone G 40 model + varnishing unit (offset varnish and / or flexo varnish) in a 70 x 100 mm format. It is equipped with an automatic calibration system and connected to an X-RITE densitometer. Intermediate dryers and final dryer. To note also the investment in a complete digital workshop with digital colour presses and black and white copiers. Premium Beauty News - You cover just about every market. Pascal Baroux - Yes just about all of them, since the wine and spirits sector represents approximately 30% of our activity on par with the perfume-cosmetic sector. We also supply the agribusiness and stationery industries for respectively 15% and 10%. Then the markets are very diversified. It is true that the synergy between our three entities offers a very wide range of services ranging from small series to large industrial volumes thanks, on the one hand, to the production of presentation boxes, boxes and cases of all types and with every substrate, in small or large quantities and, on the other hand, our printing capacity (offset, digital, customized or not and shaping workshop), and thanks, finally, to the design of thermoformed products and wedges to optimize the packaging. Premium Beauty News - Cartonboard vs. plastic... very different issues and challenges? Pascal Baroux - As everyone can see, we are more focused on cardboard than we are on plastic. This allows me to say a word about Thermoform which is really the thermoforming specialist. This company designs products and wedges designed to optimize packaging and set boxes for luxury products, perfumes, cosmetics, wines, spirits, chocolates, transport trays and wedging objects of all kinds. To meet the needs of its customers, Thermoform is constantly developing innovative solutions. The design department imagines, develops and realizes the plans that allow going to the production phase. The prototyping centre uses three-axis machines to produce mock-ups and moulds. Finally, the thermoforming machines produce samples and pre-runs before making the final products. The machine park, consisting of three Illig RV 53 and 53B, and 74B thermoformers, as well as various other production tools, allows manufacturing a wide variety of references. But it is undeniable that being a cardboard converting specialist is undoubtedly an asset today, even if it will also require some adaptations. And, of course, respect for the environment is a major issue. We are certified Imprim'Vert / Imprim'Luxe and Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant. CSR has always been part of our DNA, we measure our carbon footprint, we have set up decant tanks, waste sorting, eco-design. This CSR commitment is based on strong values: ethics, availability, data protection, customer advice and service, eco-responsible approach and anti-corruption charter. We are members of the EcoVadis CSR rating platform. Finally, I would like to stress on the fact that quality is at the centre of our concerns and at the heart of our strategy. Our quality department is subject to regular quality audits from our key luxury group clients. Quality policy is truly the soul of the Company."
Texen: A range of packaging solutions for responsible make-up products,"Texen's new eco-designed R'Mascara boasts a 21% reduction in fossil resources and illustrates the ""Reduce"" strategy as well as the expertise of the Texen Lab and of the Texen Mayet factory. The Lab tests new materials, thus allowing the factory, whose technological expertise is recognized in the manufacture of mascaras, to scale up to the industrial stage when adopting materials sourced from post-consumer recycling (PCR). Thus, the cap and the mascara bottle are made in R-PET while the stem and the wiper are in PP-PCR. Supplied by Ponzini, the brush is based on polyamide fibres derived from castor oil. The environmental impact of the R'Mascara, which is also based on the Recycle R, is subject of a life cycle analysis with the e-Dea software. This solution has been designed in the most universal dimension possible to suit the largest number of applications. Proposed with the widest range of brushes possible, it will be available from the 1st quarter of 2020, with samples availability in January. A version based on bio-sourced materials is currently being evaluated by Texen Lab. Concerning lipsticks, Texen put on the ""Reuse"" strategy with a rechargeable slimstick. Made in ABS, its mechanism can be easily unlocked to replace the product. Presented in plastic in its standard version, it can be made of aluminium. The refill can also be supplied in plastic or aluminium and does not contain glue or lubricant. The Reuse strategy was also used to create a standard 8 ml refillable pen for perfumes. Texen initially developed the pen for Mugler's fragrances. The refilling cartridge slides easily into the pen. Thanks to the push button at the bottom of the cartridge, a single click is enough to dispense the right dose on the area to be perfumed. This pen may be suitable for other products than perfume and can receive different applicators depending on the formula (skincare, makeup ...)."
"When sustainability is synonymous with refill: Natura Pack, the collection of jars and roll-ons","Initially produced by the Promens company, acquired in 2015 by the RPC group, which since July belongs to the Berry Group, the 50ml Natura Pack premium jar was first proposed in a 50 mm diameter. Now, a 58 mm diameter jar has seen the light, ""which allows expanding the scope of applications,"" detailed Delphine Roux, Marketing & Communication Manager at Berry Bramlage. The D58 jar includes three ranges (Diamond, Quartz, Coral), while the D50 format consists of five (Amber, Anfora, Opal, Ruby, Crystal). ""The PP refill, which is integrated to the jar, can be easily removed in a single step,"" confirmed Delphine Roux. In the Natura Pack Refill range by Berry Bramlage, customers can choose from three types of closures: heat sealing, induction or with a capsule. The thick wall of the outer jar can be made of PET-G, with the possibility to integrate Tenite®, a cellulosic material developed by the Eastman Company. All ranges are customizable, and the customer can decorate both the jar and the refills. The Natura Pack Refill, a concept which attracted a German cosmetic brand last year, offers consumers a sustainable solution for their beauty ritual by reducing the amount of plastic used. Indeed, the shelf life of the container and of its closure is lengthened since only the refill, which is completely recyclable, needs to be replaced,"" stressed Delphine Roux. Berry Bramlage also applies the refill concept to roll-ons. Hence, the Refill solution is also proposed in 50- and 75-ml formats and with two sizes of balls. The customer can also customize both the body of the roll-on and the refill made of PP and with a sealing system made of aluminium or plastic. The Natura Pack Refill roll-on was adopted by the brand Coslys, marketed in Biocoop organic retailer stores."
Perfume packaging keeps getting greener!,"Most suppliers now use recycled glass, although there is an ongoing debate about the PCR/PIR ratio [1] and the recycled glass percentage in a bottle significantly varies according to the different calculation methods used. To be continued… Standard lines based on lightweight glass are getting more popular. As a result, Ecoline by Bormioli Luigi and Epure by Pochet have been completed with new sizes to adapt to market demand. The Verdi model by Coverpla was actually based on the Ecoline lightweight bottles to provide an ecodesigned answer to niche brands' expectations. To meet the demand for packaging reuse and better recyclability, separable pumps and screw necks are making a most remarked comeback, as can be seen with the new CARA range by Verescence. These rectangular or round bottles are available in 50 ml and 100 ml sizes. Ultimately, to support companies with these efforts, Aptar now offers a screwable-unscrewable version of the La Petite pump. And this year, Silgan Dispensing System will release the screwable version of the Melodie Pirouette screw pump launched in 2017. Of course, the environmental concern is not limited to the use of glass. Caps are also getting greener, in particular at Quadpack, with a collection made of cork scraps. The additional advantage of these caps is that they do not require any plastic insert inside. They are directly placed on the tip of the bottle pump. As for Texen, they chose a removable tassel for Le Beau et La Belle by Jean-Paul Gaultier. Located between the push button and the ring, it guarantees tamper resistance and blocks the opening to avoid the use of any cap, in the case of Jean-Paul Gaultier perfumes. Albéa worked in collaboration with ERPRO Factory, leader on the serial additive manufacturing segment, to showcase various models of 3D-printed caps for the first time. Other than the creativity and customization offered by this technology, the raw material used is biosourced: it is derived from castor oil. Lastly, Surlyn specialist Dow unveiled the very first range of caps based on recycled Surlyn. Developed in partnership with Premi, these caps are made with 40% Surlyn derived from manufacturing post-industrial scraps. The scraps are collected, crushed, and integrated to a new production process. Bormioli Luigi launched new lacquering and finishing models with material or coloured effects, in particular to go with bottles based on recycled glass and conceal colour and transparency flaws inherent to the quality of the material. And for an even more comprehensive green proposal, Stoelzle Masnières put the spotlight on Quali Glass Coat, an environmentally friendly lacquering technique which reduces CO2 emissions by 77%, compared to standard hydro-marking. Sleeve is yet another booming alternative for sophisticated, even metallized decorative effects. Directly placed on the bottle without any adhesive, the sleeve can be easily separated from it for recycling. As a result, the bottle can get opaque, while still being recyclable, contrary to a coloured bottle. G. Pivaudran, an expert in aluminium components for perfumes and cosmetics, is considering using recycled aluminium, which is more eco-friendly and cheaper. Even Zamak, an alloy widely used in perfumes, might see its impact reduced. Metapack has just conducted a study which validates the possibility of recycling this alloy of zinc, aluminium, magnesium and copper over and over. Beyond sustainability, Wheaton presented two very interesting technical innovations in terms of customization. The Brazilian glassmaker showcased Photochromatic Spray, a new coating which reacts to UV light and makes it possible to write on bottles with an adequate light pencil. Wheaton also developed the Perfumed Screen, screen printing involving perfumed ink to turn packaging into an olfactory communication carrier. Why not get rid of testers and samples, since the bottle enables to discover the product? As far as samples are concerned, Arcade Beauty has been working on different options: lightened materials, aluminium-free single-material bags, thermoformed casing with 50% PCR… Two new entertaining products should also be mentioned: powder compact-shaped samples with a sieve to discover a fragrance soaked in perfumed balls, and ephemeral tattoos made with perfumed ink developed by Amkiri. Users apply the perfumed ink on a stencil to distil the fragrance on the skin for 24h. Last, but not least on the sampling market, ID Scent unveiled the new, 100% recyclable Scent Touch gesture exclusively made of paper. Scent Touch uses the perfuming gesture of a bottle with a rod soaked using the ID Scent technology and inserted in a cardboard case. The Touch is directly applied on the skin to discover the main fragrance notes. This model is adapted to retail, press ads, and e-sampling. To change from sprays, Texen created a pencil-shaped applicator for Angel, Alien, and Aura by Mugler. With its capacity of 8 ml, it offers an on-the-go application in just one click to deliver the right dose on the area to be perfumed. The perfumed bracelet unwinder developed by Metapack and Neyret for Dyptique is extremely original in that it unties a string with a removable clasp to be worn like a bracelet, and which can diffuse a perfumed trail for a week. Users can then repeat the operation. One unwinder can create about thirty bracelets. Metapack has also developed refillable concrete sticks made of Zamak for an on-the-go, renewable solution for solid perfumes. For his first perfume line, Julien Dossena, Paco Rabanne's Artistic Director, breaks the codes by replacing the traditional glass bottle with a flexible bag based on a metallized synthetic material developed by TNT Manufacturing and Promolib. According to the manufacturer, all the pack components can be recycled. This year, the Luxe Pack show confirmed suppliers' commitment for comprehensive eco-friendly alternatives. It is now up to luxury brands to adopt these ideas and solutions!"
Cosmetics packaging: ERPRO opens new horizons with serial 3D printing,"In many industrial sectors, 3D printing has gone beyond its original prototyping function to provide a new service: serial production. In the cosmetics industry, the example of Chanel mascara brusheshas redefined the codes, showing this technology has a bright future. The first advantage is that there is no design limit. Since there is no stripping constraint, 3D-manufactured products can take on any shape and adapt to any application. ""For Chanel, the idea was not to get involved in additive manufacturing because it is trendy, but because the brand's main concern is the customer, i.e. the makeup result. Additive manufacturing offers much flexibility in terms of design, contrary to more conventional processes,"" explains Cyrille Vue, founder and Director of ERPRO Group. ""Instead of drawing a brush, we coded the application behaviour we wanted, and then the computer suggested various models. The parameter design offers incredible creation power,"" adds the creator. The manufacturer has just repeated the same process with a new partner, Albéa, who recently attended the Luxe Pack Monaco show to showcase different makeup applicator models and perfume bottle caps with surprising designs impossible to obtain with the injection technology. ""Co-development is essential. Our working method requires sharing knowledge upstream and taking into account the functionalities expressed by our customer to imagine a highly differentiating product,"" explains Cyrille Vue. Also, additive manufacturing allows for customization. ERPRO already highlighted this feature in other sectors, in particular with headphone adaptors designed according to the customer's ear shape: Myfit solutions. The production flexibility offered by 3D printing makes it possible to manufacture unique products in large quantities. Given the current customization trend in cosmetics packaging, this technology takes on its full meaning. Lastly, it suits any type of raw materials. For mascara brushes just like any other applicator, the material used is based on biosourced castor oil. This ecoresponsible dimension adds to the many advantages of the technology. A global leader on this segment, the French company achieves a 15-million-euro turnover with about 100 employees. ERPRO 3D Factory has just been endowed with an 11th production machine, an EOS P396. Although it is not meant to replace conventional manufacturing, 3D printing involves a disruptive approach brands are much interested in. ""Adopting additive manufacturing is choosing novelty and freedom. It offers avenues of exploration never investigated before,"" says the Director, who promises several projects will soon be launched in the cosmetics industry."
Dove is switching to recycled plastic bottles and ditching plastic soap wrappers,"By the end of this year, Dove will start the process of launching new, 100% recycled plastic (PCR) bottles (where technically feasible), across all its product ranges in North America and Europe. The brand has also announced that, as of next year, its signature beauty bar single packs will be plastic-free globally. It is also working on an alternative, plastic-free material to replace the outer wrap of the beauty bar multipacks. Finally, the company will also leverage the 'minim' technology behind its new reusable, refillable, stainless steel format deodorant sticks, to further reduce its plastic use. Dove adds it continues to search for solutions where recycled plastic is not currently technically feasible, including for caps and pumps. ""At Dove, we are proud to have more than 100 initiatives ongoing around the world dedicated to tackling plastic waste,"" said Richard Slater, Unilever Chief R&D Officer. ""But as one of the biggest beauty brands in the world, we have a responsibility to accelerate our progress even further. Today's announcements are an important step in our work to transform how we produce, use and dispose of plastic packaging. By making this move, we aim to drive the global recycling industry to collect more waste plastic and make more recycled plastic available for use.'' Dove's initiatives will contribute to Unilever's recently announced new commitments on plastic: to halve its use of virgin plastic, and to help collect and process more plastic packaging than it sells Earlier this month, Unilever announced plans to halve the amount of virgin plastic it uses across its portfolio by the year 2025. This will be achieved by eliminating more than 100,000 tonnes of its current plastic packaging footprint (estimated to be around 700,000 tonnes) via 'absolute plastic reduction', while the remainder of the target will be achieved by using recycled plastics. The company will also endeavor to collect and process around 600,000 tonnes of plastic annually by 2025."
Luxe Pack Monaco: Sustainable packs are ready,"As underscored Emma Chiu, Innovation & Creation Director at The Innovation Group JWT Intelligence who moderated the conference on trends, ""Sustainability is no longer an option, it's an obligation"". A fact that exhibitors understood. All stands featured a green corner with packagings meeting the four R's of sustainable development: Reduction, Reuse, Recycling and Recovery. ""Reduce"", like the thickness of the Slim Cap+Thin Wall tube proposed by Albéa. The weight of the material for the skirt made of PE mono-material, was reduced from 500 to 300 microns, i.e., a reduction of 30%. The tube and its capsule weighs 33% less than a standard tube, resulting in a reduction of its environmental impact of nearly 36% compared to a standard tube, boasted the manufacturer. ""Reuse"", like the single-layer tube made of 50% PCR (Post Consumer Recycled) developed by CTL Packaging. The recycled material comes from milk bottles which were recycled in the UK. A PCR material supplied by the recycler Biffa, who guarantees its food grade, stipulated company officials. However, this is currently only valid in the UK, as Efsa [1] did not validate the process yet. As for ""Recycling"", it is the Eastman Company, winner of the Luxury Pack in Green 2019 Award in the category ""Sustainable Initiatives"" who came up with the best example: the plastic specialty supplier presented Cristal Revēl, a new range of PCR copolyesters. In fact, the majority plastic packaging suppliers presented packaging solutions based on 30, 50 or even 100% PCR material, or made of recycled plastic from marine litter (Qualiform). Bio-sourced packagings also stole the show, whether based on ethylene derived from sugar cane, oyster shells, dried and ground algae, or wood chips (PRP). As part exhibitors' green offer, it is probably the fourth R that best illustrates the ecological shift taken by the event, with ""Recovery"" or Refill. This can be evidenced for example, with the lipsticks offering a refill solution, like those proposed by Texen, Toly or HCT Beauty. It is also true for airless systems, where the user keeps the outer bottle and only buys the airless inner part (proposes by Berry, formerly RPC Bramlage). We cannot speak of refill solutions without mentioning refillable perfume bottles, big names like Chanel, Vicktor & Rolf, Louis Vitton, amongt others having adopted the eco-responsible gesture initiated fifteen years ago by the forerunner, Parfums Mugler. But plastic is not the only material to meet demand for more environmentally friendly solutions. Metal suppliers, dedicated to luxury packaging, are working on the issue, in particular the G. Pivaudran Company who uses aluminium for the decoration of premium perfume bottles. Committed to an environmental approach, the company is studying the possibility to use recycled aluminium. Meanwhile the cardboard sector is not lagging behind: it has long been engaged in a process of continuous improvement to preserve natural resources. BillerudKorsnäs' new CrownBoard combines strong resiliency and weight optimization. Thanks to a multi-layer structure, the carton board is thinner without compromising performance. Lighter, it reduces the number of pallets used for delivery. On the next stand, Favini was introducing his Refit paper, made up of 45% virgin fibre from FSC certified trees, 40% PCR fibres and 15% textile fibres from Italian wool and cotton by-products. Without forgetting of course, the new cardboard tubes of Albéa and L'Oréal or Stora Enso, which, if they don't completely eliminate the use of plastic, significantly reduce its use. Now remains to be checked the quality, the origin of all these materials and their food grade qualification when in direct contact with products. A requirement increasingly demanded by customers. Brands that demonstrate their commitment to sustainable development and to circular economy are now able to rely on an offer that combines recyclability, eco-design, environmental impact reduction, re-use, compostability..."
A second life for Surlyn?,"In a trade show that put a strong emphasis on sustainable solutions, in particular on alternatives to traditional plastics, the presentation by Dow and Premi of caps made of recycled Surlyn was both logical and counter-intuitive. Indeed, this polymer is usually associated with a high level of transparency that may seem incompatible with the use of recycled materials. The technical challenge of producing recycled caps was presented to Premi, an Italian company specialising in the design and manufacturing of standard and customised packaging for the perfume, make-up and cosmetics sector. The project to design caps from recycled Surlyn immediately appealed to the team at Premi, which places innovation at the heart of their development strategy. Premi has been using Surlyn for many years and has mastered its use in a wide range of applications. The combination of the company's expertise with Dow's technical support has enabled Premi to produce caps made from 40% recycled Surlyn. The material is recovered from industrial plastic waste, which is crushed prior to being integrated into a new production process. ""Adding this offering of caps based on recycled material to our existing portfolio is a great step in the right direction from a sustainability perspective. Sustainable solutions are at the top of the list of requirements for many of our buyers and brands and we are setting a new standard with these recycled Surlyn caps that retain the same premium qualities,"" said Alessandro Prestini, CEO of Premi. The large amount of recycled material used to make the caps prevented reaching the high level of transparency characteristic of Surlyn. The perfume caps presented by Dow and Premi at Luxe Pack have therefore been coloured. Dow partners with organisations around the world to reuse and recycle plastic waste more efficiently. ""This range of standard Surlyn recycled caps not only reduces plastic waste, but also allows us to move to a circular economy model. It is a step in the right direction as we continue to work with the value chain to initiate a circular model"", says Shouhaib Mohamed, Marketing Manager Perfumes & Cosmetics at Dow."
Alternatives to plastics take the beauty industry by storm,"The spectacular announcements of industry giants - Unilever pledging to halve its consumption of virgin plastic or L'Oréal announcing the forthcoming launch of a paper-based tube - are emblematic of a general trend: the cosmetics industry seeks to reduce its dependence on plastics. The paper-based tube developed by L'Oréal and Albéa is expected to pack some La Roche Posay products by the end of 2020. Also presented at Luxe Pack, another paperboard-based tube, proposed this time by the Finnish manufacturer Stora Enso, would allow to reduce the use of plastic by 70% compared to a conventional plastic tube. Moreover, the tube would be recyclable in the same scheme than the Tetra Pak type multilayer milk bricks. Stora Enso also showcased at Luxe Pack their DuraSense biocomposites made of a mixture of 30% to 50% cellulosic fibres and polypropylene. And while they were not presented at Luxe Pack this year, the biodegradable jars made of FSC-certified woodchips and natural binders, and free from microplastics, developed by Sulapac were in every mouth. The Finnish company, whose capital has recently been strengthened by big names, including Chanel, would be devoting most of its production capacity to preparing for a major launch. Perhaps even more significant of the ongoing transformation of the beauty industry, all plastic packaging manufacturers now offer alternative plastic solutions, whether plastics derived from vegetable sources (such as sugar cane or corn), or from recycled plastics. Several hybrid solutions combining, for instance, sugar cane and wood chips, or even oyster shells, such as the caps made by PRP Création from materials developed by Authentic Material, were also showcased at luxe Pack Monaco. Eastman, which was showcasing a new and greener generation of Trēva, its sustainable alternative to ABS, and Cristal Revēl a new line of compounded copolyesters with post-consumer recycled content (PCR), was honoured by the Luxe Pack in green 2019 award, in the Responsible Initiatives category, for having activated several recycling technology loops to build a circular economy for plastics. While waiting to find alternative molecules, it is still possible to use recycled plastic. This was the case of Dow, which presented in partnership with the Italian company Premi a series of Surlyn caps made from 40% recycled material. To go further, it is also possible to combine recycled plastic and lightening, such as the RPET bottle with a weight reduced by 40% that was presented by Pinard Emballages. Finally, where possible, plastics are completely eliminated, like the wooden applicators showcased by Cosmogen or by Texen. The future of cosmetic packaging will be green. Plastic will not disappear but it will get more diverse and the way we use it will be transformed."
"""Consumers are looking for transparency"", Thomas Riou, CEO, Verescence","Premium Beauty News - How has the rise in environmental and societal concerns transformed your business? Thomas Riou - These issues are not new to us, with our clients, we have been focusing on them for a long time. What we have achieved in partnership with Guerlain perfectly exemplifies this approach. Our CSR strategy is based on three pillars: the safety and well-being of our employees (People First), the positive impact of our presence in the territories, with the creation of short supply chains (Act for Society), and the development of innovative solutions to reduce the impact of our products and processes (Eco Solutions). We were awarded the EcoVadis Gold CSR medal, in other words we are among the top 1% companies in the world, with a rating that has increased significantly (77%). The big change is that consumers no longer tolerate green-washing. It is a matter that can no longer be taken lightly. This is one of the reasons why we have developed for our products a life cycle analysis software (LCA) certified by Evea Conseil. We want to go one step further and develop a tool to measure the impact of decors on the recyclability of glass and thus help change practices in our industry. In addition, our next CSR report (and the data used to achieve it) will be certified by an external auditor. Premium Beauty News - Premium brands seem to be more and more attracted by recycled glass. How is this market, on which you were precursors, evolving? Thomas Riou - Verescence was the first premium manufacturer to develop recycled glass with the launch of Infinite® Glass in 2008, and then with its Neo version in 2015. In total, more than 30 million bottles were produced worldwide! One of the remarkable features of glass is its endless recyclability, with no alteration of its properties. All premium glassmakers reuse about 30% of the glass coming from their production process; what's new with the Neo version is that we have integrated it in the glass PCR loop (Post Consumer Recycling or PCR). For Infinite® Glass Neo we use 25% PCR, 65% recycled cullet and only 10% of natural raw materials. We have been pioneers and we remain leaders in this area. However, we don't believe in single solutions. We also offer solutions with lightened glass, with jars or bottles whose weight can be halved. And of course we can combine lightened and recycled glass with Infinite® Glass Neo, like for Guerlain's Abeille Royale skincare jar. There are many other areas of progress. We are working in particular on decoration processes where huge progress has been made. And we don't hesitate to forgo some innovations, like glass metallization, if we consider that they are the source of too many environmental problems. Whatever the goal, progress goes hand in hand with measurement. That's why we are striving to develop tools to measure the environmental impact of the different technologies. Premium Beauty News - Refill and reuse solutions seem to become more and more common in the beauty sector? Thomas Riou - It's one of the solutions that brands are exploring and this trend could quickly gain momentum. Glass, strictly speaking, is no longer the main focus of concern. Pumps which are easy to disassemble while being aesthetic, are required in perfumery. For our part, we have developed and patented a solution of refillable glass jars and we have also patented treatments allowing to make unbreakable glass. We can also design machine washable decorations. These solutions are part of the ""Reuse"" pillar within our 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) eco-design programme. Premium Beauty News - What are your main levers of action to address concerns related to climate change? Thomas Riou - Over the last fifty years, the CO2 emissions of glassmakers have been reduced by 80% per tonne of glass produced. As for Verescence, it involves improving our industrial and logistic performances. We are constantly working on reducing our sites' emissions. All our furnaces are new and have, on average, gained 15% energy efficiency compared to the previous generations. We are working on recovering the heat produced, on improving the insulation of our premises, and on using electric vehicles where possible. Let's be clear, to produce glass energy is needed. But we are working hard to reduce our emissions. Our goal is for all our decorations sites to become carbon neutral. For the production of glass it will obviously take more time because a furnace has a service life of 10 to 15 years. For us glass is the best material in the world. In line with an environmental approach, glass must be given pride of place. This is actually what's happening: launches with glass stoppers are multiplying. More generally, a ""glassification"" trend can be observed, with an increasing use of glass in many beauty segments. Glass allows going upmarket, it is recyclable, and it's the only material with no interaction with its contents. In my opinion, the question of weight is a non-issue. To imitate glass, the weight or thickness in plastic are often increased. Even in the case of lightweight plastics, when assembly takes place in Asia, emissions linked to transportation can be significant! Premium Beauty News - In this context, what were the lines of investment chosen by Verescence? Thomas Riou - Our corporate project, Verescence 2022-Forming the Future, aims to make the Group the world's leading glass manufacturer in the beauty industry. This project consists of five pillars focused on sustainability: People First, Customer Excellence, Competitiveness, One Verescence and New Territories. This project is supported by a EUR 122 million investment plan that focuses on increasing our glass productivity, our capacity and capability and on improving our processes. Today decoration is the predominant growth vector. Since 2010, we have chosen to internalize all the finishing operations and today, 90% of them are performed in-house. This gives us flexibility, complete quality control and a mastery on the environmental impact of our processes. Our other areas of investment concern the digitization of factories, innovation and sustainable development. Digitalization covers many areas such as the fast processing of production data, which is a powerful performance driver. Similarly, the development of technological breakthroughs in our processes and products is both a source of competitiveness and of added value for our clients and for us. And finally and more importantly, the continuous improvement of our environmental impact. We are constantly investing in new decorative offers, greener processes, natural alternatives to chemicals, energy and raw material savings, and in reducing emissions. A synthesis of all these advances was presented, once again, at Luxe Monaco."
Quadpack among the top ten beauty packaging providers in Europe after Louvrette acquisition,"Barcelona-headquartered beauty packaging manufacturer Quadpack has acquired German cosmetics packaging company Louvrette, propelling the business among the top-ten cosmetics packaging suppliers and one of the leading jar manufacturers in Europe. The transaction greatly increases Quadpack's injection-moulding capacity and strengthens the company's penetration in Germany, one of the five biggest European markets, with a stronger commercial presence besides production capabilities. ""Our strengths go hand in hand. Louvrette brings mould making, engineering and manufacturing expertise. We bring market-leading creative design together with a global infrastructure in sales, marketing, sourcing and logistics. It's the convergence of 'German engineering excellence' with 'creativity born in Barcelona',"" said Tim Eaves, Quadpack CEO and Co-Founder. The deal also enables Quadpack to obtain a better balance as a hybrid manufacturing and sourcing company. ""We've been building our own manufacturing capability for a moment now. Following the acquisition, 33% of our products are now made in-house and in Europe, compared to 15% before,"" Tim Eaves told Premium Beauty News. Louvrette specialises in thick-walled injection moulding and is an established company in the skincare packaging market. ""Louvrette was ready for expansion and Quadpack is perfectly positioned to take its operations to the next level,"" said Louvrette General Manager and Owner Fabian Erlhoefer. ""Quadpack's global presence and infrastructure will push Louvrette's products onto the world stage, while its design acumen enhances our manufacturing know-how. Together, we can meet the needs of any cosmetics brand, as we complement each other perfectly in business and culture."" The acquisition follows on the heels of the recently signed agreement with German technology company Inotech. Quadpack will now benefit from the combination of Louvrette's manufacturing experience and Inotech's process knowledge and pioneering bi-injection moulding technology. ""In the future will have the possibility to move Inotech's beauty packaging production to Louvrette's 8,500m2 manufacturing facilities where we have enough space to increase the production area,"" explained Tim Eaves Following the acquisition, Quadpack's revenues are expected to reach around 130 million euros in 2019, from 105 million euros in 2018. While the priority is to work on the integration of the newly acquired business, Quadpack intends to continue its development strategy with a special focus on North America and Asia. To finance this strategy, Quadpack is preparing to enter Euronext Growth equity market in mid-October."
Plastic packaging: Pibiplast makes ambitions clear,"In 2018, the L Catterton and Ambienta funds acquired the majority of shares in Pibiplast, which sped up the growth strategy implemented by the company. Appointed CEO in May 2019, Fabian Piaggio intends to take Pibiplast to the next level. Over the past three years, the Italian plastic packaging expert invested 8 million euros per year, in particular to extend production sites and get new equipment for bottle blowing, decoration, and mascara brush manufacturing and assembly. ""Since early 2019, we have performed vacuum metallizing and lacquering operations ourselves, which both makes us faster and more efficient and helps manufacture larger series for a production capacity of over 100 million pieces/year,"" explains Nicolas Garnier, Sales Director France. Of course, these investments are aimed to enhance growth, but also to reduce time-to-market thanks to more flexible production management. With three divisions - tubes, makeup (small bottles and applicators for mascara and lip gloss), and skincare (PET/PP or PE bottles, caps, and jars) -, about 310 employees and four production sites in Italy, Pibiplast achieved a 64-million-euro turnover in 2018 (doubling their sales volume in five years) and defined a new growth objective for this year. The company has developed many standard models together with decoration solutions to differentiate them according to brands' needs, and it benefits from the density of Italian makeup formulators, who buy both packaging and applicators to offer their customers turnkey solutions. ""However, our growth mainly depends on our designing and manufacturing more specific models,"" explains Nicolas Garnier. ""So, we have considerably strengthened our technical teams to support our key customers. We work directly with many prestigious brands, mainly in Europe and Russia, and now in North and South America."" Pibiplast now makes their own mascara applicators and brushes – the catalogue counts over 400 references – as well as their own fibres. The company can offer several sustainable plastic solutions based on bioplastic or recycled PET. As regards sourcing, the Italian manufacturer works with cutting-edge companies specialized in plastic bottle recovery and recycling. ""They can deliver plastic with specific shades and more or less transparency, depending on our customers' requirements,"" adds Nicolas Garnier. In an effort to speed up their growth on the global level and better serve their customers, Pibiplast inaugurated a new sales office in the US in May 2019: it completes the offices in Paris for French customers, and in Brussels, Belgium, for Northern and Eastern Europe. Stefania Bosi, Sales & Marketing Director, confirms the commercial organization should be further strengthened over the next few years. Thanks to increased financial resources, the company will keep investing and is considering new acquisitions to diversify both geographically and product-wise. What is the idea? Double the turnover again, within five years."
Albéa completes eco-friendly solution offering,"Major beauty packaging player Albéa made their ambitions pretty clear in terms of reducing plastic's environmental impact and better managing packaging end-of-life. But the group still believes in plastic's longevity in the industry, so they focus on more responsible packaging solutions. ""The problem actually concerns design and use more than the product itself. That is what we need to work on, and that is what we have been doing,"" says Gilles Swyngedauw, VP Marketing, Innovation & Sustainability. The main priority is to reduce the weight of packaging and of the materials used. As a result, one of the new launches to be showcased this year completes the 50mm model in the Slip Cap + Thin Wall range with a 35mm diameter. The innovation consists of a laminated tube + capsule that saves 33% of the total weight, compared to a standard tube. Several lightened mascara and lipstick models based on Paper Kiss and Paper Mascara will also be unveiled. The lipstick or mascara packaging is made of FSC-certified board, so that the device can be separated from the cardboard packaging to recycle more paper. Also, reuse remains an essential innovation driver, in particular on the luxury segment. ""We aim to design objects rather than packaging products,"" explains Gilles Swyngedauw. This year, this objective will be illustrated with clipped or magnetized refillable lipsticks. Ultimately, end-of-life optimization involves recycling according to the existing materials and technologies. Albéa will showcase Greenleaf, a new packaging solution that can technically be recycled by companies specialized in rigid, HDPE-based plastic packaging. In the Greenleaf tube, the aluminium barrier was replaced by an EVOH barrier adapted to dental hygiene and cosmetics markets. In addition, the plastic weight was reduced by 17%. The PCR programme is both a major consumer and brand expectation and one of the main concerns for manufacturers, in particular as regards recycled plastic sourcing. The group claims they have already secured their volumes for the next three years, as they aim to maximize plastic use up to 90% of the whole pack. In addition, Albéa has been broadening their tube offering by integrating recycled high-density polyethylene to three new solutions ahead of market expectations: – A pioneer in this field, with the Encore PCR tube 50% made of recycled plastic, Albéa has now added the Max PCR tube to the range, which features up to 70% recycled plastic. – As a complement, the new Beautiful PCR version is available with a white outer layer free from any inclusions to better meet the skincare market's expectations. – Lastly, the Ultimate PCR tube is only based on PCR (70%) and biosourced plastic (30%) to be perfectly in line with the virtuous 100% circular concept. Beyond a low environmental impact, consumers now expect maximum transparency from brands. With #Follow, Albéa offers to connect brands and consumers through packaging. The solution features a single QR code and a digital service that connects packaging with the brand content. This way, customers can access more detailed information about the product origin and the process and use of materials in an interactive way. And brands can market their products, provide exclusive contents, and create links to other products in the range, while manufacturers simplify information about end-of-life and recyclability."
Eastman unveils new sustainable plastic packaging solutions,"Eastman continues the sustainable transformation of its portfolio of packaging solution for cosmetic products. At the Luxe Pack Monaco trade show, which will be held at the Grimaldi Forum on September 30 through October 2, 2019, the provider of plastic resins will showcase the next generation of Trēva, its alternative to ABS which was introduced to the market last year. ""In terms of performance and aesthetics, the new Trēva is exactly the same than the previous generation. However, we have been able to use a new state-of-the-art chemical recycling technology to increase of its content in recycled material,"" explains Clark Ensminger, Market Development Manager, Specialty Plastics at Eastman. In practice, Eastman has added 23.5% of certified recycled content to the resin formula. Together with the 48% of cellulose-based plastic already included in the initial formula, Trēva Generation 2 now contains over 70% of non-fossil materials. ""We have performed many trials to test the performance and aesthetics of Trēva for lipsticks, caps or compact cases. In many ways, it outperforms ABS. However, it is a different material which requires a specific know-how. In certain cases (about 30%) specific moulds and tooling may be required,"" adds Clark Ensminger. ""Anyway, the new generation of Treva has exactly the technical and aesthetic characteristics than the first one, it is simply more sustainable."" At Luxe Pack, Eastman will also introduce Cristal Revēl copolyesters, a new line of proprietary post-consumer recycled content (PCR) compounded polyesters. ""Revēl is a platform based on food grade recycled PET mixed with virgin copolyesters. The content of recycled material varies from 15% to 50%, depending on the client technical requirements,"" says Clark Ensminger. The level of transparency and the colour of Cristal Revēl depend on the content of recycled material. At Luxe Pack, Eastman, will showcase different samples, but it is the version containing 40% of PCR that will be marketed first. To develop these sustainable materials and include them into a circular economy, Eastman has developed three plastic recycling streams, both mechanical and chemical recycling streams, to enable the recycling of mixed polyester and mixed plastic waste from various sources. ""Our vision is that 100% of our material will participate in a circular economy in the future,"" says Renske Gores, Segment Market Manager, Plastics Packaging, Specialty Plastics at Eastman. ""We are collaborating with the Ellen MacArthur foundation and we agree with their definition of the circular economy. Thus, we have created three loops for our products that will be showcased at Luxe Pack."" These transformative circular solutions have been selected by the Luxe Pack in green Awards jury, which will announce the winner on October 1st, 2019."
"""We can now offer differentiated standardization and customization capabilities to our customers worldwide,"" Derek Hindle, Berry","What is the new face of the company, following the fusion of Berry and RPC? Derek Hindle - RPC's 153 manufacturing sites in 33 countries joining forces with Berry's give us a reach of approximately 290 manufacturing sites and about 48.000 employees worldwide with an estimated turnover of US $13 billion (net sales). 57% of the sales are being generated in North America, and 35% in Europe, with 3% in the Asia Pacific region and another 3% in Latin America. What is the strategy behind this move? Derek Hindle - It was a natural fit as both activities are quite complementary. This merger helps us increase our global reach, quality, and service. We both have built long term relationships with our clients and will be able to share processes and take the best of each business. This will help us discipline our costs and raise manufacturing efficiency. We will be able to offer differentiated standardization and customization capabilities, but also premium, low-cost, and sustainable solutions. Now with Berry, RPC Bramlage, who is well known for its high-end pumps and airless systems, now has the manufacturing footprint in the US to transfer its technology and vice-versa with US technology and know-how brought to European sites. We are now able to offer local, in-market presence with an extensive product breadth and selection. Sustainability is a key concern within the beauty industry, how do you intend to answer this sensitive issue? Derek Hindle - We have been making steps towards sustainability in our products and business, for example working towards reducing our water and energy consumption in our manufacturing plants and in the end, produce a cleaner product. Again, best practices will be exchanged within the new organization and synergies will be found to make our company even more sustainable. On the one hand, we are working on a range of refillable packaging. This technology will be spread across all our manufacturing facilities. We are extending the current Natura Pack range, to implement the solution into other products including pumps system, deodorant, dispensers, etc. Our pumps are an added-value product, which shouldn't be thrown out once the packaging is empty. We will offer our client the ability to order separable packaging with refillable containers, jars, and separate dispensers, pumps and caps. External parts then become more premium with a diversity of decor, and the containers can also be decorated and adapted to seasonal or market needs. Brands will be able to encourage consumers towards loyalty when they reorder refillable product online for instance. On the other hand, the acquisition gives Berry the ownership of recycling facilities, with RPC bpi group, one of Europe's largest recyclers of polythene waste, which provides the current market with Post Consumer Recycled (PCR) plastics. With regards to the company name, will RPC, M&H and other brands within the portfolio remain active? Derek Hindle - Some brands have a lot of equity, like M&H being well-known for small lots with very quick reaction time for instance, or Bramlage, known for high-end jars and dispensers. At present these brands and a few others will be kept under the Berry Global banner."
Qualiform and Sincoplas launch the first liquid spray plated plastic bottle,"Jet Metal's liquid spraying technology, which had already proven its worth on glass, still needed to be tested on plastic. A challenge taken up by Sincoplas, a family-owned SME specializing in the moulding, decoration and assembly of plastic parts serving the luxury and cosmetic industries. As early as 2014, the French company equipped itself with a varnishing and metallization workshop, representing an investment of nearly 1.5 million euros. ""We were the first plastic injection company in Europe to bank on this innovative technology,"" highlighted Nicolas Leroy, grandson of the founder and CEO of Sincoplas since 2017. ""We have significantly contributed in advancing it to the industrial stage for plastics, and to date, we are the only ones in Europe to master this technique,"" he added. Relatively simple to achieve, liquid spray metallization allows working on different substrates: plastic, metal, ceramic, glass. But in practice, the industrial process for plastic, demanded solid development work and the acquisition of a high level of expertise, which is now well mastered by Sincoplas. The metallization chain, in the historical production site of the Company in Folembray, France, can produce up to 50,000 pieces per day. The technology has already attracted many customers for the decoration of caps, in large series (up to three million pieces per year for a masstige perfume brand), or for the limited editions of prestige brands. To go even further, Sincoplas has successfully adapted its process on premium glass-polymer bottles (a PET grade for thick-walled bottles and jars) of Qualiform (Groupe Certina), in particular the ""Grand Luxe 50ml"" bottle that combines the appearance of glass (flat bottom and transparency) with the lightness of plastic. ""In partnership with Qualiform, we tested different types of decorations: gradients, semi-transparency effects or, more classically, opaque metallization effects, that would suit body mists particularly well, products which are currently experiencing strong growth. The first returns of brands, who were given a sneak preview of the process are very positive"", confirmed Julie Welté, Commercial and Marketing Director, Sincoplas. From an aesthetic point of view, the effect offers exceptional brilliance. The technology is based on silver salts in replacement of aluminium, which dramatically increases the reflectivity. Several drop tests enabled to validate the decoration's holding power and control the impact of different types of varnishes on the ultimate strength of the decor, the types of possible effects and also the final cost of the operation. ""Environmentally speaking, the Jet Metal technology allows working at ambient pressure and temperature, it is therefore much less energy-consuming,"" explained Nicolas Leroy. In addition, the water used during the process is treated upstream and downstream, the wastewater is therefore very pure. The residues and sludge charged with aluminium salts are treated and recycled. On the side of the ""Grand Luxe"" bottle, it requires much lower manufacturing temperatures than for glass, resulting in lower CO2 emissions, according to Qualiform. And, icing on the cake, the product can be made with bio-sourced PET, to further reduce the environmental impact. The results will be presented by Qualiform, a French manufacturer of standard and specific plastic bottles serving the prestige and masstige markets, at the next Luxe Pack show in Monaco (From September 30 to October 02, 2019)."
BillerudKorsnäs launches new brand and multiplies sustainable alternative solutions,"The Swedish company has reorganized around three distinct Divisions: Board for compact, corrugated board and liquids, Paper for the paper business (bags, special paper, formable items), and Solutions for the development of alternatives to plastic, as part of an ecoresponsible commitment. This restructuring was implemented alongside an investment of over 700 million euros in a new production tool better adapted to the market's new constraints: it was operational last June and should produce 500,000 tonnes per year. A key driver of brands' identities today, luxury packaging requires using materials offering both high quality and an eco-intelligent profile. And in terms of ecology, wood fibre is a real challenge to plastic in many ways, since it provides increasingly more sophisticated packaging solutions. With Crownboard, their new brand, Billerudkorsnäs meets this expectation: their three-product range based on virgin wood fibre offers enhanced performance and lower grammage. Crownboard Prestige, Crownboard Artisan, and Crownboard Craft can now highlight better surface conditions, more whiteness and strength, and a reduced weight to save resources and lower both the environmental impact and costs. Already behind Fiberform, a base material made of wood fibres with stretching, elasticity, and solidity characteristics similar to plastic, Billerudkorsnäs now goes farther in terms of alternative packaging solutions. ""Thanks to Fiberform, on the premises of a packaging manufacturer, we can use paper that is loosened and stretched on a machine that also uses plastic to obtain a particular, lasting shape,"" explains Christophe Delrive, Brand Owner Coordinator, Division Solutions. Various products will be showcased at the Luxe Pack show, including the Paper Bottle made of moulded fibres, exclusive packaging solutions with powerful embossing, resulting from a partnership with Kapag, FibreformCap, an opportunity to put forward paper caps, as well as the Shape Paper Pods innovation, an alternative designed for single doses and samples, which are usually based on aluminium and polyethylene complexes. Lastly, for the first time since the Packaging Impact Design Awards (PIDA) were first organized, 15 years ago, by the Swedish manufacturer, the grand finale will be held at the Luxe Pack Monaco show. The event will reward the winner among four finalist projects set up by packaging design schools in Sweden, the UK, Germany, and France, based on the theme Bring The Future. Save the date! The winner chosen by a jury of professionals, designers, journalists, printers, brands, and others will be announced on September 30, at 3pm, at the Billerudkorsnäs stand."
Quadpack partners with Inotech to boost packaging innovation and product offer,"The Barcelona-headquartered manufacturer and provider of beauty packaging has acquired the commercial rights to the patented bi-injection blow moulding (BIBM) of German technology company Inotech. The innovative technology allows the manufacture of products using two materials in a single step. ""This would allow, for example, a transparent window to be incorporated in an opaque bottle or two different colours to be introduced in a single component. The process is highly efficient, offering greater precision and producing less material waste, while eliminating the need for assembly. Greater control of materials gives designers more freedom to explore aesthetic options,"" explains Jeremy Garrard, Quadpack's Director of Design and Advanced Technologies and head of the company's research and development. Pursuant to the agreement, Quadpack's department of Design and Advanced Technologies will work with Inotech's designers, led by Josef Gleixner, to fully exploit the possibilities of the BIBM technique to develop innovative packaging solutions. ""Inotech has a special talent for applying science in new and unexpected ways,"" comments Quadpack CEO and Co-Founder Tim Eaves. ""Our Design and Advanced Technologies department has made great strides in trend analysis and creative package design in the year since its formation. Combine that know-how with Inotech's technical expertise, throw in a cutting-edge manufacturing process and you have the perfect conditions to trigger real innovation."" As part of the agreement, Quadpack also takes over Inotech's cosmetics packaging operation and incorporates its beauty-focused products into its portfolio. However, current Inotech cosmetics products will continue to be produced at its factory in Nabburg, Germany. ""We are happy to entrust the future of our cosmetics line to Quadpack. It sets industry standards in creative package design and it knows how to sell on a global scale, the two complementary skillsets needed to take this business forward. And with its Design and Advanced Technologies team, our bi-injection blow moulding process will be exploited to its full potential,"" says Harald Kausler, Inotech Managing Director. The financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed."
Lumson strengthens in makeup with the acquisition of Belotti and targets Asia,"The Italian manufacturer of atmospheric and airless distribution systems, plastic or glass bottles and jars, and lipstick packs, continues its external growth strategy with the aim to serve all beauty categories. To strengthen its make-up business, the group has just acquired Marino Belotti, an Italian company specializing in the injection of compact cases for powders intended for prestigious and masstige cosmetic brands. With a 5.500 m2 production and assembly facility near Bergamo, Marino Belotti has established a solid reputation in the design and manufacture of prestige compact cases. The company manufactures its own moulds and has built up a renowned expertise in plastic injection. This first acquisition, since the arrival of private equity fund FSI as a minority shareholder (35%) in August 2018, is fully in line with Lumson's growth strategy aiming to increase its market share in Europe and the USA for all product categories, in particular in the prestige segment. ""Marino Belotti is an historical company of our sector. We share the passion of our job and the orientation towards quality and innovation. I'm sure that this combination will enable Lumson to strengthen its positioning both in the European and American markets, where we are currently seeing the results of the hard work done over the past years,"" said Matteo Moretti, Lumson's President. Lumson, which has almost doubled in size in five years (the company's turnover has increased from 49 million euros in 2013 to 96 million in 2018, an average growth of 15% per year), has invested heavily to increase and modernize its production capacities. The company now has brand-new headquarters in Capergnanica, in the suburbs of Crema, together with a state-of-the-art facility dedicated to the production of technical components (mainly airless and atmospheric pumps), and a fully automated warehouse. In June 2019, the production capacity has been increased to135 million pieces, compared to 90 million pieces previously. Lumson intends to continue its investments to bring all of its facilities to the same level of excellence to meet the expectations of its customers. Lastly, the company that generates a large share of its sales in Europe (including 30% in Italy and 22% in France) and in the United States (28%), is now targeting the Asian markets and especially China. ""A development that will necessarily go through local production,"" underlined Matteo Moretti."
"""The Brazilian market offers a lot of space to develop,"" Paula Froes, Albéa do Brasil","With almost 1,000 people across the two production sites of Jundiaí and Mogi das Cruzes, in the state of São Paulo, Albéa Group develops and produces laminate tubes, rigid cosmetics packaging and dispensing systems for perfumes, deodorants and lotions, offering a wide array of beauty solutions for major market players. ""Brazil is a rather closed market due to import taxes and to the strength of local cosmetics groups, so the key is to produce locally. Mostly because of macroeconomics, the cosmetics market is not growing as fast as it used to, but it still offers a lot of space to develop, given the average consumption level per capita in some segments"" explains Paula Froes, Sales & Marketing Director Albéa Brazil. The perfume segment, which ranks the Brazilian market first on the global level, represents the biggest activity of Albéa Group in Brazil, through its dispensing systems and cap expertise. ""Body sprays are very popular here, whether for fragrances or deodorants"", adds Paula Froes. On the makeup segment, Albéa Brazil covers most needs with a great variety of products for lipsticks, glosses, mascaras and compact powders. Two lipstick mechanisms are offered and produced in the country. Then, Albéa designs and manufactures the whole lipstick packaging, using their global and local expertise. ""Lips represents a very prominent category for the Brazilian consumers. On a wider scale, influencers and Millennials keep pushing for the development of the makeup segment in Brazil, so it is an excellent opportunity for our customers and therefore for us,"" explains the Sales & Marketing Director. As regards dispensing systems for deodorants, Albéa is a favourite supplier in Brazil, in particular with the spray caps and dispensing systems. And the hair care market is not lagging behind, with laminate tubes and the high-quality Panache pumps. The players on the Brazilian market find their own solutions for all product categories thanks to Albéa. ""What matters most is to understand our customers' expectations and meet them with innovative solutions,"" says Paula Froes. In Brazil, the top beauty trends are the same as everywhere else - sustainability, premiumization, speed-to-market - but they need to be addressed with Brazilian flair. For example, Albéa provides responsible packaging solutions, develops sophisticated packaging that remain accessible to Brazilian consumers; and invests in automation, decoration and innovation to shorten time-to-market. A large part of the activity is dedicated to innovation, with 40 people and dedicated resources. The group also banks on more luxurious finishing techniques. ""There is a premiumization trend here, too. And although Brazilians are sensitive to price, they are attracted to high-end packaging. Launches are getting more and more luxurious to compete with sophisticated foreign brands. Local companies are offering more sophisticated products at higher prices than Brazilian consumers were used to, but they are still much less expensive than what imported luxury brands offer. To meet this trend, we need to offer innovative decoration services and more complex products,"" explains Paula Froes. The company needs to demonstrate its creativity to adapt to local prices in this need for sophistication. Two major investments were recently made accordingly for the Mogi plant, with a new UV metallization line and a new flexo decoration line for laminate tubes. In Brazil, just like everywhere else, time-to-market keeps reducing and requires more flexibility. To meet this requirement, Albéa has dedicated a huge investment to the automation of their production lines. Lastly, in line with the group's commitment to making packaging that are safe, circular and with lower environmental impact, the Brazilian site has placed environmental protection at the core of its concerns. ""Since the start of the design and technical development of a product, we think about it – the choice of the shape, the materials to be used, the recyclability, without forgetting the aesthetics. As for manufacturing processes, measures were implemented to reduce waste and consumption of energy and water,"" concludes Paula Froes."
Aptar: A greener and significantly more automated plant in Annecy,"After benefiting from an investment of more than 20 million euros for the reconstruction of its destroyed premises and of nearly 5 million to acquire new equipment (while most of the former equipment was saved from fire at the time), the site (ex-Graphocolor) broke its daily production record last June, with 9.5 million parts anodized, against a maximum of 7 to 8 million parts previously, and this less than a year after the site was up and running again in the summer of 2018. The reconstruction enabled to completely rethink the setting of the unit, in particular by separating as much as possible the pharmaceutical productions from the perfume and cosmetics productions. ""The building was streamlined to optimize production. The supply of the anodizing line was automated. While full traceability was established for the pharmaceutial line,"" explains Jean-François Régnier, the Director of the Annecy plant. Aptar expects production to reach 2.1 billion anodized parts in 2019 and 2.4 billion in 2020 thanks to the investments already made, and officials plans to quickly reach 3 billion pieces per year. All this while offering ""the widest range of shades in the world"" [1]. In parallel, a leap forward was also made environmentally speaking. ""We have tried to ban the notion of waste as much as possible and started from the premise that any residual production was in fact a new resource,"" says Jean-François Régnier. For instance, the phosphoric acid used in the anodising process is fully recycled. Thanks to the Siphos process, developed in-house, the rinsing baths are recovered, concentrated and then diluted and recycled. ""We manage to recover 98% of the phosphoric acid. It's a very virtuous circle that allows reducing our supply costs and costs required for acid neutralization. It's good for the environment and for our profitability."" Aptar Annecy, which is equipped since 2005, with an aluminium stamping workshop [2], following the same logic, recovers all its production residues, which can represent up to 50% of its supplies. All the residues generated from the stamping lines are centrifuged to extract maximum oil from them (Aptar undertakes to supply parts containing less than 2% oil), which are then sent back to the supplier who remelts them and resells them. Finally, all the effluents are treated. Acids that cannot be recycled and reused are treated with lime, the precipitation is then decanted and the sludge is recovered to be buried or recycled in cement plants. An ozoniser takes care of decontaminating the water. More than three years after the fire, the site's turnover should reach 56 million euros in 2019, against 47 million previously. The investments made necessary following the 2016 disaster where an opportunity to anticipate growth prospects and bring the site in line with new market requirements."
"Perfumes: Aptar to jump on the green bandwagon with screwable ""La Petite"" pump","At the Édition Spéciale by Luxe Pack show, Catherine Barucq, Director of the Study & Forecasting Division at Citeo (formerly known as Eco-Emballages), presented a very telling survey on luxury packaging. Among the 500 people asked the question, ""What is luxury packaging for you?"" 37% spontaneously answered ""packaging reuse"". Consumers increasingly feel embarrassed with packaging in its end of life, because they have to throw it away. Today, what they see as waste embodies the harm done by our consumer society. Given this context, would the screwable/unscrewable pump be the future of perfume? This technology is nothing new or revolutionary. When it was launched a few years ago, the screwable pump did not really seduce the market. Regulatory and sanitary constraints (some markets impose sealed pumps) and the fear of counterfeiting prevailed over the environmental dimension, which did not have as much impact back then. If the 1992 Mugler Fountain long remained on its own in the refillable category, the concept is starting to leave sufficiently olfactory trails behind to convince other groups. 1.2 million Mugler perfume bottles are said to have been refilled in 2017 - a significant reduction of the product's environmental impact. In 2018, the concept was reused by LVMH for the Louis Vuitton and Guerlain perfumes, and the list of prestigious brands keen on this principle cannot but get longer in 2020. ""Almost systematically, major brands ask us to create a version of their range with pumps that can be disassembled. The idea is either to make the bottle refillable, or to be able to separate the pump from the bottle, so that the product can be appropriately recycled. We have been working on new topics,"" Aptar beauty+home Marketing & Development Director Patrick Bousquel recently told Premium Beauty News. Just like its previous version, the screwable La Petite pump stands out with its invisible body, olfactory neutrality, and gentle handling, which offers consumers a sensorial gesture. It is available for two models: long-lasting and standard sprays. Its dimensions are close to crimp pumps, and the plastic fastener is coated with metal to avoid breakage and ensure a safe refill, says Aptar. Latest innovation in fragrances, including the increasing use of natural and locally sourced ingredients, will be discussed at the next edition of the Fragrance Innovation Summit in Paris on November 7th, 2019.

Make-up applicator expert Geka expands in Asia with new production site in Shanghai,"""By expanding its own capacities, Geka will move closer to its steadily growing customer base in the Far East and improve its ability to address their needs. The first lip gloss production started up on contract with a local cosmetic manufacturer in July,"" said the company in a release. In addition to the injection moulding and assembly workshop, Geka has staffed its Shanghai facility with local designers and project managers to provide a better support to its Chinese customers. By the end of the year, the facility will also be equipped with injection blow moulding (IBM) and decoration machines As far as full service is concerned, Geka Shanghai is negotiating with local fillers operations in order to be able to offer customers ready-to-market products. Simultaneously with the opening of these new capabilities, Geka is launching its modular BBS system in Asia. Already in place in Geka's German and US plants, the BBS consists of an extensive product catalogue of applications developed in-house and packaging solutions. The multiple combination options and the variety of plastic production technologies available allow the creation of customised items in a short time. According to Geka's APAC sales team the demand for BBS items will grow steadily in China. ""With trends changing constantly, the Chinese cosmetics industry needs time-to-market solutions that can be implemented quickly for newly developed cosmetics. The BBS range offers an attractive solution for this."" Eventually, to expand and strengthen their presence in Asia, Geka participate in the Cosmopack Asia tradeshow in Hong Kong for the first time this year on 12-14 November 2019."
Bakelite: A prime alternative to plastic?,"With its naturally high density of 1.5, cold feel and singular sonority, the Bakelite cap shares a long history with the world of luxury perfumes and cosmetics. ""The first perfume caps not made of glass were Bakelite-based,"" explains CEO Arnaud Revel. Supplanted by plastic in the 1970s, this non-petrochemical material is now gaining more interest. ""This technology is not widely known because the market is mostly focused on injection techniques involving different plastic types. And yet, it is a packaging solution which satisfies the four major criteria when it comes to choosing packaging: a technology adapted to the product's chemical specificities, countless design possibilities, a competitive price, and sustainable qualities,"" says Arnaud Revel. From a technical standpoint, thermosetting materials are insulating, so they offer an intrinsic compatibility with many bulk products for lids and jars. As for design, this material offers extremely thin, unique engravings. And as regards the price, Bakelite products are indeed more expensive than plastic, but Technicaps offsets this by offering a broad range of standard models for attractive prices. Lastly, as far as environmental protection is concerned, Bakelite is a good student. Often classified as plastic, it is actually derived from biosourced raw materials: 40% comes from wood cellulose and 60% from renewable elements like the air, water, and urea, a fertilizer widely used all around the world. To strengthen their environmental commitment, five years ago, Technicaps launched a broad plan based on the 3R strategy (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle). This approach helped reduce water consumption by four, but also boost production without increasing power consumption. ""We have evidence that for the same production level, between 2013 and 2018, we gained about 15g of CO2 per unit produced, and we produce 56 million a year,"" claims Arnaud Revel. In terms of reuse, the programme is aimed to reintegrate production flakes through a process added to the manufacturing phase. As regards recycling, the origin and properties of the raw material make it possible to upgrade products on the industrial scale. Technicaps has already implemented three solutions to this aim. The first is historic: the parts can be turned into blast to strip fragile surfaces, like plane cockpits. Another possibility, in partnership with Reprocover, consists in retransforming highly resistant thermoset parts for cable trays intended for railways, which are now made of concrete. Ultimately, part of crushed products can be distributed in horticultural fields. ""Most of our product is composed of urea, the most popular component in slow-release flower fertilizers."" Now, as regards recycling on the part of consumers, the product can be sorted, but it cannot be recycled, due to its small size. The same actually goes for all perfume and cosmetics caps. But since the product benefits from recycling systems, Technicaps is evaluating with Terracycle a solution to collect, sort, and valorize end of use products. Finally, it should be said that to produce one tonne of Bakelite, 1.14 tonne of CO2 is emitted, which is still three times less than to make one tonne of mass-produced thermosets."
Cosmogen launches a series of innovative make-up applicators,"At MakeUp in Paris, the watchword for the Cosmogen teams was once again to offer ever more innovative and efficient solutions. The new Perfect Match, for instance, is a patented brush designed to receive and apply a liquid foundation formula. It consists in a tank made of silicone where to deposit the foundation, and of a tuft made of synthetic hair that facilitates a professional-like application. ""I am very happy to have contributing designing this patent. Rhat was a challenge in the world of the make-up brushes. To succeed, I first analysed the market context and highlighted the heavy trend of liquid foundations, but with no adapted applicators. Thus, the idea was born behind Perfect Match! All this has been made possible thanks to the close collaboration with the technical team,"" explains Justine Rechenmann, product manager, brushes and accessories at Cosmogen. At MakeUp in Paris, Cosmogen also showcased new additions to its iconic Squeeze'n range with three new applicators 2-in-1: – Micro Squeeze'n Glow for lips, – Micro Squeeze'n Style for eyebrows, – and Micro Squeeze'n Spatula for face. Their patented On/Off closure rotary system protects the formula and allows to dispense the right dose before smoothing, sculpting or stretching on the targeted area with the formula. Like for all applicators in the Squeeze'n range, they are ergonomic and easy to clean, while preserving the formula of any contamination and oxidation. Their size makes them a nomadic cosmetic partner. For the face massage, which helps constrict blood vessels and drainage to avoid puffiness, specially under eyes, Cosmogen has designed three Precious Ridokis rollers from unique stones, with different colours and textures. The Kabuki Clean 2 in 1 is an innovative concept that has been designed to clean, exfoliate and refresh skin. The bristles clean trapped oil and bacteria from pores. The pad exfoliates and removes dead skincells from the T-Zone. It can be used with a cleansing gel. Eventually, with Half Moon Brush, Cosmogen offers one whole brush to apply face powder, while half parts are dedicated to contouring powder and highlighter."
MR Cartonnage Numérique makes digital printing's agility enter the industrial era,"""Always be a pioneer and look ahead"": that is how Jonathan Mihy, founder and CEO of MR Cartonnage Numérique, sums up his philosophy of action. On January 2, 2019, in Saint-Ouen L'Aumône, north-west of Paris, the company opened a second production site across 2,800 m2 fitted with an HP Indigo 30000 digital printer combined with a UV and acrylic varnishing line (Tresu iCoat 30000). This 2-million-euro investment was made possible when the company joined the DIAM International group in late 2017. As market needs are changing and the flexibility of digital printing is seducing more and more brands, MR Cartonnage aims to remain the key specialist in this field. ""No one can deny we are one technological and technical step ahead, but mass production involves new challenges: for example, we need to be able to manage colours on a large scale,"" emphasizes Jonathan Mihy. By capitalizing on their experience in digital colour reproduction, combining shaping and digital printing operations, MR Cartonnage intends to offer the folding case market more agility and speed. Thanks to industrial investments and a reorganized production on two sites, one dedicated to prototypes, the other to printing in series – they are now printing 7 million cases – the company defined an objective of 8 to 9 million for 2019, and no less than 12 to 15 million for 2020. Jonathan Mihy deeply believes that ""digital technologies will revolutionize the printing market in the luxury sector. They make it possible to meet the market's demand in terms of agility, speed, and sustainability."" The first target is the market of multi-reference case printing, i.e. cases that need specific printing variations, for example to mention a perfume or shade change. ""We have many requests in makeup. And since all shades are not sold in the same volumes, it is extremely convenient for brands to print series of different scales,"" explains the CEO. But digital printing also complies with ever-stricter time-to-market constraints. With their new industrial organization, MR Cartonnage Numérique not only intends to increase production volumes, but also accelerate their answer to customers. The opening of the second site actually goes with the launch of the One Week project aimed to reduce delivery times to one week, starting from the reception of the printing dossier. To get such a result and even gain more time upstream, MR Cartonnage also offers the services of MR Artworks, their internal executive agency. Lastly, digital printing offers many advantages as regards sustainability. ""Today, there is a real change in terms of mindset: brands take action for sustainable development,"" claims Jonathan Mihy. Digital technologies help minimize waste (no more than 20 sheets, compared to 200 to 500 with offset printing) and use compostable liquid inks (the HP inks used by MR Cartonnage Numérique are OK Compost EN 13432-certified). In addition, the company chose to work with Iggesund, whose Invercote cardboard offers a positive carbon footprint – its production absorbs more carbon than it emits. This sustainable commitment goes hand in hand with economic concerns. ""We are moving towards a big volume model with vast plants which help reduce unit costs, and towards digital, even connected plants which only produce what we need. Within a context of environmental protection and a possible ban on stock destruction, companies are starting to assess the cost of wastage, of obsolescence, and of what is produced."" The doors of the North-American market opened when MR Cartonnage Numérique joined the DIAM International group. The company is about to open an industrial prototyping workshop similar to what made it successful in Europe on the premises of the DIAM subsidiary, in Long Island, in NYC suburbs. Again, cutting-edge digital printing machines will be combined with small-scale processing machines to produce models and small series. An adventure to be followed!"
The Heinz-Glas Group presents a new furnace in Poland,"The capacity of this new fully rebuilt and quite impressive gas-fired furnace is now of 140 tonnes/day and it can be boosted to 180 tonnes/day. But the all-new 12-section production line, the first in Europe for cosmetic glass, is just as impressive: it comes in addition to the five other lines fed by this huge furnace, which produces glass continuously, seven days a week 365 days a year. This glass factory, which was acquired by the German glassmaker in the early 1990s, has been considerably modernized in recent years and this new investment is part of a deliberately dynamic strategy implemented by Heinz Glas. To note that in addition to this relatively large furnace dedicated to the production of white flint glass, the factory also has a fully electric furnace of 2 lines for opal glass, which is a rarity in the sector! Hence, a lot of people had made the trip for this inauguration, which was also attended by the Group's future CEO, Carletta Heinz, daughter of Carl-August Heinz. This was a perfect opportunity for Carl-AugustHeinz to thank all the staff members and the many customers who were present. It cannot be denied that this ultra-modern factory, which has become a model of its kind in just a few years' time, can boast being today one of the key components in the German Group's industrial glass making capabilities dedicated to the perfumery-cosmetic sector. However, a few kilometres from the glassworks, the Group can also rely both on a modern production tool specialised in decoration and a plastic production plant built ten years ago and which is home to no less than 40 machines for the production of caps, jars and bottles, with a staff of 130 people. In total, in the past 18 months, investments in Poland have exceeded 30 million euros and by the end of this year they will amount to more than 40 million euros! Carl-August Heinz in his address, recalled that his Group was doing well and that in the space of 20 years its position as a glassmaker serving the perfumery and high-end cosmetic industries had grown steadily. Heinz-Glas, which has production operations on most continents, currently employs 3,200 people spread in 5 glass factories and 12 other sites around the world, including Germany, of course, but also Poland, Peru, India, the Czech Republic, Switzerland and the United States and soon, again, China, where the Group will be operational early 2020."
Texen launches an alternative to soft flocked lips applicators,"For this new development, Texen relied on the advantages of a new material, Mucell, and on the expertise of make-up designer Michel Limongi. Thanks to Mucell technology, the applicators in the Beautifull Lips collection offer a unique sensorial experience with their smooth, lightweight feel born from the production process. Without flocking or glue and non-porous, the applicators offer major advantages in terms of both compatibility and hygiene. The use of this micro-injected thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) makes it possible to better control the raw material (and therefore the possible interactions with the formula) and to create applicators that are as flexible as desired. ""Each shape picks up the perfect dosage of formula as well as guaranteeing ease of application. This technology has been developed on an industrial scale at the Texen Mayet site, which centralizes the group's lip gloss and mascara expertise,"" explains Texen in a statement. The flexibility of Mucell allows Texen to offer a range of five applicators designed to target a specific result that is adapted to a given type of formula. Developed by Texen Beauty Partners, the pack has a short, wide stem to allow application as close to the lips as possible. A specific wiper and a tapered bottle complete the pack. The applicators of the Beautifull Lips range thus allow brands to develop solutions adapted to new formulas and gestures: – The Donut applicator features lateral cavities that capture the formula. The cavities can imprison a dense gloss texture to create a full, luminous effect on the lips. The Donut was selected on the Innovation Tree of the latest MakeUp in Paris trade show. – The Seashape applicator, with its asymmetric form, creates a professional makeup result with highly pigmented matte formulas. Its pointed tip is dedicated to precision while the concave part allows the user to fill the lips with color and its rounded back serves for finishing. – The Russian Doll applicator combines three benefits, subtly allowing a dégradé effect, a precise gesture and light effects when combined with a metallic formula. – The shape of the Facet applicator is designed for exfoliating formulas. The combination of texturizing cavities and a rigid applicator allows optimized results. – The specific curved shape of the Spatula provides sensuous nourishment, delivering a sufficient dose of hydrating formula to completely cover the lips."
Geka's innovative mascara brush and packaging solution on display at Paris make-up show,"The ""Curl Me"" mascara and the premium ""Polymorphe Mascara Packaging"" are part of the ""Kiss the Nature"" collection the German-based manufacturer presented at Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna in March 2019. Both products have been selected by the MakeUp IT Products Committee and will be presented on the Paris show's Innovation Tree. The ""Curl Me"" mascara includes Geka's new bi-injected brilliantEYES moulded brush featuring a curved design made with Geka's exclusive Sandwich technology. The two-shot technology produces a stable brush core surrounded by flexible and soft bristles. ""The curved brush shape is perfectly adapted to the lash line and coats every lash in an instant. It picks up every single lash and carefully bends it into a curl from base to tip,"" claims Geka. The packaging decoration is achieved by laser technology: the 360° wood optic is inspired by nature to create a highlight at the POS. The Polymorphe Mascara Packaging concept has been designed to meet rising market needs in terms of flexibility, time to market, as well as functionality and aesthetic requirements. Geka proposes a standard inner-bottle with a basic round form that can be used in combination with metal outer shells in a variety of shapes without any need of adjusting the inside bottle. Additionally, the surface of the metal makes the product a high-quality, high-end packaging option in various retail channels.

""What truly sets this new 3D configurator apart are the filtering options it offers users. Starting from over 100 stock components and 1200 possible combinations, the customer can find a perfect match by selecting from different criteria: desired make-up result, type of applicator, packaging filling volume or material, to name a few,"" says Geka in a release. Users can view the exact specifications of each component as they customize their pack, allowing them to instantly compare the benefits of each possible combination of components."
Will recycled aluminium soon be used in luxury packaging?,"It's a real change of culture for G. Pivaudran! The France-based company, which has established a reputation by working with high-purity aluminium, has starter a series of technical tests to understand what proportion of recycled aluminium could be used for stamping metalling parts for the luxury packaging markets. In theory, aluminium is infinitely recyclable. However, the use of recycled qualities in the luxury sector faces several challenges. The technical tests already carried out by G. Pivaudran on aesthetic treatments show it is possible to achieve very good results for matt and satin effects. ""However, we still have a lot of R&D work to do in order to adapt our processes to obtain better glossy effects,"" explains Hervé Delaigue, Sales & Business Development Director. Another challenge concerns mechanical qualities of aluminium. The company has planned further tests to adapt its know-how in stamping to recycled aluminium. As far as brands are concerned, there is a clear desire to go further in the development of products incorporating more recycled materials. However, given the aesthetic differences that remain, it is difficult to consider replacing pure aluminium by recycled qualities for products already launched. ""The results we achieved with recycled aluminium can nevertheless be very interesting for new projects that, from the outset, are designed with a strong ambition for sustainability,"" added Hervé Delaigue. Of course, G. Pivaudran's environmental commitment is not limited to these technical tests. The company has implemented a responsible policy regarding waste management, both at the production level and in the administrative offices. Moreover, in four years, the company reduced its energy consumption by 30% and divided its water consumption by two. ""Today, we collect and recycle or reuse all of our production waste and we are proud of that,"" said Marc Pivaudran, President of the company."
Bormioli Luigi: Half-weight stock refillable glass bottles soon available for premium fragrances,"In two weeks, Bormioli Luigi will start producing glass bottles for their new ecoLine range. The main feature of the new standard line is its lightness: the weight of the bottles has been halved compared to a traditional bottle of the same content, said Frédéric Montali, Business Development and Marketing Director told Premium Beauty News during the Édition Spéciale by Luxe Pack tradeshow, in Paris. Such a lightening was made possible through the combination of all the glassmaker's skills, including their knowhow related to moulds and design. The range, which features two models: ecoCube (square-shaped) and ecoTube (cylindrical), comes in two sizes, 50 ml and 100 ml with a weight of 50 grams and 100 grams respectively. To respond to a growing demand for refillable solutions, the new bottles are provided with standard CV15 neck making the bottles compatible with a standard screw pump solution to accept refills and optimise recycling by allowing an easy separation of the closure system from the glass bottle. The possibility to separate the packaging components meets a growing consumer request, according to the various testimonies made during the conference held at the two-day show. To address the expectations of consumers in terms of sustainability, but also to increase store traffic, retailers are offering a growing number of collection points for end-of-life perfume and cosmetics packaging. At the beginning of the year, during the PCD Paris show, Bormioli Luigi showcased a first lightweight model designed in partnership with Coverpla. For some years now, Bormioli Luigi uses the same lightening technology to offer 50 and 30 ml glass jars with a respective weight of 64 and 50 grams. These light versions of their bottles and jars have the same properties as heavier models and accept all traditional decoration techniques."

Braskem's sugarcane plastics are already used by more than 150 brands worldwide,"In a context of growing concerns regarding global warming, plastics produced from vegetal resources may represent part of the solution. In some cases, using green resources instead of fossil-carbon helps to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Since 2007, Brazilian petrochemical company Braskem has been working on a type of plastic made from the ethanol obtained from sugarcane. ""This green polyethylene is the first in the world to come from a renewable source,"" says Gustavo Sergi, director of renewable chemicals at Braskem. ""Its main feature is that it helps counteract the effect of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as it captures carbon monoxide in its production process."" Company data shows that each ton of green polyethylene produced corresponds to over three tons of CO2 removed from the atmosphere. The product patented by Braskem easily substitutes traditional plastic, meaning there is no need to invest in new conversion machinery. ""Green polyethylene boasts the same technical properties, performance and versatility of applications as plastic made from fossil fuel"", states Gustavo Sergi. The solutions currently available can be divided into three categories, HDPE (high density polyethylene), LDPE (low density polyethylene), and LLDPE (linear low-density polyethylene), and can be used in all kinds of industry. With a production capacity of 200,000 tons a year, the industrial green polyethylene plant production located in the Rio Grande do Sul state, in the South of Brazil, is already exporting its output to countries in South America, North America, Asia and Europe. ""Over 150 brands from across the globe currently use this product in their plastic packaging,"" says Sergi. Examples of personal care and cosmetics companies that use Braskem's green polyethylene include Brazilian companies O Boticário and Neutrox. Outside Brazil, companies such as Shiseido and Bulldog - which focuses on male products - have also opted for Braskem's green polyethylene. ""End consumers can identify green polyethylene through its accompanying 'I'm green™' label, which is only awarded to brands that use this renewable material in their packaging,"" says Sergi. Braskem is currently working on other sustainable solutions. ""Our investments in research and innovation include partnerships with universities, research centers and private companies, with a main focus on technologies that yield products from renewable sources,"" says Sergi. He adds that green polyethylene itself has also spawned other sustainable products. ""When we were studying green polyethylene applications, we discovered, for instance, a family of EVA resins (a copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate), which is also produced from sugarcane, and can be used for making shoes, sporting goods, automotive components, in construction and more."" Gustavo Sergi also highlights the beginning of operations at a pilot plant that is pioneering the production of monoethylene glycol (MEG) from sugar. This raw material is used in the textile industry and, most importantly, for manufacturing PET bottles. The expectations are huge - after all, every minute 1 million plastic bottles are sold in the world, according to a 2016 survey by Euromonitor."
Eastman accelerates its entry into the circular economy,"Initially unveiled at the Monaco show, Trēva is a cellulose-based plastic for opaque and colour-tinted packaging with better performance and less environmental impact. It can serve as a direct replacement for ABS and enables opportunities for down-gauging in those applications. Its bio-content of over 40 percent enables brands to progress toward sustainability commitments while moving away from materials listed on Proposition 65 (the Californian legislation on carcinogenic and reprotoxic substances). The Eastman Cristal EV600 copolyester is a glasslike high-flow polymer that is Cradle to Cradle Certified Bronze by the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute. In March and April, Eastman announced two recycling innovations, Advanced Circular Recycling and Carbon Renewal Technology that enable recycling of mixed polyester and mixed plastic waste. Using methanolysis, advanced circular recycling breaks down polyester-based products into their polymer building blocks. These can then be reintroduced to the production of polyester-based polymers, delivering a true circular solution. Eastman projects full-scale operations of the Advanced Circular Recycling solution to be available within 24-36 months. The Carbon Renewal Technology converts mixed plastic waste, including plastics that are difficult to recycle such as cosmetics packaging, back to its molecular components. These are reintroduced to the production of a variety of materials, like plastics and cellulosic products. ""Trēva will be one of the first Eastman products to benefit from carbon renewal technology, which will further enhance Trēva's beginning-of-life profile,"" said Kendra Harrold, marketing director for packaging. ""In addition to having over 40 percent of its content from biobased materials, Trēva enabled by carbon renewal technology will have a significant part of its remaining content derived from allocated certified recycled plastic."" Eastman plans to have this product commercially available before the end of 2019. ""These innovations are only the beginning,"" continued Harrold. ""Eastman is committed to working with our value chain partners to create real solutions toward a true circular economy."""
Plastic reduction: Stora Enso biocomposite solutions now available for cosmetics packaging,"Originally launched last year, DuraSense is a blend of wood fibres and polymers, which can be fossil, bio-based or recycled, depending on the brands' requeriements. The new family of materials was originally designed to be suitable for a wide range of applications (furniture, pallets, hand tools, automotive parts, accessories and packaging for beauty and lifestyle products, toys and items, such as kitchen utensils and bottle caps), but it is now officially available for cosmetics, food and luxury packaging. According to Stora Enso, introducing DuraSense to new customer segments is ""another step on the journey to gradually replace fossil-based packaging materials with renewable solutions."" Thanks to the wood fibres they contain, DuraSense biocomposites allow to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of packaging materials. For instance, with a blend of wood fibres and bio-based polymers, it is possible to get up to 98% renewable content. ""Reducing the amount of plastic is high on our customers' agenda, and they want help in replacing non-renewable materials. With DuraSense we can now offer different biocomposite solutions, such as caps and bottle stoppers, to demanding customers in premium cosmetics, food and luxury segments with very high standards in both aesthetics and quality,"" says Hannu Kasurinen, SVP Head of Liquid Packaging and Carton Board at Stora Enso. Furthermore, the wood used for DuraSense comes from sustainably managed Nordic forests covered by third-party-certified Chain of Custody systems. ""With wood-based biocomposites, the consumption of plastic materials can be reduced by up to 50%, ensuring that less plastic ends up in the environment. DuraSense can also be reused as a material up to seven times, recycled along with plastic materials or used for energy recovery at the end of its life,"" adds Lars Axrup, Head of Business, Sustainable Packaging Components at Stora Enso. According to Stora Enso, another interest of DuraSence wood-based biocomposites is their low impact on production costs. ""With little or no change to existing production techniques, the biocomposite material is developed to match conventional plastics and therefore fit existing moulds,"" claims the company. All the more so as Stora Enso started the commercial production of biocomposites in 2018 and now has the largest capacity in Europe dedicated to wood-fibre-based composites."
Quadpack unveils new design roadmap,"With the purpose to enhance the creativity of its teams and to stimulate dialogue with customers, the packaging supplier's new roadmap is based on four major consumer themes. Themes and not trends! ""Trends imply a start and stop, whereas themes are a more organic evolution that research shows better represents today's sophisticated consumer landscape,"" says Katie Hoddinott, Head of Design at Quadpack's Design & Advanced Technologies department. In order to make the four themes less abstract and easier to relate to the brand's consumers, each of them was associated to personalities: Oracle Oracle addresses the desire for sensorial experiences. Packaging that is tactile and scented, made of wood, glass and crystal, and has a deeper meaning. Oracle carries a touch of new-age mystique and takes inspiration from wellness and traditional cures. 3Rs Quadpack's desire for a more sustainable world is addressed in the 3Rs theme. Consumers are searching for brands that help them make more ethical, greener choices with packaging that can be Reduced, Re-used and Recycled. Phygital Shopping on your smartphone is the new normal. The Phygital theme responds to this brave new world with intelligent packaging concepts that are digital, connected, 3D printed and blur the lines between reality and AR. All About Me Gender fluidity, the 'me generation', customisation; the All About Me theme is all about this new hyper-individualism and a playful outlook on life. It speaks to people who want to break the rules and want beauty on their own unique terms. The Georgina case Georgina is one of the personalities who embody these themes: ""I love fashion, and dress to express my moods and feelings. I am very free-spirited; so, don't try to dictate to me! Searching for a deeper meaning is second nature, and I like my make-up and skin products to 'speak' to me in unexpected ways with a fun gesture or fragrance. I get a real kick out of products that are as spontaneous as I am, but I also appreciate things that are simple and unpretentious. My friends and I are always talking about great things we find on social media, especially Instagram. Anything that expresses the way I feel I share with them. They are my tribe."" To meet Georgina's expectations, Quadpack suggests the Turia jar from their Q-Line catalogue. This compact 10ml jar is a ready-made solution for lip balms, solid fragrances and travel formats. Versatile, easily decorated, the Turia jar is ready to go with just about anything. Just like the personality it was associated with."
Aptar makes a zero-plastic and recycled packaging for Lush's refillable lipstick,"Produced by Aptar Reboul - the entity of the Aptar group which specialises in metal packaging, and particularly in lipstick packaging - the tube is made in aluminium and brass, 40% of which is recycled material, and does not contain any plastic. It has been designed to be fully refillable and recyclable. The lipstick refills are inserted after removing the black wax tab from their base: then all that's needed is to slide the stick down by twisting the tube so it slots into place until the next product refill is needed. ""Every year, 800 to 900 million lipstick tubes are sold worldwide, most being made of plastic or containing plastic derived elements that are difficult to recycle. According to Lush, 25 billion tubes are thrown away in England every year [1]. This is inconceivable for the brand, which advocates a more ethical cosmetics consumption, and presented a challenge for Aptar Reboul, who was invited to come up with an environmentally friendly solution,"" explained Aptar Beauty + Home. Acquired by Aptar in 2018, Reboul is well-known for its in-depth expertise in metal processing (from drawing to completion), parts decoration and multi-material assembly, and is also an expert in the field of innovative lipstick mechanisms. ""We discovered Reboul at the last PCD trade show in Paris; it is one of only two companies in the world with the technology and experience needed to manufacture them on the scale we needed,"" highlighted Lee Carpenter, Lush Creative Packaging. While all brands are looking for more sustainable solutions, Aptar Beauty + Home has accelerated its transition to a circular economy. The company already offers several solutions for the different categories of cosmetics: mono-material packaging to facilitate recycling, incorporation of post-consumer recycled plastic (PCR), rechargeable products, etc. Beyond the eco-design of packaging, Aptar also explains being transforming its manufacturing processes to minimize their environmental impact. ""We have a launched an important innovation effort. But talking about sustainability makes sense only where it is possible to measure the reduction of the environmental impact. Therefore, we are also setting targets such as using 55% renewable energy in our manufacturing sites by 2021,"" said Jean-Jacques Ligny, Vice President Global Marketing, Digital and Communications."
Metsä Board renews its folding boxboard portfolio to better address new packaging needs,"For this new range Metsä Board focused on current main packaging issues. For instance, as far as the environment is concerned, the new range opens new light-weighting possibilities. Other benefits include new customer benefits by boosting brand appeal with enhanced and balanced visual properties. ""Packaging of the future is all about creating better brand experiences with less environmental impact. It is important that we continuously develop new solutions to make packaging even more safe and sustainable. For example, improvements to our new High Yield Pulp have enabled us to further enhance our paperboards thus providing even further opportunities for brand owners to lightweight their packaging,"" states Ari Kiviranta, SVP Development, Metsä Board. The improved grades are available for samples and trials from May. The new range consists of five grades: – MetsäBoard Natural FBB - NEW is an uncoated, rigid OBA-free grade that provides an on-trend natural surface to provide authenticity to high end product packaging. – MetsäBoard Classic FBB remains unchanged offering the same superior stiffness and high yield as before. – MetsäBoard Pro FBB OBAfree - NEW presents an improved OBA-free grade with high natural brightness combined with excellent printability. – MetsäBoard Pro FBB Bright - NEW is a multipurpose board with high brightness on top and reverse, now offering further opportunities for lightweighting. – MetsäBoard Prime FBB Bright - NEW combines superb brightness, new bluish white shade and high stiffness offering sustainable luxury for high end packaging. ""The new, improved Metsä Board range now offers even stronger performance in highly demanding end-uses, such as food, beautycare, healthcare or luxury packaging and graphics applications,"" says the Finnish manufacturer."
Seaweed and bamboo fibres: Luxe Pack Shanghai rewards alternative packaging solutions,"For the first time since its inception, the Luxe Pack in green Shanghai best sustainable packaging solution was awarded to two companies ex-aequo: Favini and Nationalpak. The jury [1] considered their submissions were both excellent in terms of lower environmental impact and showed an equal great interest for brands. The prize was awarded on April 10th, on the first day of the 12th edition of Luxe Pack Shanghai. Italy's Favini Srl won the award for the secondary packaging of the Bio+ Vagheggi range of organic cosmetics. In line with their sustainable concept, the Italian phytocosmetic brand Vagheggi has chosen Favini's Shiro Alga Carta to pack their new organic and vegan Bio+ range. This paperboard was originally designed as a way to use the detrimental algal blooms of the Venice lagoon, in partial substitution of cellulose fibres. The concept was then extended to other fragile marine areas. Furthermore, this packaging uses no varnishing, no glue, no additional leaflets or labels: the pack itself is a writeable surface. The Hong Kong based provider of luxury packaging solutions Nationalpak was awarded for their Compostable Stone Massage Oil Packaging. concept. For Luxe Pack Shanghai, the company developed a massage oil packaging with a shape inspired by spa hot stones. The packaging, which can contain three bottles of massage oil, is made from compostable bamboo fibre mixed with biodegradable resins. Bamboo was selected for its environmental credentials. The plant is grown without pesticides or chemical fertilisers, and no irrigation is required. It grows rapidly and can be harvested in 3-5 years. Bamboo produces 35% more oxygen than regular trees, and is an excellent soil erosion inhibitor. The Compostable Stone Massage Oil Packaging was tested and certified by European Union EN13432 standard. According to Natpack, when place into particular soil conditions, it will take approximately 3-6 months to complete the degradation. It contains no harmful substances and zero pollution to the environment. In addition to the best sustainable packaging solution, Nationalpak was also awarded in the sustainable initiative category. The company set up an Environmental Protection Working Group to promote environmental protection policies. They constantly educate their team about environmental issues."
Porex launches high-efficiency reservoir for makeup formulations,"Designed for liquid-based makeup products like eyeliners, lip liners and lip stains, Porex's new high-efficiency reservoir offers an optimal wicking of liquid formulations and a more uniform flow and consistent, precise application with every use. Thanks to a unique porous structure, with a double capillarity, allows liquid formula to dispense evenly and to provide consumers with 5-10% greater formula extraction. This improved restitution rate allows manufacturers to prolong their product life or reduce their formula fill volume. Actually, with traditional reservoirs, up to 30 percent of an eye or lip liner formula can remain in the pen or the tube. ""Our proprietary design allows for consumers to consistently extract the exact amount of formula they want, when they want it, adding reliability and convenience to a highly personal activity and saving valuable liquid formula,"" said Rusty Martin, global strategic marketing director for Porex. ""Through this design, our new high-efficiency reservoir enables brands to deliver a product that provides optimal performance and precise formula application, while also having a positive impact on the environment."" Made with 100 percent fiber-to-film sealed wraps, Porex eye and lip liner reservoirs combine customizable porous structures with specially designed fiber blends to be compatible with a wide range of formulas. Last year, Porex already presented an innovative technology addressing restitution and dosage issues of cushion compacts. The Fiber Cushion latex-free, hypoallergenic, super-soft and patented foams work with all types of makeup, skin care, and fragrance formulas and provide a touch-driven response that prevents leakage and product waste. They were designed exclusively for skin contact are ideal for a wide variety of cosmetic and personal care products."
"""Make & trade is the cornerstone of Cosfibel's strategy,"" Alain Chevassus","In a period of deep and fast transformation for the luxury packaging sector, where brands and consumers' expectations have shifted to new paradigms, Alain Chevassus intends to bring Cosfibel into a new era. ""With a renewed and stabilized operational management, the company now has to write the second part of its history; it will be more global, with an accelerated diversification towards new categories,"" he explains. As a consequence of the mergers and acquisitions game ""a small group of multinationals now contributes to two-thirds of the global market,"" says the Alain Chevassus. However, as far as the supply side is concerned, the business structure remains fragmented. ""To better meet the expectations of their global customers, packaging and merchandising suppliers must consolidate and globalize their offer."" Thus, Cosfibel recently signed three partnership agreements to complete its product ranges and bring its sourcing activities closer to European customers. First, the company is developing its make and trade policy in Spain thanks to investments at Grumbe and an exclusive partnership agreement to become the exclusive representative in France and Benelux of Tendero, a company specialising in rigid cardboard boxes for the Fashion, Beauty, Wine & Spirits and Fine Foods markets. Located in Alicante, Tendero has eight automatic production lines. It should achieve a turnover of 9 million Euros in 2019. This new industrial capacity will complement Grumbe's range of boxes and plastic folding cases, extra to the folding line of cardboard gluing they have just been investing in. In addition, Cosfibel signed a long-term exclusivity agreement with the Franco-Tunisian group La Soie, a recognized specialist in spinning, knitting and sewing. This agreement will enable Cosfibel to develop its catalogue of textile products and accessories in its three Beauty, Wine & Spirits, Fine Food markets. It will also bring its Bags and Accessories activities closer to its main customers. Finally, Cosfibel also signed a long-term exclusivity agreement with the HPC Group, a specialist in plastic injection and that will be the company's exclusive contact to develop their sourcing activities in Tunisia. HPC Tunis also becomes part of Cosfibel's Urban Network of sales offices around the world to develop the sales in the Maghreb region. After a year of consolidation in 2018, Alain Chevassus is highly confident for the current year. ""Thanks to a strong management team led by Stanislas Peronnet, a solid commercial team and a healthy financial position, we can expect a double-digit growth in 2019, good profitability and a growth of our global sales, in line with emerging markets in Asia and Latin America."" With 20 sales offices (dubbed ""Urban Networks"") around the world, Cosfibel relies on creativity, and proximity to its customers. ""We sell creativity, trust and security rather than mere packaging, and that allows us to appeal to the most demanding customers, including in Asia where we forecast to achieve 20% of our turnover soon,"" adds Alain Chevassus. ""The story that will be unfolded for Cosfibel is based on a 'make and trade' strategy with packaging and merchandising solutions fully dedicated to luxury brands,"" concludes the president of Cosfibel."
The refillable solution conquers premium skincare,"Cosmetics packaging professionals are unanimous in observing that the demand for refill solutions in skincare is growing, both on the part of luxury and mass market brands. Of course, the solution can be improved, because it requires two containers, but it does significantly minimize the environmental impact and support consumers, better and better aware of their buying acts, in their proactive approach. Ranges like Absolue by Lancôme and Or Rouge by Yves St Laurent recently adopted this principle, confirming the alliance between luxury and the concept of product refillability. To Carol Poltorak, Packaging Director EMEA of the L'Oréal Group, the refill concept is a new business model to be built. ""It mirrors the objective of reducing plastic consumption, one of the pillars of the L'Oréal environmental strategy, while preserving the luxury codes. Our brands are actually willing to apply this concept to other formulas, like serums or lotions,"" she says, confirming they have all been thinking about this approach seen as one of the new optimization levers, with more or less valorization. ""We have one main constraint, though: preserving the brand's luxury codes, even for our refills. We are also studying how we could provide a service that would complement these refills,"" adds Carol Poltorak. Suppliers are particularly aware of this constraint. ""As can be seen with what was done with high-end coffee machines, a refill is not necessarily viewed as low-end. There are a lot of beautiful things to be done. Consumers should be able to find luxury in this refill, even if it is only seen once,"" explains Raul Cervantes, Personal Care Market Manager of Albéa. For Absolue by Lancôme, a refillable product developed in collaboration with Heinz-Glas, for the main jar, the bottom of the cup designed by Albéa is embossed with the Lancôme Rose to relay the brand's codes in the tiniest details. Other constraints include the refill positioning and extraction. ""All this should be as easy as possible for consumers, so, for each design we adapt the cup fixation to the original jar"", emphasizes Carol Poltorak. Refills are often concealed by the jars, which play the role of cases and are meant to be kept, as can be seen with Or Rouge by Yves St Laurent, developed by Bormioli Luigi. ""It is the external container that reflects the luxury codes, usually with a significant volume and weight. The technical constraint consists in concealing the cup,"" says Federico Montali, Marketing Director of the Italian glassmaker. This cup can also be made of glass: the Verescence group has registered a patent for this type of solution. ""Generally speaking, the main constraint lies in thinking about an ideal combination of the two containers well ahead, with our different partners. The cup should be perfectly integrated to the jar to give the impression it is a single product,"" adds Raul Cervantes. ""We believe it will be a long-term trend, there will be a before and after,"" asserts Patricia Beauval, Sales Manager of RPC Bramlage Barcelona. The plastic packaging expert manufacturer has just introduced the new Natura Pack line based on this principle: plastic jar + PP refill + cap. The main jar is available in four shapes, cylindrical, oval, amphora, and rectangular, and the 50 ml size refill is made of PP, so it is recyclable. ""We believe in this concept so much that we will broaden our range and work on solutions based on recycled materials,"" adds Patricia Beauval. The environmental savings depend on plastic weight and consumption. Here, the weight of a jar with a refill equals that of 14 refills. The transport cost of a million refills is reduced by 63%, compared to the same number of full jars, which corresponds to about 50% less CO2 emissions. Whatever the segment, the reuse solution seems to be one of the most efficient in reducing the carbon impact. But it does require consumers to accept the approach. ""Today, the priority for brands is to convince consumers. If they do not make the effort of separating the pieces, nothing we do upstream will pay off,"" explains Raul Cervantes. Brands share this point of view. ""The main point is to make the market communicate more about these refills, even beyond consumers. It all depends on the impact in stores, on how we explain the product benefits. Consumers need to be able to easily find the refills: all this is detailed on the product labels, but we can do more to support this market change. The objective is to make an environmental gesture that helps reduce the impact of plastic use, while preserving the notion of customer experience,"" concludes Carol Poltorak."
"Clean, recyclable, connected and innovative: Mintel unveils the future of packaging","Connected Packaging: Multiple technologies are enabling brands to connect physical packaging to the virtual world. ""Connected packaging is witnessing renewed interest, driven by growth in ownership of connected devices worldwide and advancement in technologies that link packaging to the online world,"" explains David Luttenberger, Global Packaging Director at Mintel. Brands now have a wealth of options to connect virtually with packaging. Connected packaging can be the link between physical and digital shopping worlds, giving brands a route to some control over how the brand and product is viewed online, as well as being able to deliver engaging content and product-specific information to directly influence purchasing decisions. Closing the Loop: Brands have an opportunity to differentiate and ride consumer awareness of recycling issues. Though recyclable packaging claims have become common, claims to include recycled content are still rare. Consumers have been recycling some packaging for years and already think that recyclable packaging is standard. They are now demanding more. ""Brands have an opportunity to differentiate and ride consumer awareness of recycling issues by being part of the solution and committing to using recycled material in new packaging,"" writes Mintel in the report. Reinventing the Box: With online shopping set to gain further popularity, brands must fully establish an e-commerce packaging strategy. Global e-commerce sales reached more than US$2.1 trillion in 2017 and are expected reach US$3.8 trillion by 2021, representing an annual growth rate of around 14% per year. As consumers increasingly embrace online shopping, branded e-commerce packaging and packaging strategies are changing the face of the industry. ""The rapid development of e-commerce has had more of an impact on the design of packaging globally than anything the industry has experienced in the past several decades,"" comments David Luttenberger. ""In e-commerce, brands are learning that messaging and branding should be split between the shipping container and the interior of the box - with the latter incorporating elements that give consumers a sense of delight and surprise when opening the parcel."" Of course, consumers' expectations depend on the type of product ordered online, but brands must consider that consumers will continue to equate the quality of the product and brand with the care taken to package and ship it. Plastic-Free: With the momentum behind a plastic free aisle in every supermarket growing, brands need to consider what packaging solution can give them a place on the shelf. Linked to the growing awareness of the harmful effects of plastics on the environment and human health, plastic repulsion is growing among shoppers and new opportunities such as plastic-free aisles, package-free stores and alternative pack materials allow them to actively make choices about the plastic that is put in their basket. ""Brands should act now, either to ensure a place in emerging plastic-free zones by switching to acceptable pack materials, or by engaging with the debate, clearly explaining the benefits of plastic packaging to their product, and addressing plastic pollution concerns with appropriate end of life pack solutions,"" concludes David Luttenberger."
Silgan Dispensing focuses on agility and sustainability,"To help brands to better meet their time-to-market and sustainability targets, Silgan Dispensing is launching two new initiatives this year: the XpressService for Fragrance and Skincare, which aims to boost agility and flexibility, and a series of pumps and trigger sprayers featuring PCR plastic. ""XpresService for Fragrance and Skincare is our way of being agile, flexible and quick in reducing the time to market for our partners' new launches and accelerating their lead time for replenishment orders,"" explains the manufacturer of dispensing solutions. The service features several ranges of standard caps and necks in various colours for the company's Melody and Orchestra pumps, along with in-house etching capabilities. Brands immediately receive the price corresponding to the chosen shade and can expect to save 4 to 6 weeks compared to a usual project. This new solution complement other recent technical advances allowing to accelerate new product developments, such as the customizable extensions for spray actuators that Silgan showcased at the latest Luxe Pack Monaco show. Indeed, brands are increasingly eager to keep in line and even ahead of the latest trends, reduced lead-times, in particular for short series and customised lines, clearly appear as key factors of success. Sustainability is the other important development axis of the year for Silgan. ""To consumers, sustainable packaging is more than a 'nice to have;' it is something they are demanding of brands more and more,"" highlighted Brinder Gill, senior manager, global beauty category development.

""Silgan Dispensing's PCR products give our clients an innovative way to meet a growing consumer demand, while also helping achieve their own sustainability goals,"" concludes Brinder Gill."
Augros Cosmetic Packaging celebrates its 100th anniversary and announces an ambitious action plan,"Premium Beauty News - 2019, a year like no others? Didier Bourgine - That's true. The year of our centenary will be full of surprises; it is our way of paying tribute to those thanks to who we are here today. What motivates me is the passion driving the men and women with whom I work: our teams, our customers, our partners and suppliers. It is with them that Augros wants to celebrate its 100 years of existence. Premium Beauty News - What have you planned? Didier Bourgine - First, moments for celebration and sharing, starting this summer in the Orne Department and this autumn in Paris, with, and for those who participated in the successful crossing of this first century of existence. We have also planned open days on our two production sites in Alençon and Le Theil, for our customers but also the press and public authorities. And like every year, we will take part to major public events. We attended the last PCD show in Paris in January, and we are preparing a special celebration for the next Places D'Or event that will take place in November next. An innovative and collector's object is being designed for this purpose. It is the artwork of a famous designer. This object will reflect the ongoing creativity of our trade, all the know-how of Augros and it will symbolize this important milestone for the whole Company. Premium Beauty News - A centenary year but also a pivotal year? Didier Bourgine - You are right, ""pivotal"" in more than one way since we recently made unprecedented industrial investments with the start of a new sputter metallization line which will be followed with the commissioning of a new automated lacquering line. All these investments representing nearly three million euros. These investments, beyond the added technological competitiveness they offer, are part of our drive to continuously improve our environmental footprint. One our projects this year is to move from the Ecovadis Silver rating level to the Ecovadis Gold rating level. Finally, we released quite a few innovations, among which, the new Mercedes-Benz line for INCC Parfums, with a complete tailor-made development (i.e., a specific colour and an automatically assembled actuator). An achievement to which took part the two sites of the Group. We can also mention the 8 flankers in the Alien line (Thierry Mugler, Clarins); for Sisley a jar made of PMMA with an inner lacquering and its cap also with an inner lacquering and with a white laser engraving. In the make-up area, we also made the decor of Dior's Ultra Rouge, with a particularly complex coating to achieve on the aluminium case designed by Tesem. Our teams are also changing with the arrival of Rodolphe Bénouville, our new Sales Manager. Premium Beauty News - The next big appointment: July 20 in Alençon!? Didier Bourgine - This will be the first moment of celebration to thank and pay tribute to our teams and local partners, in Normandy."
"Serge Mansau, the artist","Elegant with romantic looks, often with a cigar in one hand, and an a pencil in the other, Serge Mansau has never stopped creating, drawing to see his dreams and desires come true, under the shape of either perfume bottles, or sculptures. It was a real four-handed work with Estelle, his wife, who used to bring him back, all sorts of materials such as leaves, dried fruit peels and even soil… She never stopped protecting him, and would understand him, better than anybody ! All along his 50 years of career, Serge Mansau never lost his desire of innovating and upsetting the world of perfumery. As a matter of fact, Anne-Caroline Prazan, International Marketing Director Perfume and Artistic director Maison Guerlain 68 told me ""He knew how to challenge the a priori and the rules of the perfumery world."" First of all, he was inhabited with his passion for the shape and the emptiness of the flacon, but also had a great intuition. Yet, he wanted to work with passionate people, and to feel their confidence, was dear to his heart. On the other hand, he also cared a lot, for intellectual sharings, with a great mutual respect, for his fans ! He established a real relationship with Jean-Louis Dumas, for the making of 24 Faubourg and L'Eau des Merveilles by Hermès. But also with Jacques Vignaud, a great friend over the years, with whom he will accomplish the perfume Un Homme and L'Insolent by Charles Jourdan. Then, it will be with Kenzo Takada for Kenzo Ça Sent Beau, Kenzo pour Homme or as well Flower by Kenzo. They all understood the power, that he put into his perfume bottles. But also, with Pierre Broc, previous President of Kenzo Perfume most impressed by Serge's miracles on Kenzo perfumes, Vivre and Quartz by Molyneux. At last, Anne-Caroline Prazan with Insolence and the drawing of the Petite Robe Noire from Guerlain. In his ivory tower at Thiverval around Paris, Serge Mansau was really a sculptor of perfume bottles, imagining always a new world of glass. His genious mind appeared, by being nourrished with his meetings, with Charles Dullin and Marcel Marceau, known as Mime Marceau, with whom he took a course. That is how he will start his career, as a stage designer at Charles Dullin. It's fascinating, considering his passion for the theater world, that he will consider himself, as a theater director of the all elements, so to write a play, in which the leading role was given to the perfume bottle ! From there, his talent will take him to Helena Rubinstein, as an interior designer of her shops, and the creation of Skin Dew, his first perfume bottle. From then on, his career was launched. And, he will dress all Paris wiht bottle for the perfume industry ! In one word, Serge was definitely a free man, as Jacques Vignaud underlines. He was an imaginary transmitter with the Paradise, as the only limit ! Nicolas Goulier makes a special request today! ""And why not encapsulate the perfumes of the Celestial Kingdom ? All my respect."" We all hope !"
How Albéa is going green?,"Albéa thus committed to making 100% of plastic packaging reusable or recyclable, by 2025 and set an ambitious 2025 recycled content target of 10% across all plastic packaging used. The company already produces 33 million tubes with PCR polyethylene. PCR (post-consumer recycled) plastic is made from single-use packaging (milk or beverage bottles) that is used and sorted before going through recycling channels. According to Albéa, the use of PCR reduces the carbon footprint of a tube by 16% (compared to a conventional Ø50mm plastic tube, 200ml with a 500μm Cebal cap). For every one million PCR tubes produced, the equivalent of 16 tons of CO2 can be saved. These tubes can be fully recycled via existing collection systems, which already exist in Germany, Sweden, Italy, Spain, and Portugal; in the process of being deployed in France, the Netherlands, and the UK. Beyond tubes, foam pumps are now also available with PCR. ""A pump produced with 100% PCR polypropylenec (cap, neck, and actuator) reduces its carbon footprint by 47%,"" claims Albéa. Albéa first introduced bioplastics in 2010, produced from Brazilian sugar cane. Throughout its life cycle, sugar cane absorbs the CO2 it needs to grow. The amount of cane used to produce one kilo of biobased PE has thus absorbed 3kg of CO2. According to Albéa, biobased PE tubes manufactured by the group provide a carbon footprint that is 76% lower than that of a conventional plastic tube, while its 100% biobased PE foam bottles reduce carbon footprint by 47%. As part of its policy to reduce packaging materials, Albéa offers - thanks to the combination of the SLIM Cap and THIN-WALL sleeve - one of the lightest polyethylene (PE) tubes on the market. The tube's total weight is reduced by 33% compared to a standard tube, in particular due to the reduction by 30% of the thickness of the tube's walls (from 500μm to 350μm). As the reuse of packaging is a very effective way of reducing the environmental impact of packaging, Albéa has showcased Spiral is the latest innovation in perfume pumps at Luxe Pack Monaco. It can be unscrewed to make the bottle both refillable and recyclable. As far as recyclability is concerned, Albéa highlights EZ'R, a 100% recyclable and lightweight foam pump that reduces total packaging weight and water needed for use, as well as My Style Bag and My Little Case, ultra-light palettes, designed in one piece for a much easier recycling. Furthermore, these palettes use about 30% less plastic than a conventional palette."
"Premiumisation, protection, sustainability: Sleever is at the heart of cosmetic trends","The labelling, decoration and promotion solutions developed by Sleever International have already proved their ability to meet brands' needs regarding point-of-sale differentiation, event customization, or late adaptation to market specificities. Beyond the mass-market and masstige segments, Sleever International's heat-shrinkable films have attracted a growing number of luxury brands, in markets as diverse as wines and spirits, beauty, pharmaceuticals and food. Illustrating this success in the high-end segment, Sleever showcased at ADF&PCD Paris its latest achievement for Oribe. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the luxury haircare brand's iconic Texturizing Spray, Sleever has produced a black and gold decorated sleeve with sequins patterns. Those are underlined by tactile relief printings, highlighting the product's design and creating surprising touch effects. Another novelty presented by Sleever International at the Paris show, the wrapping and decoration of Avène's Xeracalm 400ml. For its line of sterile cosmetics, offering preservative-free formulas which properties and efficiency need to be carefully protected over time, Sleever International has developed for Avène a multi-functional overwrap that: – Protects the formula and guarantee the inviolability; – Features an easy horizontal opening, preserving on the decoration – Decorates the bottle with a premium white matte aspect, reflecting the formula's purity. In the wake of its research efforts in sustainable development, which led to the launch of two eco-designed films: LWPET - a low-density film that reduces carbon footprint by 50% - and LDPET - which promotes recyclability of PET containers that it wraps. This expertise enabled Sleever International to participate in the launch of the first PET aerosol by Graham Packaging. Decorated by Sleever with Low a shrinkable LDPET film, AeroPET is fully recyaclable and benefits from enhanced performances in terms of: – Visibility and differenciation with a full-heigth 360° decoration on complex shapes, and up to 10 colors printing. – Eco-conception with a low-density film allowing carbon footprint reduction. – Recyclability thanks to LDPET properties. ""Thanks to our LDPET film, the products are compatible with recycling processes and the use of suitable inks makes it possible not to contaminate the sorting baths,"" highlights Sofiane Mameri, marketing and communication director at Sleever International."
Pochet wants luxury glass to go hand in hand with recycling,"The idea behind SEVA, the new glass concept developed by the Pochet Group is to use post-consumer perfume bottles to give birth to new perfume bottles. SEVA stands for Solution Ecoresponsable, Vision d'Avenir, French for Ecoresponsible Future Vision and Solution. To produce a very high quality glass meeting the specifications of their customers while including recycled glass in the manufacturing process, Pochet du Courval - the Pochet Group glass-making arm - has set up a recycling scheme entirely dedicated to perfume glass bottles. As the scheme only recycles white glass perfume bottles, Pochet can introduce 10% of external cullet [1] into its manufacturing process. This proportion adds up to the internal cullet that Pochet du Courval already reintroduces within its usual manufacturing process. ""Our aim with SEVA was to provide our customers with a solution to reduce the environmental footprint of the final product while maintaining the aesthetic appearance of our glass. This is why we have set up a closed-loop recycling scheme for high-end perfume bottle,"" said Pierre Dehé, CSR Direct at Pochet. ""This allows us to maintain a high-end quality of glass, while putting in place a virtuous cycle,"" he added. The first bottles using the SEVA concept were co-developed in partnership with L'Oréal, for Viktor and Rolf, one of the group's licensed perfume brands. Two bottles containing 10% of recycled glass exclusively derived from recycled high-end perfume bottles were produced for the Bonbon and Flowerbomb latest limited editions. This allowed Pochet du Courval to made a significant improvement in the environmental footprint of its glass while preserving the brilliance and transparency of the glass."
Coverpla now offers eco-friendly standard perfume bottles,"For Bruno Diépois, Coverpla's CEO, it is a conviction: ""the globalization and standardization of products have given rise to a reverse movement of regionalization coupled with a need for individualism."" For several years, Coverpla has been taking full advantage of this transformation by offering a range of standard and customizable packaging and components for perfumes and cosmetics. Today, the company has become an almost unavoidable supplier for niche and independent fragrance brands. Well placed to know how markets do evolve quickly, Bruno Diépois continues to look towards the future, taking into account ""new generations who see matters in a different light, and who are increasingly concerned about environmental issues."" To offer new opportunities to its customers, Coverpla is therefore committing to sustainability and recyclability. The Nice-headquartered company now offers the Ecoline range from Bormioli Luigi in its range of standard bottles. Ecoline implements in the field of perfumesthe principles Bormioli Luigi already applied to cosmetics with its Ecojars range: the Ecoline range allows a 40% reduction in weight compared with the 100g of glass used for a classic 100ml bottle, for example. This sustainable approach allows a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions across the supply chain (compared with plastic or blown or pressed glass). In addition to Bormioli Luigi's Ecoline standard bottles, Coverpla has partnered with the Italian glassmaker to develop two exclusive shapes of 50 and 100 ml bottles dubbed Verdi. Beyond their lightened glass weight, these bottles have a specific ""CV15"" neck making the bottles compatible with a standard screw pump solution (in this case Aptar's Precious pump). ""This specificity allows brands to perform their own filling operations and offer products that are refillable and 100% recyclable (due to the fact that each individual part can be separated for recycling),"" explains Coverpla. Coverpla has also designed a specific trim for the standard pump that can be matched with any of the caps in its catalogue."
Albéa Fast-Track Beauty offer gets bigger,"There are no less than 18 new make-up applicators - 16 fibre and plastic mascara brushes and two gloss applicators - now available within four weeks (after artwork validation or for re-orders for a selection of decoration and specifications) in quantities from 5,000 to 25,000 units. All the new applicators are manufactured in Albéa's Bottanuco factory, in Italy, the group's worldwide centre of excellence for mascaras, lipgloss and eyeliners applicators. ""The beauty market is going faster: new brands, more product launches, shorter development time, faster deliveries, ever-changing trends – speed is the new black,"" explains Albéa in a statement. Consisting of a selection of packaging, applicators and solutions and intended to speed up launches, Albéa's Fast-Track Beauty offer also includes a series of tubes produced by the group. There are currently 14 product references, ready-to-go tube packaging (small runs from 1,000 to 9,000 units), available to be delivered across Europe within a maximum delay of four weeks.

Made in Albéa's Tortona facility (Italy), all the tubes in the Fast-Track range are fully customizable from tube to cap through digital printing options. Launched in 2017, to address the growing demand for Full Service and time-to-market requirements, especially in the make-up segment, Albéa's first Fast Track Beauty collection was introduced at the 2017 edition of the MakeUp in Paris trade show. ""Fast Track Beauty is a unique selection of packaging and solutions from among our bestselling products and in line with the world's latest trends they are available here-and-now, with low minimum order quantities, short delivery time, customization options that our experts recommend,"" highlights the company."
Heinz-Glas invests in its future and comes back to China,"Premium Beauty News - Heinz-Group is much more than glass, it also plastics, with unique international footprint? Carl-August Heinz - Glass is and will always be our core business. As a reminder, we currently employ some 3,200 people, spread over five glass factories and twelve other locations around the world, including Germany, of course, but also Poland, Peru, India, Switzerland, USA and soon again China. Glass sales concerning this activity, including finishing activities, represent 280 million euros. As for our plastic activities, we have three dedicated factories employing some 250 people in Germany, Switzerland and Poland representing a total turnover of 30 million euros. Our Group as a whole is doing well. In the space of twenty years, our position as a glassmaker for high-end perfumery and cosmetics has continued to grow and we are now recognized as such by the biggest brands. In this business, you have to learn to be patient. And, you are right; we truly have an international footprint. We have manufacturing operations on practically every continent. Premium Beauty News - Your historic factory in Kleintettau, Upper Franconia, is now a state-of-the-art site! Carl-August Heinz - And this modernisation of our sites never stops! We spend a lot of money every year (over 12% of our turnover in average during the last 20 years!) for all our sites. In India, where the glass factory has been running since March 2017 with one furnace and three lines, we are going to invest in a fourth line. This market, certainly soon the largest market in the world for perfumes, is growing steadily. In Poland, we have invested no less than 38 million euros spread over eighteen months with, in particular, the construction of a new state-of-the-art 140 tonnes/day gas furnace, that can be ""boosted"" to 180 tonnes/day and does supply six production lines, including a new 12-section line dedicated to perfumery and cosmetics. Aside this relatively big furnace for white flint glass we also have a fully electric furnace with 2 lines for white opal - a speciality in this world! In Peru, we keep progressing in quality and efficiency to be even competitive in the Brazilian market. In our Kleintettau site in Germany, we will also build a new electric furnace that will be operational from June 2019 onward and whose operating principle is particularly energy efficient, after we have enlarged our second German glass factory in Piesau by an additional eight section IS-line in September 2017. Premium Beauty News - How does the takeover of the flaconnage activity of Saverglass fit with your current strategy? Carl-August Heinz - This activity started by Saverglass in 1997 and, dedicated to the production of perfume glass bottles, enabled Saverglass to strengthen its savoir-faire in high quality perfume bottles and developed a loyal customer base thanks to a very comprehensive range of standard models, particularly appreciated by niche perfume brands. This acquisition allows us today to broaden both our customer base and our portfolio of standard models, in line with our expertise developed in finishing techniques and plastic caps and closures adapted to glass bottles. The physical transfer of the production activity of Saverglass to Heinz-Glas has started end of December 2018. Premium Beauty News - You have decided to settle in the country again, after having left the country in 2015? Carl-August Heinz - Yes and we are back with high ambitions. Everyone is aware that this part of the world is becoming the leading consumer market for cosmetics and perfumes. We recently acquired a plot of 6 hectares and the new glass plant should be up and running by the end of this year. Premium Beauty News - Do all these investments also concern finishing lines? Carl-August Heinz - The trend is clearly for more finishing and packaging options with added value, especially for flankers, use by brands to revamp their lines, and for which decoration remains the main means of differentiation. Mastering finishing techniques is therefore essential and stands both as one of our main assets and our main development strategy. In all our glass factories and more particularly in Poland, Peru and India, the integration and mastery of decoration techniques is strategic. Premium Beauty News - And what about the ""plastic"" activity in all this? Carl-August Heinz - We are currently investing heavily (over EUR 20 million) in injection blow moulding in Switzerland where, as you know, we are already present. And we are working a lot on finding eco-friendly solutions in this area with 100% recyclable materials, for example for stoppers/ caps/ closures and have already developed some and successfully brought to market for which we also got remarkable awards (see international press). Premium Beauty News - Do the perfumery and cosmetics segments rebalance one another for the Heinz Group? Carl-August Heinz - Yes, and perfumery actually accounts for 75 percent of our activity, but cosmetics are gaining ground."
"""Logistics and environment are the main challenges for samples,"" Maxime d'Haussy","Premium Beauty News - The first sample in all categories, used to be the packet. Is this still the case? Maxime d'Haussy - The packet remains very popular! It can be found in many fields, from hygiene products to skin care and cosmetics, make-up and perfume. Although in the latter category, mini-sprays are really the most popular sample packaging with consumers. Coming back to cosmetics, we must not forget the mini-tubes and also the thermoformed samples. The former allows for a quick response because they are very standard packaging, the latter allows for development of replicas faithful to the sales models and offer many possibilities in make-up (foundation, lipstick, mascara, gloss). However, if we think in terms of volume, I think that it is the scented labels (scent seal) and their derivatives in cosmetics and make-up (beauty seal and scent seal) that represent the largest quantities of samples distributed. The main thing to remember is that there is a solution and an answer to each challenge presented by the brands and that samples remain one of the first triggers of the purchasing decision. Premium Beauty News - According to you, what is the value of this market? Maxime d'Haussy - It is very difficult to estimate this market. There are no statistics and we have a rather limited vision of emerging countries such as India or China. The sample market remains a niche market that I estimate at around US $1.5 billion. But considering that a sample costs only a few cents, you have a better idea of what this market represents in volume. The supplier market is dominated by a large international group, but there are many other suppliers who are excellent both in the quality of their products and in the services they provide to their customers. They should not be underestimated. The key to success is based on creativity, service and quality. Premium Beauty News - What will be the standard sample of tomorrow? Maxime d'Haussy - In recent years, we have seen attempts to develop connected samples (USB key delivering a fragrance, among others). These are prototypes because, although they are interesting, they have not yet really found their way. These new products come at a high cost and are an unreliable final product. But I'm quite convinced that the ""ideal"" connected sample will soon be on the market. The question remains when. On the other hand, it is a fact that purchasing behavior has evolved and is constantly evolving with new technologies, applications of all kinds and the hyper-connectivity of consumers. This induces a profound change not in the sample as an object but in the way, it is distributed. Consumers are demanding (and they are right to be) and expect brands to provide them with samples in an ever-shorter period of time and without necessarily having to go to the store. In short, the sample of tomorrow (and today, already) must above all meet a logistical challenge. But that is not the only challenge. The other major challenge remains the environment and the absolute need to work on concepts that will reduce the ecological footprint of packaging without compromising the quality of protective products and taking into account the logistical impact on the carbon footprint. A beautiful equation! Maxime d'Haussy Maxime d'Haussy began his career in the beauty packaging industry in 1992 at Seaquist Closures (Aptar Group). He immediately became passionate about this business sector. He discovered a very dynamic and creative universe, in constant search of innovation and quality. In 1995, he seized an opportunity and joined SOFAB (now part of the Albéa Group). This company, originally created by the BIC Group for the launch of the ""bare perfume"", has successfully converted its manufacturing base to become the inventor and world leader in mini-perfume sprayers known as Sophistic's and Sofilux. He took his first steps in the field of samples. Exactly seven years later, Socoplan (now part of the Arcade Beauty group) offered him the opportunity to work as Sales and Marketing Director in a company exclusively dedicated to samples and mini-products. That was all it took to convince him to expand his knowledge in the fields of sachets and thermoformed packaging (blisters). In 2007, the group acquired Biopack, the European leader in perfume sampling, and took over its general management in January 2008. After having learned much in the field of care, hygiene and make-up products, he enriched his knowledge in the field of alcoholic products while encountering his first experience as a general manager with what this entails in terms of responsibilities and requirements. In 2013, seeking new horizons, he left for Brazil to take over the direction of Arcade Beauty Mappel."
Albéa to showcase new connected compact at the PCD Paris tradeshow,"Developed in collective intelligence with CMSmartconnect - a start-up in consumer purchasing experience and marketing data collection / analysis; the ""IOB Kickstarter"" offer is available for beauty brands that want to instantly interact with their consumers through packaging linked to their digital adapted content.

In addition, the Internet of Beauty was built in partnership with key players of the beauty industry as it opens news opportunities for brands to better interact with consumers. ""Being the first physical touchpoint between a product and a consumer, the packaging is a key element of the retail experience"" explains Noé Gailly, Marketing Director. ""Beauty consumers today are ultra-connected and want to do more with the pack: discover stories behind the product, share content on their social media networks or even buy the product by scanning it on an app,"" adds Noé Gailly. The Internet of Beauty does that and more: consumers will access new range of services, including quick and easy access to information. Brands will be able to better understand their consumers and address their needs with greater precision. This revolution stands as a new business opportunity for Beauty Industry professionals."
Lush Cosmetics goes packaging-free with new skincare line,"A few months after the successful launch of the world's first foundation with no plastic packaging, Lush Cosmetics is launching a new line of entirely packaging-free vegan skincare. The skincare line, which rolled out last month in the UK and Ireland, was launched in continental Europe and online on January 18, along with a brand new global campaign. The collection spans everything from facial oils to eye masks — all of which are completely free from animal derivatives and plastic. Highlights include a solid 'Amazon Primer' facial oil, which contains softening cupuaçu butter to moisturize and arrowroot powder to keep the skin matte and smooth, acting as a pre-makeup primer. There is also a solid bar version of a traditional cold cream, in the form of 'Like A Virgin,' which includes organic extra virgin olive oil, organic jojoba oil and sunflower and candelilla waxes for a hydrating cleanse, and a 'Mortal Kombu' eye mask designed to be soaked in warm water before releasing the benefits of kombu seaweed, antioxidant green tea and soothing witch hazel. In addition to this launch, Lush also opened the doors of its newest Naked shop in Manchester, UK, on January 18. The store only stocks packaging-free products, even eschewing labels and allowing shoppers to scan their purchases via an app. The specialist store is the brand's third of the kind, following openings last year in Berlin and Milan. ""In Lush we work in an industry where the packaging costs the customer more than the product,"" said Mark Constantine, Lush Co-founder and Managing Director. ""Now, the customer needs to worry about how to recycle something they didn't want to buy in the first place. This seems like a raw deal to us. If we can cut out all the plastic packaging, we can give our customers better value for money."" In a context of increasing consumer awareness on environmental issues, and while Zero Waste will be the big trend of the year, according to Mintel, this move could have a strong resonance among consumers."
Metapack opens new showroom in New York City,"The French specialist of luxury package design keeps developing on new markets. Already present in the United States since 2013 with a sales agent, they now aim to go farther and have just opened a display space for their products. ""We have recruited Stéphanie Bon as an Account Manager. She will directly report to François Damide, Director of the NYC-based Crafting Beauty company, which creates turnkey perfumes and also hosts the new showroom. The partnership was pretty timely,"" explains Isaure de La Noue, Sales Manager and Associate of Metapack. Just like in its Parisian equivalent, the room will showcase the company's flagship products and standard ranges of solid perfume cases, sprays, and caps, whose demand keeps rising. ""We aim to reach luxury brands, of course, given our positioning, but also niche brands, with which we already work a lot in Europe, and makeup and home fragrance brands,"" adds Isaure de La Noue. As they intend to strengthen their presence in the US, Metapack will take part in the Luxe Pack New York show with the support of the Paris sales team. At the anniversary ceremony, last December, Metapack's President Annette Der Minassian also announced the possibility to offer customers to connect their packaging, as soon as 2019. The company has just launched a partnership with Phone Me, the specialist of NFC connected labels."
ADF&PCD Paris: Made in France and ecodesign on the agenda,"This year, ADF&PCD will be held in Hall 7.2 of Porte de Versailles-Parc des Expositions: a larger area than usual to host about 600 exhibitors – over a hundred more than in 2018, for approximately 1,000 more visitors than last year. ""We have been working on inviting more and more global beauty brands,"" emphasizes Christelle Anya, Director of the Parisian show. New exhibitors will include the Imprim'Luxe association and its labelled companies, representing the graphic arts and printing trades. ""ADF&PCD Parisis extremely popular among exhibitors and brands. Figures speak for themselves,"" adds Christelle Anya. The 2019 renewal is embodied by a new feature intended to help visitors in search of Made in France products and/or ecoresponsible solutions, who will attend guided visits to the relevant exhibitors. About ten exhibitors identified and selected beforehand will welcome a group of visitors who have registered to these one-hour sessions organized twice a day. They will be guided by two packaging experts as part of the Made in France Tour and the Eco Tour. The issue of sustainable development will also be at the core of the conference agenda, in particular with a Chanel-hosted session focused on the sustainable perfume challenge and on wellness, and a debate on ""plastic repulsion"". The conference will be chaired by Estée Lauder's Senior VP Packaging Innovation, Hervé Bouix, who will showcase the solutions implemented by Unilever. ""We constantly make changes to our offering, and we invite brands to come share their own challenges and solutions,"" explains the show's Director. Indie Brands, innovation, retail… a broad spectrum of subjects will be on the agenda of the two round tables. Apart from the three ADF&PCD events – Paris, New York City, and Shanghai – the organizer, Easyfairs, has just created the ICON Club. This club gathers about 100 members representing various global brands from all sectors and industries and encourages them to gather twice a year in order to exchange about packaging news, challenges, and trends. It was officially launched last September at the 3rd NYC annual ADF&PCD show. The French version will be launched next January at ADF&PCD Paris, which will welcome its first members. This initiative will enrich the three portfolio events. ""As for ADF&PCD New York and Shanghai, which will respectively be held for the fourth and second time (next March for Shanghai), we are trying not to reproduce exactly the same model as in Paris: we would rather adapt to American and Asian markets, by offering other, very disruptive features,"" concludes the organizer.

Innovation fosters iD Scent business development,"Most of iD Scent's latest olfactory achievements are based on their Scentest® technology. Born of 10 years of R&D, the technology incorporates perfume into paper fibres by air compression, thus providing an accurate, stable, homogeneous reproduction of the fragrance over several months, even years. The perfume may be partially or totally applied on the material, on one or two sides, so it does not come in contact with the decoration. This detail creates multiple finishing options, like hot stamping, without any disturbance. The perfume does not harm the prints, and vice versa. Over the last few months, with this leading technology, iD Scent has participated in major communication campaigns, including Prada Infusion d'Iris, Narciso Eau de Parfum Rouge by Narciso Rodriguez, Pure XS Pour Homme by Paco Rabanne in addition to Girls Can Do Anything, the new women's fragrance by Zadig & Voltaire. Beyond sampling, this technology has been adapted to other substrates, such as fabric and rubber, thus making possible to extend the field of scented applications to new objects: scented sheets, dressing samples, press kits , gifts, etc. In October at Luxe Pack Monaco and in November at the Fragrance Innovation Summit in Paris, iD Scent gave a preview of an entirely new way of discovering scents in sales outlets: Scentcloud® a customizable diffuser. Perfume diffusion - the core business of iD Scent - thus becomes visible thanks to a ''perfume cloud '' effect. At points of sale, the diffuser is incorporated into a stele or POS kit. Diffusion takes place through a venturi spray system that provides an extremely faithful rendering of the scent. Unlike other techniques, Scentcloud® creates scented clouds through a cold nebulization process technology, using no other substance than the perfume. ""This technology does not distort the perfume and allows thousands of tests, in a very economical way, preserving the full integrity of fragrance notes,"" said Maxime Caffon, Associate Director at iD Scent."
Environment and plastic packaging: Albéa takes up the challenge!,"Premium Beauty News - Could you explain the concept of plastic circular economy for novices? Gilles Swyngedauw - The circular economy involves stopping to design, produce, and consume in a linear way, based on the I-take-I-use-I-throw-away model. It requires reusing and recycling as much as possible. As regards industrial sites, we need to reduce our energy consumption, stop putting waste into landfill, and instead, recycle it as much as we can. Now, generally speaking, as far as packaging is concerned, the idea is to keep relying on eco-design and life cycle assessments to reduce our environmental impact. Today, we must go even further, by devising reusable and recyclable packaging and integrating recycled materials. Plastic has been used in beauty packaging for decades: it is fantastic in many ways. Cosmetic plastic packaging can be produced in any shape, and it is lighter, cheaper, more efficient, more protective, and more easy-to-use than ever. There is constant progress in this field. Beauty packaging results in wonderful, functional, high-performing, high-quality products that preserve formulas on our bathroom shelves and can be carried with us in our handbags or on holidays. Today, our challenge is to make it sustainable and develop an efficient circular economy in the hygiene-beauty sector. It involves rethinking the value chain, taking into account our whole ecosystem, in order to enhance waste collection, sorting, and end-of-life recycling. Premium Beauty News - That is a huge challenge, especially since consumers increasingly feel concerned about these issues! Gilles Swyngedauw - Indeed, it is a very important challenge, and there is no time to lose. Transparency and responsibility have become conditions for consumers to make a purchase. CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) is no longer just a nice extra. Beyond the obvious advantages for society, is it profitable for companies to give priority to sustainable development: 90% of the people surveyed would be ready to change brands to favour those associated with a social or environmental cause. As a result, emphasizing the positive impact increases loyalty and trust, both on the part of consumers and employees. Four years ago, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation started gathering companies and governments around a positive vision: a plastic circular economy. Today, the Foundation and the United Nations Environment Programme join to speed up these dynamics, by launching the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment. Albéa has signed it and is fully committed, of course! Premium Beauty News - Where to begin? Gilles Swyngedauw - Everyone knows that, since 2002, Albéa has placed sustainable development at the core of the company's strategy: thanks to our expertise in eco-design and life cycle assessment, we have invented packaging with a lower environmental footprint, reduced the quantity of plastic used, developed recyclable packaging, and used recycled (PCR) and biosourced plastics. Today, we also want to proactively contribute to developing a high-performing circular economy in the hygiene-beauty sector. Obviously, for packaging to be recycled, it needs to be collected and sorted. And it is not that easy, because it is often made of ""small"" objects. So, we also use refillable solutions. As for plastic materials, we will obviously have to replace those that cannot be recycled in close collaboration with manufacturers. Premium Beauty News - Can you give us a few concrete examples? Gilles Swyngedauw - There are many. For example, you can hardly find anything lighter than our Slim Cap + Thin-Wall tube. Designed to be flat and compact with sharp lines, Slim (which is made of PP – polypropylene) is one of the lightest caps on the market. The total tube weight was reduced by 33%, compared to a standard cap and apron. It represents the equivalent of 8.8 tonnes of plastic saved for the production of one million Slim Cap + Thin Wall units, i.e. an emission reduction of 36 tonnes of CO2: that is 36 Paris/NYC round trips for one person. These tubes are perfectly recyclable by the existing PE/PP industry and contribute to the circular economy through the integration of PCR: Post-Consumer Recycled – plastic that has already had a first life. As a reminder, the PCR plastic used in our tubes is based on drink or milk bottle packs used and upgraded by households through the recycling industry. Every year, Albéa produces about 33 million PCR tubes that are fully recyclable by the existing plastic collection industry. For example, our foam pumps also contain PCR now, thanks to the development of a solution comprising 100% PCR plastic in the cap, neck, and pushbutton. Since 2010, we have also offered tubes and bottles made of biosourced plastic. These plastics are based on sugar cane from Brazil, which absorbs a high quantity of CO2 as it grows. As a result, producing one kilogram of biosourced PE absorbs a total of 3.09 kg of CO2. The carbon footprint related to the manufacturing of biosourced plastics is 76% lower than that of a standard plastic tube. Here is another example in the field of perfume: Spiral, our refillable pump, can be unscrewed to make the bottle both refillable and recyclable. Its carbon footprint is reduced by 21%, compared to standard metal screw-pumps. Lastly, My Style Bag is designed in one piece made from a single material (PP), which makes it considerably easier to recycle. These palettes use about 30% less plastic than conventional palettes and feature a more convenient opening/closing system, thanks to a flexible hinge. My Style Bag can accommodate pressed and poured formulas, as well as makeup accessories. The arrangement of its containers is fully customizable. We will soon have many other examples to give: our R&D services are on a war footing and new materials are about to appear. And of course, beyond mere products, we implement new partnerships with the recycling industry, both in Europe and Indonesia, where there can be a lack of collection facilities. Premium Beauty News - Figures just show we could not go on like this! Gilles Swyngedauw - Absolutely, and as I showed you, the Albéa Group has been aware of it for a long time. We have been acting for environmental preservation in many concrete ways. Plastic consumption is booming all around the world as demographics, urbanization, and access to consumer goods grow – and packaging is obviously part of it. We cannot but take action. Premium Beauty News - What is the next step for Albéa? Gilles Swyngedauw - We have just conducted a materiality study of our teams and external stakeholders, customers, suppliers, investors, and partners. The objective is to identify ""material"" environmental and societal issues that everyone considers a priority for the years to come. This assessment will help us update our CSR roadmap. We will structure programmes, define objectives, measure progress… and openly communicate about them with an extra-financial report focused on CSR. To me, the change in consumers, companies, and governments as regards the circular economy goes with a fundamental change in our approach: it is crucial to work together, rethink the whole value chain, act out of our own scope of activity, share information and ambitions, but also constraints, think together, and co-imagine solutions. The materiality study and the CSR report illustrate this new reality. It is a huge challenge, and we are all concerned by these issues, as employees, citizens, and parents. I strongly believe we will succeed if we work together."
Advent calendars: A profitable pre-Christmas operation,"Demand is rising. An increasing number of beauty players, brands or distributors, have been dabbling in this new practice, which consists in offering a playful, discovery-based product at different prices. ""We started four years ago, and today, we conduct about ten projects per year. The smallest is Mademoiselle Bio's, with 800 units, and it goes up to 160,000 for a leader in selective distribution,"" says François Malissin, Sales Manager of MPack. The company, specialized in global packaging solutions, provides a great number of cosmetics brands (Décléor, Birchbox, Kérastase…) with a specific, full-service solution from design to co-packing (filling). There are two main reasons for brands taking such interest in Advent calendars. On the one hand, they help deseasonalize the end-of-year period. They are marketed in October, so, for consumers, they represent ""a Christmas purchase before Christmas comes"". On the other, they are composed of 24 mini-products or samples, so they are an exceptional targeted testing operation. ""It is often more about a testing marketing mix than a commercial operation"", asserts François Malissin. As a result, service providers are compelled to adapt to a heavy cost constraint. ""The main issue is that we need to be creative, while offering a logical production cost, based on the products put in the calendars,"" says Guillaume Haillot, President of Shopluxe, a subsidiary of the Cosfibel group, also a supplier of creative solutions in luxury packaging. The company has developed Advent calendars for several years in the field of delicatessen, in particular the chocolate industry. ""Chocolate makers' creativity made us invent very original things for cosmetics,"" he adds. The selling price of a calendar ranges from about 30 euros to more than 300 euros in the luxury world. ""Our customers are willing to invest in a comprehensive service, i.e. a ready-to-sell product about 10% its selling price. This determines the product complexity,"" emphasizes François Malissin. And to best guide their customers based on the design and price, MPack launched a catalogue of about 30 estimated products two years ago. Advent calendars impose very specific manufacturing techniques, in particular as regards product bracing with spacers, window opening, and filling. ""We work on the design, on securing the products, and on the total calendar weight"", explains Guillaume Haillot. The standard calendar usually comprises two articulated sides containing the 24 boxes. It can also be presented as a box with 24 dated cases. The filling phase with the products supplied by the customers is usually performed by a packer selected by the brand. The MPack offering does cover this co-packing phase, though. ""Our strategy consists in providing our customers with an offer that completes our services, like co-packing or the traceability of the products inserted,"" details François Malissin. The assembly phase involves filling the thermoformed spacers, and then inserting them in cases, which are closed with double-sided tape. ""Everything needs to be well-paced and organized to be interesting from an economic standpoint, both for brands and for us,"" adds the Director. MPack can also carry out this operation at a Poland-based partner's for very high quantities, openly, with their customers. Better-adapted to skincare and makeup than perfume, for which the assortment of mini-products represents a drag on the budget, Advent calendars have found their own place in the beauty world. And according to suppliers, the series ordered are sold out every year!"
"""Qualipac's expertise is recognized, we now want to make a difference in terms of agility and CSR,"" Thierry Rabu","Premium Beauty News - What has been the experience in leading Qualipac for almost one year? Thierry Rabu - I found at Qualipac very strong and recognized human skills, with a high level of technicality and inventiveness, in particular in fields such as electroplating and aluminium forming, in our French sites of Aurillac and Saint-Saturnin-du-Limet. Qualipac can rely on solid industrial bases in Europe, Asia and South America. We have a strong presence in France, which is not so common in plastics but goes well in the direction of current customer demand. From these solid bases, it was necessary to define the major strategic lines to make the difference. That's what we have been working at for almost a year. Our first focus has been to build on the investments already scheduled. The second consisted in completing this initial industrial plan; and the third to revamp our supply chain to make a real competitive advantage from it. Premium Beauty News - The industrial development plan initiated within the group was your starting point? Thierry Rabu - Many investments had already been planned, including where CSR was concerned. Today, our brand-new electroplating line in our Aurillac facility allows us to increase our production capacity in an environmentally responsible manner. At our facility in Saint Saturnin, we have redesigned the entire water treatment system and invested in new machines to increase our industrial efficiency. Our competence in the work of aluminium, an interesting recyclable material to produce eco-designed packaging, is increasingly recognized. We are making similar investments in all our production sites around the world. In China, we have invested in new metallization lines with VOC treatment systems. In Brazil, we completed the move to our new factory which is now fully operational. We now produce in this country a complete packaging offer, especially for makeup products, and we have a true centre of expertise in lipstick with production capabilities that also allow us to serve other markets. Premium Beauty News - Which points have been consolidated? Thierry Rabu - We completed the industrial plan in order to achieve a better standardization of our whole machinery and equipment, thus facilitating the transfer of lines from one site to another for more agility. We are also moving towards a modular assembly approach allowing more flexibility, a better time-to-market and requiring lower investments from our customers. Ultimately, we are aiming for a very modular industry 4.0 deployment that integrates artificial intelligence tools. In the same vein, we have also deployed new project management tools for a much more complete control of the risks and a better follow-up of the industrialization lead times. Premium Beauty News - What about the supply chain? Thierry Rabu - Our aim is to introduce a collaborative approach between our various factories so that our supply chain becomes a key competitive advantage of the group's multi-material offer. We strengthened the supply chain team and implemented various tools, in particular for planning, to better monitor our lead-time and increase predictability. In a context of increasing market volatility, the reduction of delays and their predictability become a real competitive advantage. This is a key element of the Pochet Group's multi-material strategy. Premium Beauty News - What about innovation? Thierry Rabu - We are creating a ""Fab Lab"" (Manufacturing and Innovation Laboratory) in Chartres, another of our French plants, to be more reactive in the pre-project phase, thanks to accelerated prototyping, and accelerated material testing and functional tests. We are also interested in 3D printing. We are using this technology to create parts that cannot be made using traditional injection processes. We are still working to improve the decorability of the pieces and also want 3D printing to be more CSR-oriented. This technology has a quite different environmental impact than injection. Eco-design is also an important field of innovation for our customers. At the Luxe Pack Monaco trade show, we won the Luxe Pack in green award for the eco-design makeup case L'Essentiel. We already master second generation bio-sourced solutions and we are working on the third generation. We are also working a lot on the recyclability of the different plastics, on the possibility to separate the various components, and on the chemistry of plastics that are complicated to recycle. Eventually, at the beginning of 2019, we will be able to offer a carbon footprint with each quotation request, as Pochet du Courval already does for the bottle division. More generally, the group's multi-material expertise makes it possible to propose alternative solutions. Premium Beauty News - In short, it can be said it was a particularly active year? Thierry Rabu - Very active and mainly devoted to listening to the needs of our customers in order to make them benefit from the maximum adaptability to address increasingly volatile and unpredictable markets. With one goal: to make Qualipac their preferred supplier."
Weltrade invests to address growing Aussie demand for environmentally friendly and high quality packaging,"Premium Beauty News - What do you love about packaging? Steve Welsh - I get asked what is it that I love about packaging a lot! There are many reasons however, the part I love most is when I see our clients succeed and have their products on retailer's shelves or winning awards for their category. I understand the time, effort, and creative work we both put into each packaging project and it is great to feel a part of their journey. Premium Beauty News - What are the main brands you work with? Steve Welsh - We work with hundreds of brands including Aspen Australia, Kora Organics by Miranda Kerr, DeLorenzo and Schwarzkopf. Premium Beauty News - What are the main trends of the market, the main requests you receive from Australian brands? Steve Welsh - We receive many requests from clients for our post-consumer recycled and bioplastic packaging, as well as requests for unique packaging, custom colours, printing and moulds. Environmentally friendly products and packaging is a huge trend. As consumers become more educated with social media of the pros/cons of various products and their packaging, we are seeing many brands looking to us for help with improving their packaging message. They are especially looking at our newly released Post-Consumer Resin tubes, which can have up to 45% of their weight made from recycled plastic. We are always on the lookout for new ways of doing things that are more efficient and environmentally friendly. Premium Beauty News - Are there any other exciting projects in the future? Steve Welsh - Weltrade Packaging is undergoing a new expansion to increase the proportion of onshore manufacture, especially PET jars and bottles, in our Queensland facility. We are passionate to continue investing in our equipment and our team to provide the best packaging solutions for our clients.

We will continue to work with the government to expand our product range and specialty lines."
VPF launches environment-friendly self-adhesive label made of grass paper,"According to the Germany-based labelstock supplier whole raft of environmental benefits can be expected from the new adhesive-coated eco-friendly addition to its product portfolio. ""Protecting the environment and conserving resources are key considerations for VPF when developing new self-adhesive materials. So, it is especially gratifying to find innovative new paper grades that are produced using a readily available renewable like grass,"" explains the company in a release. These brand-new papers contain 50% of sundried fresh fibres. This provides a major advantage by slashing the required energy and water input during production. According to the paper manufacturer, less than one litre of water is needed per ton of grass fibre pulp, compared with 6000 litres of water per ton when producing conventional wood cellulose. This automatically results in significant energy savings and an associated reduction in CO2 emissions. The level of chemical additives is also reduced. Available in a grammage of 95 g/m2, the grass paper is recyclable, compostable and certified as an FSC-Mix. It has been approved for direct food contact. It can also be easily printed using conventional printing methods. VPF is providing labels made of grass paper with two different adhesives coatings as standard. For permanent-label applications the acrylic emulsion adhesive 958 is used. According to the company, this grade is ideal for small diameters and a large variety of substrates. The multi-purpose adhesive has been approved for direct food contact. For removable labels, VPF employs the 987 adhesive. Removable without a trace from many different kinds of substrate, this adhesive too is based on acrylic emulsion. Both adhesives were selected after extensive migration and ageing tests conducted in VPF's laboratories at its home plant in Sprockhövel, Germany."
Silgan Dispensing launches new pump for sun-care market,"At the latest Luxe Pack show, held in Monaco last October, Silgan Dispensing unveiled Mark VII Max Style, a new pump designed to alleviate the frustrations consumers experience when applying sun-care products. Silgan Dispensing has identified that the difficulty associated with applying sunscreen as thoroughly and frequently as recommended is a common frustration among consumers. ""Research from a study in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology shows that of those surveyed, only 33 percent of people applied sunscreen to all of their exposed skin. The rest only focused on their faces and arms, leaving plenty of other areas unprotected. Reasons for the misapplication and misuse of sunscreen by the participants of the study ranged from the greasiness of the feel of applying a cream formula to taking too much time to apply. The same participants also noted that they were more likely to use a sunscreen with a spray application,"" explained the company. Silgan's new dispensing system features the same actuator than the Mark VII Max pump and combines it with several new design enhancements that increase the ease of use. The actuator, which already featured a low force to actuate, now has a larger finger landing area to accommodate a wider range of finger sizes and enables different approach angles for the index finger so that the package can be held in many different orientations. Silgan also added two ribs on the actuator to increase friction of the skin for better grip. The ribs also provide a visual and tactile clue as to how to correctly position the fingertip. The Mark VII Max Style pump also provides a variety of different spray patterns and spray angles thanks to its 21 different orifice cups, assuring full body coverage. ""As consumers of sun care products ourselves, we know firsthand the frustrating experience typically associated with applying sunscreen,"" said Eva Martin, Product Line Manager at Silgan Dispensing. ""The design of Mark VII Max Style meets these frustrations head on, tying directly back to our core mission of delivering a better experience to our customers and the end consumer. MKVII Max Style's new and unique design increases the ease of use and helps consumers improve their sun care experience by delivering a mess-free, fast and easy application that provides full coverage."""
"Augros, targeting 25 million euros in 2021","Premium Beauty News - One hundred years old and in top form! Didier Bourgine - Like many historical companies, we have gone through all situations! Ups and then downs and today we can be proud of having resisted all the economic crises and to now run a successful company that will achieve 18 million in sales this year, with 31 injection machines (from 80 to 400 t.), 40 robots, 5 lacquering lines, 3 vacuum metalizing chambers, 170 employees, nearly 140 million units produced in 2018. So indeed, considering our age, We are in good shape! Premium Beauty News - Tell us more about your Company... Didier Bourgine - Almost six decades ago, Jacques Augros pioneered the luxury perfume industry to cap perfume bottles with what was regarded at the time as a major innovation: the ""Plast-Emeri"" system developed with Pochet, followed by the ""Opercule"" system, which was adopted by leading perfume brands. In 1980, my father, Jacques Bourgine acquired Augros. I joined him in 1991. We decided to work on three strategic areas which are still the backbone of our industrial strategy: – The globalization of skills to have a mastery of all the key manufacturing steps, made possible with the acquisition in 1998 of MSV, the vacuum metalizing and lacquering unit. – Innovation as a spearhead to offer unique solutions that adapt to market developments, such as Comp'Steel, a standardized automated weighing solution, or Ready To Pack, a standardized development process to reduce by 30% development times and speed up time to market, and finally, the integration of spray caps that simplify the beauty gesture. – Automation, a pillar of continuous improvement, cost control and total quality. Premium Beauty News - Is automation the ideal solution? Didier Bourgine - In our trade, there are no other! And it is essential to generate financial resources that can then be reinvested. All our presses are now automated with triple-axis robots, and we now have a total of 9 six-axis robots on our assembly and secondary process lines. Premium Beauty News - You have also changed you business model? Didier Bourgine - We abandoned the mass market, to specialize in high-end and custom products. Our clients are leading European brands. We are very fortunate to have in Europe, within a very accessible radius, what is best in the world in terms of perfume and cosmetic brands. As for the lacquering and metallization unit, we only use 15% of its capacity. The remaining production is performed as a row 2 activity, but most of the time it is dedicated to customer orders. We accept orders ranging from 10,000 to one million pieces. Speed, flexibility..., and reactivity are our watchwords! Premium Beauty News - And what about your equipment? Didier Bourgine - We subcontract them but under our full control! All our moulds are designed and developed in-house. Our department almost works in 3 eight hour-shifts. This allows us to reduce development times and to also achieve substantial savings by standardizing their designs. Premium Beauty News - Perfumery, skincare and make-up…, what are your latest achievements in these areas? Didier Bourgine - Today 90% of the packs we develop include surface treatment. Our latest spray cap for INCC Parfums, Mercedes-Benz, The Move, is metal blue with a specific automated button actuator assembly. In the make-up segment, we designed the decoration of Dior's Ultra Rouge, with a particularly demanding and complex lacquering of the Tesem aluminium case."
Samples and single-use products: Cofatech celebrates 25th anniversary and invests in innovation,"""The sampling market has evolved a lot over the past few years,"" explains CEO Dominique Lourel. ""But today, our deliberately high-end positioning and our closeness to our customers' needs are a real asset."" The company boasts a customer portfolio with both major and niche brands. But the two main strengths of this SME from Western France are innovation and flexibility. ""It has clearly become second nature to us,"" adds Dominique Lourel. ""Innovation is an integral part of our market vision."" The company is actually set to showcase a brand new concept in early 2019. Cofatech's main markets include skincare, hair care and, since 2008, alcohol products, in particular perfumes showcased in vials for which a new workshop was set up. ""It was a significant change,"" explains Dominique Lourel. ""This activity represents 50% of our business today."" And then, there are bags. This market requires great reactivity and a constant presence to quickly meet demand. The wide variety and high availability of 0.4 ml to 50 ml bag ranges is one of the company's most precious assets."
Luxe Pack Monaco: How perfumery packaging is renewing itself,"The question of the durability of packaging, and particularly the plastic issue, was present on many stands. The concept of plastic repulsion is a rising trend that requires manufacturers to innovate in order to use less of it, facilitate recycling, or propose alternative solutions with recycled or bio-sourced plastic. Albéa presented in its green corner its range of easily recyclable mono-material products, such as the EZ'R, a 100% recyclable plastic foam pump. While at its stand, RPC Bramlage presented its Ecosolution range, a fully recyclable set with a plastic pump. For perfumes, research is focused on the separability of materials, and particularly of the pump vs. the bottle, either for recycling optimization or as a refilling option. Along the same line, Albéa presented its latest innovation in the area of perfume pumps: the screw pump Spiral. This screw pomp makes the bottle both refillable and recyclable. Its carbon footprint is thus reduced by 21% compared to standard metal screw pumps. Spiral is available in 100 ml and 10 ml size, a travel format that meets the strong demand for small formats in perfumery. The Aptar Group also presented a screw-off version of its La Petite et Precious pumps in a 100ml format and the Metapack company, standard bag sprays, concrete case bases and lipstick tubes in a refillable version, and new this year, a perfume in a refillable roll-on tube to wear as a pendant. The glass maker Verescence chose to give pride of place to this notion of ecodesign, with a focus on two of its bestsellers in the field: the recycled glass NEO Infinite, which was chosen for Bulgari's new Man Wood Essence, and its range of lightweight glass. To illustrate how luxury and sustainable development could go in hand, the glass maker went one step further by proposing Upcycled, a concept of recycled and lightened glass bottle, decorated with recycled materials, topped with a glass stopper and connected via Visual Recognition Technology to allow traceability access, and which contains a juice made by Givaudan based on apple waste. To meet the growing trend for ""glassification"" including bottle covers, Verescence presented Bowie, a glass cabochon. Arcade Beauty focused on the eco-design trend with its new aluminium-free sachet. A more sustainable alternative, which reduces the carbon footprint by 22%. In the paper sector, Metsä Board, put forward the ingenuity of the designer Liro Numminen, who created a eco-friendly alternative to the bubble wrap used in e-commerce boxes. Entirely made of paperboard, this functional innovation will enable any form of product to be safely packed. With the NFC technology or visual recognition, each packaging can be connected either for securing purposes or to create a link between the brand and the consumer. With its Internet Of Beauty offer, Albéa took up the challenge of integrating the NFC technology into several of its primary packagings, a mascara, a lipstick and a powder compact were showcased, and the Company also guaranteed it could be added to any other type of packaging including in perfumery. Integrated to paper or textile materials respectively by Arjowiggins and Seram, the NFC technology was seen on many stands as a support to a large number of solutions. Aptar now proposes its offer around the dispensing La Petite, Note and Color Code as a full service offer. The offer includes a glass bottle, its decoration, the secondary packaging and the conditioning. Aptar thus intends to act as a one stop supplier for brands seeking to optimize time to market. Silgan offers customizable extensions for spray actuators. With always a focus on time to market, the manufacturer created moulds to reduce both design costs and manufacturing time. With the same objective, the company has succeeded in automating the feeding of its high-speed laser marking machines, thus making this personalization technology more accessible and therefore available for small series or sampling. For its part, Seram unveiled an in-store concept of ultra-personalization with the implementation of a store display making it possible to print or engrave on different materials, textile or leather patches. The consumer can then place the item on its bottle to make it unique. In terms of customer experience at the point of sale, IDScent has unveiled its innovation, ScentCloud, a diffuser integrated into a base or a customizable display at the point of sale, which delivers thanks to a nebulising system ""a perfume mist"", thus transcribing very faithfully all the perfume's notes."
All4Pack to offer a prospective vision of packaging,"Organized every other year, the Paris All4Pack show gathers the global packaging industry in major business areas, including Beauty. It covers all trades in this sector and offers visitors an opportunity to discover solutions in multiple disciplines. ""Our decision to organize the show on a more transversal basis, taking into account the whole packaging chain, actually proved much relevant. It provides an answer to a prevailing trend for exhibitors, who increasingly develop their businesses upstream or downstream their initial offering. On the other hand, it meets visitors' needs,"" explains Véronique Sestrières, the show's Director. The 2018 event is designed as a reflection of the sector through various highlights. Adapting to the sector's changes To put the event in relation to the most recent developments in the packaging sector and best convey user expectations through its content, for several years, All4Pack has gathered a committee of twelve experts, all professionals from major global groups in different business areas, including Beauty, with Philippe Bonningue, Global Director of Sustainable Packaging & Development of L'Oréal, and Guillaume Lebert, R&D Director of Sustainable Development Europe of P&G. This year, All4Pack will reinforce the matchmaking activity launched in 2016 to refine a proposal adapted to prime manufacturer expectations. Visitors will submit their requests on a dedicated platform, and then exhibitors will answer based on their expertise. ""The business meetings we organized last year got 80% positive feedback, so we decided to go farther,"" explains the Director. This year, in the same vein, the Top Buyers Club will offer VIP service and treatment for broad projects identified beforehand. In addition, among the 1,300 exhibitors, visitors will discover about 15 start-ups in a new dedicated area: Startups Lab. ""We wished to put transversal solutions and services into a new, laid-back perspective,"" adds Véronique Sestrières. The new Creative Lounge area has the ""best of the best"" in store, with a selection of original new launches spotted by Creapills, the medium of creative ideas and marketing innovation and partner of the event, but also a dozen of innovations showcased by the exhibitors, a selection of products illustrated by SIAL Innovation in the food industry, as well as the winners of different international packaging competitions. The ""Pack the Future - The Sustainable Plastic Packaging Award"" will be presented as plastic packaging is largely being questioned in all areas. This competition highlights the sector's manufacturers for their innovative and sustainable packaging solutions. The Expert Committee will also attribute the Innovation Awards to the show's most innovative solutions. Lastly, environmental issues are among the major themes of the All4Pack Live conference agenda, which will also cover broader subjects in packaging and intralogistics (recycling, additive manufacturing, cybersecurity, serialization…) Ultimately, as a means to exemplify the sector, All4Pack will provide a prospective vision of packaging with the results of a study entitled ""Packaging ready for its revolution"". Conducted in partnership with EPDA, the European Brand & Packaging Association, the study of 23 global designers and 8,000 European consumers was focused on several major challenges that will drive packaging into reinventing itself. These challenges include population ageing: 42% of European consumers think the packaging legibility is not adequate, and 47% believe improvements in the opening and sealing of packaging is an issue to be taken into account. Another challenge lies in natural resource depletion, about which most respondents are in favour of a ban on non-recyclable packaging (40%) and overpackaging (47%), and on the implementation of financial rewards for returning used packaging. Thirdly, 34% of the people surveyed view the development of artificial intelligence as a source of economic advantages, in particular that of limiting waste by warning consumers about expiry dates. These clear expectations emphasize the importance of the perfect functionality of packaging and its ability to cleanly disappear after use. ""Within this context of expected changes, All4Pack is an excellent indicator of today's and tomorrow's expectations and solutions,"" concludes Véronique Sestrières."
Metapack celebrates 20th anniversary with new global projects,"Premium Beauty News - It took only 20 years for Metapack to become a key player in luxury packaging. How did you find your own place? Annette Der Minassian - We entered the market with innovative, multi-material technical solutions developed by our China-based partners at attractive costs. At that time, we mainly focused on advertising and promotional activities. But in the 2000s, we quickly oriented our business towards luxury, in particular thanks to Zamak. We provided the industry with advanced technical opportunities that resulted in luxury products. We capitalized on our historical Chinese partners, while controlling the manufacturing process, which helped us quickly go upmarket. Our ability to manage both small series and large volumes led us to also work with niche perfume brands starting from 2010 – we are very present on this segment, now. Premium Beauty News - What are Metapack's strengths? Annette Der Minassian - We formed a solid technical team that could meet both major groups' and emerging brands' needs. The whole design and development phase takes place in our Paris office, which counts 13 employees. As for manufacturing, we rely on our Chinese partners with whom we have shared experience for 20 years. We opened an office in Hong Kong in 2003 to follow up our projects and production. Our customers appreciate our ability to deal with the most complex briefs, and if demand requires it, we also offer manufacturing solutions in Europe. Premium Beauty News - You meet demand with tailor-made designs, but do you also have a standard range? Isaure de la Noue - Indeed, our knowledge of multi-material tools helps us develop a whole range of bespoke solutions. We have also offered standard ranges for three years – they are very appealing to niche brands. Our moulds are designed for easy customization. These ranges are only designed for refillable products: Zamak-based bag sprays, four concrete case bases, lipstick casing… We endeavour to meet the expectations of high-end, mobile, responsible research. The idea is to make consumers want to keep their pieces. Premium Beauty News - So, you have also got an office in New York? Isaure de la Noue - We opened it in 2013 to meet the needs of the American market. It works extremely well, so we will inaugurate a showroom later this year as a complement. Premium Beauty News - How do you see the future of your company? Annette Der Minassian - We will preserve our specificities, because that is what makes a difference. We will keep federating, innovating, and opening to other European partners. We will also keep listening to innovative companies that can provide our customers with a worthy service, and finding new, closer alchemies. And of course, we will keep growing: we aim to reach a 20-million-euro turnover for our 20th anniversary, and we are not far from it."
G. Pivaudran to double its surface treatment capacity,"Based in South West France, the G. Pivaudran company recently inaugurated a new 3000 m2 building. The company, which claims to be one of the world's leading metal processer for the fragrance and cosmetics industries is celebrating its 70th anniversary and Marc Pivaudran, CEO and grandson of Georges Pivaudran, the founder, seized this opportunity to look to the future. ""This anniversary is an opportunity to measure the ability of our company to look forward,"" he said. ""We have just finished extension work on a new 3000 m2 industrial building that will enable us to increase capacity for new projects entrusted to us by our customers and to deploy assembly machines followed by new press tools."" Extension and refurbishment work entailed an investment of about 2.7 million euros in real estate and 1.8 million euros in machines. In the continuity of these investments, the company will install a new automatic anodization line by the end of next year. G. Pivaudran will thus be able to double its surface treatment capacity. In line with its vision of sustainability, the company has implemented a continuous quality improvement initiative, which is deployed systematically across the company with a focus on: the training and certification of production teams, the reliability of developments and the optimization of manufacturing processes. This comes as a complement to the company's CSR approach. G. Pivaudran is ISO 14001 compliant and is moving forward to upgrade energy savings. Next steps for the company: diversification towards spirits (perfumes and cosmetics still account for 95% of turnover) and the conquest of new export markets (international sales currently represent nearly 20% of the turnover business)."
Aptar strengthens the protection of fragile and natural formulas,"With consumers being increasingly suspicious regarding the substances contained in their daily cosmetics, brands are multiplying the launches of new generation formulas: cosmetics highly concentrated in natural ingredients, products formulated with very little or no preservatives, probiotics based skin care products, or products containing anti-pollution agents, Vitamin C, or other substances sensitive to light and oxidation. To protect these highly sensitive formulas from external contamination, Aptar Beauty + Home is launching Skin Protect, a patented solution allowing a fully hermetic closure. Skin Protect is the result of four years of development. Thanks to a piston which hermetically seals the actuator's orifice as soon as the distribution of formula is stopped, Aptar's new solution can dispense the formulation without any air return in the tube. ""This patented technology ensures a perfectly sealed closure while ensuring easy control when dispensing the cream. The Airless tube is equipped with the Tip Seal technology, which prevents the product from clogging the dispensing orifice. Three ventilation points on the cap avoid the confinement of the air and any risk of surface humidity,"" explains Aptar. When it comes to ban preservatives, airless systems are not always enough. According to Aptar, Skin Protect allows to remove or drastically reduce preservatives. The tube are delivered sterile. Microbiological tests have confirmed the microbial tightness of the system. Skin Protect also offers the usual benefits of airless systems. In particular, it meets the expectation of consumers to be able to use the product in its entirety and to easily control the dispensing flow. Furthermore, the ""Twist to Lock"" system ensures a quick and intuitive closure. According to Aptar, Skin Protect is a perfect packaging for: – Vitamin C skin care anti-aging products – Anti-pollution skin care products – Probiotics skincare – Skin care for ultra-sensitive skin Available in three sizes (50ml, 75ml and 100 ml), Skin Protect can deliver any kind of emulsions and fluids."
Verescence puts eco-design at the forefront,"""At Verescence, we believe that developing more environmentally-friendly actions and eco-designed products is compatible with the codes of luxury and beauty,"" explains Astrid Dulau-Vuillet, Global Marketing & Communication Director at Verescence. At Luxe Pack Monaco 2018, the French glassmaker has highlighted its latest eco-friendly products, including Upcycled, an eco-designed fragrance specially developed for the show. The Upcycled' high-end glass cap and bottle are 100% recyclable. The glass weight of the bottle (Verescence's standard mould ""VERSO"" 100ml) has been reduced from 180g to 130g for a lower impact on the environment (-21% of greenhouse gas emissions). The silk-screening and lacquering are also eco-designed according to a patent-pending process. ""The choice of glass for the cap allows to eliminate plastic while meeting the current trend to premiumization in this category,"" said Astrid Dulau-Vuillet to Premium Beauty News. As far as the fragrance is concerned, the Verescence called on Givaudan's expertise. A 100% natural origin unisex cologne, the fragrance was created by perfumer Marypierre Julien with different upcycled materials (or ""recycled upward"", i.e. transforming materials or products that we no longer use in materials of higher quality that can be used to create new products). Verescence also used its expertise in lightweight glass for the development of a new jar for Guerlain's Orchidée Impériale day cream. The glass weight of the jar has been reduced by 62%, from 244g to 93g for a lower impact on the environment. ""Guerlain is a pioneer in eco-design in the luxury beauty market. The brand has challenged us with this lightweight glass jar. This is a perfect example of a high-end eco-conceived packaging which has had a huge market impact"", says Astrid Dulau-Vuillet. Eventually, Verescence showcased the NEO Infinite Glass bottle produced for Bvlgari Man Wood Essence, Bvlgari's latest men's fragrance launched in September. The bottle is made from 90 percent recycled glass, using the NEO Infinite Glass innovation launched by Verescence in 2014. To top it all off, Verescence's CSR policy was rewarded with the Luxe Pack in green award. The jury emphasized the maturity of a ""perfectly organized"" approach where the figures, vision and ambitions ""are carried through to every level in the company - from the shop floor to the general management."" Fragrance Innovation Summit Astrid Dulau-Vuillet, Global Marketing & Communication Director of Verescence, will speak with Sandrine Sommer (Guerlain) and Gildas Bonnel (Sidièse) during the roundtable: ""Sustainable commitment: brand communication issues"" Full program and registration: www.fragranceinnovation.com"
Luxe Pack makes a statement with a new event dedicated to packaging in Paris,"Just eight days after Luxe Pack Monaco had closed its doors, the InfoPro Group announced the launch of a new event dedicated to luxury packaging: ""Edition Spéciale by Luxe Pack"", which will take place on 4 and 5 June 2019 in Paris at the Carreau du Temple hall. ""It is a new concept, a multi-media and high-end event,"" explained Nathalie Grosdidier, in charge of several trade shows for the InfoPro Group - including Luxe Pack and MakeUp In. ""It offers the power of communication and the contacts of a traditional appointment but it also mobilizes players around a topical key issue chosen each year by Brand owners."" The theme of the 2019 edition will be unveiled once the ongoing survey with luxury brands dedicated to beauty, wine & spirits, delicatessen, fashion is completed. ""In the months leading up to the event, a digital platform will disseminate a strong editorial content on this theme: testimonials or questions from brand owners, solutions from manufacturers, and insights from experts."" A featured event, as part of this launch in June, will gather in a stylish venue in the heart of Paris, experts in packaging manufacturing, who will be in a position to concretely address the subject. ""It will be all about confronting strategies, putting forward innovative and relevant solutions to write the future of this market together,"" said Nathalie Grosdidier. The 2018 edition of Luxe Pack Monaco welcomed 470 exhibitors including 55 first time exhibitors and a stable number of visitors - 9280 this year, including 53% from abroad, against 9200 in 2017. Key players in luxury packaging had once again made the trip, especially glassmakers. In addition to world leaders, several newcomers were present like the Swedish Blue Glass, la cristallerie Saint Louis, Wheaton from Brazil, the OI Europe Company and even a firm from Slovakia, Rocasca. ""The presence of the global high-end glass industry can only strengthen the DNA of Luxe Pack,"" said Nathalie Grosdidier. ""Luxe Pack Monaco is more than ever the world's leading appointment for the luxury packaging sector. The foundations of this trade show have been reinforced further this year"". A 2018 edition with clearly a growing number of so called ""high-tech"" exhibitors in the ""Digital"" Village, which gathered for the first time twenty-four companies with a strong presence of 3D printing. Gradually the area created four years ago and dedicated to formulation has expanded and gathered this year 24 exhibitors. While there was no lack of visitors, it is clearly the lack of space that now hinders its expansion. The Grimaldi Forum is becoming increasingly cramped for Luxury Pack Monaco, with a waiting list now exceeding 100 companies. The takeover of the ""MakeUp In"" trade shows in 2016 has undeniably strengthened the foothold of the InfoPro Group in the Beauty sector. ""The synergies between Luxe Pack and MakeUp In are working very well in Los Angeles - with a number of exhibitors up by 50% in 2019 compared to 2018 - and in Shanghai,"" explained Nathalie Grosdidier. ""And the same synergy will certainly be just as efficient elsewhere depending on the opportunities arising."" After the United States, Asia remains a priority for the Group who recently reorganized its commercial structure by appointing, among others, Agnes Leung in Hong Kong, who will be in charge of developing the Luxe Pack and MakeUp in trade shows locally in partnership with the Aventi Company in Shanghai. Finally, a new sales representative dedicated to Luxe Pack shows has joined the Group's headquarters in Antony, France, in the person of Maria Verigina. Note that this ""trade show"" strategy is reinforced by the presence in the same Division, of the team in charge of the Formes de Luxe magazine, with the aim of increasing synergies."
Heinz-Glas strengthens its footprint in high-end glass for perfumes with the acquisition of Saverglass' flacon business,"Saverglass, a world leader in the production of super-premium bottle for the wines and spirits markets, has sold its flacon business to German glassmaker Heinz-Glass, one of Europe's leading manufacturers of premium and luxury glass bottles and jars for the perfume and cosmetics industry. In a context of strong global demand for high-end glass bottles - linked in particular to the accelerated premiumization in several markets (rosé wines and olive oils in Europe, tequilas, mezcal and rums on the American continent, skincare around the world), Saverglass wants to focus its production capabilities on its key markets. Thus, in June 2018, the group started a new glass and decor factory in Mexico, adding the new facility to the five already existing on three continents [1], in order to meet the strong demand for high-end bottles in the American wines and spirits market. Launched in 1997, the production of glass bottles for perfumes enabled the French glassmaker to strengthen its culture and know-how in high-end glass and to develop a portfolio of loyal customers and a comprehensive and highly appreciated range of standard designs, especially for niche perfume brands. This business, however, only counted for a minor proportion of Saverglass' net sales. The acquisition of the Saverglass' flacon business enables Heinz-Glas to broaden both its customer base and its portfolio of standard designs, a perfect match with its extensive offering of finishing technologies and plastic caps for premium and luxury glass bottles and jars. The Heinz-Glas Group, whose history dates back to 1622, is headquartered in Kleintettau, Germany, with operations in 12 countries and three continents. ""The entire Heinz-Glas team feels a responsibility to serve customers in the future at least as good as Saverglass did in the past,"" said Carl-August Heinz, owner and president of Heinz-Glas Group. The transfer of the Saverglass production business to Heinz-Glas is set to take place on the 1st of January 2019. A task force comprising teams from both companies has been set up to ensure a smooth transition for customers. ""We are going to take all measures to satisfy customers. I'll be in Feuquières this week to start working on the transition,"" told Rudolf Wurm, Commercial Director of Heinz Glas and Managing Director of Heinz Glas France, to Premium Beauty News. ""We want to capitalize on the excellent work done by Saverglass,"" he added."
Eastman showcases a green alternative to ABS at Luxe Pack Monaco,"Trēva is a new BPA-free plastic containing 45% of cellulose-based plastic sourced from sustainably managed North American forests. Furthermore, because of its aesthetic, mechanical and chemical qualities it is an alternative that performs as well as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). ""It is an ideal solution for cosmetics brands looking for sustainable solutions for opaque and colour-tinted packaging,"" explains Cédric Perben, Global Cosmetic Technical Platform Leader, Specialty Plastics at Eastman. ""Unlike other cellulosic material, Trēva achieves exceptional depth of colour and high gloss for opaque applications. Further assuring optimum aesthetics, its excellent chemical resistance to skin oils helps ensure packaging won't crack, craze, become brittle, or discolour over the life of the cosmetics product."" Trēva thus served as a basis for the development, in partnership with Groupe Rocher, of an eco-designed compact. Groupe Rocher shared their concept for a compact case simplifying processing into a single step instead of the typical three-step process. The design also eliminates the metal hinge pins and uses plastic pins instead. ""By eliminating metal and using fewer materials in the design, Groupe Rocher has created a compact case that requires fewer natural resources to produce, using less energy and eliminating secondary processing steps without compromising the packaging functionality and aesthetic brand codes,"" states Stéphane Tétaud, packaging makeup development at Groupe Rocher. ""This saves time and money during the manufacturing process and has the added benefit of taking a step toward recyclability."" The compact lid is composed of the new Eastman Cristal™ EV600 copolyester, a glasslike high-flow polymer that is Cradle to Cradle Certified™ Bronze by the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute."
"""We help brands to reach their goals through innovative packaging design and materials,"" Sari Pajari, Metsä Board","Premium Beauty News - What have been this year's main highlights for Metsä Board? Sari Pajari - Metsä Board has introduced its SkinCare 2.0 gift box design, an inspirational package for beauty care applications that aims to improve the consumer experience and minimizes the use of plastics in a creative way. The structural design of each box reduces packaging material use and offers a plastic-free and recyclable packaging solution. In addition, each box offers a unique opening and reclosing feature. We have received several recognitions to our sustainable packaging innovations. For example, our SkinCare 2.0 gift box design won the 2018 Luxe Pack Shanghai 'in green' Award and our innovative cup design Lidloc has won and the Red Dot award. Sustainability credentials are extremely important for us and our customers, and this is why we are very proud of the recognition given to us by institutions like CDP and EcoVadis. Metsä Board was this year again awarded a position both on CDP's Supplier Climate A List and on CDP's Supplier Water A List and we are the only forest industry company globally to feature on the Supplier Climate A list. Metsä Board was also again awarded the Gold level rating by EcoVadis for our approach to sustainability and corporate social responsibility. Overall, we were ranked in the top 1% of suppliers across all categories. Premium Beauty News - To what extent is ""green"" packaging influencing consumer purchasing behavior and packaging choices among brand owners in the cosmetics industry? Sari Pajari - We see a growing demand for more naturally derived ingredients in beauty products and their packaging with increased concerns on product safety, traceability and friendliness to the environment. Conscious consumers appreciate ethical, trustworthy brands which have transparently published their sustainability targets and programs. We at Metsä Board help brand owners reach these goals through innovative packaging design and by providing sustainable packaging materials that are renewable, recyclable, biodegradable, certified and more lightweight. Premium Beauty News - What new innovations will Metsä Board be presenting at Luxe Pack? Sari Pajari - Metsä Board will highlight its innovative SkinCare 2.0 gift box which uses fiber-based materials to replace plastic. Also on display will be a creative customer case study which shows how packaging design should communicate with each part of the value chain and how it must be at the core of a luxury brand. The 2018 'Spirit of the Year', Arctic Blue Gin packaging showcases how an impressive design process optimized all aspects of the paperboard to create a stunning and sustainable solution. Visitors can also see first-hand the ground-breaking winning design 'Stretching Inner Part' from the global 'Better with Less – Design Challenge' design competition, that was organised by Metsä Board. This innovative design introduces an ingenious fiber-based alternative to plastic bubble wrap which is also very interesting for luxury packaging. Premium Beauty News - According to you, what are the next big trends set to disrupt the industry in the next few years bring? Sari Pajari - I can see four major trends: – Continued changes in the retailing landscape. Customers expect a seamless, intuitive customer experience that makes buying products quicker, easier and more enjoyable, be it online, in-store or a combination of these, the experience of e-commerce packaging must match consumer expectations for shopping a brand in-store. Packaging solutions need to be adaptable for different channels but at the same provide a uniform, high-quality brand experience for shoppers. – Experience and personalization. Consumers look for experiences and entertainment and they also share their experiences in social media. This calls for personalization, limited editions, innovative materials and new design solutions such as unique opening and closing features. Technological advancements in digital printing of packaging support this trend, enabling lower print runs more cost efficiently. – Smart packaging. Connected packaging acts as an interface between the consumer and the product, offering a pathway to augmented reality with videos and further information about the product, its origin and sustainability. – Sustainability. The Importance of sustainability and traceability continues to grow. Work toward the reduction of excess packaging, make sure your packaging is as sustainable and recyclable as possible - you are far more likely to win customers over - and show you're doing your bit for the planet. Premium Beauty News - What are the main opportunities and challenges faced by packaging players? Sari Pajari - Consumers are increasingly conscious about sustainability of packaging. Today's educated consumers also understand the connection between consumption and environmental and social impact. We need to work together in order to ensure that packaging fulfils the growing consumer expectations and provides positive brand experiences for the consumer. Premium Beauty News - How has Metsä Board overcome these challenges? Sari Pajari - Our lightweight premium paperboards successfully meet the growing need to reduce carbon footprints and make packaging more sustainable. Through our packaging design services, we also provide ideas, inspiration and practical solutions to brand owners to jointly develop more eco-friendly and functional packaging. We have recently further strengthened our design team to meet brand owners' growing interest in this area."
Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie celebrates its 200th anniversary with a new award,"For its 200th anniversary, celebrated in Paris, on September 18, Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie (formerly Verreries de Masnières) gathered more than 110 people - clients, staffs and journalists. The party was presided over by Étienne Gruyez, CEO of the company, and Dr Cornelius Grupp, owner of the Stölzle Glass Group. On this occasion, Mr. Alexis Govciyan, Director of the ISM (Institut Supérieur des Métiers - Higher Institute of Trades), presented to Dr Cornelius Grupp the Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant (EPV, or Living Heritage Enterprise) label, a mark of recognition granted to companies that have achieved excellence in industrial expertise over the years. The group's industrial complex is located in Masnières, 190 km (120 miles) north of Paris in the Hauts de France region. It comprises two entities: Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie, specializing in the production of high-end glass bottles and jars, primarily for the perfumery-cosmetics sector, and Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie Décoration, specializing in glass decoration techniques, including the recently launched Quali Glass Coat 2.0 innovation, a newly developed a glue-free and solvent-free powder coating process offering a broad palette of new decorative effects with a very low environmental impact and high mechanical resistance. Since its acquisition by Stölzle Glass Group, the company has undergone a full transformation. Stölzle Masnières Parfumerie now has its own mould workshop, equipped with brand new state-of-the-art equipment. In 2016, a new combustion furnace was put into service and can now transform 75 tons of glass per day to produce 40 to 140 bottles per minute. In order to improve the company's agility, the production team has been working intensively to be able to process different sizes simultaneously when they are compatible. A technical performance that involves two different quality controls simultaneously. An important training program has also been carried out so that all employees can achieve several tasks. Once again, the goal is to increase the site's agility. New developments are planned for the coming years, including the reconstruction of a new furnace by 2020 and the destruction of the oldest in 2018. The glass plant will therefore be equipped with 4 to 5 additional production lines. To mark this anniversary year, various events have been held throughout 2018, in addition to the party held on September 18. On June 22 and 23, two days were devoted exclusively to the employees and their families, and on September 15 the company opened its doors to the public for the Journée de la Patrimoine (France's annual heritage festival)."
Aptar partners with makeup artist Fred Farrugia to enhance innovation,"To establish itself as a key innovator in make-up packaging, Aptar Beauty + Home sought out Fred Farrugia, a leading make-up artist. Mr Farrugia joined Aptar Beauty + Home's innovation team that gathers the talents of designers, engineers, research and development experts, creative professionals and marketing directors. ""This unit, where creativity knows no bounds, works to conceive innovations that break with established codes, to develop new, previously unexploited materials and work so that packaging and gestures come together in perfect synergy. Its aim is to be able to accompany brands whatever their stage of development, from small indies to the biggest multinational brands, with solutions ranging from dispensing systems to the development of complete make-up lines,"" explains the company. Fred Farrugia has worked with the world's most famous photographers, including Peter Lindbergh, Jean-Baptiste Mondino and Jean-Paul Goude before meeting Jean Paul Gaultier and working with him on his first ever Haute Couture show. In 1997, Lancôme picked him out, and for eight years, he was in charge of creating the house's make-up products as its artistic director. He was the brains behind the famous Juicy Tube, the first lipgloss ever to be packaged in a tube and still on the market to this day. A true packaging revolution at the time, this iconic product set the tone for his ongoing passion for design and the essential relationship between the product and its packaging. Based on his experience, in 2004 Fred Farrugia decided to create his eponymous brand. After five years in development, he launched a never before seen make-up concept, a portable, customizable palette designed by Ora-Ïto and made up of modules to be combined and clipped together. The mix-and-match collection was composed of foundation, blusher, eyeshadows and lip products to be applied with either a brush, a sponge or the fingers thanks to their adaptable textures. ""The codes of the colour cosmetics world are about to be reset thanks to this collaboration with Aptar. The shared goal at the root of this collaboration is to reinvent the segment so that formulas, packaging and make-up gestures finally come together in perfect harmony,"" says Fred Farrugia. The first outcome of this collaboration is expected this autumn with the launch of ""a completely new face makeup gesture""."

Anaïk imagines the future of promotional gifts,"In 45 years, the landscape of promotional gifts and accessories has been radically transformed. ""The multiplication of advertisers, media, and special offers create a chaotic vision with less and less loyal, or at best, multi-loyal consumers,"" explains Frédéric Delloye, owner and Director of the company for 20 years. The advent and boom of digital technologies increased the global level of competition and accelerated the price war. ""They also favoured the emergence of new, more demanding, better-informed consumers who expect new experiences, are crazy about new technologies and concerned about sustainability,"" emphasizes Laetitia Faure, founder of the Urban Sublime trends agency. ""As regards promotional gifts, like loyalty programmes, one of the keys is that relevance comes before opportunism… The future of customer loyalty is not a card, but a relationship."" In parallel to this transformation of demand, the supply chain has also been experiencing an unprecedented change. As can be seen with packaging manufacturers, all players in this sector have to deal with increased costs in China. ""If we resist increased prices too much, we increase risks – quality, environmental, ethical risks. So, we must adapt, and we have started restructuring our supply chains,"" explains Frédéric Delloye, who is convinced the country will remain the world's factory in this trade. As a result, Anaïk (47 million euros of turnover and 27 million items delivered in 2017) rethought their whole offering to create a positive, long-lasting link between brands and their customers. The company invented and registered the concept of ""Smart Gift"", a gift in line with the digital era based on five features: – S for ""Smart"", meaning elegant, chic, and refined, but also intelligent – M for ""Measurable"". The objects offered should generate a positive emotion which should be measured, together with the consumer satisfaction index, and of course, the KING of promotional offers. – A for ""Action"". If the brand encourages an action in exchange for the object and the customer responds to this incitement, by giving her opinion or forwarding it to her friends, it significantly strengthens the impact of the operation. – R for ""RSE"" (CSR). It is essential to preserve people and the environment. – T for ""Traceability"". Consumers want to know what they buy and under which conditions the objects they receive as a gift were manufactured. They also want to be reassured about the presence of chemicals and health preservation. The Anaïk offering is now composed of ""phygital"" (physical and digital) products combining physical objects and ad hoc interactive digital solutions that strengthen the relationship between the brand and customers. To meet their customer and consumer expectations, Anaïk initiated an ambitious CSR policy in 2007. It is based on four top priorities: – Improving working conditions in plants by implementing a social audit plan and corrective actions to be followed up – Eco-design, in particular by using organic cotton, recycled cotton, and recycled polyester – More environmentally friendly transport choices (railway transport or barges), in particular to reduce CO2 emissions – Clean packaging: paper and FSC cardboard in particular, cotton pouches, etc. Just like for the whole industry, most products manufactured by Anaïk are made in Asia. ""Today, over 80% of our turnover comes from products manufactured in plants audited in accordance with the ILO (International Labour Organization) conventions,"" the company explains. An Anaïk expert based in Shanghai and specialized in social audits meets partner suppliers every week and supports plants with their progress strategies before they are audited by an external body. Support plans are set up and followed up by Anaïk teams in China. Global expansion To design and deliver products as close as possible to every market's needs, Anaïk – the company already has commercial offices in London, Paris, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Dubai, and New York City – also intends to boost their global development. Sales managers act as intermediates, both to inform designers about each market's specific expectations and to present creations to their customers. The company has just created new positions within the North American team to set up a real subsidiary composed of seven people, Anaïk America. ""This new step already helps Anaïk better serve French customers settled in the United States and gain new customers on this continent,"" Frédéric Delloye rejoices. ""Beyond promotional gifts, we aim to become an emotional marketing leader. We have reinvented the gift: today, it needs to be beautiful, chic, and elegant, but also smart, shrewd, and useful. It has to generate measurable customer satisfaction and a positive impact on sales. Plus, it should be interactive: we should ask for customers' opinions and get them involved, but also remain responsible and transparent. 'Made in Anaïk' rhymes with the guarantee of a product fitted with a personalized digital solution which both preserves the environment and humans, of a product that is completely traceable, and of our adherence to the most demanding anti-corruption practices,"" concludes the CEO."
"Livcer, celebrating its 30th anniversary with a new factory!","Premium Beauty News - Thirty years of age already! Aude de Livonnière - It's true that time just flies! This gives me the opportunity of looking back on these past 30 years... My father, Xavier de Livonnière and his partner Jean Ceresa, who were running a big printing company specialized in rotogravure, Les Charmettes, decided in 1988 to create a second, more flexible company, able to meet the needs of SMBs; this resulted in the creation of the ""LivCer"" Company, whose name was coined with the first three letters of the founders' family names. But the two partners remained completely involved in the development of Les Charmettes, (until its sale to large international groups). Hence, Xavier de Livonnière entrusted, from its inception, the management of Livcer to his children, Charles and me. To meet the needs for agility of its customers, Charles decided to chose and take up the daring challenge of flexographic printing. In a market dominated by rotogravure, this technology was totally innovative. Yet, when this technology is well mastered, it offers many advantages: a high-quality printing offer along with a drastic reduction in costs and deadlines. The pharmaceutical industry was immediately seduced by the process! In addition, from the outset, Charles made the avant-garde choice to use water-based inks and to settle his activity in an eco-responsible environment. This pioneering spirit helped establish Livcer Flexographie as the benchmark Company in continuous printing. But at the same time, Livcer had also responded to a very specific request for the packaging of thermoformed doses. This could have been the end of the development of the Company, but I quickly understood the huge potential this technology offered for the cosmetic industry and I decided to join the family business and created Livcer Monodose in 1991. Beauty brands were won over by this new sampling format that satisfied all their requirements: insure the preservation of formulas, rely on a very flexible material that allows creating every possible shape and finally, thanks to the insert on which the single dose is presented, be able to communicate! It was an immediate hit. Custom designed treatments, single-dose masks, targeted treatments, travel kits..., the market for cosmetic single-doses exploded and we became the experts in this type of packaging. Premium Beauty News - And today success is the same! Aude de Livonnière - Yes, absolutely! Today, Livcer employs around fifty people, manufactures some 90 million thermoformed doses each year and has a turnover of 15 million euros. A double-digit increase again this year is pushing us to increase our production capacity. By a stroke of luck, the plant located right next to ours in Sucy-en-Brie was for sale. We will be operational next spring 2019 and this will allow us to purely and simply increase our capacity twofold. Premium Beauty News - That means more machines? Aude de Livonnière - Absolutely, we intend to acquire additional production lines. We currently rely on eight thermoforming lines that can condition either horizontally or vertically. Our biggest market remains cosmetics (80%). A market equally divided between personal care and make-up, knowing that the latter is currently enjoying the fastest growth. And concerning the products we manufacture, the share of ""samples"" represents 75% of our business, the remaining 25% being ""sales products"". In the coming months, we will certainly start running new ""home-made"" thermoforming lines with a brand-design. Premium Beauty News - Innovation is your DNA! Could you give us some examples? Aude de Livonnière - That's what makes the Company stand apart and allows us to be the European leader in thermoformed doses. Now, on the side of novel products, there is the Cosmetic Press. We have managed the technological feat of encapsulating in an ultra slim, totally transparent, large size blister a foundation or a skincare. Before testing it, beautistas can check if the colour of the texture appeals to them. Thanks to its slim profile, this single-dose fits everywhere, in the printed press or envelopes. And of course, true to our commitment toward environment, this new sample respects eco-designing standards. The Cosmetic Press epitomises 30 years of continuous innovation. Let me recall the milestones of these past five years... 2013, the Touch Kiss, to print your kisses: a never-seen-before technology of reverse printing. 2014, the Beauty Press, to read on your lips: a sample lipstick and a concentrated pack of excellence! 2015, the Bi-Colour, to double the dose: the double casting technology implemented makes it possible, for the first time, to propose two colours in the same single dose sample. 2016, the mini-mascara to offer a one-eye dose! And in 2017, the mini-cushion for the dosing of touch-ups. We also launched in 2017, loose powder samples fitted with micro-perforated lids that perfectly mimic the sifters of traditional powder cases. This enables the brand to promote its product since the consumer uses the same application gesture as he would with a powder case. Indeed, using various communication media, (card or mini package), the sample can be fitted with its powder puff. Upon request, we can supply the applicators and even condition the cushions. Like for on sale products, the foundation is poured on a cushion and it can be used for one or two applications. Premium Beauty News - And what about your export sales? Aude de Livonnière - We are progressing each year a little more... Exports sales represent today 20% of our activity. Main countries targeted: the United States and Italy (given the number of make-up contract manufactures in the country)."
Linea Glam continues growing in France,"To achieve its objectives, Linea Glam is constantly working on the design of exclusive packaging with its partners in Asia (Korea, Taiwan and China) and in Europe, so as to be able to provide its European customers with innovative proposals (dubbed ""packaging ideas""), including an aesthetic dimension in accordance with brands' styles and requirements. ""After a very close collaboration with a high-quality manufacturer in South Korea for a few years, we have been looking by ourselves for innovative products throughout Asia. It is in this context that we have set up a liaison office in Taiwan which manages our sourcing and supply network of which we are particularly proud,"" said Mauro Zulianello, President of Linea Glam France. Indisputably, France remains the main market for the company that doubled its sales in the country in 2017. Linea Glam is also pleased with the strong performance achieved in Germany with a very strong growth expected in 2018-2019, in the continuity of the good results of last year. ""In 2017, we also developed projects with great success in Italy, Switzerland and even in Asia (Thailand, South Korea and India),"" emphasizes Mauro Zulianello. Among its latest and most prominent achievements, Linea Glam was chosen by Filorga for the 30ml dropper bottle of the brand's Oil Absolute, an item with premium technical and aesthetic features. The ""auto-dropper"" system allows it to charge automatically each time the cap is screwed onto the bottle, so the product is always ready for use. Also in France, Linea Glam has also developed the ""Mood Box"" for the Irisé Paris brand, an infinitely adaptable make-up palette, which can contain either foundations, blushes or eyeshadows, with as a project to develop soon a new version with larger dimensions in order to contain more makeup colours and options. ""Our main goal is to maintain a consistently high level of service for all our customers, always and in all circumstances. The strong momentum in the packaging industry is the perfect propeller of our creative strength and our ever-renewed will to meet new market challenges,"" concludes Mauro Zulianello."
Stora Enso: One step closer to replacing plastic,"The Finnish group is making another major step on its journey to replacing fossil-based materials with renewable solutions. Stora Enso's new DuraSense range enables the use of renewable fibres, such as wood, to substitute for a large portion of fossil-based plastic. The new family of materials is suitable for a wide range of applications from consumer goods to industrial applications. Typical applications include, for example, furniture, pallets, hand tools, automotive parts, accessories and packaging for beauty and lifestyle products, toys and items, such as kitchen utensils and bottle caps. The DuraSense granules are a combination of natural wood fibres, polymers and additives offering the mouldability of plastic with the sustainability and workability of wood. With DuraSense, it is also possible to combine fibres with recycled or bio-based polymers to further enhance environmental values. For example, DuraSense Eco100, which is one of the product grades and based on wood fibres and biopolymers, allows to fully replace fossil-based plastics. ""Reducing the amount of plastic and replacing it with renewable and traceable materials is a gradual process. With DuraSense, we can offer customers a wood fibre-based alternative which improves sustainability performance and, depending on the product, significantly reduces the carbon footprint - all the way up to 80%,"" says Jari Suominen, Head of Wood Products at Stora Enso. Stora Enso's biocomposites can be reused as a material up to seven times or recycled along with other plastic materials or, alternatively, used for energy recovery at their end of life. ""The replacement of plastics as a packaging material is an issue that cannot be avoided. DuraSense offers very interesting opportunities. In the future, we can consider specific developments to meet the requirements of beauty brands, particularly in the make-up sector,"" adds Hervé Vue, Sales Director of Stora Enso France. In parallel, Stora Enso has signed a new partnership with the start-up Sulapac, which produces a fully biodegradable material made of renewable and sustainable raw materials. Sulapac's fully biodegradable eco-designed packaging has been selected by Finnish cosmetics company Naviter for its new Atopik range of natural cosmetic products. Through the joint development agreement, Stora Enso will licence Sulapac's materials and technology, and begin the development of fully renewable caps and closures for liquid packages. ""At Stora Enso we believe that everything that's made with fossil-based materials today can be made from a tree tomorrow. Our future growth comes from innovations in renewable materials,"" concludes Annica Bresky, EVP Consumer Board at Stora Enso. ""With our partners, such as Sulapac, we drive these innovations to create the packaging of the future."""
Albéa presents Halal compliant packaging and full-service solutions,"As a World exclusive at Beauty World Middle East, Albéa presented its Halal-compliant packaging offer, including ready-to-go and tailor-made Halal cosmetic packaging, from tubes to makeup as well as jars and accessories. ""Halal packaging allows clients to consume while remaining aligned with their beliefs their beliefs throughout the whole value-chain,"" explains the company. Manufactured from plant-based plastics, with a process excluding the use of any animal fats, Albéa's halal packaging (tubes and compact cases) are produced in the group's two Indonesian factories - in Semarang and Surabaya - which have received the HAS 23000 Halal certification.

The way bristles are cut and twisted allows the most complex designs."" The collection features four fibre brushes: Jazz, Blues, Folk, Pop."
Blend'It: The personalized perfumed experience by Centdegrés,"After having explored various avenues in packaging innovation for make-up or skincare at various international tradeshows, Centdegrés focused on the latest perfumery trends for its new presentation in Dubai, United Arabe Emirates. This year, Centdegrés has decided to incorporate the fair's visitors to test in real-time a new concept, originating from an attentive observation of market trends. ""Blend'It is an elaborate and amusing invitation to compose a fragrance in one's own image, based on your mood at the time of creation using high-quality scents designed by master perfumers that have been adapted for this new experience,"" explains the company in a release. Together with Centdegrés, Firmenich, an international leader in fragrance, has developed two original scents and four booster scents to transform the fragrances. Albéa, for the pumps [1], MMB, an expert in small bottle series, and Nortier and DejaLink for the secondary the packaging, also participated in the project and produced a convincing prototype that was developed enough to be distributed and tested during the show. At the Blend'It stand, each visitor-tester will be able to select one of two unique scents that best reflects his/her personality and two out of four booster scents that suit their perfume habits. The visitor will leave the stand with a package composed of a combination of their 3 selections: 3 small spray bottles conceived and created to fit entirely in one hand and allow the user to easily create his/her very own signature olfactory compositions, designed and thought-out by master fragrance developers. ""For centdegrés, this event is a unique and valuable occasion to highlight the skills and expertise of all the teams involved, but also and in particular, to share the creative process with the visitors who will be invited to share their Blend'It experience, questions and sensations. They will become the main influencers of this project and allow the agency to refine and develop the blending concept and create a real product from A to Z,"" says the design agency."
The Annick Goutal brand gets a makeover,"Built through iconic women like Catherine Deneuve and Isabelle Adjani, the Annick Goutal brand universe was resolutely feminine. However, in the perspective of the launch of mixed and men's ranges, especially for its famous perfume ""L'Eau d'Adrien"" created in 1981, the brand wanted to change its image. In order to open more of its universe to men the brand chose to change its name to Goutal. In this context, BETC Design has created a new territory of expression dubbed ""The House Goutal"", conceived as an authentic place where expresses the passion and daring that characterizes it. The agency has continued the transformation of the brand by reinterpreting the historical codes that have made its reputation, such as the golden elements used for the caps, or the godrons that have been preserved but modernized, with more irregular shapes, thus removing the draped effect of the past. The new caps retain a dense form thus echoing the brand's historic codes which differed by their bold shapes. The agency brought them a new pleated look and changed the gilding to a whiter and more discreet tone. The new packs are offered in sheaths with a white box cut in the center that shows through a window the interior where the perfume is. The illustration is taken again and comes to dress the pack, and is voluntarily colored. Finally, the illustration continues inside the pack that invites you to walk inside it. For the men's range man, the agency has selected of metallic grey and silver colours. For women, white and walleye were chosen. The new logotype keeps the spirit of the previous lettering, while bringing it more weight and a new black colour. The inked illustration is signed by illustration studio the Broll and Prascida. The brand's name is replaced at the top of the packs to highlight it. The women's perfumes are recognizable with the use of walleye on the pack and the eau de toilette stands out with a pink window more pastel than that of the perfume. The walleye was removed from the packs for men, the differentiation being done through the coulour. ""Annick Goutal has opened a path, as one of the pioneers of niche perfumery. For us, it was a matter of strategic and creative branding, iin a historical dimension, building on the foundations established over the last thirty years and at the same time projecting the brand into a modern world. Bottles and secondary packs have been essentialized, modernized and ennobled simultaneously, and the name was abbreviated, and the logotype and heraldry iconized,"" highlighted Christophe Pradère, CEO and founder of BETC Design."
Wista Packaging to target international markets,"""Our operations are based on two centres of excellence, Qualitec Plastics Technology and Wista Packaging. Our manufacturing facilities are equipped with European machinery, equipment and technology and we have our own global patents,"" explains Eric Zembrod, CEO. In 1995, Qualitec Plastics Technology started diversifying its activities by manufacturing technical parts for the cosmetics and pharmaceutical primary packaging markets. In 2012, the company's owners created Wista Packaging, a new entity exclusively dedicated to personal care and pharmaceutical packaging. Headquartered in Boituva, in the State of Sao Paulo, close to Brazil's economic capital, the family-owned businesses manufacture their own moulds and tools. Qualitec focuses on plastic packaging components (caps, applicators, green plastics and airless pumps), while Wista Packaging focuses on flexible tubes and decoration. The vertical integration allows them to shorten lead times and to offer highly flexible services. ""Besides the monolayer or coex, the injection lines and our own tooling shop, our facility is equipped with state-of-the art extrusion and decoration lines, allowing us to provide high quality tubes integrated to our patented applicators. Our decoration system is unique and enables to maximize the artwork up to 100% of the length of the tube without additional labelling. Our equipment allows decorations up to seven colours using a wide range of technologies, including HD resolution (700 dpi), silkscreen printing, hot stamping, embossing, braille marking, and metallization,"" adds Zembrod. So far, the company is mainly serving Brazilian customers, but is now ready to export its products to the rest of South America and to North America. ""We'll showcase our products in major North American tradeshows, including Luxe Pack New York and MakeUp in New York,"" highlights Flavio Unikowsky, the company's International Business Manager. With a turnover of USD 24 million, Wista Packaging has a production capacity of 6 million tubes per month (72 million tubes per year) and plans to double its manufacturing capacity within the next three years."
New cushion compact technology addresses restitution and dosage issues,"The new patent-pending Porex Fiber Cushion is a gradient fibre reservoir that addresses product dosage challenges typically associated with standard foam cushions used for existing makeup products. The technology deploys capillary action to pull liquid formula from the bottom of pads to the surface in a measured, consistent manner. A touch-driven response then ensures the cushion disperses a uniform amount of product each time it is compressed. ""Foam cushions currently available on the market are facing various delivery and dosage problems. With traditional foam reservoirs only 50% of the formula can be dispensed because the fluid tends to accumulate in the bottom of the compact,"" explains Rusty Martin, Global Strategic Marketing Director Consumer and Industrial Segments at Porex. According to Porex, their new Fiber Cushion reservoir can stock a large variety of liquid-based formulations, like foundations or concealers, while offering a high delivery rate thus reducing product waste and enhancing consumers' experience. ""Thanks to the cushion's chemically stable fibre construction, water or oil-based formulation do not accumulate at the bottom of the compact but are driven to the top by capillary reaction,"" adds Rusty Martin. Furthermore, while foam pads typically resemble an ink pad or sponge, the Porex Fiber Cushion offers different aesthetics that can be tailored to the look and feel a brand desires. The cushion's chemically stable fiber construction is also durable enough for a range of formulas including solvents, oils and water-based products. ""On-the-go cosmetics products are experiencing rapid growth to meet fast-paced consumer lifestyles, but the standard cushion compacts on the market do not live up to the expectations of makeup users or cosmetics brands. The new Porex Fiber Cushion ensures that brands can offer portable versions of their liquid-based products while upholding the performance their customers have grown to expect. This technology changes the face of makeup application,"" concludes Martin. The Porex Fiber Cushions currently produced in the US but will soon be manufactured in Europe and Asia too."
RPC to showcase a new lotion pump and several innovations at Cosmoprof,"The new Lotus lotion pump can dispense an accurate 1.5ml dose of product with minimal effort for the end-user. This standard pump features a customisable outer body with a choice of surface finishes and decoration effects. ""This enables manufacturers to combine excellent functionality and user-friendly operation with a personalised on-shelf appearance for effective brand identity,"" RPC claims. The company will also showcase the other packaging and dispensing solutions for cosmetic and personal care applications. Hence, RPC will showcase the Magic Star and Twist-Up airless dispensers, which combine a precise dose with effective protection of sensitive ingredients. The Magic Star features a modular construction with separate body and dispensing head that ensures fast and easy filling. The design of the Twist-Up reveals the dispensing head by turning the upper part of the container. This makes the container particularly secure in its locked 'down' position, meaning it is ideal for the growing e-commerce market for cosmetics. The dispenser also delivers controlled dosing and hygienic application of creams and lotions. Another innovation is RPC Bramlage's recently-launched standard lipcare stick. This comprises a unique three-piece construction that ensures ease of use, with tight control of the pomade stick to minimise the risk of breaking. For viscous creams and gels, the latest Ecosolution high viscosity pump is able to achieve a 97% restitution rate for even the thickest formulae. It can be used in conjunction with the Vega AirFree bottle that features an inner pouch with an EVOH layer to prevent oxygen ingress for extended protection. This makes it suitable for products containing natural ingredients and without preservatives. Eventually, the new airless XL5 pump is offering several benefits including a large dose and ease of use. It has been designed for a variety of professional applications such as spa and hair care, but is equally suitable for larger family size or promotional packs for body care and other personal care products. The pump delivers an accurate 5ml dosage each time, with end-users able to control the operation to deliver the exact amount of product they require. The XL5 pump fits onto the 500ml AirFree Vinci bottle, which is ideal for family formats, and can also be easily adapted to larger sizes of bottles up to 1000ml. Eventually, RPC Bramlage will also showcase its extensive choice of cream jars including the Empress range, which features a double layer construction to maximise a product's quality positioning and brand image, with the inner layer produced in polypropylene and the transparent outer layer in SAN. A new addition is the Coral jar with an innovative design that incorporates a raised section at the base to provide an alternative to the traditional cylindrical shape. The award-winning Slidissime jar meanwhile offers consumers a new tactile opening sensation, dispensing a tailored dose of up to 0.5ml of cream while providing effective airless protection of formulations."
Packitoo: towards the automation of packaging brand-supplier relationships?,"The young start-up is headed by Thomas Othax and Corinne Loustalet-Parra. Thanks to their 20-year experience in the field of packaging, they intend to solve the difficulties encountered by both medium-sized businesses (often devoid of any purchase department) and major groups in search of promotional packaging when they need to quickly gather different service providers – cardboard makers, plastic specialists, all trades involved in tailor-made packaging projects. By putting them in contact with each other, Packitoo promises them to gain time, optimize costs, and simplify processes. These parameters are much sought-after, as the number of promotional campaigns keeps increasing. The sourcing method is based on making a project digitally match with manufacturers that are part of the Packitoo community. The brand submits the tender through a detailed form, so service providers can provide an answer within five days with a quote in accordance with the specifications established. A synthesis is created, enriched with the information the platform has on the manufacturers (profiles, feedback, etc.), and then the player answering process is automated via notifications or e-mails. At this stage, Packitoo pays itself with manufacturers' monthly subscriptions, ranging from EUR 100 to EUR 250 per month, depending on the formula selected, as well as with a retrocession of a commission percentage of the order. In compensation, the tool helps optimize their commercial strategy at lower costs and creates new opportunities in new business areas. The application already counts over 300 customers, including packaging brands and suppliers. Over eight months, it generated some 200 projects and consolidated almost EUR 500,000 market offers. The professional community gathers 250 French and global packaging providers, and the project-providing SMEs that have tested the tool optimized their earnings by 25% on the purchase item. Based in south-western France, the start-up already counts nine employees and should soon open offices in Paris, Madrid, Barcelona, Brussels, and London, and then in Asia and the United States."
"Prisma, a new glass coating for decorative or functional use","Showcased at the last PCD Paris show, the process consists in vacuum-laying a series of extremely thin layers of metal salts to create a scintillating effect. The layers can also be laid with different types of materials, depending on the function wanted. ""A high quantity of materials can be used to play with colours, but also functional filters. These functional intermediaries are still being developed, but they will offer antimicrobial or anti-UV properties, among others,"" explains Federico Montali. For an iridescent finish, depending on the materials used, the effects vary from colourless to coloured with changing reflections. Thanks to the vacuum technology, Prisma can be applied on the whole bottle surface, whatever the shape, including the bottom, foot, and shoulders. The finishing is completed with varnish to protect the layers and tint the whole object on request. Lastly, Bormioli Luigi highlights the fact that Prisma is an eco-responsible innovation which does not require any solvent for the application and does not contain any heavy metals."
Packaging: Recycling and digital are becoming central issues for buyers,"The latest findings of the 2017 Observatory [1] conducted by the All4Pack Paris trade show [2] announce promising growth prospects for the packaging sector in 2018. Investment perspectives of the entire packaging industry are stimulated by growth in packaging user sectors. – The return to economic growth continues to fuel the packaging sector. 63% of buyers and 62% of suppliers forecast an increase in their output by volume in France. Distribution/retail/online holds onto its top position as the most optimistic user sector. The capital, intermediate and construction goods sector has turned optimistic once again for 58% of buyers. One out of two buyers has invested or plans to invest in the creation or manufacturing of packaging solutions. – Processing and handling are driving investment. Out of the 91% of buyers with investments either ongoing or planned within the next two years, one out of three will be investing in processing/packing machines and one out of three in storage or load handling systems. – The ""Made in France"" label is a guarantee for purchases, in spite of noticeable pressure on materials prices. 46% of buyers source their packaging in France. 78% believe that the ""Made in France"" label is a key to development in packaging, but 41% expect to see materials prices rise. According to the All4Pack Observatory, the circular economy is becoming a key issue for the packaging industry, which anticipates new legal requirements. – Recycling and recyclability of materials will drive innovation in the coming two years according to 52% of buyers. A long way ahead of design. – Cost reductions and recycling round out the virtuous circle of packaging. Cost control is historically the most important factor driving change, and this is still the case according to 51% of buyers; however it is nonetheless becoming less predominant on the priority list. Recyclability and recycling of packaging is the second most important factor driving change, and reduction at source and eco-design moves back up to fourth position. The Observatory also points out powerful signals around distribution modes, the digital transformation and industry 4.0: – E-packaging has found its place on the market. Four buyers out of seven say that primary packaging should generally adapt to omnichannel distribution, while two out of seven think that it should be specifically adapted to the online sales channel. Development in shipping packaging is focussed most on boxes tailored to the size of parcels, envelopes, and air cushion and recycled paper gap filling, but in one case in two, it is a standard-size box. – Connected/smart packaging to cater to Millennials. Or so think 79% of buyers. 29% of buyers consider it necessary to differentiate packaging aimed at millennials from that aimed at baby boomers. 71% think that format and size are differentiation criteria for baby boomers. 15 February 2018 – Packing and packaging have now entered the era of industry 4.0 for 71% of buyers and suppliers. Buyers expect industry 4.0 to deliver better quality at lower cost, even more flexibility for equipment, and productivity gains. The key benefit according to suppliers is the reduction in time to market. 36% of buyers have already started investing to adopt the technology of industry 4.0, while others are waiting to assess its return on investment.

Stoelzle Masnières unveils its new eco-friendly glass decoration process,"Derived from a technique used in the automotive industry, this innovation required two years of additional developments and adjustments. It consists in a glue-free and solvent-free powder coating. According to Stoelzle Masnières, the use of powder paint allows us to offer a broad palette of new decorative effects with a very low environmental impact and high mechanical resistance. Among other advantages, this new process allows the development of new shades using thermo-lacquering technology.

Quali Glass Coat 2.0 allows the creation of a spectacular finishes with: perfect coverage of all surfaces, high resistance to shock and friction, a wide choice of colours and surface effects, chrome, pearlescent, glitter or shading effects on all or part of a bottle or jar, whether transparent or opaque. According to Stoelzle, the new technique is suitable for all over-decoration techniques for added personalization, including serigraphy. Due to the zero amount of solvents and very small amount of volatile organic compounds involved in the whole decoration process, Quali Glass Coat 2.0 also offers dramatic ecological advantages. Furthermore, the recuperation and reintegration of exceeding material produced by over-spraying allows to eliminate both emissions and waste. Eventually, the powders used in the application process are compliant with Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances (RoHS). These powders contain no lead, mercury, cadmium or chrome, in line with current European regulations. This process thus constitutes an alternative to lacquering and vacuum metallization. The cost is almost equivalent to that of lacquering, while it may vary depending on the materials used, since the process can be used to spray all kinds of particles, including the most precious. ""Our latest innovation, Quali Glass Coat, will allow sales director Nicolas Carron and his teams to accompany our customers ever further in their quest for creativity and the personalization of bottles and jars,"" highlights Étienne Gruyez, managing director of Stoelzle Masnieres Parfumerie and Stoezle Masnieres Decoration."
"""The next Packaging Innovations show in Birmingham is set to be the biggest and busiest to date,"" James Drake-Brockman, Easyfairs","Premium Beauty News - How many exhibitors do you expect for this new edition of Packaging Innovations? James Drake-Brockman - We already have over 300 exhibitors signed up, ranging from major names through to the smaller, more niche specialists. This, along with the 6,000+ decision makers in attendance, means the show is set to be the biggest and busiest to date. As the industry leader, we continuously strive to better our offerings each year. Visitors to the 2018 show will see that we have an even greater representation from right across the packaging supply chain and our strongest attendance from the leading packaging designers, so there really is something for everyone. Premium Beauty News - What about international exhibitors? James Drake-Brockman - As the show continues to grow, we are seeing more and more international brands wanting to be involved. This year we expect international suppliers to make up around 28% of the showfloor. This is really exciting, not only because it has allowed us to expand our showfloor, but also add to the fantastic names we already had signed up. We work very hard to attract the right calibre of exhibitor to the show, and we always make sure that any global suppliers who show an interest will be relevant to our visitor base. Premium Beauty News -. What are the most dynamic sectors? James Drake-Brockman - Sustainability is a huge talking point for the industry at the moment and it is set to be a big focus at the show - we have the Ecopack area, Ecopack Stage and Ecopack Challenge all dedicated to the issue. We launched Ecopack back in 2008, when we first identified sustainability as becoming one of the biggest challenges facing the packaging industry. Ten years later, the issue of sustainability is more prolific than ever, and our dedicated Ecopack Stage is packed full of educational content designed to advise on how companies can, not only survive, but thrive in an eco-conscious market. We are thrilled to have major names, such as Innocent, Coop and TerraCycle on board. It really is not to be missed. The Ecopack Challenge is also returning by popular demand and will offer companies that are creating innovative and sustainable products the chance to win the opportunity to discuss its idea with experts at Marks & Spencer. The session will be a Dragons' Den style competition, as the four shortlisted companies demonstrate why they should be crowned champion in front of an expert panel and interactive audience. For those looking for inspiration for their packaging, we also have the Pentawards Winners Exhibit returning for 2018. The display will feature the most cutting-edge packaging design from around the world, giving visitors the unique opportunity to get hands on with the best and most creative packaging designs from the last year. In addition to this, we will see new products and innovations launched across the board over the course of the two-days, with over 100 new products being unveiled live on the showfloor. Premium Beauty News - What are the main novelties at this year's event? James Drake-Brockman - I've already mentioned some of the fantastic features that we will be welcoming to the show this year, including the return of the Pentawards Winners Exhibit and the highly anticipated Ecopack Challenge. New for 2018 will be the Innovation Zone - a brand-new area that will showcase the ten most innovative exhibitor products, as well as a selection of new technologies and solutions from non-exhibiting brands. This area has been designed to showcase the latest innovation from within the packaging industry, but also with the visitor in mind, allowing them to experience each product first hand. Also new to the show is The Sustainability Trail, which will highlight the suppliers that are offering solutions and services designed to drive more sustainable values. The feature will inform the brands and retailers in attendance of ways to take a more sustainable approach to their packaging, as well as showcasing the most appropriate stands to visit. Premium Beauty News - What are the main current packaging trends for the beauty market? James Drake-Brockman - The cosmetic packaging market is expected to be worth $31.4 billion by 2021, so it is an incredibly exciting time for the beauty industry. Our industry insight has also shown that sustainability is an increasing issue for the cosmetic packaging industry, with brands like L'Oréal and Dior announcing the launch of 100% recyclable packaging ranges. With this in mind, we have carefully curated a seminar programme that promises to feature educational content, first hand experiences and advice, all designed to inspire the beauty industry professionals in attendance. The industry will take centre stage at the Industry Forum Theatre, as part of the Beauty Forum, which offers a jam-packed schedule of talks from industry thought leaders. The programme will kick off with Imogen Matthews, Founder of Imogen Matthews Associates, who will be exploring the challenges facing brands in developing aspirational yet sustainable packaging. The Beauty Forum will also feature speakers from Floral Street, James Cropper and Curtis Packaging. We're also excited to see some major suppliers from the cosmetic and beauty packaging industry joining us for 2018. Hunter Luxury Packaging, Royston Labels, Continental Bottle Company Ltd, Burgopak and Quadpack are just a few of the big brands who will be offering solutions specifically for the beauty market at the show. Other industry names set to join us at the show include Avon, Baylis & Harding, Coty, John Frieda, Estee Lauder, Molton Brown, Jo Malone & Neal's Yard. Premium Beauty News - Packaging Innovations is launching its first edition in New York in September, alongside to PCD New York. Can you tell us more about the international development of the show? James Drake-Brockman - We run almost 40 packaging focused events across the world and are always looking for new ways that we can serve our markets. The combination of the success of ADF-PCD in New York and the fact that the upcoming Pentawards Gala is set to be held at The Guggenheim Museum made it an easy decision to launch Packaging Innovations in New York. It's going to be a very special, intimate event and one that will mark an exciting new chapter for Packaging Innovations. Because there is already an educated and advanced packaging market in the US, it means that a show like ours was always going to be welcomed with open arms. We are really excited about this launch event and feel confident that the show can help the region become better known as a packaging hub and reaffirm our position as the leading packaging portfolio in the world."
"Philippe Thuvien, L'Oréal: ""The year of packaging innovation!""","Premium Beauty News - Could you please give us some examples of major Packaging Innovations? Philippe Thuvien - Clearly, packaging innovation is strategic to boost product performance and protect the formula. And packaging has a key role to both increase the perceived value of the product and provide an additional service to the user. Here are a few examples of some of our major innovations in 2017: -The mascaras Lash Paradise from L'Oréal Paris and Mister Big from Lancôme with their fibre brushes delivering both volume and separation. – The Armani to Go Cushion Foundation with its airtight case to protect the most sensitive formulas. – Tatouage couture by YSL, a new liquid lipstick with a high precision applicator featuring the YSL logo upon application. – Lancôme's Genefique Sensitive skincare that allows to immediately deliver in a single pressure a booster; the two formulas thus offering a dual concentrate combining a youth activator and soothing properties. – And also L'Oréal Paris' first refillable jar with a refill which has on the outside a ""bead"" textured finish, consistent with the formula, to increase the perceived value. – Finally, in haircare, Power Mix, in L'Oréal Professionnel's Expert line, which enables the hairdresser to offer his client a personalized hair treatment blended under her eyes; the hairdresser thus uses the right amount of product with the two liquids that transform into cream with a very positive environmental impact compared to a single dose kit. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, how do you position yourself in terms of sustainable innovation? Philippe Thuvien - At L'Oréal, Sustainable Development has been a reality for more than 10 years. As far as packaging is concerned, it is a vision and a clearly articulated commitment based on 3 principles: Respect, Reduce, Replace. Respect our consumers, environment and biodiversity with for example, food-grade quality for materials in contact with their content, cardboards made from 100% sustainably managed and certified forests, or the total ban of PVC. Reduce the weight and volume of our packaging, an integral part of the design phase; it is a major lever for improving the environmental profile of products. Replace materials from non-renewable resources with recycled or biomass materials; in 2017, 7,294 tonnes of recycled materials (i.e., + 33% for plastics) enabled to save the equivalent quantity in virgin materials. Premium Beauty News - Tell us a word about your Sharing Beauty With All Program? Philippe Thuvien - In terms of responsible innovation, our commitment for 2020 is very clear: 100% of our new products must have an improved environmental or social impact, compared to the products they replaced. To this end, the Group has developed the Sustainable Product Optimization Tool (SPOT) to evaluate the performance of these new products compared to the ones replaced. In 2017, the SPOT tool was made available for all the brands in the Group. Premium Beauty News - Is digital a challenge for Packaging designers? Philippe Thuvien - In 2017, Packaging has accelerated its digital transformation by integrating in its development processes, all the 4.0 technologies, including the generalization and globalisation of 3D printing (with a 3D laboratory in New York and another one in Paris) representing 8000+ prototypes designed and the implementation of simulation tools to predict the mechanical behaviour of our new packs. These tools have already enabled to generate significant gains in development times. But for Packaging, digital revolution does not stop there: in-mould sensors, digital printing, augmented reality and big data will transform our Trade! Premium Beauty News - What are the prospects for 2018? Philippe Thuvien - In a fast changing world, 2018 promises to be an exciting year for our trade. We recently grouped the Design teams within the Packaging teams to better illustrate and translate in volume our ""consumer centric"" approach, dedicated to perceived value, user ergonomics and consistency with brand codes; hence, more than 700 projects will be treated in product design in 2018. Innovation serving consumers, the reduction of the environmental impact of our packagings without compromising on the perceived value of products and meeting e-commerce requirements will be very exciting challenges for our teams; and with always bearing in mind the fundamentals of the Trade: a responsible Packaging, with the highest standards and guaranteeing the safety of consumers!"
Taiki: Softness and sweetness for the winter 2018 collection,"With its curved shapes and the softness of its material, the Perfect Release sponge offers a new application gesture for complexion. All curved, with a double Perfect Release film on each side, it allows to drop off the fluid or creamy texture on the skin by gently tapping. The wide part is ideal for applying the foundation, when the tip of the teardrop will easily reach the small areas of the face and eye contour with a concealer. No traces, no demarcations, a makeup without thickness to make it ultra natural. Its innovative material does not absorb makeup and restores the entire formula. Cashmere is the material that perfectly epitomises the softness and cocooning seasonal trend. Taiki addresses this feeling with a loose powder dispenser with an integrated puff allowing to apply a veil of loose powder for retouching complexion. Flip the dispenser, tap, fix, sparkle ! Thanks to its open/close system and a mirror, the Poudrier Caresse Cachemire can be carried out everywhere. Eventually, the skin softness during wintertime also implies a pampered skin. The Multi-Masking Brush allows applying different masks at the same time to each area of the face, depending on their specific needs. The square side allows to gently apply, in thick layer, a moisturizing texture on cheeks that tight, when the triangular side allows to precisely target the T zone with a clay mask or the eye contour with an anti-aging."
The ADF-PCD shows announce new features for their next edition in Paris,"With a total of 481 exhibitors [1] (compared to 420 in 2017 and 350 in 2016), the 2018 edition of the ADF and PCD shows (Aerosol & Dispensing Forum and Packaging of Perfume Cosmetics & Design) confirms the growing importance of the event that was added to the Easyfairs portfolio two years ago. On January 31st and February 1st, the 2018 edition will be held in a new and more spacious venue: the completely renovated Hall 7 of the Parc des Expositions at the Porte de Versailles in Paris, France. The 2018 edition will also be marked by several new features: – An Accelerator Zone will allow ten start-ups selected on the basis of their technology to present their latest creations and innovations. Among the companies present this year: Sericyne; ICTK, Voodoo (printed circuit boards on wood), etc. – A refocused conference program that will offer more importance to brands. A greater emphasis will thus be given to non-exhibiting speakers with innovation, technology transfer and sustainable development remain the key topics. – The creation of an Innovation & Technology Theater, a second conference area dedicated to exhibitors and suppliers with display cases offering visitors a quick overview of the latest packaging innovations. – A new Pentawards area where the winners of the design competition - now part of the Easyfairs' portfolio - will be showcased. Finally, as every year, the show will be the opportunity to unveil the packaging creations awarded by two juries (one for ADF and the other for PCD) bringing together experts, professionals and journalists. ""The aim of the ADF & PCD Awards is to reward and promote the cosmetic, aerosol and dispensing innovations placed on the European and international market during the year 2017,"" explain the organizers. To be noted this year, the PCD Awards have been split in two new categories: one for luxury goods and the other for consumer goods. A special sustainable development award has also been created. This year, the two juries evaluated 73 applications and awarded 8 products for ADF and 9 products for PCD. In addition, 6 excellence certificates were given for ADF products and 11 for PCD. The ADF Awards ceremony will take place on Wednesday 31 January 2018 at 4.45 pm and the PCD Awards ceremony on Thursday 1st February 2018 at 2.00 pm. While the concept of pre-constructed stands in standard formats is maintained this year at ADF-PCD, the organizers plan to give more freedom to exhibitors starting in 2019, with the possibility to book larger spaces and bare surfaces for customized stands. For 2019, the organizers, who will have an even larger exhibition surface, also explore the possibility to expand the show to other sectors or categories, perhaps with the co-location of a Packaging Innovations event as will be the case in New York in September. The ADF-PCD concept also continues its international development. After two editions in New York, ADF-PCD will hold its first edition in Shanghai on 28-29 March 2018. For this first edition in Asia, the organizers expect about 100 exhibitors, 20% of whom being European companies."
A new start for PRP Création,"Premium Beauty News - At fifty years of age, you still have the same entrepreneurial spirit! Joël Viry - Absolutely! There's nothing I can do about it! And like any entrepreneur, over the years, you learn to refine your goals and strategies. Between 1992 and 1998 I developed several areas of activity as an engineer/employee; then in 1998 I invested myself more particularly in, Setaram, a SME whose turnover was of 7 million euros with 500,000 euros of losses to make it hit the 24 million euros mark in 2004 with two million euros benefits, In 2004 I decided to embark on a new adventure and concentrated on a very specific axis, that of high-end electronics dedicated to military equipment. In 2008, with the economic crisis, I had to hand over my business. But the entrepreneurship bug was still there! And in 2011 I turned to other projects, this time in connection with the plastics industry. I started with a business of 2 million euros in turnover, Sermi Plast, and then followed with a second one in 2012 with 1 million in sales, SPI, and finally, the same year, with the creation of a structure in Tunisia, S2Tunisie. In 2014, this group of companies achieved 3.5 million euros in sales, mainly in two markets, home appliances and the building industry, and is today doing very well. But I understood that diversification was the key. This is when an opportunity arose: the PRP Company... A successful business specialized in a dynamic segment: the manufacture of bottles and closures for the beauty industry. Its products are intended for different market segments including Perfumes and its high-end clients (Dior, Channel, Guerlain...), mass distribution Cosmetics (Marionnaud, Clarins, Biotherm...), and also pharmaceutical laboratories (Pierre Fabre, Virbac...), etc. Premium Beauty News - PRP, was a ""sleeping beauty""? Joël Viry - Absolutely! PRP (Productions Réalisations Plastiques) was created in 1975. Its primary purpose was to cater for the needs of markets using plastic containers. But let me provide you with some background… In the early 80's, Company managers decided to set foot in cosmetic perfumery a market where players were starting to develop ranges made of plastic components. In 1984, PRP was the first company to launch the injection stretch blow technology in PET bi orientation of thick layers. At the same time, the Company created a R&D/design department in order to satisfy requests from its various customers. In 1996, PRP built a new unique production plant in the Parc Industriel Ouest, in Oyonnax, France to bring together the different activities and to take advantage of the same modern environment not far from the future A 404 motorway. Inside this new site, workshops are dust free and in controlled atmosphere. These conditions enabled to meet the growing customer requirements in terms of product quality and of ISO 9001 standards for which the Company was in the process of being certified. In 1999, PRP was granted the ISO 9001 certification after several years of work to implement a quality assurance system aimed mainly at structuring the services of a Company in full development. In October 2002, the Company obtained the ISO 9001 certification (2000 version). In 2011, the Company could boast the following certifications: ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OH SAS 18001, Quality, Safety, Environment (QSE). Premium Beauty News - On the technical side, the company is not lagging behind either? Joël Viry - Yes, you are right! The Company has developed an expertise in extrusion blow moulding and co-extrusion blow moulding (2 and 3 layers), injection stretch blow moulding and Injection blow moulding and in injection moulding and bi-injection moulding. The Company uses thermo-welded multilayer films to produce high performance airless packaging; it has a workshop dedicated to screen printing, hot stamping, pad printing, lacquering and metalizing. It has its own flat/assembly lines. It has a thorough expertise in product control procedures (three-dimensional measurements, statistical sampling check, metrology)... The staff is trained to self-control to deliver an ever higher quality matching customer requirements. In this constant quest for customer satisfaction, the continuous improvement of both our performances (Quality, Safety, Environment) and of our processes is paramount. Some workshops areas were created and materialized in the premises: for example the ATEX areas (ATmosphère EXplosive - i.e., environment with an explosive atmosphere), machine circulation areas, safety zones around machines... Problems related to the noise of machines are taken into account, such as, for example, the gradual transformation of extrusion blow moulding machines and blow-moulding machines into ""all-electric"" machines. PRP is committed to the environment. Every year a measurement of its carbon footprint is made, with a goal to reduce by 2% this balance every year. Waste is effectively sorted: for basic industrial waste but also production generated waste. Waste is re-used: crushed, recycled or resold. An energy action plan has been implemented and enables a significant reduction in energy consumption. The Company is also committed to research and is partnering in two projects closely related to the environment through its participation in the Plastipolis competitiveness cluster. Finally, each employee is made aware of environmental and sustainable development issues. Innovation at PRP does not only focus on the development of products, materials... It also concerns innovation in manufacturing processes or in production tools. To this end, the Company actually designs its own machines to meet a need, a specific request from a customer, thus resulting in greater efficiency and high quality finishing. Premium Beauty News - And resulting in fine achievements? Joël Viry - Quite true! PRP has undoubtedly pioneered the use in France of the injection stretch blow technology in PET bi orientation of thick layers. PRP innovated with the development of an airless system as early as 1993 with L'Oréal. The Company was singled out with several Oscars, including the IFEC Packaging Oscar for SEPHORA's Shower Gel Flask in 1998. I can also mention LANCÔME's Spot Corrector in 2009, the launch of 2-in-1 bottles and of over moulded bottles, not to mention our glass polymer bottles, our offer for standard airless bottles, and many innovative finishings and decorations, such as liquid metallisation and, more recently, DIOR's new PumpUp Mascara, the packaging for CHANEL's hand cream Crème Main. Premium Beauty News - What are the next steps for PRP? Joël Viry - I must stress on the fact that this acquisition of PRP also enabled us to optimize our industrial tool by integrating on the same site the SERMI Plast entities. This year alone, the turnover will exceed 16 million euros. We are investing at all levels, be it in the area of personnel (20 people were hired since April) or in the production tool. Next year, we will still be spending again tens of thousands of euros, especially to improve our online decorating process (screen printing).We will certainly also invest in 3D technology and, of course, in our fleet of blow moulding machines. And there are plenty of new markets are opening up to us... Makeup is one of them!"
Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie announces new eco-friendly glass coating,"On the occasion of the ADF-PCD tradeshow, to be held in Paris on January 31st and February 1st, 2018, the Perfumery and Cosmetics Business Unit of the Stölzle Glass Group will present ""Quali Glass Coat"", a new decoration process conceived within its decoration pole, Stölzle Masnières Decoration. ""This new technique allows us to achieve an array of new decorative effects with low environmental impact (compared with conventional lacquering) and greater mechanical resistance,"" announces the company in a release. The investments made by Stölzle Glass Group at the Masnières facility include an important environmental component, consistent with the group's strategy. ""It is our duty to take responsibility for the environmental impact that will affect future generations,"" explains Étienne Gruyez, managing director of Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie. Thus, since 2017, the electric power consumed by the Manières glass unit is entirely comes exclusively from French 100% renewable resources. An important step forward, considering that electricity represents 37% of the impact of glass production, which represents itself 70% of the impact of the whole Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie impact. Similarly, the impact of the extraction and transport of the materials used in glass production is kept low - 30% of the company's environmental impact, on average - thanks to the proximity of the raw material. Actually, sand is extracted 200 km from the factory and transported by boat. Eventually, in 2017, Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie has decreased its environmental impact by 17%. ""Over the last few years, the Stölzle Glass Group has been growing steadily. Linked with this growth and expansion of production capacity, Stölzle has invested heavily in the field of environmental protection. Our medium-term targets for 2020 and beyond is to continue to pursue this strategy,"" adds Johannes Schick, CEO of Stölzle Glass Group. Among the group's main targets: the qualification for ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certification, and the implementation of heat recovery systems in each factory to reduce the carbon footprint while improving energy and resource efficiency."
"The Pochet Group, on the rise!","Premium Beauty News - Reasoning by ""market"", you cover the entire beauty sector. But nothing is more different in terms of growth dynamics than the make-up, skincare and perfume categories... How do you manage to adapt? Tristan Farabet -Quite true, but this is why we constantly adapt our production tool to these constraints. As you now the huge advantage we have in our competitive environment is that we are able to offer an array of skills in the glass, plastic, metal and finishing areas. With us, customers find a one stop solution. As for our adaptation to these different dynamics and markets constraints, this is one of the reasons explaining the massive investments we are making at the moment, both industrial speaking and at the innovation level. We rely on a total envelope exceeding 200 million euros over five years. To stay ahead of the pack, our ambition, by 2023, is to become the best global high-end packaging company for perfumes and cosmetics, customers' preferred company for its inventiveness and the excellence of its multi-material expertise. Premium Beauty News - Regarding the make-up sector for example, how do you approach it and with what tools? Tristan Farabet - Picking make-up is indeed a good study case because it's by far the most dynamic sector at the moment, even if as far as sales a concerned, perfume remains our biggest activity. I must also say a word about skincare, which is impacting very positively our ""glass"" activity. Speaking of make-up, we are investing a lot in this area, whether in Brazil, China or Europe with our Qualipac unit. These investments are focused on the industrial toll but also on innovation. Hence, in Brazil, where make-up represents a significant part of the factory's activity, 20 million euros were injected into the construction of a brand-new building. This site brings together the entire Group's industrial activities and expertise in perfume and cosmetic packaging: plastic injection, blow moulding, lacquering, metallization, decoration and assembling. It spreads over 18,000 m², i.e., 58% extra surface area, with the possibility for a 50% additional extension. In the long term, the plant will house 80 injection machines, and will enable Pochet do Brasil to also double its metallization capacity with new lacquering and metallization lines. I can also mention China where investments are permanent to modernize our two production sites. Premium Beauty News - Investments and... innovations! Tristan Farabet - That's right! Innovation is permanent in this make-up niche thanks to the work of our teams and partners. For example, our ""In'pressive"" technology was used on nail polish bottles. As you know this technology allows sculpting the inner shape of the bottle with as much freedom as its outer shape. It enables to sculpt the colour, to magnify it in an innovative way, to make the nail polish even more desirable. The bottle truly carries emotion, and creates a real differentiation for brands, which is today essential in an ultra-competitive environment. We also announced, via Pochet do Brasil, the launch on the market of our latest innovation, Lip Up, a very technical lipstick mechanism free from silicone and polyoxymethylene (POM). Lip Up results from a global development among the French, American, and Brazilian R&D teams. The 24-cavity mould is made in France, but the mechanism is exclusively produced in Brazil on fully automated lines. Premium Beauty News - Industrial investments that concern all your areas of expertise? Tristan Farabet - Absolutely! We must not forget, for example, the 10 million euros invested in a new electroplating workshop, in one of our two production units, in Aurillac, France. The new building is home to a new production line. This line enables to increase the production capacity by 44%, to process new colours and to improve quality and working conditions. In addition, the new process implemented represents a very important advance in CSR: it will help remove hexavalent chromium from the new production line, to divide by twenty the concentration of chromium and nickel releases and to reduce by 10 to 15% energy consumption. Our efforts are just as important in the field of decoration. Since the past year, our three French decoration sites of Guimerville, Beaugency and Gamaches have been benefiting of a three-year investment plan of more than 17 million euros with the aim of making them the most efficient units available in the sector. This investment programme includes the optimization of the three sites, the rationalization of production flows, the equipment modernization, including new high-speed machines, and the automation of control operations as well as of loading and unloading operations. The whole modernization process was also designed with the aim to improve employees' working conditions as well as the Group's environmental footprint: calculation of the carbon footprint related to each operation, reduction of water consumption, etc. The modernization approach was the same finally for aluminium, a particularly appreciated material at the moment, with, this time, an envelope of 10 million euros, for the replacement of some of the equipment and the commissioning of new automated lines. Premium Beauty News - But glass remains by far your core business. And this material never stops surprising! Tristan Farabet - We like pushing the limits a little more every day! With ""Epure"", for example, a lightweight jar with thin walls, our engineers have definitely crossed another glass technology threshold. This technique enables both, up to 50% weight reduction, while sticking to luxury codes, particularly gloss. This is the proof that glass can be both luxurious and lightened, provided it is perfectly manufactured. The finest proofs of this glass/plastic/metal excellence in the way of pushing the limits are, for the most part, already present on the market. But I must say a word about ""Gabrielle"", Chanel's new women's perfume, which results from seven years of collaboration with our glass-making teams. It was quite a feat to combine to the extremely fine glass walls, perfect brightness and flawless execution with the same robustness as a in a traditional bottle. I could also say a word about ""Twilly"", the Hermès perfume bottle with its balanced glass distribution, its mastery and the finesse of its engraving. ""Girl of Now"" by Elie Saab, ""Duo"" by Armani, ""Scandal"" by J.P. Gaultier, ""One Essentiel"" by Dior, Givenchy's skincare ""Noir et Blanc"", without forgetting in the make-up niche, Dior's new lip stain, ""Rouge Dior Liquide"", ""Prisme Libre"" by Givenchy or ""Ligne Couture"" from Yves Saint."
Global market for bioplastics to grow by 20 percent,"""The global market for bioplastics is predicted to grow by 20 percent over the next five years. The transition to a low-carbon and circular economy, stronger policy support for the bioeconomy, and an increased consumer awareness for sustainable products and packaging are driving the expansion,"" said François de Bie, Chairman of European Bioplastics (EUBP), the European association representing the interests of the bioplastics industry along the entire value chain. ""Many of the pioneers in the industry are expanding their existing production capacities. They are responding to the increased demand for innovative and sustainable biopolymers by brands and consumers alike,"" added de Bie. Packaging remains the largest field of application for bioplastics with almost 60 percent (1.2 million tonnes) of the total bioplastics market in 2017. Despite the market growth predicted in the next five years, the farm land use share for bioplastics will remain around 0.02 percent. According to EUBP, this clearly shows that there is no competition between the renewable feedstock for food, feed, and the production of bioplastics. [1] The global bioplastics production capacity is set to increase from around 2.05 million tonnes in 2017 to approximately 2.44 million tonnes in 2022. Biopolymers such as PLA (polylactic acid) and PHAs (polyhydroxyalkanoates) are the main drivers of this growth. PHAs are a polymer family that has been in development for a while and that now finally enters the market at commercial scale, with production capacities estimated to triple in the next five years. These polyesters are 100 percent bio-based, biodegradable, and feature a wide array of physical and mechanical properties depending on their chemical composition. Production capacities of PLA are also predicted to grow by 50 percent by 2022 compared to 2017. PLA is a very versatile material that features excellent barrier properties and is available in high-performance PLA grades that are an ideal replacement for PS (polystyrene), PP (polypropylene), and ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) in more demanding applications. Bio-based, non-biodegradable plastics, including the drop-in solutions bio-based PE (polyethylene) and bio-based PET (polyethylene terephthalate), as well as bio-based PA (polyamides), currently make up for around 56 percent (1.2 million tonnes) of the global bioplastics production capacities. The production of bio-based PE is predicted to continue to grow as new capacities are planned to come online in Europe in the coming years. Intentions to increase production capacities for bio-based PET, however, have not been realised at the rate predicted in previous years. Instead, the focus has shifted to the development of PEF (polyethylene furanoate), a new polymer that is expected to enter the market in 2020. PEF is comparable to PET but 100 percent bio-based and is said to feature superior barrier and thermal properties, making it an ideal material for the packaging of drinks, food and non-food products. In 2022, bio-based PP is expected to enter the market on a commercial scale with a strong growth potential due to the widespread application of PP in a wide range of sectors. Brands participating in the European Bioplastics Conference outlined their efforts and initiatives to reduce their environmental footprint and the role of bioplastics in achieving these goals. Danone and Nestlé Waters, for instance, spoke about their combined efforts to introduce a 100 percent bio-based PET bottle by 2020 that uses second-generation ligno-cellulosic feedstock. ""We are witnessing a growing number of major brands switching from fossil-based to bio-based materials or to offer biodegradable solutions for their products in response to the increased consumer demand for more sustainable products and an overall change in awareness about the impacts of consumption choices on the environment,"" concluded de Bie."
Verescence continues the modernization of its flagship glass plant in France,"Verescence has unveiled last week its largest glass-melting furnace and presented the various improvements of its French flagship plant in Mers-Les-Bains. This investment is part of the ""Excellence 2018"" plan - a global investment plan of more than 100 million euros - and more specifically of the ""Mers 2018"" plan, dedicated to the glass production site in Mers-Les-Bains. Verescence has allocated a total budget of 30 million euros to renovate the plant of which 11 million euros of investment for the reconstruction of the furnace #6. With an output capacity of 700,000 bottles per day, the furnace is the group's most significant one as well as one of the world's largest. ""This furnace is dedicated to bottles made with Xtra Flint glass, a glass of an outstanding quality and highly appreciated by the high-end perfumery players for its brightness and transparency,"" said the French glassmaker in a release. The reconstruction of the glass-melting furnace #6 was an opportunity to reduce the site's environmental impact, with a reduction by 15% of energy consumption and 40% of CO2 emissions. These works were also a good opportunity to renovate the entire manufacturing area through various improvements both in terms of work efficiency and working conditions. The whole modernization process was also designed with the aim to improve the plant's amenities (social areas, offices…) some of which are still ongoing and offering more modern and comfortable work and rest areas for the employees. Eventually, it should be noted that Verescence, which operates four glass production sites in France, Spain, the United States, and Brazil, and five sites dedicated to finishing (two in France, one in Spain, one in the US, and another in Brazil), is the only glassmaker to have been certified in all its European plants according to the cosmetics Good Manufacturing Practices (ISO 22716:2007). In 2016, Verescence employed 2,950 people worldwide and achieved sales revenue of 330 million euros."
Mascaras: The new SIMP plant is up and running,"Premium Beauty News - From 2011 to 2017, quite a fast development with on top of it a doubling of your turnover! Alain Blondel - That's true! We lost no time! I must say that the market was favourable: the make-up sector is doing very well and the mascara niche even better! Today we manufacture some 160 million injected mascaras brushes a year and we have a global capacity for more than 300 million parts. It was essential to move to new, more suitable premises. This is now the case since a few weeks. SIMP's new Tigery site is established on a plot of 14,000 sqm on which was built a building of 6,500 sqm which is home to 28 moulding machines for brushes plus 22 presses and finition machines for the rubber parts. Amount invested: more than 2.5 million euros, complemented with the installation, at the end of the year, of two new moulding machines and a finishing line for rubber parts. Don't forget that we also have a subsidiary in Mexico with a 1,700 sqm factory and a capacity of 35 million pieces. Located in Aguascalientes, this factory is specialized in the production of rubber parts for the cosmetics industry, more specifically mascara wipers, and in the contract manufacturing of plastic and rubber parts and assembly operations for local markets. Premium Beauty News - What were the keys for this success? Alain Blondel - As I already explained in a previous interview for Premium Beauty News, innovation is central to our progress. We have now more than 30 patents in our portfolio. Plastic moulded mascara brushes and rubber wipers remain the Company's core business, but we are also diversifying our activities in the production of other types of applicators for make-up and skincare. Another key to our success: our strong international presence since we currently export more than 70% of our productions, mostly in Europe and North America. Premium Beauty News - You now belong to the HCP Group, who recently acquired the German Company, Rusi a mascara manufacturer. What level of independence and synergies to do you expect? Alain Blondel - There is no room for ambiguities towards our customers. Things were made clear at the time of our merger with the HCP Group: in spite of this change of ownership, we were to continue our activities with neither changes in our organization nor service interruption. We have continued and will continue to operate autonomously as part of the HCP Group. We continue to serve our customers, with no pressure, for necessarily combining packs and brushes. Meanwhile, we provide the HCP Group with significant manufacturing capabilities through complementary products, offering a broad range of packaging solutions that HCP proposes to major beauty brands. As for the takeover of Rusi, it enables the three entities (SIMP/Rusi/HCP) to provide a very broad range of specific products everywhere in the world, to demanding customers."
Lumson is gaining momentum everywhere,"Premium Beauty News - The news made the headlines a few weeks ago with the takeover of your Italian counterpart Leoplast! Matteo Moretti - This operation is part of a strategy that aims to offer our customers the advantages of a quality, reliable, European manufacturing platform capable of responding flexibly to the more and more stringent needs of our customers in terms of time to market. This acquisition will of course require significant investments in order to develop Leoplast's production capacity and ensure its growth on the lipstick market. This will enable us to enrich our portfolio of make-up products, with a consistent range of standard and customized lipsticks, available in different materials and finishes with the use of innovative decoration techniques. Premium Beauty News - Your Group has achieved quite a lot in the past seven years? Matteo Moretti - We can indeed say that we have become a leading Company in Europe in the design, production and marketing of primary packaging systems dedicated to the cosmetics and make-up market. We already have two production sites in Italy, now complemented by the two Leoplast sites. And it's not over since we are in the process of doubling our production of pumps in Italy. An investment which consists in increasing the current production area by 6,000 m², which will enable to produce some 150 million pumps per year. Premium Beauty News - You are also proposing a new decoration technique that you call the ""Pop Up Technique""! Matteo Moretti - The ""Pop Up"" digital printing technique is a printing method using a four-colour process technique: this allows obtaining an extremely wide range of decoration solutions, from a simple one colour printing up to multi-colour very complex ones, such as photographic images. Through Pop-Up (UV based and solvent) and the four colour process, we can obtain an unlimited scale of colours (with the only exception of shiny metalized colours like gold or silver) also on very dark surfaces. It is also possible to obtain a final embossed effect on the decoration, through a dedicated optional passage of thick clear finishing – that can be either glossy or matt. The effect is very nice both from the aesthetic point of view and to the touch. The embossed effect can be made on the whole decoration surface or only on some details of it, in order to focus attention on them. We can also apply the clear finishing directly on the plastics components, without other colours: in this case, the graphics results transparent and embossed, as if obtained by the mould. The standard thickness of the matt/glossy finishing is 0,1mm and can be increased on demand with further passages. This technique allows to perfectly reproducing the decoration on each component, without any variation in colour and thickness that are normally present in tradition decoration techniques (hot stamping, offset printing, silkscreen and pad printing…). The quality level of this technique is therefore very high. Premium Beauty News - And you also announced the launch of a new lipstick. Matteo Moretti - That's right! We are proud to announce the launch of the first Lipstick manufactured in our factory in Italy: ""Rouge"". This new lipstick is the result of the inimitable Italian design and its ultra-elegant shape makes it simply outstanding. The Lipstick Rouge can be customized with the new pop-up decoration technique and to create a complete lip set, it can be combined with the Rouge Lipgloss also manufactured by Lumson. Premium Beauty News - What other objectives do you have for the coming months? Matteo Moretti - We are working on doubling our sales force in the United States to be present both in the skincare and make-up packaging areas."
Smurfit Kappa: a smartly fitted Masterclass,"Fitments were put forward on the Smurfit Kappa stand at Luxe Pack Monaco. The corrugated board specialist (45,000 employees and 370 sites in 34 countries) relies on the experience in luxury fitments of their SIEMCO site based near Nantes, France, to support perfumes & cosmetics brands with their developments. ""We aim to help them maximize the customer experience, but also control costs and environmental impacts,"" explains Gérard Mathieu, Marketing & Innovation Director. To support this strategy, Smurfit Kappa has just developed an interactive digital tool intended to train customers and better determine their needs. Showcased as a world premiere at Luxe Pack Monaco, this ""Masterclass – Luxury Perfume Box Fitments"" is a concrete, entertaining way to boost brand image: customer experience maximization, cost reduction throughout the supply and manufacturing chain, production and logistics risk control, optimum product protection and presentation. And all this follows the principles of a sustainable development strategy. ""These Masterclasses help explore all possibilities,"" Gérard Mathieu emphasizes. ""They are both a training tool and an instrument to communicate with customers, and they help work on their needs in practical terms, following an approach consisting in calculating the overall cost."" Thanks to a powerful simulation tool, Smurfit Kappa can integrate many parameters to choose the best fitment solution. From a marketing angle, the impact of the choices on consumers' perception of the packaging volume, or on the coherence between the different capacities offered in the range can be instantaneously visualized. From the cost angle, beyond merely taking into account the costs of the material and fitment manufacturing, the cost of the final assembly, and even the environmental impact, can be integrated to the project. As regards the environmental impact, the tool developed by Smurfit Kappa makes it possible to take into account about ten eco-design criteria (material consumption, logistics flows, recycling, end-of-life, etc.). Other parameters involving complementary know-how offered by the Smurfit Kappa group may be added to take into account issues related to production, logistics, or distribution, in particular in e-commerce. This ""Masterclass – Luxury Perfume Fitments"" is accessible at the Experience Centre in Saint-Mandé, east of Paris. Smurfit Kappa has been welcoming customers since April 2016 for working sessions on their needs in packaging and PLV cardboard. To the group, which covers all segments in fields like consumer goods, agri-food, or luxury products, the idea is not only to showcase their broad offering, but also to better support their customers. ""The Experience Centre is much more than a mere showroom,"" Gérard Mathieu emphasizes. ""It makes it possible for us to have a real dialogue with brands, provide a real marketing service, and position ourselves as real packaging experts."" The Experience Centre is used to expose all Smurfit Kappa packaging solutions, but also to accelerate the development process, by reducing the number of models and pre-tests required. In terms of merchandising, pre-series and tests in stores are no longer necessary, thanks to a mini-store featuring a virtual reality area that provides 3D simulations of all product and packaging combinations possible. By giving access to most Smurfit Kappa's cross-cutting skills, and by combining a varied expertise, these new tools help support the group's customers in optimally boosting their brand image and reducing time-to-market. And all this includes sustainable development!"

Klocke banks on make-up and skincare,"Premium Beauty News - How would you describe the Klocke Group in a few words? Tanja Hefke - With a turnover of more than 270 million euros, more than 2,200 employees, 9 production sites, the Klocke Group, still owned by the Klocke family, offers clients over 50 years of a rich experience in the field of contract packaging. Today our Group proposes its expertise in the development, manufacture and packaging of vaccines (human and veterinary), pharmaceutical products and also in the packaging of cosmetic and food products. Premium Beauty News - And what about recent industrial investments? Tanja Hefke - significant investments currently concern the acquisition of a new modular production line offering more flexibility, improved production rates, higher capacities and evermore higher quality. Premium Beauty News - Which innovations do you consider as milestones in Klocke's track record these last few years in the field of thermoformed packaging and more particularly samples? Tanja Hefke - Over the past years significant changes have occurred in the area of monodose samples. First proposed as sales promotion items, they later evolved as sales merchandise for use as a nomadic product for people on the go or as practical unit dose treatments. Our latest innovations include the development of child resistant packs validated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the packaging of pest control products. Today Klocke offers a wide range of ""child resistant"" products. In the cosmetic field, thanks to the specific dosing systems developed by our engineers, we also know how to condition products containing beads or pearls. Premium Beauty News - What about the cosmetics market? Tanja Hefke - We have a strong positioning in the field of cosmetics and intend in the coming years to extend our positioning more specifically in the make-up and skincare markets. Premium Beauty News - Make-up and skincare are growth drivers for your Group. What are your assets in this area? Tanja Hefke - Thanks to our in-house technical department, we have constantly strived to improve thermoforming techniques (customization of the blister pack via thermoforming or embossing), dosing techniques (micro-dosing, filling of hot and/or cold forms in the same blister). We offer standard tools as well as specific tools developed internally, at the customer's request. Our long standing experience enables us to also offer a wide range of materials adapted to our clients' formulas. Depending on products' textures, we offer, breakable peelable or combined thermoformed blisters (peel-off and break-off opening on the same blister). Premium Beauty News - Most of your production is done in Germany. Do you plan expanding abroad through external growth? Tanja Hefke - Through our German sites, we serve both European markets and the rest of the world. We have a redundant machine park that allows us to react flexibly to our customers' requirements. Moreover, our manufacturing site in the United States allows us to serve the North American continent but also Latin America."

Luxury: How glass is reinventing itself,"The panel - chaired by Michel Fontaine, President of the Conseil National de l'Emballage and gathering representatives from Europe's main manufacturers - insisted on the challenging demands faced by luxury brands, which are more and more under pressure from an increasingly global and consumer-centric market. Indeed, according to the panel members, consumers no longer just passively buy a product, they want to know a lot more about the brand, how it is produced and what the company stands for. ""The European glass flaconnage sector is partnering with customers to help reduce products environmental footprint through packaging innovation e.g. glass lightweighting, carbon footprint evaluation, and resources efficiency throughequipment optimization,"" commented Isabelle Lallemant, Group Marketing and Innovation Director at Groupe Pochet. Embedded in the European cultural heritage this industry benefits from a strong and transparent corporate social identity that adds equity value to brands. ""Consumers trust glass for its authenticity as a packaging, and as an industry that's enrooted in the history of Europe,"" commented Simone Baratta, Prestige Perfume Business Unit Director of Bormioli Luigi. ""Innovation and sustainable production are genuinely integrated with this heritage."" With such strong traditions as a basis, the industry addresses new demands from brands and final consumers by heavily investing in the improvement of its processes and products. ""The industry is adapting to keep relevant with the digital Big Bang,"" declared Etienne Gruyez from Stölzle Masnières. ""Today for example we can provide new finished samples to our customers in less than 4 weeks thanks to a complete digitalization of the design phase. Digital printing allows us also to minimize errors and reduce costs."" Brands want to have ease of access to high quality packaging solutions that meet increasingly demanding design and technological requirements. ""This can only be achieved with the most advanced know how in glass production. Brands also want to have more environment friendly solutions. Today we are able to provide innovative measurement tools and products that help customers to reduce their environmental impact,"" according to Samuel Joachim, Group Innovation and Development Director in Verescence. The authenticity of glass material is also the unique and precious emotional touch point brands can count on. ""Emotion is the key driver in the conception of new flacons and we work tightly with customers to make sure the really fit with the product identity,"" ensured François Cheru, Sales Director of Verreries Brosse. Actually, unlike any other packaging materials, glass is loved by consumers. According to a recent consumer survey carried by the consumer platform Friends of Glass, 85% of European consumers recommend glass as packaging for their best loved products. ""It is the only material which naturally stirs emotion through its touch, feel, its unique design, its weight and makes products stand out on shelves"", says Virginia Elliott, Global Head of Sales for Heinz Glas Group, ""brands rely on glass to create consumer empathy, communicate the elegance and prestige of their products. We can now create this empathy also through digital applications which will allow consumers to own unique products""."
"Time to Market: Albéa launches My Flash, a new concept of modular moulds","Albéa has chosen to support its customers in this transition by transforming its industrial processes. To help them speed up their launches and product reorders, Albéa is implementing new ranges, procedures and equipment designed to reduce the time to market. The latest innovation to date is My Flash, a brand-new modular-mould technology qualified as ""revolutionary"" by the cosmetics packaging manufacturer. ""The My Flash modular mould technology allows packaging to be quickly and easily adapted at an incredibly competitive cost so it can be brought to market fast,"" explains the company in a release. The My Flash Technology is based on a double-mould system - an outer mould section (or ""parent mould"") and an inner mould section - and on a series of interchangeable cavities for small modifications. Based on the ""parent"" mould, My Flash lets brands create an infinite number of variations and as such produce new versions in large batches. Brands can even personalise their ranges in record time and at a reduced rate since changing the cavities is allows to slightly adapt the packaging appearance. And for more important packaging modifications, changing the inner section allows to reduce costs and delay by 30% compared to a full mould replacement. ""Variations in the look and shape, extensions to the range, limited editions, seasonal collections... My Flash allows you to satisfy consumers' insatiable need for new products,"" explains Albéa in a release. Actually, this technology is particularly suited to range extensions and to the creation of limited series. Albéa showcased My Flash at Luxe Pack Monaco. The technology was designed in the Group's mould shop in Shanghai and successfully launched for one of their customers at the Albéa Bottanuco (Italy) site, which is a European Centre of Excellence for applicators and mascara and lip-gloss packs. My Flash technology has allowed standardised lids to be customised: Rio for mascara and Paris-NewYork for lip gloss."
"""Innovation drives our development"", Hélène Marchand, Verescence","Premium Beauty News - Verescence is pursuing a transformation policy involving a new investment plan over three years. How is it taking shape? Hélène Marchand - This year, we rebuilt furnace number 6 on our glassmaking site of Mers-les-Bains, in the north of France. With a capacity of 130 tonnes of glass a day, it is our most important furnace. It is used on six production lines with a capacity of 700,000 bottles per day. This 11-million-euro investment required two months of work and helped us both reduce our energy consumption by 15% and make our CO2 emissions fall by more than 40%. This new furnace also makes it possible for us to keep improving quality, since we now have three furnaces able to produce extra-white glass. This reconstruction was also an opportunity to modernize the whole production area. Also in Mers-les-Bains, thanks to the space available after the pharmacy activity was moved elsewhere, we will be able to completely reorganize the site and enhance both working conditions and efficiency, in particular by bringing production services and engineering departments closer together. The other major investment area concerns our two finishing sites in France, in Abbeville and Écouché, both in northern France. All in all, about 20 million euros will be invested over the period 2016-2019, in particular in the creation of a new gluing line on the Écouché site, as well as in lacquering, screen printing, and more generally speaking, digital printing technologies. Premium Beauty News - It seems CSR is also at the core of Verescence's transformation strategy. Hélène Marchand - It is a central element. Our CSR policy is based on three lines of action. We aim to integrate our business to the local ecosystem, improve our products through eco-design, and give people priority. As for ecosystems, we are trying to build up relationships with near companies. 98% of our purchases are already made in France and 50% are even made within 300 kilometres from our sites. As regards our people, our first action is focused on our employees' security and on the prevention of industrial accidents. In addition, we are investing in training and know-how preservation. For example, we are partners with the Grand Musée du Parfum, which we have been supporting since the project was launched. On top of this, to promote diversity, we have created the Verescence au Féminin network for technical trades and women's leadership. We have recently organized an event with our women employees and customers that provided much richness and energy. As for the eco-design line of action, it focuses on product development and manufacturing from the angle of sustainability. Among others, the idea is to make glass lighter, recycle as much as possible, and use non-polluting products or techniques that prevent waste as part our different finishing processes. Lastly, and that is perfectly in line with our will to support customers and provide services of excellence, we have developed – in partnership with EVEA – a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool to help our customers compare the advantages and drawbacks of different development projects from an environmental standpoint. We present this impact analysis during the technical study phase. Premium Beauty News - In practice, how is this conveyed in terms of innovations? Hélène Marchand - Our policy has always involved highlighting innovations in line with market trends. At the 2017 Luxe Pack show, we will put forward our unbreakable glass technology to mirror the boom of glass in the makeup category. Also for makeup, we will showcase our bottle featuring an integrated glass squeegee – ideal for nail varnish and gloss. In addition, we will put the spotlight on the latest evolutions of our SCULPT'In technology, which makes it possible to create sophisticated shapes inside the bottles. As for sustainable development, we mainly focus on making glass lighter. Our challenge is to make perfect glass with very thin walls, while preserving solidity. We are launching a 50 ml jar that weighs 60 g (compared to usually 100 g for this capacity). Lastly, as far as finishing is concerned, we will showcase new COLOR'In decorations compatible with most juices (gold, stone, magma…), as well as very popular iridescent and metal effects for which we offer a great variety of techniques (holography, lacquering, hot stamping…). For high perfumery, we will expose a collection of exceptional glasses: a Verre Haute Joaillerie (High Jewellery Glass) obtained with a patented technique that consists in inlaying precious stones during the glass-forming phase, and a Verre Minéral (Mineral Glass) inspired from Murano glass, which offers coloured, unique volutes on the glass. And of course, we will showcase the emblematic new developments we contributed to, in particular Y, the new YSL Beauté men's perfume, the new Goldea The Roman Night women's fragrance by Bvlgari, the Dior Hydralife jar, and the YSL Beauté Encre de Peau foundation. We are creators. Innovation drives our development, whether in terms of products or processes and organization. Our ambitious development plan should help us consolidate this advantage to sublimate our customers' projects, always pushing the limits further with them."
"""New consumer expectations offer many opportunities for innovation"", Christophe Baudry, Metsä Board","Premium Beauty News - Let's start straight away with the future. To you, as a major packaging player, what main trends have been impacting the industry? Christophe Baudry - First, we need to take interest in megatrends, in particular major demographic changes. If you have a look at the UN and World Bank data, the number of inhabitants on our planet should reach 8.5 billion by 2030, and it will keep rising up to 11.2 billion in 2100. Above all, this population will get more and more urban. In 2050, 65% of the world's population will live in cities. So, as far as we are concerned, the conclusion is quite simple: there will be a strong increase in the needs for packaged products. In the meantime, an increasing number of consumers are worried about our planet. Together with global warming and air pollution, increased consumption, and plastic waste are the main preoccupations. Consumers have grown aware of the challenges to come and the need to use resources efficiently. And brand owners and retailers are already acting upon this. They have publicly undertaken to reduce and optimize the packaging they place on the market, and to use resources more efficiently, without compromising food safety, for example. Today, 96% of brand owners consider sustainable packaging important for their companies. [1] On top of this strong demand for sustainability, consumers are eager to live real experiences. They want to be both surprised and seduced, not only in traditional stores, but also when they do their shopping online. All studies come to this conclusion: packaging quality is a guarantee for repeated purchases! Premium Beauty News - What is your view on these trends? Christophe Baudry - These trends create both challenges and opportunities for the whole industry (paperboard manufacturers, converters, printers, and brands), and many challenges need to be met: we must optimise packaging, use lighter weight, renewable materials and provide brands with optimum support so they can reach their objectives, seduce demanding consumers, optimize packaging to adapt it to new customer needs… At Metsä Board, we work in close collaboration with our customers to fulfil these objectives, and we do think we have a great potential to meet tomorrow's challenges. As a sustainability pioneer, with our lightweight paperboard, we have shown the advantages of innovative practices that take into account environmental issues and fight climate change. Premium Beauty News - Does that mean Metsä Board's ""Better with Less"" concept is actually inspired from these major trends? Christophe Baudry - We decided to introduce our offering more clearly and logically, but we also did mean to highlight what has been guiding our innovation efforts for years: sustainability, product safety, and quality. To Metsä Board, the objective is to offer consumers a better experience, by working in collaboration with our customers to create modern, innovative, and well-thought-out packaging solutions that meet brands' and tomorrow's world's requirements. Both with the help of our lightweight materials as well as the supporting expert services for example in design. To clarify our offering, we have harmonized our product names, without changing their intrinsic quality: Carta Elega has become MetsäBoard Prime FBB, and Carta Solida is now called MetsäBoard Pro FBB Bright. All products are now find logically arranged under Metsä Board family. Premium Beauty News - The next Luxe Pack Monaco show will be an opportunity for you to make people get familiar with your unified offering! Christophe Baudry - Definitely. Our customers in different luxury segments will take advantage of the show to get to know our new branding. In addition, Luxe Pack Monaco will be an opportunity for us to put an emphasis on our latest innovation in design. With a smart design, we can create packaging that better address challenges related to sustainability and consumer seduction. That is actually what we mean with our ""Better with Less"" concept – better consumer experiences with less environmental impact. As an example, we will showcase a new Skincare Box at the show. Like the previous one, it will be made according to the principle of glue-free boxes, but I can already tell you it will be even more innovative than the version presented last year!"
Cosmetic packaging and pumps at the heart of Albéa's beauty 4.0. Strategy,"Premium Beauty News -With CRP and now Dispensing, you now have a foothold in all the niches of the ""Beauty"" sector in terms of packaging! Guillaume de Demandolx - That's right! We chose to combine these two activities because they have many customers in common and because we want to create a common in-house dynamic. In particular, like in Brazil or China where we have been offering complete solutions for a long time, we can now roll out the same programme in the U.S. and Europe where we are capable of producing complete containers, like for example the pump and the cap of a perfume bottle or a complete airless packaging. Premium Beauty News - The challenges imposed by Time to Market are the same. What are the Group's industrial priorities? Guillaume de Demandolx - Our strategy rests on many pillars. We invest heavily in automation to improve the flexibility and efficiency of our equipment. The motivation of our teams is such that in some of our sites, they have even developed their own in house robotic solutions! To help our clients accelerate their launches we even innovate in processes, like for example with our new modular mould technology, My Flash, engineered with the help of our integrated mould workshop in Shanghai and which will be presented at LuxePack Monaco. We also focus on products innovation, to enrich ever more our consistent range of standard packs, which was renamed ""Packaging Playground"", to encourage future brand designers to come and create their packagings in collaboration with our teams. We are also rethinking our industrial flows to offer production lead-times of less than 4 weeks for perfume and lotion pumps in our expertise centre of Le Tréport, France. We strive to simplify and accelerate our internal processes to improve customer experience, among many other things! In other words, in a fast changing market, we want to help each of our clients by providing them with the industrial and product solution the best suited to their specific needs. Tailor-made combinations! Premium Beauty News - Speaking of strong points, what are they by market and/or product line segments? Guillaume de Demandolx - Speaking of the perfume activity we recently decided to extend by more than 2,000 m², our French factory in Parigné-L'Evêque, which is specialized in the production of caps. This extension will lead to an increase in the production capacity of more than 20%. Because even though the perfume sector has currently a low overall growth rate, we are convinced that our clients appreciate the added value of our ""made in France"" expertise for the development of complex parts. Many of these caps are truly technically bluffing! And undoubtedly the synergies with our offering in perfume pumps also represents a strong asset. If we now take a look at the skincare market, it is indeed also not experiencing strong growth, but on the other hand it is much more stable than the ever changing make-up market! This allows us to build our investment plan properly. Hence, our French site in Simandre, specialized in caps, skincare jars and metallization, has equipped itself with new cutting edge, fully automated lines, which are, believe me, quite impressive. And this site is only a few kilometres from our Lacrost site, which has developed an expertise in pumps and airless systems. We can offer for example a whole line of containers, perfectly transparent packs – to highlight the innovative formulas they contain, mini-packs in line with the travel trend, a lot of different sizes and intermediate options and finally a complete service with matching closures! Premium Beauty News - Speaking again of stable segments, make-up is clearly on the opposite trend: unstable but fortunately strong growing. Hence a segment not easy to deal with for an industrial player like you? Guillaume de Demandolx - You are right! Ultra-dynamic, fast-moving, and therefore terribly exciting! Make-up accounts for more than half of the CRP-Dispensing activity. Because we have operations in a lot of countries, we can serve both so-called ""legacy"" and ""indie"" brands, which are experiencing absolutely staggering growth rates in some areas. The United States are up sharply, Europe is doing well, like Southeast Asia and particularly Indonesia and India. 2017 therefore promises to be quite a good year, even if we keep a low profile during each of our launches and every new turn of the market. New brands are emerging in the world, everywhere and constantly, it is fascinating but what a challenge industrially speaking! Simply imagine that you have to be able to produce small and medium batches, be flexible and all this with no or little visibility! Premium Beauty News - Regarding make-up, each product has its own specificities! Guillaume de Demandolx - What is essential in this niche is to have a capacity for innovation, operational discipline and responsiveness. Precisely, to be more reactive in the mascara segment where our customers recognize our leadership, we recently opened a Tips Studio in the United States. Located in our plant in Morristown, Tennessee, it is modelled after the Tips Studio of our site in Bottanuco, Italy. The Tips Studio gathers the Group's expertise in applicators: mascaras brushes (fibres and plastic), lip-gloss tips, eye-liners, eyebrows, etc. Innovative and efficient applicators, mass or prestige, standards or custom developed, based for some of them on patented proprietary technologies. As far as make-up cases are concerned, the only thing I can tell you is that we are working on new gestures. But we will showcase at LuxePack the latest addition to our Onyx family, the ""Onyx Two Way Cake"", a new standard compact with two-compartments. And I would like to stress on the fact that Onyx benefits from our digital printing system which allows printing on a case, to the unit, a picture taken a few minutes before. Resulting in an amazing effect! Premium Beauty News - This ""product overview"" would not be complete without speaking of another ""flagship"" product, lipstick! Guillaume de Demandolx - Indeed, lipstick is one of our featured products! The market is growing strongly at the moment. We produce hundreds of millions of them each year, which makes us one of the world leaders. But above all, we do everything to maintain that leading edge! To this end, we invested heavily in automated equipment in China last year, to increase performance and speed. The same was done in our French site of Plouhinec, now specialized in lipstick and who will celebrate its 40th anniversary this year. The plant is home to new equipment, ultra-fast robots, a new production line for our eco-designed and high-performance lipstick mechanism, Maestro... We produce lipstick tubes everywhere in the world, in Brazil, the United States, Europe, Indonesia. At LuxePack we will introduce new products with innovative designs and gestures, such as the very girly ""Bubble Kiss""... Premium Beauty News - You combine news, history and modernity! Guillaume de Demandolx - That's right! Many of our industrial sites are currently celebrating their 30, 40 or 50 years of existence. It is a source of pride, it is a duty to our territories and our communities, it is the sign of a long-standing expertise and know-how. An every day adaptation to the evolutions of our markets and customers. Today, fostered by the digital trend, driven by consumers, the Time to market trend is also disturbing our entire industry. We are investing heavily in technologies, skills, training and products. Because we must look ahead, beyond this turmoil, to build the future. And always, always, best serve each of our customers."
Stölzle Glass Group continues heavy investments in French glasswork in Masnières,"""For three years, Stölzle Glass Group has put all the necessary resources to achieve its ambitions for the future and will continue to invest,"" explains Étienne Gruyez, who is steering the rebirth of this site for Stölzle Glass Group, which will celebrate in 2018 its 200 years of glass production. Since 2013, when the Stölzle Glass Group acquired the Verreries de Masnières from Bormioli Rocco and after the adoption of drastic measures between 2013 and 2015, the Austrian group invested more than 14 million euros in state-of-the-art production and decoration tools with ambitious goals in terms of quality, reliability and flexibility. ""We have met this challenge,"" states Étienne Gruyez. ""While the site was suffering from a poor image, including among the staff, we have successfully restored trust with both our current 340 employees and our customers. Now, we can provide our customers with an unprecedented flexibility and with the restored reliability of our industrial equipment."" Actually, the company has undergone a full transformation. Stölzle Masnières Parfumerie now has its own mould workshop, equipped with brand new state-of-the-art equipment. With this new workshop, the company aims to be able to manufacture in-house the totality of its moulds in order to gain even more flexibility and speed with a reduced delay for the production of the samples. In 2016, a new combustion furnace was put into service and can now transform 75 tons of glass per day to produce 40 to 140 bottles per minute. In order to improve the company's agility, the production team has been working intensively to be able to process different sizes simultaneously when they are compatible. A technical performance that involves two different quality controls simultaneously. A huge training program has also been carried out so that all employees can achieve several tasks. Once again, the goal is to increase the site's agility. These investments have been fruitful since Stölzle Masnières Parfumerie has already achieved very good performance indicators with, for instance, an on-time and in-full (OTIF) delivery rate of 100% for new launches and of 98% for reassortments and a rate of customer complaints of less than 1%. But Stölzle's ambitions do not end there! New developments are planned for the coming years, including the reconstruction of a new furnace by 2020 and the destruction of the oldest in 2018. The glass plant will therefore be equipped with 4 to 5 additional production lines, which will enable the recruitment and training of 150 to 200 new employees. The decoration was not forgotten in the transformation of the company. Located just a few hundred meters from the glass factory, Stölzle Masnières Décroration, the decoration arm of the group's Perfumery and Cosmetics Business Unit, has also been the subject of major investments. Lacquering, silk-screening and hot stamping: the site offers most production techniques with a very wide range of colours. ""We can also work with materials such as enamels, semi-precious metals and even precious metals such as gold or platinum,"" says Étienne Gruyez. ""Here in Masnières, we most particularly focus on small quantities for high-end orders, but in permanent connection with our Polish site we can also realize decors for large quantities."" In Masnières too, the group strives to create innovative decorations that are beginning to make its reputation. ""Our inkjet and lacquering specialist works on 3D wood, concrete, soft touch effects... as well as on lenticular effects."" Stoëlzle Masnières announces for Christmas 2017 a new fragrance launch using one of its innovative inkjet techniques. To support its commercial development and its customers projects, Stölzle Masnières Parfumerie has appointed ex-Technicaps Nicolas Carron as its new Sales Director for Perfumery and Cosmetics. ""Nicolas has the perfect profile to meet the goals we have set ourselves. We want to continue to play a major role in the high-perfumery-cosmetics market,"" says Étienne Gruyez. ""With Franck Legrand, now responsible for innovation, and Nicolas Carron, our new sales manager, our aim is to double our production capacity,"" concludes the General Manager."
"""Produce"", the right choice for Quadpack!","Premium Beauty News - You're almost done! And the 100 million euro target in sales is within reach! The ""production"" shift was crucial! Tim Eaves - Indeed, we can only be satisfied with this change initiated five years ago. A turnaround that now opens on a straight line where we can accelerate our development. The ""manufacturing"" share now represents 17% of our overall turnover and 30% if we only take into account our activity in Europe. Next year, we intend to intensify our efforts in two directions, increase production but also strengthen our foothold in Asia and on the other side of the Atlantic (North and South America). Premium Beauty News - There seems to be a fundamental trend on the part of clients towards an increased sourcing in Europe rather than in Asia? Tim Eaves - You are right! And this is actually one of the reasons, but not the only one, why we will pursue our industrial integration. This ""come back"" to Europe, as we know, is mostly due to social reasons, to costs and a desire to be consistent with this strong concept of ""Time to Market"". And in the make-up niche for example, there is a real acceleration of requests for delivery times with a ten week maximum time frame. Our significant advantages are that we are close to our customers, extremely flexible, multi-material and multi-technology. Premium Beauty News - How is your activity spread today? Tim Eaves - Our activity in the perfume sector is of around 15%, 20% in make-up and 65% for skincare. You know that perfume is a fairly new activity for us (2015), but we are very satisfied with the results, especially thanks to our presence in wood-based products which are very popular. Of course, make-up is also growing strongly and we strive to offer new developments, particularly concerning applicators. As a matter of fact, we are extremely satisfied with the merger with the Collcap Company."

The strong ambitions of Medicos,"Premium Beauty News - 2017 is an important milestone with two acquisitions! Cédric Marmonier - In May and July 2017, we acquired successively the Bullier SAS Company based in Saint Brieuc and the Janvier Company based in Chassal. Janvier, a specialist in plastic injection and an expert in the packaging area, is today a major player in the fields of perfumery and cosmetics (skincare, make-up, healthcare and hygiene). To this end, the Company can rely on various technical tools with a design office, a mechanical mould, 28 injection moulding machines ranging from 35 to 1000 tonnes, mono and bi-material, a dust-free room. It is highly robotized. And, of course, it has its own decoration workshop (pad printing, screen printing and hot stamping machines). As for Bullier SAS, the company is a true master craftsman in its specialty, the making brushes mainly for the cosmetics sector. There are up to eight different stages to make a brush. This requires a very specific expertise and excellent workmanship. This expertise in manufacturing enables us to innovate in terms of materials used, the shape of brushes and or the shape of hair or fibres, on the type of handle or the ferrule... Quality = savoir-faire, savoir-faire = Bullier/Pinceaux Léonard. Today the Company works with the most renowned brands. It also specialises in small and medium series, from 100 to 1000 pieces. Premium Beauty News - Since your creation in 2002, you have prioritized an economic model focusing on strong value creation based on a number of key factors... Which ones? Cédric Marmonier - Let's say there are seven! – Technological expertise: plastic injection moulding, stretched glass and the manufacture of brushes. – A ""Lean and Quality"" approach used as a managerial lever, but also as a foundation to drive our processes and continuous improvement actions. – The Control over the value-added chain: design, industrialization, manufacturing, decoration and distribution. – A comprehensive product offering: standard and specific developments. – An industrial synergy: six production units organized into profit centres with a complementary expertise. – Operations in three markets that enrich one another with Good Manufacturing Practices. – The culture of a managing shareholder, which is synonymous with ambitious undertakings, rapid decision-making and long-term strategy. To summarize, it's all about being a leading European player in the design, co-design and manufacture of complete sub-units or parts, injected, shaped and assembled for the most demanding segments of health, fragrance-cosmetics and agro-food markets. Premium Beauty News - The first company to join the Group in 2002, RR Plastiques is the one you consider industrially as the most flexible and versatile among your Business Units... Cédric Marmonier - Over the last decade, RR Plastiques has naturally diversified itself by developing solutions for the Fragrance-Cosmetics market and combining its expertise in both technical and decorative parts. With forty years of technical excellence in medical devices, it has consolidated its position as a ""metering specialist"" (droppers) and by using specific materials (SEBS, EVA, Santoprene®, soft PVC, etc.). Four years later, we integrated Rovipharm by acquiring half of its capital to target specifically the Healthcare market. Its 8700 sqm of new buildings house an industrial tool, which is second to none in France and which perfectly meets the requirements of its market (3000 sqm of ISO 8 compliant, secured, sprinkled workshops). Also specialist in ""dosing"", it develops ""closure"" solutions and a number of medical devices. Its strong human, technical and financial resources have sustained the Company's double-digit growth since it was founded. In 2012, Mino Gaillard joined us and, after a period of major investment in production facilities, returned to sustained growth at the end of 2013. It is one of the few remaining independent French companies operating in the selective segment of the beauty market as a specialist in thick-walled mouldings in transparent materials (Surlyn®, PETG, PCTG, SMMA, SAN, etc.), which it injects, shapes and assembles on the production line for several prestigious clients who recognize its rare and long-standing expertise. Note that it is also the French specialist in mould blocks used in the cheese industry. Three years later in 2015, the Co.Ve Company based in Italy for over 50 years, joined us. As a specialist in stretched glass, the Company has made its mark on the history of the Group for two reasons since it has complemented our technological offer and materialized our strategic will to support abroad our main customers. Co.Ve, through its mastery of glass processing techniques (drawing, assembling and finishing), enriches our portfolio with a complete range of pipettes and vials, thus validating our overall supply strategy in the Healthcare and Beauty sectors. Premium Beauty News - And now what are the next steps? Cédric Marmonier - I remain in a development dynamic, passionate about trades and products that have made what the Group is today."
Metal: Axilone's model plant in Catalonia,"As a leading supplier on the premium beauty market for the skincare, makeup, and perfume segments, Axilone relies on a double industrial skill: metal drawing on the one hand, plastic injection on the other. The company has four industrial sites, including two dedicated to plastic injection in France (Auray and Guidel, in Brittany), one in China, mainly focused on the production of lipstick components, with a double metal and plastic expertise, and the Sant Pere de Torelló site in Spain specialized in metal drawing and anodizing. In 2016, Axilone achieved a 181 million euro turnover – makeup represents slightly more than half the global activity and the remainder is divided between skincare and perfume. Since 2014, the new Axilone Metal site in Sant Pere de Torelló has led to a strong rise in the production capacity of metal components, with both maximum agility and environmental preservation. ""Overall, the demand for metal parts is increasing, which corresponds to beauty brands willing to better highlight their packs, as well as to the fast animation of ranges by creating flakers and limited editions,"" explains Site Director David Gregorio. ""Meanwhile, we have observed shorter deadlines, reduced batch sizes, and an increasing need for services. This means more agility for us."" The 15,000 m2 plant was designed to be specialized in drawing, lamination, polishing, anodizing, and assembly operations. Strict quality controls are performed throughout the production process, and there is also a permanent procedure in place for quality improvement and accident and environmental risk prevention. ""All in all, 17 or 18 groups for continuous improvement work on all quality, environmental, and safety issues,"" David Gregorio explains. Similarly to the group's other plants, the site aims to reduce both waste and the duration of production cycles, as well as optimize the quality and level of qualification of the teams, following the principles of Lean Manufacturing. A large part of the process (70%, according to Axilone estimations) was automated, and the machine capacity is controlled in real time. As regards assembly – customer demand for this service keeps increasing – adjustable machines were designed following the principles of flexible automation to be used for different types of projects. Still, the plant has a clean room for the most high-end parts requiring manual assembly. Environmental commitment As for environmental protection, the new production unit in Sant Pere de Torelló benefits from a recent design. The site was built with panels offering good phonic and thermal isolation. It was decided to favour natural light both in the plant and offices. LED-based artificial lighting is automatically controlled and all waters are treated. As for heating and the use of hot water throughout the industrial process, the plant uses the energy of a neighbouring biomass-supplied plant. Production optimization also has a positive effect on the environmental footprint, in particular as it reduces the quantity of waste (it is all compacted and sold for recycling). Generally speaking, the site is compliant with the group's CSR policy (waste sorting and treatment, zero waste objective, solvent-free degreasing) and various progress projects were launched, for example with a view to accurately measure the carbon impact. This model plant provides Axilone with many advantages to meet new customer expectations, whether ""ever-stronger time-to-market requirements"", new services (decoration, assembly), or environmental concerns."
A new strategic line of action for Codipack,"Premium Beauty News - After thirty years, Codipack has initiated a real strategic shift. Why decide for a new orientation on perfumery? Michel Cochet - Since it was created in 1987, Codipack has worked as a sales agency for several perfume, skincare and makeup packaging manufacturers - mainly Spanish and Italian companies specialized in glass and plastics. I am not saying anything new if I tell you that this activity mainly depends on the uncertainties of your partners and how their strategy evolves. Some people ceased their activities, while others were purchased by more powerful groups or chose different development paths. It has been several years since we started thinking about a strategy that could make us less dependent on these fluctuations. Premium Beauty News - In practical terms, what is the new face of Codipack? Michel Cochet - We target cosmetics and perfume brands in search of innovation in terms of glass packaging sourced in Asia and Europe. We offer standard glass bottles with a unique design, standard and exclusive Zamak caps, as well as standard, exclusive plastic caps made by EUROCAP in the United Arab Emirates, our privileged partner since 2008. We also rely on our Taiwan-based buying agency. We already have a dozen references of exclusive Zamak caps. We have just launched three new designs of standard 100ml glass bottles, and we now offer about fifteen different shapes. As for plastic caps, we have developed almost 40 design references. We aim to launch several new products every year, both in terms of glass design and caps. We mainly target niche brands and all brands seeking small and medium quantities, from 3,000 to 5,000 units, but we're also able to serve all those looking for more important volumes. Our customers are mainly based in France, but we also work with Spain, Russia and the United-States. Beyond standard models, it is also possible to make personalized products. Lastly, we can take care of brands' whole perfume projects if they want us to, with a full-service offer including product design and manufacturing, from packaging to conditioning. We also manage relationships with all service providers, in Europe or Asia, until the finished products are delivered. Premium Beauty News - Can brands ask for these standard models to be personalized? Michel Cochet - Of course, that is essential! As regards glass, we can make several types of finishing ourselves: lacquering, hot stamping and serigraphy. In addition, we can take care of glass metallization at EUROCAP, in Dubai. As for our caps, there is a metallization and lacquering chain, as well as hot stamping and pad printing machines, also on our partner EUROCAP's site in Dubai. We offer an online service for creating personalized bottles on our website, codipack-france.com. Brands can assemble the bottles and caps of their choice, and to define decoration options."
HCP expands operations in Europe with the acquisition of Rusi Cosmetic,"The HCP Packaging Group, a global leader in the design, development and manufacture of primary packaging containers for the cosmetics, skincare and fragrance industries, has acquired a 100% stake in Rusi Cosmetic GmbH & Co. KG from Mr Klaus Sindel and other share-holders. The transaction was closed on August 31, 2017. Rusi is one of the leading European companies in the cosmetic packaging industry. Rusi develops, produces and markets complete cosmetic packaging for mascara, lipgloss, and eyeliner, among other lines. The company's headquarters and production site is located at Bechhofen (near Nuremberg), where there is a unique heritage in the segment of brush manufacturing. For this reason, Rusi has decades-long expertise in the production of different mascara brushes as well as, for example, brushes for make-up, eye shadow, blusher, etc. Rusi's product range extends to powder puffs, foam applicators, application systems for cosmetic pencils, eyebrow brush combs, and cream spatulas. Rusi will provide the core HCP manufacturing platform in Europe and its commercial and operations functions will be fully integrated into HCP. ""Rusi's President will report directly to HCP's Group President and CEO,"" explained HCP in a release, adding there will be no further management changes announced at this stage. ""HCP values the wide range of product category expertise that Rusi possesses which we intend to build on by investing in a significant plant expansion to better support our customers' regional sourcing objectives in Europe. In addition, with both SIMP and Rusi under one umbrella, HCP can offer very compelling full-pack mascara solutions locally"", said HCP President & CEO, Eddy Wu. SIMP will continue to operate as a separate organization to ensure its ability to serve other suppliers who purchase brushes from SIMP directly and, as far as Rusi is concerned, HCP's management has stressed that notwithstanding the change of ownership it is business as usual with no disruption of service due to this change. ""With Rusi joining the HCP family, we are realizing our dreams of being the world's leading mascara solution provider and at the same time moving toward much more regionally-localised manufacturing in each of the markets we serve,"" added Eddy Wu."
Digital printing: Quadpack gives a new dimension to wood packaging,"Photographic-quality decoration on wood is now a reality. To achieve the highest levels of quality using digital printing, Quadpack Impressions, the decorating plant of Quadpack Industries, has teamed up with Technotraf Wood Packaging, the group's unit dedicated to the production of wood packaging. The plant's decoration experts are experimenting new techniques and special inks to achieve decorative results on wooden components that inject real 'wow' factor to beauty packaging. ""We are always looking for new ways to make packaging stand out. New advances in digital printing technology are yielding amazing results. But it is our teamwork with our Quadpack colleagues that really makes the difference. Combine our expertise in printing with Technotraf's wood finishing know-how and the ideas of Quadpack's design team, and what you end up with is truly spectacular. That's when we effectively become a design factory,"" said Quadpack Impressions plant director David Tanyá. A selection of digitally-printed wooden components was unveiled at the latest edition of the MakeUp in Paris tradeshow and a series of new illustrations should be showcased at Luxe Pack Monaco in October. The new decoration techniques developed by Quadpack Impressions are not just for wood but for other materials as well, like plastic or glass. Furthermore, several additional effects can be achieved by applying traditional techniques such as hot-stamping. Quadpack Impressions is currently offering digital printing on flat or slightly irregular surfaces. However, the company announces that printing on cylindrical packs and tubes is planned for the future."
Solid bleached paperboard: the ambitions of Mosaico,"Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us more about the Burgo Group and its ""Mosaico"" entity? Antonio Appruzzese - The Mosaico entity encompasses all the specialties of the Burgo Group such as graphical and packaging boards as opposed to coated paper. The entity aims at boosting the marketing and sales of these specialties through an active network of specialized agents and distributors. Premium Beauty News - What does your paperboard grade offer mostly consists of, in the field of premium packaging? Antonio Appruzzese - These are solid bleached paperboards, one or two side coated as required. We take advantage of Burgo's expertise in coated papers for the graphics sector to offer a perfectly white and smooth substrate with exceptional printability. This paperboard, which is sold under the trade name ""Temptation"", is available in several finishes, including one that offers excellent properties for packaging design. Premium Beauty News - How do the Mosaico paperboard grades stand out from the crowd? Antonio Appruzzese - Many of the products from the Lugo mill are laminated in two or more plies so we can offer a very wide range of grammages up to 800 g/m². Furthermore, Temptation Rock and Silk come embossed if required and the range also includes an uncoated version branded as Temptation Velvet. Premium Beauty News - Is your European base an asset? Antonio Appruzzese - The Temptation products are produced in Lugo, near Vicenza, Italy. Most of the paperboard converting for premium packaging is done in France, Germany and northern Italy. This proximity should enable us to offer the quality of service required by folding box makers and specifiers. Premium Beauty News - You are targeting all segments in the luxury markets, and more particularly the Beauty sector? Antonio Appruzzese - We really intend to make inroads in this sector. We already have a long standing expertise in the graphics paper markets. The packaging sector seems more promising in terms of growth and opportunities.

For France, we have chosen the AGIPAP Agency to promote and sell the Temptation product range intended for premium packaging."
Saverglass aims to become a key player in perfumery glassware,"With four glass production sites, including three in France (Feuquières, about 120 km north of Paris, Le Havre, Normandy, and Arques, in the North of France), and one in Ras al-Khaimah, United Arab Emirates, Saverglass produces 600 million bottles and flasks per year. Born from the glassmaking tradition of the Bresle valley in the North of France, the French group founded in 1897 in Feuquières, in the region of Picardie, also owns three sites dedicated to decoration (Feuquières, Arques, and Coulommiers, France), and 17 sales subsidiaries around the world. ""As soon as the mid-1980s,"" explains Régis Maillet, Marketing Director, ""Saverglass focused the production activity on the high-end market to become the world's expert in the manufacturing and decoration of top-of-the-range bottles and flasks."" And that was a winning choice, as the turnover increased thirtyfold between 1985 and 2016. As from 1997, Saverglass dedicated production lines to perfumery and cosmetics, mainly in the Feuquières plant. ""Luxury codes are quite similar for perfumes and spirits,"" Régis Maillet emphasizes. To meet the industry's needs, as a complement to the production of specific luxury flasks, the glassmaker immediately chose to create ranges of high-end standard flasks with a heavy glass weight and original and elegant shapes easy to personalize. ""Paradoxically, this work on standard models is more difficult than on specific ones, since there is a lot to do with the design to find the right aesthetic balance for a flask. Then, the models are easily differentiated from each other with decoration,"" highlights Stéphane Marchand, Perfumery & Cosmetics Market Director. As soon as the mid-1980s, Saverglass started working with a pole of designers recruited to enhance the group's creativity in all covered sectors. Since then, the company has launched two to three new standard models per year and, with over 50 shapes, it has one of the widest ranges in the industry today. But above all, almost all standard models' stocks in the catalogue are managed and available any time, even small series: the minimum order is set at one palette for a standard model (one day is needed to produce a specific model). Obviously, personalization requires the many decoration technologies the group is specialized in (enamel or organic screen printing, four-colour printing, partial or complete coating, metallizing, hot stamping, satin finishing, sand blasting, decalcomania, accessorization, etc.). However, Saverglass also offers to launch the process as soon as the finish mould phase, which reduces the initial investment by 50%, compared to a specific model, while creating a glass shape like no other. The finish mould engraving or parison mould bottom adaptations can also directly act on the glass. Saverglass showcased their latest decoration creation made possible with these investments at the last Luxe Pack Monaco show: the patented Art & Touch technology, a new generation of decorations obtained with micro-etching to create endless refined designs. This technique can be combined with other decoration methods for extremely varied, astonishingly realistic effects. The only constraint is that it can only be applied on the bottle area that can be decorated, for now. To reinforce their creative decoration offering, Saverglass has also been working with a trends agency for two years to better define consumer profiles. ""We are now a real proactive force for our customers,"" explains Laurence Marécaux, Bottling Market Director. If they are real experts in decoration, Saverglass also excels in all glassmaking qualities highly prized in perfumery, including fire polishing. ""The diversification process we launched over twenty years ago in perfumes and cosmetics compelled us to adapt to other quality standards, which retrospectively helped us make progress in the field of spirits. Conversely, the expertise we gained in heavy glass weights for spirits was a significant advantage to introduce new standards in the field of perfumery,"" Régis Maillet adds. The extremely recent industrial park (the oldest furnace dates back to 2013) is managed in accordance with quality procedures in line with the obligations to be met by a multi-site company with customers all around the world. Already the first ISO 9001-certified glassmaker in 1981, Saverglass is also ISO 14001 (environmental management), OHSAS (occupational health and safety), ISO 22000 (food safety management), and ISO 22301-certified (business continuity management system). No definite plan is signed with any customer until it has been validated by all the people involved in the production process. Manual and automatic quality controls are carried out during all production phases (raw materials, hot glass, cold glass, palettes). By banking on high quality standard ranges, guaranteeing their stock availability, and massively investing in decoration, Saverglass found themselves in line with the new expectations of a market in search of reactivity and short series, without compromising on quality. In addition, the glassmaker managed to capitalize on their experience in spirits, without overlooking the specificities of the perfume-cosmetics industry: as Stéphane Marchand explains, ""from design to delivery, our perfume and cosmetics teams are dedicated to this industry and also come from them."" This positioning makes it possible for the company to both take part in major launches and serve young emerging brands. The bottles for the Jean Patou re-releases, the new specific model for niche brand Olfactive Studio, who used to choose one of the group's standard models, or Tacit, the latest Aesop fragrance, count among their latest iconic achievements."
Suppliers: Taiki stocks up new makeup ranges,"As for trends, the company introduced the third edition of the Taiki Beauty Lab summer box. This new version is in line with the seasonal collections presented every six months based on the main applicator trends of the year to come. Focused on the themes of holidays, relaxation, and aquatic sensations, this 2018 edition named Tropical Feeling features the 3D Sunset Brush for professional results. Its heart made of fibres provides ""perfect coverage"" from the middle, while the airier external crown simultaneously offers the blurry effect needed for the final application. The tool is specially designed to meet both makeup beginners' and artists' expectations, according to Taiki. The Tropical Feeling box also comprises the Sea & Sun Sponge, the latest TBS (Taiki Beauty Sponge) innovation, a sponge selectively flocked to make personalization possible (decorations or logos) with two different colours, a breast pocket of mattifying films which absorb the sebum, while preserving the skin's hydration for an intact makeup finish, a Taiki technology exclusively developed with 3M, and, lastly, moisturizing and refreshing aquatic patches for the eye contour. Similarly to many other market players, Taiki got rid of natural fibres with a new generation of accessories fitted with Tafre Premium, and now Tafre-G synthetic fibres. The letter G means 'Goat Hair' to refer to their similarity in terms of efficacy and flexibility with goat hair, very popular in cosmetics. This more ethical, but also gentler and cheaper solution than the premium version, imposes itself as an alternative in line with the Vegan trend. In addition, Taiki has developed three new sponge models for Cushion made of NBR (nitrile butadiene rubber), from the most natural finish to the highest coverage: the cushion TBS (Taiki Beauty Sponge), the Duo Sponge, with a thin Celbian skin for a very soft skin feel, and the Flocked Sponge, for a more covering result. By multiplying makeup result possibilities, Taiki covers all customer expectations. To keep up with the boom of the skincare mask demand, Taiki devised an offering of three standard soaked masks with a moisturizing, anti-wrinkle, and illuminating action, in collaboration with Strand Cosmetics Europe for formulation and filling. The anti-aging mask is available with a stretch synthetic material to reinforce the lifting effect, the two others with biodegradable, non-woven materials made of natural cotton fibres. These three versions can be purchased as a universal or personalized product. Ultimately, Taiki showcased a redesigned version of the Airless Twist distribution system. The idea is to offer a simpler, more accurate application and easier filling. The simplified piston mechanism leaves room for a greater capacity with the same volume. It is adapted to fluid or thicker formulas."
Cosmogen: A series of innovations,"Since 1982, Cosmogen's marketing and R&D teams continue to monitor the markets, trends and consumption habits to develop the packaging, brushes, applicators and gestures that will contribute to the performance of tomorrow's cosmetics. Beyond technical innovation [1] Attract One Expert offers a full care ritual, from the controlled release of the formula to its targeted application. Its Ø12mm removable ball, totally free of its movement, is the ally of anti-aging skin care products. When heated, it relaxes and facilitates the penetration of the formula. When chilled, it massages, decongests and stimulates the epidermis. Furthermore, with the exclusive decorative options offered by Cosmogen, Attract One Expert fits the needs of ultra-premium skin care products. Regarding the patented range of Tear Drop brushes made by Cosmogen, it has a specific ferrule, that provides the tuft with a tear drop shape, perfect for makeup application. The narrow side allows to apply the formula on the areas that are difficult to reach, such as the eye contour or the nose, while the rounded side covers the broader areas of the face. The dense and flat tuft allows to adjust the coverage for a professional and harmonious makeup. The whole range consists of six brushes: a foundation brush, a sculpting brush, a concealer brush, an eye brush, a lip brush and a fresh-faced brush especially made for aqueous foundation formulas. This soft and easy-to-use applicator was designed to apply creams, liquid and foam foundations. It has the advantage of not wasting product since it restores 100% of the formula, and requires therefore a small volume of formula. Its flexibility and easy handling make it possible to work the formula easily and to stretch it for a result without trace. The magnifying effect due to its transparent material also makes it possible to control the accuracy of the application. It fits all areas of the face and suits for sensitive skins. It is easy to clean up and dry instantly. It can also replace the sponge inside the cushion compact. Technical data: – Inner material: PU gel – Outer material: TPU film Cosmogen has designed these Brush Cleaning Pads to clean up brushes in depth, and to make them look like new before each next use. Main characteristics: – Patented expert design – Usable with all brushes: cream & powder – 4 individual pads for better efficiency and adaptability – Large surface of use more convenient for large tufts – Specific dry cleaning pad for powder brushes allowing a fast daily cleaning – Good grip – Ergonomic for traveling – Washable & long lasting Further to its aesthetic character, this brush is made of double length hair that was specially designed by the engineers of Cosmogen. Its easy grip inspires a new gesture that naturally subdues the contours of the face and reveals its shadow and light areas with natural and elegance. All Face Fan, as named by Michel Limongi, is ""the magic brush for complexion"", says Cosmogen. ""This double-sided fan was necessary to create an innovative make-up gesture to achieve all kinds of style: tanning, blush, strobing, contouring, natural complexion. According to me, this double-length hair brush is the perfect answer to the difficulties that all women encounter: pressing too much, taking too much color, and touch ups. The easy control of pressure provides a natural, easy, no-stain, and no-trace makeup,'' says Michel Limongi. Technical features: – Tuft: 2-length synthetic fibres – Handle: PS – Decoration: Silk Screening"
Aptar deciphers the fragrance gesture,"""At Aptar, we believe the usual spraying gesture should not be treated as ordinary. Perfumes should be appropriately presented,"" claims Sabine Bouillet-Lubot, Strategic Marketing Manager Fragrance at Aptar. ""And the industry would actually take advantage from the development of the sensorial aspect in this field."" That is how the ""Codex des gestuelles"" was born: this reference glossary is aimed to translate into words the evolution and mode of application of perfumes, as well as the possible solutions developed by Aptar, from the mere spraying gesture to the most sophisticated movements applied to alternative formulas. The survey mainly shows that the way we wear our perfume does not only depend on our culture or climate, but on many other parameters like personality, circumstances, or sex… The gesture of spraying perfume is, and will certainly remain the most common mode of application for the most pragmatic of us. Still, it can be modified in different ways. In the category of standard sprays, the Codex suggests the term ""débrumer"" (≈ demistify) to refer to the ""action of vigorously tapping one's face with perfume during the morning routine to get rid of the early sleepiness feeling."" This version is often very masculine, just like its alternative consisting in spraying the chest, since it conveys an idea of power. The gesture of ""ennuager"" (≈ clouding over), or transforming the fragrance into a cloud to better plunge into it and get wholly soaked with it, is more sophisticated. This gesture is used all over the world and often popular among women with a seductive profile, as well as men in Brazil and the Middle East, who like wearing a generous quantity of perfume. Aptar meets this ""long time spray"" expectation with the Precious solution for a mist effect and a diffusion that lasts three times longer than with a standard spray for the same perfume dose. It is available in several versions (Precious, Petite&Precious, Precious 140 mcl). There are several application and/or texture alternatives to the gesture of spraying a juice on an alcohol base. ""There is a demand for new experiences. To redynamize the market, we need to think of alternatives, of the diversity of gestures associated with formulas other than alcohol bases, like gels, oils, waxes, or even powders,"" Sabine Bouillet-Lubot explains. Among these alternatives, there is the touch application, which is translated as follows in the Codex: ""Déliprécis"" (≈ deliprecise) refers to someone who delicately targets specific points like the back of their ears, their necks, wrists, crooks of the elbows… Aptar contributed to developing this mode of application with Note, an applicator which gets automatically filled with perfume and lays down its content by capillary action when it comes in contact with the skin. Note is suitable for eaux de parfum, absolutes, and perfume concentrates, but it can also adapt to oily formulas. Other gestures have been observed, like the one called ""Smellfie"", which consists in smelling one's wrist soaked with perfume. As a result, Aptar devised a bulb atomizer, Eternelle, and other hand games, caresses, rubbing movements or gentle slaps, in particular in Brazil, with light waters. With this exclusive approach, Aptar aims to awaken senses about the fragrance gesture to convince brands of the importance of thinking about the packaging upstream the product creation. ""Brands are keen to hear about consumer expectations. They are starting to grow aware of this,"" Sabine Bouillet-Lubot concludes."

Aptar develops new pumps with a new DuPont Crastin PBT grade,"This collaboration involves the transition by Aptar to a new DuPont Crastin polybutylene terephthalate (PBT). Crastin is a high-performance and chemical resistant polymer that offers significant added-value to the technical process of developing cosmetics pumps for creams, foundations, and liquid make-up. Aptar found that one of the greatest benefits of using Crastin PBT for developing cosmetics pumps, compared to the PBT grade previously used, is its capacity to provide enhanced stability throughout the different cycles of the injection moulding process. Securing stability of the injection moulding process has been a challenge to the industry, especially as the parameters of the injection machine can shift over time. ""The dimensional and mechanical properties of Crastin PBT mitigates this problem. In a similar vein, Crastin PBT contributes to increased stability of the different pieces of the pump and ensures consistency of dimensions,"" explains DuPont in a release. According to DuPont, another advantage of Crastin PBT is that it allows for good surface finishes and resolves the problem of sink marks. Sink marks are the small dimples or grooves on plastic surfaces that occur when, for instance, the hold pressure time is insufficient, the temperature is too high or the cooling time too low. Using Crastin PBT also makes it easier to inject and fill a component and the part release from the tool. This is particularly useful when the pieces are complex with small cores and as the temperature control is challenging. Eventually, highlights DuPont, ""grades in the Crastin PBT portfolio meet all requirements of existing cosmetic and food regulations."" DuPont expanded its Crastin PBT portfolio to the cosmetics and personal care industry in 2016. ""We have an excellent on-going collaboration with Aptar, which is based on a shared philosophy of open-mindedness and combining competences. This has driven us in the right direction to solve a complex problem around the processibility and formation of their pumps,"" said Alexandra Fabbro - EMEA Marketing Development Leader Performance Materials, DuPont. ""DuPont took the time to sit down with us and really get to the bottom of the processing challenges we had been experiencing. This helped us to address the challenge at its core and to find an effective and sustainable solution. DuPont understands our challenges and has a hands-on philosophy. By pooling our strengths and resources we managed to find a formulation of Crastin that is tailored to our needs for 100%. This would not have been possible otherwise,"" said Thomas Clémence, Engineer in Materials at Aptar. DuPont will showcase the application of Crastin PBT for the creation of cosmetics pumps at the MakeUp in Paris Show on 22-23 June 2017."
The Pochet Group is massively investing in Brazil,"A new industrial site Named Mosaico, the new production site project represents a significant investment of 63 million Reals – about 20 million euros – which will make it easy for the group to double their production area in an environment that meets all social and environmental responsibility criteria. ""This new plant will gather the four current production sites, including that of Brazilian subsidiary Solev [a Pochet Group subsidiary specialized in high-end decorations on plastic and glass]. This way, we will maximize our services and reduce our costs,"" explains Gustavo Libanio, Managing Director of Pochet do Brasil. The site will feature all the group's industrial activities and know-how in terms of cosmetics packaging: plastic injection, blowing, lacquering, metallizing, and assembly. It will spread across 18,000 m2 – a 58% larger area –, with a possibility to add a 50% larger extension. In the long run, the plant will be able to comprise 80 injection machines: this way, Pochet do Brasil will also double their metallizing capacity, thanks to a new lacquering and metallizing line. Pochet plans to employ up to 1,200 workers, i.e., almost twice the current team, in optimum working, safety, and environmental protection conditions. Solar collectors, a new cooling tower with a closed circuit and speed control to save electricity and water, a rainwater recovery system, natural and LED lights, an air recycling system, automated resin distribution, a garden open to a family cooperative to supply the site's restaurant, a training programme for young people, a plastic waste recycling system devised by a designer of objects sold to the benefit of associations… the great number of pro-environmental and social initiatives make the Mosaico project a model of competitiveness and integration. ""We have defined accurate objectives like automation, the reduction of energy consumption, and material recycling,"" Gustavo Libanio asserts. The first machines will be installed starting from this summer, so that the whole site can be operational as soon as October 2017. In addition, Pochet do Brasil has just announced the launch of their latest innovation on the market, Lip Up, a very technical lipstick mechanism free from silicone and polyoxymethylene (POM). Lip Up results from a global development among the French, American, and Brazilian R&D teams. The 24-cavity mould was made in France, but the mechanism will be exclusively produced in Brazil on fully automated lines as soon as next August. At the request of their customers, the group has also developed a new standard line of six packaging references for mascaras, lipsticks, glosses, small and large boxes and compacts. The range reveals an uncluttered, both simple and sophisticated design that is easy to customize, depending on the requests made. ""These standard models provide our customers with a really affordable quality solution – that is important in the Brazilian context – while offering the possibility to be very sophisticated, depending on the decoration chosen,"" explains Meire Tescer, Sales Manager of Pochet do Brasil. Within an improving, but still uncertain economic context, Pochet do Brasil is optimistic about the Brazilian market's potential. Since Brazilian company IPEL, which is specialized in manufacturing makeup containers, was purchased in 2009, and the new team was deployed, Pochet do Brasil has multiplied their turnover twofold on the makeup activity and successfully developed on the Fragrance segment, with the manufacturing of caps. The investments achieved at a turning point in their development will help the group position themselves among the leaders in Brazil, and Latin America as a whole. ""In times of crisis, beauty is a safe investment. The cosmetics industry in Brazil is still doing well, and we are optimistic because the market is here. We have achieved 60 million Real of new business this year. There are signs of recovery, and our plant will be ready at the right moment,"" Gustavo Libanio reveals."
NastriTex banks on the packaging,"Premium Beauty News - Can you give us some details about this new project? Federico Mocchetti - ""Technology in solutions"" is based on 40 years' experience in studying and manufacturing textiles and other materials for the manufacturing of cosmetics. We have a profound knowledge of our clients' needs. They are companies that use constant innovation as an integral part of their processes, making them world leaders in their sectors. We know how to share this sense of perfection in the making of a cosmetic, considering the look and design of every piece and how cosmetics consumers evaluate, perceive and behave towards cosmetics. We know how important time to market reduction is for every innovation, just as it is important to strategically protect research information, whether it be for a contract manufacturer or for a brand company. What's more, our NastriTex Lab has benefited from large investments, for both technological resources and for the training of personnel, and will continue to do so in the future. Premium Beauty News - What support does the NastriTex Lab provide? Federico Mocchetti - The NastriTex Lab is our technical connection with the cosmetics world, carrying out tests for the pressing dry powders, the formation of wet products, stability tests, and so on. NastriTex Lab, though, is also the heart of research and development for new materials; investigating mass per unit, thickness, air, liquid and powder permeability, absorption capacity, and distension of materials, just to name a few of the parameters that can be evaluated, modified and innovated for any material. NastriTex Lab aims to become an integral part of its clients' innovation processes. What does this mean in practice and how can it be achieved? Becoming an integral part of a client's innovation means capturing the mood that inspires the creative process. But how? In order to take on such a role, technical expertise must be used in the service of innovation. Trials and tests are therefore not simply a way to measure the practical feasibility of innovation, but also a way to contribute to its creation. Premium Beauty News - What are your industrial projects for this year? And could you give us some of the more important figures concerning your company? Federico Mocchetti - The main key figures that we like to share are those that interest our clients, who number more than 150 and span 25 countries throughout the world: – 7 logistical bases on four continents; – 2 ongoing collaborations with internationally recognized research centers; – 3% of revenue invested in research; – 0.1% of client-reported non-compliance; – 12 days average time for the completion of orders; The goal that we have set for ourselves for this year is to develop new projects with packaging manufacturers. What will we tell our clients in Paris? Let's make up something new … together."
G. Pivaudran is making significant investments,"""And this is only the beginning,"" explained Marc Pivaudran, President, ""because we are planning to integrate a new anodizing line that will be operational by the end of 2018 or early 2019"". After going through a rough patch, the French firm based in Souillac, South-Western France, has found a new lease of life. ""We secured big contracts in our traditional sector,"" underlined the Head of Pivaudran, ""not only in the perfume sector, but also in make-up where we are taking part to the launch of a series of mascaras."" In recent years, the French Company will have consistently developed itself, not only in terms of industrial equipment and adaptation to new standards, but also in terms of staff training. ""Our training budget is eight to ten times higher than what the law imposes,"" highlighted Marc Pivaudran. ""Concerning environmental standards, we are at the forefront with the ISO 14001 Certification, acquired last October and we are also working hard on our energy saving upgrade"". In parallel, the company is focusing on new metal processing techniques to continue to innovate in the area of shapes and decoration options. The new 3000 m² building will mostly be home to new automatic assembly machines but also new storage areas."
"""Digital technologies are about to transform sampling campaigns,"" Xavier de Jarnac, Arcade Beauty","Premium Beauty News - Arcade Beauty is now defined as a partner for ""smart sampling solutions"". How do digital technologies impact your business? Xavier de Jarnac - Digital technologies are gradually penetrating the world of sampling and will soon revolutionize the way sampling campaigns are designed. Today, digital technologies represent 30% of brands' advertizing investments, and they are about to reach 40%. This medium has outmatched television in many countries. However, samples remain an essential step, because, at some point, consumers need to test products, in particular in the beauty industry. As a matter of fact, we aim to support our customers with distributing samples through a digital environment, in order to build a bridge between the online and offline worlds – between the virtual world and product testing. Premium Beauty News - What do you mean by ""smart solutions""? Xavier de Jarnac - The market is getting from mass sampling to a more targeted approach focused on consumers, who decide when and how to take interest in a brand and receive a sample. To meet this demand, we suggest two options: direct marketing (mail with a sample), or our sampling distributor, called The Kiosk. These ""solutions"" are perfectly adapted to digital technologies: I order a sample and receive it at home by mail, or collect it from a distributor close to my home. Premium Beauty News - It actually seems direct marketing is rebounding. Xavier de Jarnac - Indeed, the mail solution is an excellent complement to digital technologies, and it offers very attractive ROI. We support our customers in this field by suggesting a packaged offering: sample production in optimized formats for postal dispatch, distribution all around the world, thanks to partnerships with dispatchers in many countries, data collection, with the creation of mini-websites, analysis of campaign efficiency, etc. Premium Beauty News - Is it this intention to diversify your activities that explains your investment in the Adelpi connected terminal solution? Xavier de Jarnac - We aim to offer perfume and cosmetics brands new solutions to distribute samples and mini-products, while guaranteeing a fluid experience for final customers. It does explain our investment in Adelpi's connected distributor. Thanks to the The Kiosk solution, consumers can order their samples by creating an account online and collecting them from a close terminal with a mere identification code. The data collected by The Kiosk will help brands work on their relationships with consumers or prospects in the long term, and suggest adapted offers to them. The machine's touch screen also makes it possible to create a playful experience with the sample, especially since it can be connected to the 4G or WiFi networks available around. The Kiosk terminal distributes highly qualitative samples, creates an event around their distribution, and collects data on consumers. We will showcase it at the next Pack & Gift show on June 21-22, in Paris. Premium Beauty News - Much has also been said about connected samples. Xavier de Jarnac - That is the other major development path in this field. A sample is by definition a small surface with a reduced communication space, hence the temptation to offer a complementary experience online. The best-known solution is the QR Code, which works well in Asia. The other option is the visual recognition of the sample, but similarly to the QR Code, it requires a specific application. There are more and more possibilities, and we are actually developing our own solution. Right now, the connected sample solution is a minority. The challenge for us is to achieve maximum fluidity, because we can get excellent results. We keep testing and developing new solutions. There are real expectations from consumers, in particular in terms of exclusive advantages. Premium Beauty News - Will the targeting possibilities offered by digital technologies not reduce the number of samples per campaign? Xavier de Jarnac - Not necessarily. We are convinced the two systems can coexist: standard mass sampling to reach a great number of consumers, and a targeted offer to develop loyalty and product experiences. We will sell smarter samples and services. Our objective remains unchanged: promoting products through sample distribution. We are acquiring new skills beyond mass production and distribution to integrate data management. That is the actual challenge."
Cefapac: A plastic-free blister pack,"Blister packs are made to hang on a holder in the retail store. They often consist of a paperboard backing plus a moulded transparent plastic front section to display the product to the consumer. Bliste packs are one of the World's most widely used forms of packaging and they can now be made totally in paperboard. ""Our development work had two starting points - environmental impact and ease of opening,"" explains Eirik Faukland, the packaging veteran in charge of R&D at Moltzau. ""To get around the well-known problem of the extreme difficulty of opening plastic blister packs, the basic concept was to replace the plastic with paperboard. What's unique with the Cefapac solution is that we chose to replace all the traditional creases with perforations, which gives the desired openability."" However, when perforations replace creases, the risk is that they cannot protect the pack's contents well enough. The choice of which paperboard to use is therefore crucial. The Norwegian firm then turned to Iggesund's paperboard offer. ""Invercote's superior tear strength is a prerequisite for a good-quality pack,"" Faukland says. ""Both the strength and how it performs in the various stages of converting and filling are crucial."" The world-leading manufacturer of ski wax, Swix, is currently packing some of its waxes in Cefapac packs and plans to expand the trial. Other products in Cefapacs already on the market are dressings for wounds and some non-prescription medicines. Cefapac is suitable for many categories of products distributed in blisters, including cosmetics. Beyond the environmental benefits and the increased ease of use by consumers, Moltzau also claims that Cefapac's perforations have allowed the company's customers to increase the speed of their filling lines compared with those using creased packaging blanks. In the autumn of 2015 Cefapac was honoured with a Scandinavian packaging award, Scanstar, and in 2017 Cefapac will receive the WorldStar award from the World Packaging Organisation. As the pack's designer, Eirik Faukland has also been warmly praised by representatives of the Swedish and Norwegian Rheumatism Associations, which represent rheumatism sufferers. The associations actively encourage the packaging industry to develop more easily opened forms of packaging."
"""Better with less"": A new products and services offering by Metsä Board","As part of the launch Metsä Board renews the product names of its premium quality lightweight paperboards to bring the offering to customers in a clearer way. All the products are now found under one Metsä Board family divided into the Natural, Classic, Pro and Prime categories. The three service areas - Packaging Analysis & Design, Availability Services and Technical Expertise and R&D - complement the products and provide collaboration initiatives for joint development with customers to develop better and lighter packaging. While the company's offering and product names will be harmonised, the products and their specifications will remain unchanged. Through this initiative, named Better with Less, the company aims to improve consumer experience by creating, together with its customers, considered and innovative, renewable contemporary packaging solutions fitting brands and demands of the future world. ""Consumers expect better experiences with less environmental impact. Brand owners are looking at how to optimise packaging to be more sustainable, safer and lighter in weight. We are known for our pioneering expertise in high-quality, lightweight paperboards and are committed to improving further. Now with our unified product portfolio and targeted services we can provide even stronger support to our customers to jointly improve sustainability and efficiency of packaging throughout the value chain,"" says Mika Joukio, CEO of Metsä Board. The new brand imagery was created with a Stockholm based photographer and image maker Carl Kleiner. Kleiner is known for creating playful, high quality and eye-catching visuals for global companies such as Calvin Klein, Google, Hermès, H&M and Nike. The new brand visuals utilise the Metsä Group Moose symbol's angular forms to design a striking category colour coded visual. All the images were crafted by hand, through precise printing, cutting, layering of Metsä Board's board materials."
Coverpla strengthens its footprint in North America,"""Our offer perfectly matches with the needs of niche beauty and fragrance brands, which is the most dynamic segment both in Europe and North America,"" said Bruno Diépois, President of Coverpla. ""By standardizing the product offer, globalization has created the need for niche products, and now there is a real need for differentiation on all markets and this is true for both large and small businesses.""

Pochet du Courval: A historic glasswork in rapid transformation,"Each year, nearly 280 million bottles and jars for luxury perfumes and cosmetics are produced in the Pochet Group's factory in Guimerville, a few kilometres away from the company's historic site in Courval. The factory, which today brings together the manufacturing and decoration activities dedicated to perfume bottles and cosmetic jars, is undergoing major changes. Built in 1971, the plant is being completely refurbished as part of an investment plan that aims to transform it into a modern tool at the forefront of existing technologies and of current environmental requirements. The rebuilding of the glass-melting furnace #4 (15 million euros of investments), which was inaugurated at the beginning of 2015, was also the occasion of a real technological move forward, with a 45% reduction in energy consumption. The decoration unit is also undergoing full transformation. Actually, the group is investing more than 17 million euros over three years in the three Pochet du Courval decoration sites (Guimerville, Beaugency, Gamaches) with the aim of transforming them into the most efficient units of the sector by 2018. The three-year investment programme includes the optimization of the three sites, the rationalization of production flows, the equipment modernization, including new high-speed machines, and the automation of control operations as well as of loading and unloading operations. Furthermore, the whole modernization process has been designed with the aim to improve employers' working conditions as well as the group's environmental footprint: calculation of the carbon footprint related to each operation, reduction of water consumption by 45% between 2014 and 2016. The unique glass expertise the Pochet site in Guimerville offers luxury perfumery and beauty brands is the result of four centuries dedicated to glass making and innovations, with a recognized outstanding mastery of the interior and exterior glass shaping and of glass glow and purity. The company's excellence has its source in a perfect mastery of the execution and a systematic control of all the items: each bottle or pot being controlled individually by a machine, by a human or both. All production and finishing processes thus involve important skills issues and their transmission is an important competitive challenge for the Group. Pochet has therefore set up a plan to ensure the transmission and sharing of know-how as well as skill-building and increased commitment of employees. Initiated in Guimerville, this initiative aims to formalize key know-hows of the glassmaking process and should lay the foundation for the Pochet Academy, the place where the Group's multi-material know-how will be shared. The Pochet site in Guimerville also has a research and innovation office whose mission is to reinvent tomorrow's products from an aesthetic and functional point of view. Pochet aims to become the creative and inspiring partner of its clients and works with trend agencies to conduct studies with the aim to better understand new consumer expectations and define new uses."
Medicos Group takes over French manufacturer of cosmetic brushes Bullier,"The Medicos group (RR Plastiques, Rovipharm, Mino Gaillard, Co.Ve), specialized in plastic injection moulding, drawn glass and finishing for the health, beauty and food industries, is widening its range of products by entering the market of cosmetic and makeup brushes with the takeover of a majority share in the company Bullier. A family-run company now in its seventh generation, Bullier designs and produces high-quality brushes for professionals and for the general public, mostly for make-up and the fine arts. Bullier employs thirty employees and sells about 3 million brushes a year. In 2016, the company achieved a turnover of 3.4 million euros. The company, headquartered in Saint-Brieuc (Brittany), is headed and owned by Stéphanie Bullier, who will retain a minority stake. Bullier sells more than 3,000 brushes to make-up brands and to leading retailers of fine supplies. The company also offers a range of complementary products such as makeup pouches or displays for points of sales. Specific series and high-end items are made in France, in the company's workshops in Brittany. The company also sources some items in Asia, with the support of its purchasing office in China. Since taking over the company in 2012, Stéphanie Bullier has focused on developing and streamlining manufacturing to minimize delivery times. In addition, the company has increased its export sales to over 40% of its turnover. Within the Medicos Group, Bullier should benefit from its industrial expertise and increased financial resources. ""This combination will also allow the development of new products, whether for the distribution and application of skincare and make-up products or for the fine arts,"" Bullier said in a statement. In the short term, investments will be made in new industrial equipment to rapidly increase the company's production in France. In addition, the development of complementary products and the cross-referencing of customers should accelerate growth."
Stora Enso launches the upgraded version of Ensocoat,"Presented at Interpack 2017 (Düsseldorf, 04-10 May 2017), the upgraded Ensocoat by Stora Enso now comes with even better whiteness and shade ""to meet the most stringent demands of luxury brands and the graphical industry."" Stora Enso has developed the new Ensocoat based on customers' insights, optimizing the board's whiteness and brightness to provide a pleasing aesthetic experience. The aim was to produce a carton board with the best visual appearance in the market. ""Luxury packaging typically comes with sophisticated finishing treatments such as embossing, foil stamping and metallization, which require perfect smoothness, whiteness and folding properties from the substrate,"" explains Stora Enso. Ensocoat belongs to the category of SBS (solid bleached sulphate) board, which is the highest quality category in carton board. It is made entirely from renewable virgin fibre in a production process powered by bioenergy. ""Which makes the product a sustainable choice,"" highlights Stora Enso. Ensocoat is used for packaging consumer products such as cosmetics, perfumes, champagne, spirits and chocolate. It is also used in high-end graphical applications such as stationery, covers, cards and calendars. ""As our aim is to be the global benchmark in high-quality virgin-fibre carton board and the preferred partner to customers and brand owners in premium end-use segments, we have further developed our flagship board grade Ensocoat to fulfil this ambition,"" says Product Manager Eva Lundqvist at Stora Enso. At Interpack, paper artists, films and samples will showcase the upgraded Ensocoat's print results using different techniques. The slogan of the campaign is Commit to Luxury. Fashion designer Bea Szenfeld made Ensocoat move and multidisciplinary designer Jule Waibel made the most of the foldability of the board. For architect Charles Young, precision is everything, and photographer Paperboyo opened a totally new angle on the world with the help of Ensocoat. The new campaign is also visible on the website www.storaenso.com/ensocoat and on Instagram #committoluxury."
"Trussardi chooses Note, for a new fragrance gesture","The famous Italian brand Trussardi wanted a precious, delicate and sensual gesture for an application ""goccia a goccia"" (drop by drop) of their latest creations Trussardi Donna and Trussardi My Name. Trussardi Parfums has been convinced by Note, one of the latest innovations from Aptar Beauty + Home, which revives a timeless gesture, from an era when fragrance used to be applied to the skin with a delicate, simple finesse using a glass stopper. Note allows to simply and delicately apply the fragrance to the skin on the pulse points. ""In this respect, it is also in line with modern trends, where the consumer is in control, choosing the dose and where to apply it,"" explains Sabine Bouillet Lubot, Strategic Marketing Manager Fragrance at AptarGroup. The transparent applicator fills automatically after each use. The applicator has been tested with consumers in four countries (France, China, Brazil and China). According to Aptar, it has always been highly appreciated. ""Including in Brazil, where consumers are used to apply perfumes very generously, Note is perceived as very suitable for night applications."" At the time of its launch, Note had already seduced Dior, for the edition Touche de Parfum of their iconic line J'Adore. At the latest Luxe Pack tradeshow in Monaco, Aptar continued to focus on the intimate and sensual experience of Note, with Note Oil Edition, a special version for perfume oils, which was presented, in partnership with Firmenich, for the formulation, and the glass factory Verreries Brosse, using their Up&Down technology to realize a the bottle design. The Goccia a Goccia 50 ml editions of the Eau de Parfum Trussardi Donna and Trussardi My Name are available since March 2017."
Albéa: A series of innovative packaging solutions for the lips,"Albéa, through its Lipstick & Co innovation platform, has developed lipstick and lip pencil packaging and mechanisms to accompany brands in the Lip Art trend and its increasingly sophisticated lipstick formulations, high-coverage textures for a long-lasting finish and vibrant colours thanks to ultra-intense pigments. For opaque, long-lasting formulations, the Albéa Lipstick & Co experts have developed Maestro, an unguided high-tech mechanism. Maestro is an unguided lipstick mechanism (Ø 12.7mm) that is free from polyoxymethylene (POM), in accordance with REACH regulations. This packaging, which is also free from polypropylene, is compatible with a large range of formulations, particularly isododecane and isohexadecane-based formulations. ""With its patented 'flex-tab' technology for controlled, constant use, Maestro feels natural and comfortable to use. The mechanism also includes a one-twist opening system that makes it quicker and easier to refill,"" explains Albéa in a release. Maestro comes with Albéa's standard packaging for the LS164 lipstick, but can be used with any specific packaging. It is manufactured and assembled in France at the Albéa plant in Plouhinec, Brittany. For creamier, more comforting formulations, Albéa has presented Parisian Kiss, its new standard packaging featuring the Baystick lipstick mechanism. ""The guided Baystick mechanism (Ø 11.3 mm) has been specially designed for soft, creamy formulations. It ensures the bullet remains intact throughout the lipstick's life. It also gives a greater application surface than traditional mechanisms, for more comfortable use,"" highlights Albéa. Parisian Kiss' hermetic packaging protects the formulation. It is now available in a metallized plastic (ABS) or all-metal (aluminium) version. For very liquid formulations such as lip stains and foundations, Albéa is launching Twist Pen Cushion, a pen with a very soft sponge tip. ""Designed for any lip, eye or face application, the Twist Pen Cushion is easy to use. You can control how much you want to use by simply twisting the pen. Applied to the desired zone, the sponge reproduces the effect of applying with fingers, but is more hygienic,"" says Albéa. For a better customization, the sponge can be coloured and the tip can be in silicone or a brush, giving you more options."
Albéa Tips Studio unveils three new mascara and lipgloss designs,"The new designs focus on the eyes, with: Excess Lash, a range of fibre mascara brushes, and Beauty Flow, a new family of plastic mascara brushes. As far as lips are concerned, Albéa introduced Generous Gloss, a lipgloss range with a slim and flexible base. ""In 2017, mascara trends were all about extremes, with either excessively sophisticated makeup effects and easy gestures. The challenge we face is to respond quickly with increasingly high-performance applicators that are easy for women to use,"" explains Audrey Landon, Albéa Tips Studio Product Manager. Addressing these expectations, the Excess Lash range of fibre mascaras promises a false-lash look without false lashes. Thanks to an exclusive loose fibre formulation, the new range allows to thicken lashes and to make them longer by add extra texture. Eyes are made up in three stages: applying mascara with the Excess brush; applying the loose fibre formulation with the Ecstasy brush for a curled, XXL volume effect, or the Spice brush for an extreme volume effect; and another coat of mascara for a multidimensional result! On the other end of the scale, the plastic Beauty Flow mascara brushes are all about simplicity with four plastic brushes that are easy to use thanks to their ergonomic, intuitive shape. – Balance is a small brush that is easy to use and perfect for any lash type. Its large receptacle guarantees intense volume. – Escape gently grips lashes to extend and provide volume and length. – Essential and its large, easy to load receptacles provide extra volume. The rigid tip can get right into the corners of eyes making sure every lash is coated. – Tempo is a 2-in-1 brush with a double curved shape that coats and curls lashes. Volume plus curl guarantees a sophisticated result! Finally, Generous Gloss, a new range of lipglosses, includes Exquisite and Sensual. ""The applicator's slim, flexible base makes it extremely easy to use and gives lips better definition, and it's silky-soft for comfortable use,"" highlights Albéa. – Exquisite is pointed for precise application. – Sensual is round for better coverage in a single stroke. The Generous Gloss range is perfect for liquid, long-wear or translucent formulations."
"CapScent, the next generation samples","CapScent is a small very thin glass or plastic capsule, in which is placed the product, a capsule, which in turn is integrated in a larger flexible capsule that will release the texture it contains when slightly squeezed. The soft touch flexible envelope made of low density copolymer is completely waterproof and can take any imaginable shape. To experiment the discovery of a nail polish, for example, it is possible to add an application brush. Original, fun and quick to use, this patented solution meets growing demand for small single-dose formats, travel products, test samples or discovery set boxes. ""Many emerging brands or luxury brands like Estée Lauder rely on CapScent for the successful launch of a new product because the capsule illustrates novelty,"" emphasised Agnion Mpiere, creator of the product and President of Saabelis. The product is available in sizes ranging from 0.05 ml to 1.2 ml, from 5000 pieces at the price EUR 0.4 for the standard version."
Direct beauty marketing gets its second wind,"Established in the north of France, the birthplace of mail-order firms, D'Haussy has been an expert in the whole mailing production chain for companies for several decades, from printing to dispatching, database management, personalization, finishing, and shipping. The company employs almost 160 people and has two production sites in the cities of Lille and Strasbourg. ""We have always needed paper, it is a basic material. But today, paper can be relevantly used as a complement to the Internet,"" states Yann Normand, Marketing Director. D'Haussy is positioned as a partner of brands' multi-channel strategies. For example, the company develops a direct marketing campaign offering for personalized, targeted, connected sampling by post. ""Today, technologies allow for optimum personalization. As a result, we can act as the physical intermediary of brands' digital actions,"" explains Aldjia Guirous, Development Director. ""For example, based on the data collected on the Internet, we can carry out personalized sampling campaigns."" Flat-sized samples of skincare products or perfumes are sent to specifically named individuals according to a targeting strategy based on the criteria suggested on the sheets provided by customers. The mail bears a purchase code to get a discount or a QR Code, and it also makes the return rate mechanism more powerful than with classic blind distribution. ""Beyond the objective to directly reach consumers, we do aim to set up and enrich qualified databases,"" Yann Normand asserts. D'Haussy will exhibit at the next edition of the Pack & Gift show, which will be held in Paris, Porte de Versailles, next June 21-22. The company announces it will showcase ""innovative solutions to help cosmetics brands offer their customers a unique, enriched experience."""
Eurovetrocap plays its part actively in the surge of Italy's cosmetic packaging sector,"The Italian cosmetics packaging industry continues growing. While the Cosmoprof - Cosmopack tradeshow, which is held annually in Bologna, is celebrating its 50th anniversary, the Italian cosmetics industry remains driven by export sales. ""The experience of the Italian sector, developed over more than 50 years, and the important impetus provided by exports, keep all of us constantly streamlining our processes and company organization. This, in turn, enables us to better handle the increase in orders in parallel with the improvement of our company's performance. In our country, there are lots of choices within the cosmetics packaging sector, giving rise to competition and leading to positive effects appreciated by both customers and ourselves, with the inevitable consolidation of our country's image,"" explains Costantino Cattaneo, Communication Manager at Eurovetrocap. The Milan-based company recorded a double-digit growth in 2016 (+12%), with 43 million Euros in net sales. The launch of Euromakeup, a new division dedicated to makeup packaging, contrinuted to these good figures. ""Before formalizing the figures, however, we will wait until the end of 2017,"" adds Costantino Cattaneo. ""As far as Eurovetrocap is concerned, this significant increase in sales has not been derived solely from foreign demand for Italian products, but also from the significant improvement in quality we achieved over the last year,"" highlights Costantino. The questionnaires the company sends out every year to all of its customers have highlighted a notable increase in perceived quality, both for the products and for the service provided. ""The time-frames for customization have significantly decreased, as well as for commercial and technical support on all orders."" This year, Eurovetrocap will present a large array of new products at Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna. ""We know that our strength rests, above all, in a wide range, perhaps the widest available on the market, of both plastic and glass items and it is for this reason that we continue to invest in new moulds,"" says Costantino. The company has further expanded its range of bottles for the perfumery sector, with both smooth and rounded shapes, and with more angular and classic styles. Also, they have increased the range of wood accessories, with five new models, for both perfumery and skin care, further streamlining the ordering process to reduce production times and improve quality. For skin care we present a new oval line in heavy weight-glass in 30 and 50 ml versions, which can be coupled with the new 230mcl or 150 mcl low profile pump, and with the 50 ml glass jar. As far as plastic is concerned, Eurovetrocap has launched Alex, a new line in recycled amber-coloured PET for cosmeceutical products in 100, 200, 250 and 500 ml sizes, which can be combined with all of the company's standard cosmetics accessories, and from now on also available in black. In the airless category, Eurovetrocap will showcase the PAMELA line, a new version of the NINA line, but with a snap-on pump and cap assembly. With regard to sustainability, the company continues to work towards a decrease in the environmental impact of its packaging by offering products in recycled glass, Green PE, or recycled PE, PET and PP. ""The next challenge for us will be to help customers to evaluate the right strategy to better communicate the important added value of sustainability, and to satisfy an ever-growing demand,"" says Costantino Cattaneo. Eventually, in order to enlarge its service offering, Eurovetrocap recently acquired a state-of-the-art digital printer. ""Not only are four-color graphics possible, but also small and medium-sized productions requiring hundreds of parameters can be achieved without any extra set-up costs. This new method also offers durability comparable to traditional techniques, a concept previously unimaginable when we think of screen printing,"" highlights Costantino Cattaneo. In addition, the machine lends itself very well to the production of samples, which simulate perfectly the final effect of screen printing. In this way, the customer has the possibility to see in advance, within a very short time, the final effect of the design on the container without having to pay for printing equipment."
Stora Enso upgrades its flagship carton board for beauty and luxury markets,"The new Ensocoat,Stora Enso's luxury and graphical board, which was informally announced at the beginning of the year at the PCD tradeshow in Paris, will be launched officially at the Interpack 2017 packaging exhibition in Dusseldorf, Germany in May. According to the Finnish carton board maker, the new Ensocoat will provide even better whiteness and shade. ""This will contribute to excellent print results and high performance with all finishing treatments."" Stora Enso explains the upgrade was based on customers' insights. The other key features of the board, in particular the rigidity and stiffness that allow using lightweight grades, will remain in line with the market's expectations. ""As our aim is to be the global benchmark in high-quality virgin-fibre carton board and the preferred partner to customers and brand owners in premium end-use segments, we have further developed our flagship board grade Ensocoat to fulfil this ambition,"" says Product Manager Eva Lundqvist at Stora Enso. ""Luxury packaging typically involves embossing, foil stamping and other special effects that demand a lot from the material, its smoothness, whiteness and folding properties. With Ensocoat we want to offer our customers a carton board with the market's best visual appearance. Whiteness and brightness are the key technical properties, and we are also looking into whiteness as an aesthetic experience, based on insights gathered from our customers and stakeholders."" Stora Enso's Ensocoat belongs to the category of SBS (solid bleached sulphate) board, which is the highest quality category in carton board, fully made from pure virgin fibre. It is used worldwide for demanding graphical applications and luxury packaging for consumer products such as cosmetics, perfumes, champagne, spirits and chocolate. It is produced from responsibly sourced, certified raw materials, to match with the industry's quest for sustainability. The new board quality will be introduced in full scale at the Interpack 2017 packaging exhibition in Dusseldorf, Germany in May. In the meantime, Stora Enso will give a preview of the product in connection with the Lahti 2017 Ski World Championships in Finland."
Packaging Innovations continues to grow,"Premium Beauty News - How many exhibitors do you expect for this new edition? Gerry Sherwood - There will be over 350 leading suppliers from right across the packaging supply chain at the show this year. By bringing all of these organisations together under one roof, visitors will have unique access to the very latest packaging solutions, print finishes, innovative techniques and advancements in both technology and machinery. The show continues to be the biggest and most important event for the entire packaging supply chain. As well as more exhibitors, we're expecting more visitors this year and we will have more features than ever before, as well as the return of favourites such as the Packaging News Theatre, the Great Innovation Debate and many more. Premium Beauty News - What categories are growing faster than others? Gerry Sherwood - We're seeing much more interest from the printing sector which is relevant across all categories; partly because of the increased innovation in personalisation but also because packaging print is becoming increasingly attractive in relation to other forms of print. This year we will have big brands such as HP, Epson and Agfa at the show. Cosmetics and beauty continues to grow as an important category in the show. This year Quadpack will be sponsoring the VIP Lounge, raising their profile as well as their product range following their recent acquisition of Collcap. Baralan will be exhibiting their innovative new Otty 15 nail varnish bottle; Tinplate Products will have its range of beautiful cosmetics tins as well as product packaging for the male beauty market; and Vivid Laminating Technologies will be showcasing finishing processes that give the 'wow' factor the beauty and cosmetics sector is looking for. Premium Beauty News - What is the percentage of local vs international exhibitors? Gerry Sherwood - I would say that about 25% of our exhibitors come from outside the UK, which is really exciting for the show, bringing packaging innovation from all over the world to the NEC. The main area non-UK exhibitors come from is continental Europe, but we will also have exhibitors travelling from the US and Hong Kong to be part of the show. Premium Beauty News - What is the focus of this year's show? Gerry Sherwood - Innovation is, as always, at the heart of the show. Because we boast three co-located events it means that our focus has to be on innovation across the entire packaging supply chain. Packaging Innovations 2017 will focus on primary and secondary packaging, but it also has a dedicated area for sustainability, called Ecopack, and a dedicated area for contract manufacturers and packers, called. All very much worth a visit. Simultaneously, Empack 2017 will play host to suppliers with the latest technologies and machinery, whilst Label&Print 2017 will allow its visitors to explore the latest finishes and techniques available for printing, labelling and converting. Premium Beauty News - Are there any new developments for this year's show? Gerry Sherwood - Absolutely! We always make sure the show has something fresh to offer its visitors. We have 10% first time exhibitors this year, new theatres and some really exciting new interactive features. David Wiggins who works for DRW Packaging Consultants, will be hosting our brand-new Inclusivity Feature, where he'll be exploring the hidden potential of inclusive design in packaging. This is a really hot topic in the industry at the moment and a lot of companies are considering the impact their packaging design has on consumers. I think this session will make a lot of our visitors take stock of their designs, and how they can become more inclusive. We'll also be launching The Ideas Factory at the 2017 show which we are really excited about. Here, visitors will be able to learn from non-packaging based companies, like British Gas, Mintel and Cambridge University, to get fresh ideas and hopefully be inspired! This session will give visitors a unique opportunity to hear the newest techniques that are being used in other sectors, allowing them to see how they can be applied to the packaging industry. I really do think visitors are going to be spoilt for choice! For the first time at the event, Campden BRI will be hosting its very own 'mini theatre' which will be geared towards the food and drink industries. As part of this, sessions will cover a wide range of subjects including packaging defects and labelling updates, through to food contact materials and openability. Premium Beauty News - In your opinion, what are the main current packaging trends for the beauty market? Gerry Sherwood - This is a tough one because there are so many trends sweeping the industry at the moment. However, we're definitely seeing a rise in sustainable packaging due to consumer demands. Consumers are more conscientious than ever before and they really want to see that their favourite brands are producing environmentally friendly packaging. In fact, Ecopack, the show area that I mentioned earlier, will allow all those eco-conscious buyers to explore sustainable packaging solutions. Actually, many consumers are now leading more eco-conscious lifestyles and to reflect this the beauty industry has seen a surge in organic based products. These products are sparking a new trend in the industry with 'minimalist' packaging on the rise. This is a trend that I envisage continuing throughout 2017. Premium Beauty News - What is your strategy for the years to come in terms of exhibitors and visitors? Gerry Sherwood - For our visitors its simple, we want to continue to provide them with the most up to date technologies and solutions that will benefit their business. We are providing them with a platform to future proof their organisations and remain relevant in this ever-changing market. In order to do this, we need to attract industry leaders to share their latest knowledge and developments, whether that be through exhibiting or hosting a speaker slot. So, our strategy with exhibitors is to further expand our showfloor so that we remain the UK's leading packaging event. If you are a packaging professional, make sure that you are at Birmingham's NEC on 1 & 2 March 2017. It is going to be a cracker!"
"""Innovation conditions our existence"", Frédéric Montali, Bormioli Luigi","Premium Beauty News - How is Bormioli Luigi's business doing? Frédéric Montali - Our business is based on three pillars: mainly cosmetics perfumery, spirits, and tableware. We are one of the most prominent luxury perfumery suppliers, but we have also been development and innovation leaders since our R&D structure was created in 2009. Premium Beauty News - What is your corporate strategy? Frédéric Montali - The idea is to increase our turnover despite an ever more difficult context. The perfume industry is experiencing a slowdown, and on top of that, there is a stronger concentration of buyers from major groups, which means there are fewer customers and prices are declining and much more negotiated. This means we must find new growth drivers. Premium Beauty News - Where are these growth drivers? Frédéric Montali - Innovation above all. Today, it is a condition for living. Even if it is costly, it is necessary, as it helps us develop exclusive products. That is one of the reasons why the market needs us. Through innovation, we support our customers wherever the market leads them. Diversification also plays an important role. For example, we focus a lot on our cosmetics customers and, more generally speaking, we tend to work more and more in the spirits sector. Premium Beauty News - Innovation is at the core of your strategy. Could you give us a few examples? Frédéric Montali - It creates real dynamics within Bormioli Luigi: every year, we introduce an innovation or innovation evolution. Even if the market is slower, we maintain this pace. One of the best results we got with our research is most certainly the Inside innovation, our decorative coating applied inside the glass bottle. It has been a huge commercial success since it was launched in 2013. More recently, we presented Ecojars, a concept of ultra-light glass jars for which there is already a considerable demand. Premium Beauty News - Talking about this, is committing to sustainable development a crucial issue for you, involving concrete developments? What does it represent? Frédéric Montali - It has been a most significant issue over the past two or three years. Environmental responsibility has become essential to our customers. It is a condition for living on the market, and we do believe in it. One of the few levers we have left is to manage our industrial structure as best we can. For example, reducing energy consumption means both saving CO2 emissions and reducing costs. Everyone wins."
"The Zhanjiang factory, the cosmetic spearhead of SGD Asia Pacific","Premium Beauty News - In two years the Zhanjiang factory will celebrate its twentieth anniversary! SGD Asia Pacific - That's right! With its Zhanjiang plant and with its two sales offices in Shanghai and Guangzhou, SGD Asia-Pacific occupies a prime spot in these very fast developing markets. The glass bottles (flasks, jars, vials) are destined for four primary markets: pharmaceuticals, perfumery, cosmetics and food. It produces today some 350 million pieces a year! We can really say that SGD Asia-Pacific has succeeded in meeting European and American quality standards for glass bottles. The creation of a class 100000 clean room and the improvements made to the decorating shop enable the plant to meet the quality challenges requested by its customers. Let me recall the key dates of our presence in China. In 1998 this glass factory is bought by Saint Gobain in Zhanjiang. Between 2004 and 2005, a gradual transformation of the plant is operated for the cosmetics and perfumery markets. Still in 2005, the plant develops itself on the pharma segment and in particular that of medicinal oils. In 2007, two lines are dedicated to upscale perfumery market. In 2008, a clean environment room is created (""grey room"") for cold end and decoration. In 2010, a clean room is created (class 100 000) along with the full automation of production lines. The plant is certified ISO 9001, SA 8000 and ISO 15378. It also owns CFDA pharmaceutical licenses for type II and III glass. Since 2010, investments have been ongoing with, as a high point, the year 2015 when the site was completely transformed with the installation of a sixth production line and a third lacquering line, representing a total investment of $ 12 million. Premium Beauty News - You have real ambitions in the cosmetics segment! SGD Asia Pacific - Absolutely! After our significant investments in 2015, we can say that we have really turned a corner. Our growth rate exceeds 15% per year and our ambition to have one third of the Asian market of cosmetic glass packaging is within reach. The skincare segment is by far our first market in our cosmetic segment with more than 60% of our sales in this segment, followed by foundations and hair care. To be successful in these markets, you must be able to offer high level innovation to clients. This is what we do every day leveraging the expertise of our glass and decoration teams. Thanks to our technical mastery in the production and decoration of bottles and jars, we offer our clients the possibility to fully exercise their creativity, while remaining competitive. Our teams are also dedicated to providing very fast time to market deadlines, for the benefits of clients. Premium Beauty News - Could you please give us some examples of recently launched new products? SGD Asia Pacific - We have strong partnerships, resulting in frequent launches, with international leaders like Estee Lauder, P&G, L'Oreal, Jurlique and many Chinese brands who want to offer high quality level products to their clients also trust us."
Sustainable development: Pochet gets involved and invests in the future,"""As a family company since 1623, we obviously know what a long-term strategy is, and we have always had this will to firmly establish ourselves throughout the French territory. Sustainability is an integral part of our DNA,"" Tristan Farabet, General Manager of the Pochet Group, claims straight away. Indeed, few companies can boast such a history, though they may still be leaders in their businesses. ""The group has always given itself the means to remain a family company, by investing to preserve customers' trust,"" he continues. In addition, to keep their leadership, Pochet has defined themselves an ambition to be fulfilled by 2023: becoming ""the best global high-end packaging company for perfumery and beauty, and a favourite of customers for their inventiveness, the excellence of their multimaterial know-how, the commitment of their teams, and their CSR strategy."" As an integral part of the group's strategy, over the past few years, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has actually become a significant competitiveness parameter for major brands' suppliers. ""Sustainability challenges have gained ground in the luxury sector. There is a real customer expectation in this field."" Brands define themselves concrete, sometimes ambitious objectives, so they require important commitments from all players in the value chain. ""Today, certain customers have to put an end to their relationships with suppliers who do not make enough progress in terms of CSR. For us, it is an advantage, in particular compared to our competitors in low-cost countries,"" Tristan Farabet explains. The Pochet Group has based their CSR strategy on four pillars: preserving the planet (reduction of sites' and products' environmental footprint, circular economy), exchanging and cooperating with all stakeholders to ""make progress together"", respecting men and taking them into consideration, and, lastly, preserving and sharing know-how. All this should be done bearing in mind that to be sustainable, growth obviously needs to remain profitable, and the luxury sector involves a demand for excellence on which there can be no compromise. ""It is difficult to reconcile all these requirements, but it is possible and, as a matter of fact, it is essential,"" emphasizes Pierre Dehé, Corporate Social Responsibility Director of the group. ""Things change very fast, on all levels. For example, today, we know how to make wonderful products with less glass."" As regards environmental protection, the Pochet Group intends to focus on two areas: products and processes. ""The first step obviously involves measuring our impact,"" Pierre Dehé explains. Once criteria have been defined, reduction commitments are measured and determined for each site, with annual road maps. The group aims to reduce their water consumption by 70%, their CO2 emissions by 20%, and their Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) emissions by 50%. On the Qualipac Aluminium site in Saint-Saturnin-du-Limet, 40km south of Laval in the west of France, the group invested 4 million euros to build a wastewater treatment plant to treat all the anodizing baths, for releases 10 times lower than regulatory thresholds. Of course, environmental protection would be meaningless if it did not go hand in hand with consideration for men. That is why the group has undertaken to reach a zero accident objective on all its production sites and eradicate CMR products. ""We also aim to improve our processes,"" Pierre Dehé adds: to him, environmental protection can also be a way to improve performance. For example, on the Qualipac site in Aurillac, in central France, innovative electroplating processes will help remove hexavalent chromium from the process on a new production line – it should be operational by the end of 2017 – as well as divide the concentration of chromium and nickel releases by 20. The energy released by heating baths will also be recovered to reduce energy consumption by 10 to 15%. ""The environmental and social dimension is taken into account in all our investments."" Another key element in this CSR strategy is to preserve and share know-how. Half of the group's sites in France will be classified as an Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant (Living Heritage Company). ""We are at the meeting point of craftsmanship and the industry: we produce industrial quantities, but for very high quality products and prestigious brands,"" explains Tristan Farabet. As a matter of fact, 70% of the group's production lines undergo at least one adjustment every day, which requires much human handling. On the glassmaking site of Guimerville, in Normandy, the group has identified the key trades and skills to share know-how. The idea is not only to guarantee know-how durability, but also to make employees progress, level by level. In addition, it is an enhancement tool to visualize the aspects in which progress can be made and implement personalized training plans. The next step consists in setting up the Pochet Academy, an internal training programme for the whole group to support the staff in advancing in their careers and preserve their skills, while making sure they integrate new knowledge. The survey conducted every other year among the entire group's employees reveals real pride in their trade: over 70%. To the Pochet Group's leaders, this pride is a significant driver for staff commitment and the group's performance. CSR commitments can only strengthen them. Of course, the group's suppliers are associated with this strategy, as most of them must even undertake to comply with a charter on responsible purchases. More generally speaking, Pochet aims to work in collaboration with all their partners to make progress as regards these issues. Once a year, the group will hold working sessions with customers, suppliers, and NGOs to identify new avenues for progress. The first is scheduled for late 2017. As a family group and a flagship of the French industry, Pochet means to rely on their advantages to implement this new project based on customer satisfaction and staff commitment. ""Our employees themselves identify with these values and find them meaningful,"" Tristan Farabet concludes."
ADF&PCD: Participation on the rise for the 2017 edition,"With 6,445 visitors, an increase of 7.5% compared to last year's edition, the ADF&PCD tradeshow successfully moved to the Porte de Versailles exhibition centre. Thanks to the new venue the show also doubled the exhibition area (11,000 m2) and increased the number of exhibitors from 350 in 2016 to 420 this year. « In 2017, we broke all our records in terms of attendees and exhibitors. We wish to thank our exhibitors for the exclusive launches presented at the tradefair, the magnificent presentations, and in particular the stand designs prepared for this edition at a new venue.

Beauty brands urged to check UK's leading packaging event,"Beauty brands need to make their consumers' lives easier and reduce their environmental impact, whilst still producing aesthetically very pleasing, if not luxurious looking, products. The two-day event is designed to meet this tough agenda with a series of unmissable features providing visitors with invaluable opportunities to learn the latest trends and solutions from influential names in the packaging industry. If you're looking for packaging developments designed to engage consumers whilst meeting sustainability targets, be sure to visit the Ecopack Challenge. This Dragons' Den style session will feature four short-listed companies demonstrating their latest environmentally responsible packaging ideas to a panel of experts and show visitors. The winner will have the opportunity to develop their idea with Marks & Spencer. David Wiggins of DRW Packaging Consultants will host the new Inclusivity feature examining how packaging can be more inclusive at the design stage to better meet customers' needs and maximise appeal. Another highlight of the 2017 show is the Packaging Consultancy Clinic, which is being hosted by the Packaging Society. Here visitors can get one-to-one personalised advice on any aspect of their packaging. The show will also host five seminar theatres packed with over 30 hours of free-to-attend educational content. The sessions are being delivered by packaging industry leaders and big brands, from companies such as Amazon, GSK, Co-Op, Innocent Drinks, Lucozade Ribena Suntory and Coca-Cola. The sessions include two of the world's leading exponents of e-commerce packaging, Amazon's Brent Nelson, Senior Manager of WW Packaging, Sustainability, and Justine Mahler, Manager of WW Packaging, Sustainability, who will give visitors an insight into the best-in-class solutions when designing packaging for e-commerce. Plus, Innocent Drinks Sustainability Manager, Simon Reid, will present 'Leaving things better than we find them'. During his talk, Simon will look at how Innocent ensures its supply chain meets environmental and social minimum standards and is constantly striving to reduce waste and the amount of energy and water it uses. In addition to this there will be a full show floor featuring hundreds of exhibitors and all the latest innovations. From new pack concepts, finishes, materials, caps, closures and inks through to tamper evident seals, plus design and contract packing services. Registration is now open.

Texen and E Ink bring first personalized digital packaging for cosmetics,"In partnership with E-Ink, Texen presented an interactive solution based on the use of a miniature screen with no battery, using near field communication (NFC). The smart packaging design concept combines E Ink's low power, high contrast paper-like display technology with Texen's packaging expertise to create customizable packaging displays for makeup compacts, perfume bottles and other cosmetic packaging. The E Ink display, powered purely by near field communications (NFC), can be updated by a smartphone that generates radio frequency signals carrying both the information and energy needed to update the display. Once an image is switched, the display will continue to show the information with no further power input required. This opens wide possibilities for personalization or for late adaptation to labelling requirements. ""With the rise of beauty on a micro scale, our partnership with E Ink looks to enable our cosmetic customers to be the first to offer customizable digital packaging,"" said Stéphane Lesprit, TexenLab Innovation Manager. ""With E Ink's battery-free, thin, lightweight and durable technology, brands could enhance their packaging without having to alter the shape and design of their packaging, truly making this solution a first for the industry."" Thanks to another partnership with several plastic suppliers, Texen also presented a range of applicators and sponges that target a new sensorial experience in makeup application. Rather than materials like ceramic and silicone, Texen has chosen thermoplastic for its flexibility and silky texture. Applicators and sponges respectively designed for brow, lip or face makeup use the latest technologies including the Mucell process. The aim of this process is to achieve optimal results in terms of comfort, flexibility, hygiene and the perfect restitution of the formula without waste. Eventually, Texen bets on additive manufacturing technology in order to broaden the range of design possibilities available, and thus makeup effects, which also allows it to reduce lead times. ""Without the need for moulds and using easy-to-create prototypes, brands are the winners both in terms of budget and time-to-market,"" explains the company. ""3D Printing allows differentiation via specific animations and short series."" One example previewed is Texen's daring new mascara brushes with their striking visual impact. "" 3D printing is no longer limited to the production of prototype s, the technology makes it possible to produce millions of parts without any specific tools,"" explains Daniel Saclier, Head of Business Development & Full Service at Texen. ""All these innovations demonstrate our ability to anticipate the needs of consumers, to think product before thinking packaging,"" he concludes."
"Silgan buys WestRock's Home, Health and Beauty dispensers unit for about $1 billion","Formerly known as Calmar Inc., WestRock's Home, Health and Beauty business generated sales of approximately $566 million for the fiscal year-ended September 30, 2016. Calmar was purchased by MeadWestvaco in 2006. Then MeadWestvaco and RockTenn merged in 2015 to form WestRock and the new company ultimately decided to divest the business. ""We have a constant strategic focus at WestRock on aligning our portfolio and resources around our core paper and packaging solutions businesses, and the sale of our Home, Health and Beauty business is the next step in this process,"" said Steve Voorhees, chief executive officer of WestRock. For Silgan, a leading manufacturer of rigid packaging for shelf-stable food and other consumer goods products, this acquisition is an opportunity to expand into a new area of business. ""This acquisition significantly enhances the scope and breadth of our market leading closure franchise by bringing new capabilities in the highly engineered dispensing systems category,"" said Tony Allott, Silgan's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""This business has a long history as a differentiated packaging franchise with deep customer relationships, a clear focus on the needs of its customers and markets and a strong track record for product innovation to meet these needs,"" continued Mr. Allott. Silgan achieved annual net sales of approximately $3.8 billion in 2015 through 88 manufacturing facilities in North and South America, Europe and Asia. The company expects to cut costs by $15 million within two years of making the purchase through improved manufacturing efficiencies, procurement savings and reductions in general and administrative expenses. The two companies expect to close the transaction, subject to necessary government and regulatory approvals, in the quarter ending March 31, 2017."
"Quadpack, targeting 100 million euros in sales in 2017!","Premium Beauty news - Your Company has done remarkably well! Tim Eaves - There is always a lot to do, but it is true that we can be proud of the company's track record in recent years. And the EUR 100 million target in sales is within reach in 2017. We are present in France, Spain, Italy, the UK, Germany, but also in the US, Hong Kong, China, Australia, Korea and Taiwan. We have become ""the"" specialist in the packaging of skincare, make-up and perfumery products. In just three years, we have made a huge shift towards the production of plastic-based and wood-based packaging in Europe by acquiring several companies, particularly in Spain. So much so that this specific ""manufacturing"" part already accounts for 20% of our business and that it will soon reach between 35% - 40%. And we will move on with this acquisition strategy. If you remember in 2003, our turnover was of 2.7 million euros and it was of 61 million euros in 2015. We haven't ended our 2016 financial year yet, but turnover is estimated at 72.5 million euros. The goal is to prepare the Group for an IPO, which is expected to take place in the next two years. As a preliminary measure, Quadpack Industries was first listed with a private placement on the Marché Libre, which is part of the EuroNext stock exchange, on April 21, 2016. Premium Beauty news - A ""production"" part where you recently invested and a ""distribution"" part where you have strengthened your presence! Tim Eaves - Absolutely, investments projects which were recently covered by Premium Beauty News. In Castellbisbal, Spain, we invested in a new high-end by injection moulding line at Quadpack Plastics (ex Rinaplast) and in Torelló, Spain, in a new emissions control system at Technotraf. As you know the Quadpack Plastics factory now boasts 12 injection-moulding machines, five screen-printing machines, two UV screen-printing machines, one pad printing machine and five assembly lines. As for the ""Distribution"" part, we recently announced the merger of our activities with the British packaging supplier Collcap Group Ltd. Collcap brings its expertise in glass and plastic tubes and a well established sourcing activity in Asia and Quadpack, its global infrastructure in sales, marketing, purchases and logistics, as well as a European manufacturing division. This merger is a continuation of the external growth strategy started in 2013 with the acquisition of Technotraf a wood packaging factory, the first step in the Group's production activity, completed a year later by the acquisition of Krampak, rebranded Quadpack Impressions."
E-commerce and packaging: trying to square the circle,"In the world of high-end cosmetics and perfumes, the shopping experience online should be similar to that in store. ""An increasing number of our customers also sell online now, and they want to be able to adapt online selling packaging to their own image. Demand is growing stronger and stronger, so we should think about it properly,"" explains Stéphanie Havard, Project Manager at Procos, an expert in luxury packaging. ""They have also found out that, the more upgraded the packaging, the less complaints they receive. This helps really qualify the products sold, better promote the brand, and create a real surprise, a real added value,"" she adds. Expectations should be met as soon as the product is shipped, according to DS Smith, a packaging specialist that has developed shipping packs for cosmetics brands perfectly adapted to online shopping requirements. ""We design personalized solutions for a booming market,"" explains Béatrice Charrier, Marketing Director at DS Smith Consumer France. Shipping packaging should meet several requirements: preserve its main role of protecting the product against degradation and theft, not make it the object of people's desire on the outside, and promote the brand's image with a wow effect inside. The whole should be designed bearing in mind cost, weights, and environmental impact constraints. ""We need to work on the discovery effect, while maintaining the addressee's anonymity,"" Béatrice Charrier highlights. ""We are asked to adapt the size to the item and its weight, work on the cardboard grammage, but above all, make a sophisticated decoration, since the most important is to preserve the brand's codes,"" Stéphanie Havard confirms. With the concept of upcycling, we can go even farther, offering a second life to the packaging. This idea was recently developed and implemented for a famous coffee capsule supplier, as DS Smith created a shipping packaging in the form of a box fitted with drawers, for it to serve other uses. To help their customers think this through, Procos came to the last Pack & Gift show to showcase different concepts of boxes adapted to perfume or makeup products sold online. The first perfume shipping box developed with a sophisticated decoration directly opens on the case, which is placed in the middle of fresh flowers. ""The idea is to recreate the same bond as what is experienced in-store, with a floral atmosphere and an olfactory dimension,"" Stéphanie Havard explains. The second box, a real makeup kit, looks like an object to be kept, with mini-drawers and a mirror. ""With this idea, we can also stimulate additional selling, for example by imagining that the mirror is a personalized LCD screen programmed to make the customer discover products complementary to those they have just bought,"" Stéphanie Havard adds. Guaranteeing consumers the closeness they enjoy during their shopping experience in-store, with less weight and for a cheaper cost, while satisfying industrial constraints: the role of packaging in the boom of e-commerce has yet to be proven."
In'pressive Nails: A new dimension for nail polish,"The In'pressive Nails project is the result of an alliance between the design agency Centdegrés, the high-end glass manufacturer Pochet, the nail polish expert Fiabila and trends agency BeautyStreams, who joined their forces to create this innovative object. Based on the In'pressive technique, Pochet's innovative glass manufacturing process, a raspberry has been sculpted into a block of glass and three unique gourmet colours have been developed to achieve the harmony between the packaging concept and the final realization. ""We were able to gather a dream team of suppliers to achieve this project,"" explains Elie Papernic, Managing Partner and Creative Director of Centdegrés. The In'Pressive technology allows to design the inner shape of the bottle with as much freedom as its outer shape. According to Pochet, ""it has opened a new era of creativity for the Fragrance and Beauty industry."" Initially imagined for fragrances and skincare, In'pressive has shown its great potential for the nail polish and beauty categories. Pochet's technology enables to sculpt the colour and to magnify it in an innovative way, to make nail polish even more desirable. ""The bottle carries emotion, and creates a real differentiation for the brands, which is today essential in an ultracompetitive environment,"" says Pochet in a release. With In'pressive Nails, the Pochet Group, Centdegrés, Fiabila and Beautystreams offer a luxury evocation of a fruity colour, coming in several versions. ""Let every brand imagine its own story with In'pressive…"" concludes Pochet. Pochet will showcase In'pressive Nails, along with other innovations and creations, at the next PCD exhibition in Paris (18-19 January 2017, Porte de Versailles exhibition centre)."
Cosmetics industry to drive growth of global airless packaging market,"According to the research report released by Transparency Market Research (TMR) [1], the global airless packaging market is likely to progress at a CAGR [2] of 5.5% from 2016 to 2024 in terms of value. The overall value of the market is estimated to US$4.13 billion in 2016. It is expected to reach US$6.34 billion by the end of 2024. Airless packaging offers several benefits over conventional methods. Airless packaging can provide a great way for distributors to save space as well as overall packaging material used, thus helping them cut costs down to a large extent over time. Additionally, the use of airless packages for products, such as airless pumps, allows a consumer to use up at least 95% of the contents in a bottle, which is much higher than conventional pumps. As stated by a TMR analyst, ""The zero-wastage advantage presented by airless packaging alone is expected to revolutionize several industry verticals, especially the cosmetics industry. Several of the leading producers of cosmetics and personal care products, such as L'Oréal, Olay, Nivea, and Oriflame, are indulging in airless packaging and are gaining a highly positive feedback from users in terms of usable volume available in a given package."" One of the leading issues with airless packaging today is the very low rate of product differentiation that manufacturers can achieve. This makes it very difficult for manufacturers to achieve a high number of consumer value propositions. The lack of value propositions further makes it difficult for manufacturers to incorporate innovations and speed up development processes because they cannot tell effectively whether their products are being received well or not, making it difficult for them to understand their customers and achieve a higher level of product organization. ""There is still, however, a very high scope of growth left for the global airless packaging market. A lot of this lies in the growing demand for premium packaging and luxury packaging. The cosmetics industry especially is showing a positive inclination towards the greater use of premium packaging as it allows them to introduce several luxury cosmetic products with greater product appeal,"" adds the analyst. Europe will be the place to watch out for in terms of the competitive landscape of the global airless packaging market, notes TMR. ""A large proportion of the key players in this market are based in Europe or hold large manufacturing capabilities in the region."""
Tradeshow: ADF & PCD ready to take another step forward,"If the concept of the event remains unchanged - two events (Aerosol & Dispensing Forum and Packaging of Perfume Cosmetics & Design) organized in parallel to maximise transfers of ideas and technologies - the format takes on a new dimension. The new venue allowed the organizers to double the exhibition area (11,000 m2) and to accommodate 420 exhibitors, compared to 350 in 2016. More than 6,500 visitors are expected. However, the show keeps up with its principle of standard. ""We strive to keep the soul of the show unchanged despite the event's growing size. Our goal is to continue to promote unformal meetings and friendliness. We do not want to become a giant show,"" explains Christelle Anya, Director of ADF & PCD. As usual, ADF & PCD will feature about 100 exclusive lectures. Among not to be missed lectures: – How can pharma inhaler nozzles create benefits for cosmetic applications? – How to use the «best practices» of automotive for the aerosol industry? – Click Stylo: a new gesture in lipstick application. – Plastic has a possibilty to design aerosol cans. – Turning the dip tube on its head. – Necessity for child resistant packaging in cosmetic products - requirements, tubes solutions and marketed case study. – Digital business development tools for packagers. – Perfumes 3.0 - How products' digitalization can make perfumes more intimate, more exclusive, more enjoyable – Digitalization: how to build the future of packaging for luxury brands? – Anticipate customers' needs with the connected and customised packaging. Eventually, the ADF & PCD Awards ceremonies will reward the most important innovations of the year. ""At the beginning of this year, ADF & PCD is unquestionably the showcase to identify tomorrow's innovations and the ideal platform for the launch of new concepts or innovations. The success of the show is based on the will of visitors and suppliers to take stock of projects in development, to perpetuate their relationships, but also to source, to benchmark, to monitor new technologies and to network,"" highlights Christelle Anya."
"Laffon: ""Remain the specialist in make-up compacts in Europe!""","Premium Beauty News - Laffon was created more than 25 years ago! A long track record and a true revival in 2005! Monica Crosta - Laffon was founded in 1982 by two entrepreneurs. From 1989 to 2005 it was part of the Techpack-Alcan Beauty Group, thus becoming the supplier of the biggest players in the cosmetics industry at an international level with a specificity, that of offering standard packagings with exclusive designs. After recovering its independence in 2005, the firm continued to expand its range of standard packaging solutions, while still focusing evermore on providing comprehensive and custom solutions. We are therefore indeed specialized in the development and production of make-up packaging, but we prefer to consider ourselves as a service provider, serving our customers. Premium Beauty News - Your activity does not stop at make-up cases? Monica Crosta - True, we also produce mascaras and lipstick tubes and lipgloss, but our vocation is really, and increasingly, focused on make-up cases. We have invested a lot in recent years to modernize and automate our production lines with 27 brand new injection machines and 4 fully automated lines capable of making a complete case, including its packaging. Premium Beauty News - You produce in Italy for the European market? Monica Crosta - That's right! The European market, which had been deserted in the last ten years, is starting to become attractive again, and more than sufficient for us. To sell in the United States or elsewhere, you must be able to produce locally."
Cosmogen: A new start,"Premium Beauty News - A new chapter begins for Cosmogen! A company that has never stopped evolving...from distributor to designer/creator and which now can boast having a full mastery of the entire manufacturing process... Renaud van den Berg - This is certainly what best characterizes Cosmogen. Its constant adaptability! Cosmogen is first and foremost, a French company pioneering in the design and manufacturing of cosmetic packagings and applicators. We offer cosmetic brands brushes, accessories and packaging solutions dedicated to the application of skincare and make-up products. Constant research on new concepts with many patents filed has strengthened our expertise and extended our skills in powder dispensing systems and fluid bulk for make-up and skincare lines. Every year our turnover increases steadily by more than 13%. It actually reflects our specialization strategy: We create value on the segment of cosmetic products application. The increasingly stringent selection of our industrial partners is conducted through technical, environmental and social audits, and they are a key component of our activity. We consider them more as partners than suppliers. We chose to specialize in the application and the preservation of cosmetic products in order to focus our resources on two objectives: Reach excellence in terms of quality, responsiveness and services and maintain a high technological level of innovation. Premium Beauty News - Make-up and skincare are on a par in you activity? And innovation is a requirement... Renaud van den Berg - Quite true. Note that in skincare, there is very strong demand for ""accessories"" and ""applicators"". As for make-up, it is clear that the sector has been evolving at a phenomenal rate. Formulas are gaining more and more importance, significantly impacting the entire supplier industry with always more ""full service"". So much so that we decided a few months ago to set up a specific team that would be dedicated to this activity and to be closer to formulators. The constant improvement of different application and preservation techniques for cosmetic formulations is central to our concerns. Our technical teams have adopted a steady pace of innovation and regularly come up with new creations and patents. We participate with our customers' marketing teams to the development of specific application solutions. Our flexible structure allows us to be highly responsive and to quickly implement projects by reducing the development cycle, from the submission phase of the project to the finalization of industrial moulds. Premium Beauty News - You have a global footprint? Renaud van den Berg - Our commercial structure has expanded over the years. We of course have operations in Europe, but also in the United States, Brazil and China, to be closer to key accounts, however globalized they are. We ship daily on every continent: Europe, North and South America, and Asia. Premium Beauty News - With this new reshuffling of cards, MBO Partners is strengthening its collaboration with you! Renaud van den Berg - As you know, MBO Partners is a company that helps ambitious entrepreneurs by supporting them financially in transmission and development operations in France and Spain. It has just raised its fourth fund, (EUR 250 million), bringing its managed funds to a total of EUR 580 million. Cosmogen is therefore continuing to grow in beauty with MBO Partners by involving the Management team."
Zignago Vetro Group increases its strategy in cosmetics,"Premium Beauty News - An old story, that of your Group? Stefano Bortoli - It began in the early 1940s from the idea of a man, Mr Gaetano Marzotto, who designed a complementary and supplementary activity to farming that existed at that time. Today, the Zignago Holding has operations in many different sectors, from the production, of wine, electricity through biomass, to that of glass including real estate. The share of the Zignago Vetro Group alone accounts for about some EUR 319 million in sales for a staff of roughly 2000 people. We can quickly recall the various entities part of the Zignago Vetro Group: the glassmaker Zignago Vetro itself weighs EUR 175 million in revenue, to which we must add the Verreries Brosses (EUR 54 million), Vetri Speciali (EUR 142 million), Huta Szkla Czechy (EUR 22 million) and Vetreco (EUR 11 million). Premium Beauty News - The production of glass packaging for the food industry is one of the dominating activities! Stefano Bortoli - Yes, Zignago Vetro remains an important player in food and beverage. But it's important to underline that today the balance between the Food&Beverages (F&B) and Cosmetics&Perfumes(C&P) market activities is one of our strategic key points. Premium Beauty News - How many factories, furnaces and production lines do you have? Stefano Bortoli - Without Vetri Speciali, the Group has seven furnaces distributed in four European factories. Note that we plan to add an additional furnace next year in our Polish plant of Huta Szkla Czechy. And we have twenty three production lines, across all sectors. Premium Beauty News - Can you also decorate your products? Stefano Bortoli - We are able to offer a complete service of secondary treatments, from a simple silk screening to the most complex treatment such as hot stamping and metallization that can be made either internally or externally. In this sector, we are investing in our polish plant which is equipped today with 2 lacquering lines and 4 serigraphy lines. Note also that the Polish factory has its own mould-making workshop, which is meant to become the hub for all the factories of the Group. Premium Beauty News - The perfume and cosmetic market is experiencing ups and downs right now? How do you cope with these changes? Stefano Bortoli - It is true that the perfume and nail polish market is slightly down at the moment, but we remain confident about an upcoming rebound. To remain in the race in this global competition between glassmakers, we have decided to enlarge our global offer from the high end to mass market, and in this perspective, the choice of investing in Poland was the right one. Besides, there are other niches in cosmetics which are growing rapidly, such as foundations and skincare products in general. To meet the needs of this market, we constantly create new cream jars and standard bottles. As for perfumery, the niche of independent Perfumers is quite promising. Premium Beauty News - You have a strong foothold in foreign markets? Stefano Bortoli - We ship worldwide, with an increasing demand from the Far East. Latest initiative is the creation in 2015 of Zignago Vetro USA with an office in New York and one in San Francisco. Premium Beauty News - Environment is a major concern for you! Stefano Bortoli - Absolutely, we have put in place important investments in recent years from the recovery of exhaust gases in our factories, the use of Biomass production with a plant of 17 megawatts that covers our electricity needs to the use of photovoltaic panels. And last but not least by using an increasing quantity of post-consumer recycled (PCR) glass, and putting in place a proactive policy and a financial commitment in creating Vetreco, a new cullet treatment plant in the centre of Italy. Premium Beauty News - What are your strong points in terms of innovations during the last few months? Stefano Bortoli - We have set up in Verreries Brosse a team focused on development. The first goal achieved by our team is an innovative manufacturing process, which brings more glass at the shoulder of the bottles to create thickness symmetry between the top and the bottom. The result of this process was the patented Up & Down bottles, which we launched in the market recently. With these amazing bottles, mainly focused on the niche or luxury perfumery, the fragrance is valorised at its best! At Zignago Vetro we are working on the possibility to produce cosmetics with green glass (Cullet up to 90 %; PCR up to 75 %) greatly reducing CO2 emissions. The project has also been presented during the exhibition Make Up in Sustainable, a specific area of the MakeUp in Paris show dedicated to sustainable development. Besides, we are also working on other interesting new projects that will be unveiled at the next exhibitions."
WestRock continues its segmentation strategy of fragrance sprays,"WestRock's consumer research and insights have shown consumers notice, appreciate and feel connected by the nuances of the total product experience: the way a spray touches their skin, the sensation of dispensing of product and of course, the overall look. ""These studies have highlighted the importance of sprays in the consumer experience, and how expectations vary, especially between men and women and also between the different moments of the day,"" explains Sandy Gregory, Associate Marketing Director Global Fragrance and European Beauty. The two new sprayers, Melodie Touch and Melodie Mystery, aim to offer brand owners a new solution for delivering the perfect spray experience thus addressing the unique fragrance needs of every consumer, in any situation. ""Both Melodie Touch and Melodie Mystery provide a new way to reflect the positioning of a brand's fragrance and to heighten the consumer's experience,"" adds Sandy Gregory. ""Each dispenser offers the ability to deepen the fragrance experience, and we know from our research as well as other offerings in the market that spray can increase consumers' brand connection and drive repeat purchase intent."" Most of the time sprays consumers consider sprays are the best fragrance dispensing systems. However, studies conducted by WestRock show that in certain occasions more discretion and control are required. The Melodie Touch spray was designed to address these needs. The small-size spray provides a discreet and directly targeted dose that is perfect for application and touching up in public spaces. It is also well suited for concentrated perfume formulas, an emerging trend among prestige brands. ""With global consumer lifestyles becoming increasingly busy, consumers can effortlessly continue to enjoy their usual rituals and traditional spray gestures without over-applying thereby adding value to the product and promoting brand loyalty,"" highlights WestRock. Seventh sprayer in the Emotions of Spray Collection, the new Melodie Mystery maintains the magical aura offered by a prolonged, sensual and fine spray while combining it with a focused and targeted application. ""The quality of the spray has become part of a fragrance marketing mix. The perfect match results in an emotional connection between consumer and that fragrance. Brands are even starting to communicate on that,"" concludes Sandy Gregory."
CTL boasts a European production capacity of 200 million units for its new ESTube,"2016 will stand, without a doubt, as a pivotal year in the history of this company created in 1964, with the passing away last August of Juan Celaya, its owner/creator (and still involved in the company), who died at the age of 96. The firm that employs 750 people and has four production sites is now run by the Juan Celaya Foundation. Juan Celaya was indeed a most unusual character who managed to settle his Company, in a little more than fifty years, as the third European producer of plastic tubes with a production capacity that now exceeds 700 million units. A tireless entrepreneur who always made the right industrial choices, the last one in 2013, when he decided to invest in a new patented technology IML (In Mold Labeling), and to launch this new product, first in the United States by building a brand new plant with three production lines in Charlotte, (North Carolina). Three years later, the decision was made to double the production capacity on the historic site of the Basque Country and then to increase it threefold by also installing three new lines in the French factory in Vichy. ""The ESTube is truly a small revolution, explains Jean-Luc Leblond, VP Sales & Marketing at CTL Packaging USA, both in terms of technical and marketing results but also in terms of supply. The printing quality is outstanding and decorative and graphic possibilities are endless for our customers, but on top of it, this technology also enables short delivery deadlines. Just imagine the saving in time, space and flexibility for our customers: we store their decorated films and produce their tubes according to their needs in real time! Note that minimum delivery orders are of 5000 units and that the tube is made of a single-material (the skirt, film, head and cap are made of polypropylene)! As for formats, with this technology they range from 35, 40 and 50 mm in diameter (30 to 265ml). The main markets targeted are skincare and body care but also some make-up lines. We can also fit the tube with a range of airless spray & lotion pumps that allow, in addition to precise dosage, using this packaging upside down, which is an increasingly popular feature among consumers."" In addition, the ESTube is now customizable. ""With the HP Digital Offset technology performed in-house, our customers have the possibility to number each of their tubes for their Limited Editions, to have a unique QR Code on each tube to guarantee full traceability, or to launch Augmented Reality applications without compromising on their finishing,"" concludes Jean-Luc Leblond."

Quadpack and Collcap merge to become a leading force in beauty packaging in Europe,"""The merger means a larger, expert team developing tightly-focused packaging solutions for skincare, make-up and fragrance, either manufactured in-house or produced by approved manufacturing partners in Asia and Europe,"" highlight the two companies in a joint release. Each company tenders its own strengths to the new operation: Collcap its extensive expertise in glass and plastic tubes and a robust sourcing operation in Asia, Quadpack a global infrastructure in sales, marketing, sourcing and logistics, as well as a European manufacturing division. The two companies also predict ""a smooth transition"" for their integration. Collcap's office in Leek, Staffordshire, will be the centre of the group's UK operations, while Quadpack's Barcelona office in Spain remains as global headquarters. Collcap founder John McDermott becomes a Quadpack Industries board member. This fusion is the continuation of the strategy for inorganic growth that Quadpack initiated in 2013 with the acquisition of wood packaging plant Technotraf, the first step in the creation of a new manufacturing division, and completed by that of Krampak, now Quadpack Impressions, the following year Earlier this year, Quadpack Industries acquired injection-moulding company Rinaplast, now rebranded Quadpack Plastics.

Quadpack's overall growth strategy is also devised to prepare the group for an initial public offering, planned within the next two years. As a preliminary step, Quadpack Industries listed on the Marché Libre, part of the EuroNext stock exchange, on 21 April 2016."
"""Innovating is a challenge, innovating sustainably is even more so"", Philippe Bonningue, L'Oréal","Premium Beauty News - How do you see packaging and its role in the cosmetics industry today? Philippe Bonningue - Packaging is the main identity link between a brand and its consumers, so our role is both to design packs in line with brands' identities and satisfy user expectations. We must show we know how to associate sensoriality, rationality, and emotions in our designs, while integrating sustainable and societal criteria, a ubiquitous requirement related to our environmental policy. Premium Beauty News - How did this role change over the past few years? Philippe Bonningue - Beyond its protective, container, and informative functions, packaging now plays a strategic and multidimensional role in the development of new products, but always in keeping with the quality expected by consumers and the safety of use it must guarantee. It is a key innovation driver. As a reminder, L'Oréal registers over 80 packaging patents a year. For example, the aerosol fitted with a diffusion circle launched for Mixa and Garnier deodorants was developed with the Deoz technology. It required five years of research and led to ten innovation patents. It was marketed to meet the demand from certain women consumers, who sought more gentleness, compared to traditional sprays. So, this unique aerosol comprises two overlapping rings to diffuse the formula in the form of a mist and give a more pleasant sensation. The value perceived by packaging users has taken a crucial dimension over the past few years. It is conveyed by ergonomics, ease of use, the performance it gives the formula, but also the fact that it is getting increasingly more connected and smart. What has also obviously changed is that consumers are growing more and more aware of the environmental impact. It has become essential to design responsible packs, as it is an element they take into account when they make a purchase. Premium Beauty News - How have you dealt with this requirement? Philippe Bonningue - Packaging represents 50% of the environmental impact throughout the life cycle of a product (except for rinsed-off products). At L'Oréal, we address this issue by strongly committing to reducing our impact through our 2007 Packaging & Environment policy, which we regularly review to make stricter. It integrates our ecodesign processes as well as the 3R approach (Respect consumers and the environment, Reduce packaging in volume and weight, Replace materials by others with a lower environmental impact). For example, everyone knows a good way to reduce the environmental impact is to make products reusable and refillable. As a result, we have set up a number of projects following the refill concept. Of course, we still aim to offer the best consumer experience possible and guarantee gestures that will satisfy consumers, but we also intend to take into account environmental issues. Several projects have already been developed, like with perfumes, with the Viktor & Rolf brand, or makeup. In this segment, there are few formulas, but a lot of packaging, and trends quickly evolve. So, for example, we made lipstick and makeup palette refills for Shu Uemura. We will keep moving in this direction. Premium Beauty News - How does this impact your relationship with suppliers? Philippe Bonningue - We choose our suppliers in accordance with our responsible purchase policy (L'Oréal Buy & Care), which is based on five equally important criteria, namely their capacity to innovate and meet our quality, service, environmental responsibility, and economic competitiveness requirements. This selection policy helps us get familiar with and control the traceability of the raw materials and conditioning items used for our products, and make sure our supply chain is reliable, our workers respected, and labour law complied with. Among these criteria, social and environmental responsibility is essential to us, as there is a very high demand in this field. As an example, according to our suppliers, we are one of the most demanding companies as regards the use of recycled materials, PCR (Post Consumer Recycle), whether for glass or PET plastic. In terms of processes, we tackle all issues upstream, during the design phase, as soon as the marketing briefing. That is when we imagine what the product will be when it is no longer a product (product used and empty). Innovating is a challenge, and innovating sustainably is even more so, although it is also an outstanding opportunity. Premium Beauty News - Are consumers and brands ready for connected packaging? Philippe Bonningue - We live in a hyperconnected world, so consumers are ready indeed, but they are probably a bit lost, given the offering. That is the reason why it is essential to make the connection useful. It should actually be an added value for consumers, play an educational role, and prove useful in people's daily lives. Connected beauty is both a trend and a consumer expectation we meet by integrating digital technologies into the design and development of our products, but we will not make it a gadget. A first major application was launched last July, with the La Roche-Posay UV Patch, to discover your own sun resistance, either directly (just read what the patch displays when you place it on your skin), or via an application connected to the patch. Other projects are under study for products that have not been launched yet. Premium Beauty News - NFC, digital printing… which technologies do you prefer? Philippe Bonningue - All technologies whose NFC chip and digital printing/recognition are under study. They are complementary, so we cannot just exclude any one of them. Besides, our policy aims to integrate all new technologies to the development of all our products, so that we can meet consumers' specific needs. We can also mention the 3D printing technologies we already use, in particular in the production phase of a new Kérastase shampoo capsule. Premium Beauty News - What other major trends define tomorrow's packaging? Philippe Bonningue - Beyond sustainable development and connected beauty, there is personalization, a major expectation among consumers who wish to live a unique experience, whatever the distribution channel, but mostly e-commerce. We should bear in mind it represents 5% of the group's turnover, with a growth of over 38% last year. In China, it accounts for 20% of the turnover. It is a significant trend that can make companies overlook certain aspects, like the formula performance or the environmental impact, by using overpackaging, and we do not want that. That is why we integrate all the distribution constraints specific to this purchase channel upstream, as soon as the design phase (the same pack is subject to many more channel disruptions with e-commerce than with any other traditional channel), so that we can optimize our packaging and always satisfy all our consumers with innovative, reliable products in line with our commitment for the environment."
Eurovetrocap continues the development of its makeup packaging business,"Premium Beauty News - Eurovetrocap has quite a track record! Eleonora L'Hoir Cattaneo - Actually, if we take into account the real origin of the company, the Company's story starts in the 1940s with the Cattaneo family: two brothers and their sister, Annibale, Paolo and Carla, who created Cattaneo a glass factory. In the 60s, the company restructured itself to become the IVISC (Industrie Verrière Italienne de Saint Christophe), with headquarters located in Trezzano Sul Naviglio, in premises of over 100 000 m2. The Bormioli Rocco Spa Group then acquired the company in the early 80s. As a consequence the three sons of Annibale, Vanni, Carlo and Marco decided to create a new company dedicated to the distribution and completion of glass and plastic packagings for the cosmetic industry, Eurovetrocap. Premium Beauty News - An outstanding performance! Eleonora L'Hoir Cattaneo - Indeed for the past thirty-five years the group hasn't stopped growing, organically, but also through the acquisition of other companies. Eurovetrocap currently employs a hundred employees, has two sales offices, one in Agliana near Florence and the other in Paris and sales representations in 30 countries. Eurovetrocap recorded in 2015 a turnover of over 40 million euros. Premium Beauty News - With a clearly defined product strategy! Eleonora L'Hoir Cattaneo - We specialize mostly in the design and marketing of complete packaging lines for the perfume, cosmetic and pharmaceutical sectors (bottles, jars, caps, linings, closures, etc.). Quality, competitive prices, short deadlines and low MOQs are the keys to our success. We have a very wide range of products and considerable stock. With more than 15,000 pallets stored in our two warehouses and a latest-generation ERP, capable of processing thousands of orders per year, we are able to react in a very short time. And icing on the cake, there is no minimum order. People can order a few dozen products if they want. On top of it we also take care of the finishing (conventional screen printing and UV printing, pad printing, hot stamping, metallization, metal embossing metal, sublimation printing, etc.). We also have a Design/Development department which is present at every stage of a project, be it for the creation or specific decorations or products, both on glass or plastic, in a very short time. Premium Beauty News - Environment is also one of your key issues? Eleonora L'Hoir Cattaneo - Absolutely! This commitment to sustainable development has led us, in 2011, to focus our investments towards renewable energy sources. Hence, two photovoltaic panels of 200 and 100 kWp located on the roof of our factory in Milan, supply electricity to the offices, the warehouse and the screen printing / pad printing unit. In winter, when the sunlight alone is no longer sufficient to ensure our energy independence, we rely on the services of Repower, a renewably sourced energy supplier. In 2013, we also obtained the ISO 14001 certification. The aim was the same with the company's car fleet. Traditional vehicles were gradually replaced by hybrid, electric or LPG vehicles. Premium Beauty News - After the skincare, perfume and pharmacy sectors, you decided to get involved in make-up? Eleonora L'Hoir Cattaneo - When you look at it, we were already active in this sector with our jars and bottles for foundations and other products used as primers. And then we had the possibility this year to acquire the mascara production activity of an Italian company. We complemented the existing range with tottles, glass bottles for foundation products and a range of 6 small glass jars with capacities of less than 15 ml. Finally, we signed an agreement with the U.S. Company Seacliff, in particular for the marketing of its famous make-up compact BeautiLock™ available in three standard sizes (28mm, 43mm and 59mm). It is also available in the form of a pallet with a removable pan, and a full range of 30g, 50g jars and of 240g bottles. Its main features are an airtight locking mechanism for volatile compounds, a sleek and stylish design. It is available in PP, ABS, PETG and PCTA. It comes in three parts and is fitted with a mirror. Premium Beauty News - France remains your biggest market? Eleonora L'Hoir Cattaneo - Our primary market is ltaly followed by France and some European countries and then the USA, some Africa countries and some countries of the Middle East... and even Australia."
"""The packaging chain should be considered from a global standpoint,"" Véronique Sestrières, All4Pack","Premium Beauty News - 2016 will be the first time the show has been prepared under the All4Pack brand name. What is there beyond the name change? Véronique Sestrières - The integration of the Packaging and Handling shows is now real. They were already perfectly in line with each other in terms of activity, so we thought it timely to emphasize this with a new brand name. It is a decision that definitely corresponds to buyers' and brands' principles and global need. Today, the whole chain is considered from a global standpoint. It was perfectly coherent to showcase everything, from raw materials to packaging shipment solutions. We are pioneers in this sense. In addition, All4Pack is more easily understood by international players, which favours the development of the event. Premium Beauty News - How is the event shaping up? Véronique Sestrières - The dominant theme for All4Pack 2016 will be creativity. Under the catch line Let's Be Creative, the guideline of this edition, there is the reality of the market, which is actually boosted by all kinds of constraints, whether regulatory, marketing, environmental, or budget constraints. Faced with this reality, packaging professionals constantly brainstorm, and that is the reason why rather than innovation, we will be talking about the ceaseless creativity of the industry. We have also reorganized our space. We have made changes in the halls, by simplifying the division into sectors, so that visitors better understand where they are going and what exhibitors do. Two halls are still dedicated to machines, including those in the Health & Beauty sector. As for the new Hall 7, it will be totally dedicated to finished packaging for all industries. We resolved to mix all sectors for a more global vision of the technology transfers between them. The new Business Meeting concept also constitutes a targeted answer in a cross-sectoral show. It is an initiative that we will launch this year and mean to develop by 2018. The principle is simple: for example, a cosmetics company's Purchasing Manager in search for a certain type of machines may describe his situation on the dedicated platform before the show. Then, our exhibitors make themselves known, if they can provide an appropriate solution, and we organize meetings with the contacts selected by the visitor during the show. Premium Beauty News -How will the Beauty industry be represented? Véronique Sestrières - The Beauty & Cosmetics part represents about 10% of the 1,500 exhibitors. This percentage has remained stable, but there are 25% of newcomers, most of them from around the world, in particular Europe and Asia. 70% of the exhibitors in this industry are packaging suppliers, 30% machine suppliers. In parallel, certain food specialists have various things to introduce to the Cosmetics industry, and vice versa: there are no definite boundaries, and that is what is interesting in a cross-sector area. Then, many exhibitors offer multisector solutions beauty professionals are keen on (printing, coding & marking, handling). Premium Beauty News - What can major cosmetics brands' visitors find at All4Pack that they cannot on a dedicated show? Véronique Sestrières - More sources of inspiration. All4Pack offers machine solutions that cannot necessarily be found in shows dedicated to a specific sector. We can now showcase both technical and more marketing solutions. As everyone knows, today, all these services must work together for increased efficacy, reduced costs, and innovation. It is essential to have a good, global vision of the chain. This show does provide this global answer that can meet all needs. We will never be as specialized as a dedicated show, but conversely, a dedicated show is more restrictive than a cross-sector show, so they are complementary events. Premium Beauty News - Can inspiration also be found in the content? Véronique Sestrières - Sure, it is also a show where you can find much dedicated content, which is always interesting. The programme gathers more than 150 influential experts, and will provide a detailed analysis of the main stakes, trends, and specificities of the industry from a global standpoint. A show on our own TV set dedicated to K Beauty and its packs will be hosted by Caroline Moulin, Director of the Nao Design agency, on November 16. There will be both Korean bloggers and experts around her to present this significant trend. Lastly, why not also take inspiration from the most beautiful packaging of the last ten years at the 10/10 exhibition organized by the Pentawards? 100 exceptional or remarkable packaging models were selected among the winners of the last ten editions of the Pentawards, in ten categories, including perfumes and cosmetics. They will be showcased for the first time, and exclusively at our show!"

Geka / Mixpac Systems: a marriage of convenience!,"Premium Beauty News - The announcement of this merger came as a surprise at first? Amaury de Menthière - Indeed at first sight, questions raised by this merger were legitimate. But in fact, there are a lot of synergies between the two companies. A few words first on the Sulzer Group itself, which employs more than 14000 people spread over 170 sites in the world: It is a Swiss company founded in 1834 mostly specialized today in the manufacturing of pumps, rotating equipment and, thanks to its SMS Division (720 people, 200 million Swiss francs in sales, six production sites) of applicators and distributors/mixers for the dental and pharmaceutical industries and industrial adhesives. And you know that Geka also manufactures applicators, which are different from those intended for the beauty industry since we started an activity in skincare and various other products, especially in the field of electronic cigarettes. For the Sulzer Group, this diversification in the beauty industry is an excellent opportunity, and for Geka, the guarantee of having an industrial partner with a strong global foothold and who has long track record in the processing of plastic precision parts. Premium Beauty News - Which means as a President, you will have an overall responsibility? Amaury de Menthière - That's right and it's consistent. Because there are significant technical synergies. SMS is present in the United States, U.K., Denmark, China and Switzerland, of course. And as you know, we are present in Germany, the United States and Brazil. SMS manufactures applicators and dispensers for the dental and pharmaceutical industry mostly and to a lesser extend for cosmetics. This merger will result in the creation of a major player in the field of precision plastic injection. Premium Beauty News - Many new products were recently showcased by Geka? Amaury de Menthière - Absolutely! Both at MakeUp in New York and Luxe Pack Monaco, we put in the spotlight innovations in mascaras, lip glosses and eyeliners. One of the highlight products we launched is our new moulded mascara brush called softSECRET which is available as a standard product. It is produced using the patented Sandwich process: two different plastic materials create a stable core with extremely soft bristles. Thanks to the harder brush core the lashes are precisely lifted and perfectly separated, while the transparent, extremely soft bristles reach the finest lashes. Also in terms of twisted wire mascaras we are working with two different materials - but this time the single fibres consist of two components. The cores of the fibres are made of a hard material to comb the lashes and avoid lash clumping. However, the brush does not stitch on the eyelid as the hard fibre cores are coated by soft materials (i.e. a foam type) so that the fibres also absorb more formula for increased volume. To round up our innovations in the eye category we launched a new eyeliner that consists of 19 delicate moulded micro bristle that do not spread but create a continuous and precise line. At Luxe Pack we also presented a mascara with a colourful metallic sleeve decoration as well as a cap made with a marble metallic masterbatch that creates unique eye-catching effects on each product. For the lip category we have our new squared heavy-walled lip gloss packaging. As we continuously see more and more demand for elaborate decorations, we now also offer in-house metallization and lacquering."
"Albéa links customization, digitalization and agility","""The entire market is accelerating while losing visibility. In such a context, agility is the key word, together with the ability to react quickly, even more quickly than it was previously required,"" said Cecile Tuil, Vice President Communication. In the fast-moving cosmetic market, digital is changing the rules of the game and Albéa is supporting its customers in this transformation by implementing digital collaboration between its teams and experts networks; automating its manufacturing sites and processes; deploying easier, safer and more ergonomic information systems; reinforcing its web and social media presence; and by developing connectivity of its packaging. At Luxe Pack Monaco 2016, Albéa introduced its three exclusive new digital platforms: – The Albéa Virtual Makeup allows showcasing the pack and its makeup effect live on the face. This digital experience is the result of a partnership with Perfect Corp, the founder of YouCam Makeup, the #1 digital beauty app in the world. Using augmented reality technology, its functionalities allow a smart device to detect real forms of the human face. – The Albéa Connect app provides the group's sales teams with an instant visual recognition system, allowing their smartphone to recognize Albéa packaging and all useful information in a few seconds. ""While holding the pack in your hands, you can explore all the product's features and value proposition in an instant wherever you are - at the office, in a meeting or at a trade show. It's a new dynamic and efficient way to access information at all times,"" explains the group. – Albéa Mix & Match, a digital platform that allows to virtually create custom-made packaging solutions from Albéa's standard offer. As a first step, the launch of this new platform only concerns the group's Tube Europe activity. It is therefore possible to imagine and recreate a custom-made tube combining three of Albéa expertise in real-time: the tube structures (round, oval, plastic, laminate or Purefoil), an applicator (airless pumps, cannulas, caps) and decoration capabilities by playing with different colours, shades and effects thanks to a rich palette of options. Albéa Mix&Match will evolve in the coming months, with the integration of the North America Tubes offer and Dispensing Systems. The platform is accessible online, here."
Aptar: A new perspective on cosmetic oils,"Facial skincare, sampling and promotion, fragrance, haircare and sun care ranges: Aptar showcased innovations for almost all the categories that may be formulated with oil. As far as facial skincare is concerned Aptar Beauty+ Home presented two specific packaging solutions: a special edition of the airless stylus pen Serumony, and Oilmist, a new pump for all over dry oils With its ""press to dispense"" method, Serumony oil edition is ""the perfect way to get the right dose of ultra-liquid and ultra-delicate formulas"". By pressing once, the consumer can get a 70μl drop. It is therefore easy to choose and control the quantity of formula required. Once the right dose obtained, the consumer just has to lock the push-button by turning it a quarter of the way around and replace the cap, then the formula is protected from contact with the air. Another plus: zero risk of spillage onto the bottle neck or outside the bottle, since this beauty elixir is ""captured"" in an airtight bottle. According to Aptar, Serumony oil edition is compatible with most nourishing facial oils. For its part, the new Oilmist pump allows oil to come out in a spray. The soft, modular pump is used to control dosage and the long, continuous spray releases an ultra-thin mist. This pump is available in metal or plastic with a crystal cap option. For sampling and promotion, Aptar Beauty + Home also offers the Oilmist technology in a Mini Packaging version: Travel Oilmist, a portable package for an even spray. ""The perfect size to address two market trends: Try before you buy and On-The-Go,"" says Aptar. In the perfume sector, Aptar Beauty + Home is continuing to focus on the intimate and sensual experience of Note, with a special version for perfume oils. A preview of Note Oil Edition was presented at Luxe Pack, in partnership with Firmenich, for the formulation, and the glass factory Verreries Brosse, using their Up&Down technology to realize a unique bottle design. For the hair care and sun care markets Aptar Beauty + Home is launched two new solutions: – With oil becoming increasingly important in haircare routines, Aptar Beauty + Home has expanded its lotion pump range with the new PZ Lark - a new cosmetic pump designed to address the needs of professional lotions and high-end haircare products. Featuring the renowned PZ pump technology, the PZ Lark has a soft actuation even with highly viscous formulas. Its new design and its discreet engine address the trend towards transparent packaging widely seen in the luxury and professional haircare markets. – To address the trend for oil based and high viscosity formulas in sun, hair and body care Aptar Beauty + Home presented the PZ Sprayer with a new insert technology for demanding formulas and a very homogenous and even spray."
Luxury glass: From the lightest to the heaviest,"Riding the eco-responsible trend, glass manufacturers innovate in the weight reduction of their products. Awarded by the Luxe Pack in Green 2016 for its Ecojars innovation, Bormioli Luigi percfectly illustrates the trend which is forecasted to become a key feature of the market in the future. ""In a few years it will be a condition to carry on operating on the market,"" says Frédéric Montali, Head of the Cosmetics Division of the Bormioli Luigi group. The Ecojars range for skin care and luxury make-up consists of four ultralight standard jars, weighing 50% less than a traditional glass of the same capacity. To achieve this lightening, Bormioli Luigi took inspiration from its expertise in the production of tableware glass, in particular for the development of a patented process for the jar's screw ring. Reducing the amount of glass helps to decrease the overall impact on the environment, including the volumes of raw materials used and the impact of production and transportation. Similarly, the Pochet Group strives to combine concern for the environment and luxury codes with Epure, a lightweight jar with thin walls. Born from a Pochet du Courval technical prowess for the glass making, Epure can be completed by a cap solution, thus allowing customers to benefit from the Group's multimaterial expertise. ""The goal was to go forward in the lightweight glass, with up to 50% reduction of weight, while sticking to luxury codes, including gloss. A glass can be both luxurious and lightweight, provided it is are perfectly manufactured,"" said Thierry Rabu, General manager of the group's glass division. In order to meet this challenge, Pochet chose to reduce the height of the ring, thereby radically changing the design of the jars. In parallel, with its Evolution concept, German glassmaker Heinz Glas showcased its ability to produce heavy weight bottles and jars. The company displayed single-shaped designs of the same volume gradually ranging from the heavier to the lighter. Also with a view on environment preservation, Verescence (formerly SGD Parfumerie), continues to develop its Neo Infinity range of recycled glass standards. Finally, to support this move towards lighter glass jars and bottles, both Verescence and Stölzle Glass Group presented new processing solutions to enhance glass resistance to breakage, with Stölzle Glass adding to the treatment an invisible film to preserve the integrity of the bottle in case of breakage. Despite these lightweighting efforts, heavy glass bottles with thick walls remain strongly associated with luxury codes and the market's preference. As far as heavy weight glass are concerned, the main innovation was the Up & Down technology presented by Verreries Brosse (Zignago Vetro Group) brush with. The new process allowed to distribute an even distribution of the glass all around the bottle to surround the juice. Such an achievement was already possible for the sides and bottom and the bottom of the bottle, but Verreries Brosse is the first to be able to provide thickness to the shoulders. Also noteworthy, Verescence's new Bowie collection which adds weight and substance to standard bottles targeting the niche perfumery market."
Texen organizes to anticipate consumers' expectations,"In the wake of the recent acquisitions of several leading international suppliers - C+N Packaging in October 2014 and Topline Products at the end of January 2016 - Texen not only strengthened its industrial capacity and international presence, but also greatly diversified its skills. With a turnover forecasted to exceed 200 million euros in 2016, more than 1,500 employees, 11 industrial facilities and 4 commercial offices on 3 continents, Texen now ranks as the world's 3rd supplier of plastic packaging solutions for cosmetics and fragrances. The company generates 70 to 75% of its turnover in the makeup category, the rest being shared equivalently between skincare and perfumes. Since 2013, Texen has its own in-house innovation team - called TexenLab - with a 250 m2 laboratory equipped with its own dedicated machinery and its a Fab Lab. The integration of Topline Products brought Texen a broadened industrial footprint, with additional factories in the US, Mexico and China. The acquisition also brought trading and full-service capabilities as well as a solid network of partner companies and enhanced communication and marketing capabilities. Thanks to these new assets, Texen now positions itself as a global solution provider able to respond to all types of demand: bespoke packaging and complex development, standard products, turnkey solutions and an à la carte service offer that goes from formulation and filling to secondary packaging. In order to build win-win relationships with brands, Texen has partnered with additional external resources. ""Given the variety of demands from customers, it is no longer possible to produce everything by ourselves. To be proactive and creative we need to cooperate with a wider community,"" explains Pierre-Antoine Henry, Global Director - Business Development & Full Service at Texen. The aim is to move from a BtoB dialogue to a BtoBtoC model based on a better understanding of the consumer's world and expectations when it comes to makeup, skincare and fragrance. To help implement this new business strategy, ex-LVMH Daniel Saclier joined Texen in June. His mission is to help the company in the creation of such a network of industrial partners able to respond to the expectations of brands. ""Agility is a key element of success in the market. In order to go faster, brands are increasingly looking for comprehensive solutions. Packaging and formula are increasingly linked,"" he says. To accelerate its research on consumer expectations, Texen also enlisted the services of ""beauty architect & designer"" Michel Limongi, founder and manager of LaBeautyFULL.id. ""Our approach of innovation consists in working on a solution, a result, rather than on a pack. First, we have to identify the difficulties of consumers, identify problems and then to propose a solution that will,"" says Limongi. ""We sell a comprehensive idea not a piece of plastic."" As a result of this cooperation, a new skincare concept, a new makeup concept and a new concept fragrance are under development and will be presented in 2017. ""In a changing Luxury and Beauty market, on which brands are constantly renewing their offer to provide added benefits to consumers, Texen is positioning itself as a true partner, providing the best solutions for their product needs,"" concludes Olivier Salaun, President and CEO of PSB Industries, Texen's parent company."
"François Luscan, Albéa: ""The aim is to stay the best at what we do!""","Premium Beauty News - 2016 was a good year for the Albéa Group? François Luscan - Definitely, yes! The start of the year was quite good. We are matching market growth and sometimes even performing better. The make-up sector is doing very well, skincare too but with disparities depending of geographical areas and, as everyone knows and observes, the perfume sector is struggling. The key word for us is to ""adapt"" all the time! Agility is the main challenge, especially since what characterizes the present time is the lack of visibility. For us, what is important is ""after""! It involves staying at the top and be the best at what we do and never stop innovating and going forward! Our philosophy and commitment have always been based on the future. But this future has accelerated dramatically. The best example is this soaring digital revolution and the practical consequences for our businesses. As you know our reason for being is to combine reliability and agility to support our customers' ambitions and the many challenges of our market. That is why we develop the collective intelligence of our networks worldwide, the digitalization of our industrial sites, the information tools of our teams and the connectivity of our packagings. I would like to stress, in particular, on this notion of ""smart factories"" that we have implemented and which enables us to develop this technological and industrial reliability, to promote the agility of processes and of the supply chain and to meet the requirements of sustainable development. Premium Beauty News - What matters the most actually is ""the"" customer's satisfaction! François Luscan - I couldn't agree more! And in this area, we strive to continually improve ourselves. Thus, thanks to a new software that we have designed and that allows to manage development projects and the project portfolio according to the so-called ""PPM"" method (Project and Portfolio Management). Now, we also offer our customers with a very high reliability rate in project developments. This management method allows us to follow on everything regarding the project development, from design to realization, including risks involved. Premium Beauty News - The industrial tool is therefore constantly changing! François Luscan - On our sites, we are currently deploying a very ambitious automation project focused on both, people and clients. It relies in particular on the standardization and flexibility of certain equipment, to ensure greater agility in the implementation of new projects, to provide back-up capacity, and facilitate the deployment or the rapid transfer of equipment according to the needs. And advanced robotics today makes it possible to develop robots that work more independently, that are more flexible, and with a higher cooperation with operators. This is important, to work on small runs efficiently, which is key with the multiplication of small brands, for example in the make-up sector..., small brands that will often grow! More generally, we invest every year nearly $ 100 million in our sites, our equipment, our processes and to train our teams. Premium Beauty News - Today, environment can only be at the heart of industrial concerns? François Luscan - It has always been for us in any case! I cannot list here all the things that we are doing in this area, it would probably deserve a separate article, but for example we are currently deploying an energy consumption management program on our sites via connected meters that provide a real-time monitoring and allow a rapid correction of any slippage. Our commitment to social responsibility, that we have been developing for over 10 years, includes our teams and our communities, our products, our operations, our customers and our partners. Moreover, we are extremely proud to have received last week in the Luxe Pack in Green award for Corporate Social Responsibility! Premium Beauty News - Concerning ""Digital"", you have obviously given a major boost! François Luscan - That's true but it was necessary! We are integrating digital printing. We are working on 3D Printing or Direct Digital Manufacturing. The third component concerns digitization, i.e. ""Smart IT"". Its goal is to design and provide our teams with a more ergonomic, simpler and at the same time more secure information system. We have appointed a Cyber Security Manager and integrated designers to redesign our IT systems to improve ergonomics and develop more intuitive and transverse business applications. There is also ""Albéa Pulse"" that provides Operational Managers with real-time key performance indicators for each industrial site... or ""Smart Glasses"", a remote technical assistance industrial system... Not to mention ""Smart Packaging"" to reflect with our clients on the development of intelligent packagings, on digital technologies to rethink products traceability and anti-counterfeiting, etc... ""Albéa Mix & Match"" enables to virtually create tailor-made tubes, ""Albéa Connect"" is, as you know, our first B2B application on connected packagings and finally ""Albéa Virtual MakeUp"" is a virtual make-up application that combines our packaging solutions, countless make-up shades and the augmented reality technology to detect the exact contours of the face. Premium Beauty News - Resources are needed to implement all these human and industrial projects? François Luscan - With the encouragements of our customers and the support of our shareholders, we have them! Don't forget that we invest each year between 6% and 7% of our turnover and that we have doubled in seven years both our sales and staff and that we successfully completed five acquisitions. What is important is obviously to be able to carry on our development. Hence the rumours you heard about the quest for a partner with both the financial capacity and the aim to support Albéa's development. Premium Beauty News - You presented a lot of new models recently? François Luscan - As always! It's in our DNA! Again, I cannot list them all but I am very proud of this eyeliner with a pivoting applicator designed specifically for Lancôme. And this clever cap engineered for the new creation of the Cartier fragrance house is also superb with a capping system and a downward and upward motion to release the pump. And many other great achievements for our customers! As far as technical innovation was concerned, we were also proud to introduce Maestro, a non-guided Ø12.7mm lipstick mechanism featuring the patented ""flex tab technology"" for a controlled and constant swivel torque. New also, the ""TearDrop"" tube, presented in preview, for the drop-by-drop dispensing of liquid formulas... Premium Beauty News - You were mentioning it earlier between the lines... Managing an industrial company with fifteen thousand people spread in thirty eight industrial sites across the world while remaining flexible, reactive, innovative... Quite a challenge indeed? François Luscan - Let's say a constant and exciting challenge! Because this challenge concerns, we must keep that in mind, women and men and a cohesive and committed team. We must always go further, move quickly but effectively combine strength and agility, understanding how our market and our customers are changing in order to adapt constantly. Thus, Albéa will continue to support its customers and will last."
"""The digital revolution will transform the distribution of samples,"" Carl Allain, Arcade Beauty","Premium Beauty News - How is the activity of Arcade Beauty organized worldwide today? Carl Allain - After the arrival of Peter Lennox in February as the Group's new CEO in February, we reorganized Arcade in major regions: North America, Europe, Brazil. To date, approximately 50 to 55% of out turnover comes from North America, 35 to 40% from Europe and 5 to 10% from Brazil. We have a dozen sites around the world: North and South America, Europe and China. In Europe we rely on five production sites: four in France and one in Poland. Premium Beauty News - With the emergence of digital, the sampling sector is now confronted to a real transformation. Carl Allain - With the challenge of digital revolution, confronting us all, the beauty market is undergoing a complete transformation. And obviously this also has a direct impact on the distribution of samples. All cosmetics and perfume brands are now heavily investing in digital and the way samples are distributed will inevitably change. There is a shift from mass distribution to a more targeted and smarter distribution, aiming at a better return on investment. This change is accompanied by a decline in the weight of the printed press, even if the specialised women's press better resisted than the mainstream press. But brands continue to consider samples as a key to success in the cosmetic market. They all confirmed they needed samples to boost sales. It is a key element of the purchasing act. Samples as such, have therefore nothing to fear from the internet and the digital rise. But their distribution will change substantially. Today all market players (brands, retailers, pure players, application developers, etc.) are seeking to create and consolidate customer databases. The sample will be a key element in this battle towards beauty digitalization. Premium Beauty News - In this context, in which direction will the sample industry evolve? Carl Allain - The strategy we have developed consists of four major thrusts: the development of mini products, the new needs of retailers, direct marketing and geographic expansion. Demand for mini-products is rising sharply, it meets both the beauty to go trend that values travel-size products for women on the go, but also demand for cheap and easily accessible products. These products are in high demand among retailers, for their own brands that now have significant market shares. Mini-products and samples also answer another increasing need from retailers: an intensification of the relationship with their clients. This already strong trend in the US is gaining momentum in France. Retailers today can rely on large customer databases, including VIP customers, and they are looking for ways to enhance further their customers' experience, including by inviting them to try new products. Direct marketing, a sector undergoing substantial changes, was heavily impacted by digitalization and it was given a new lease of life through new forms of synergies with the development of the internet and social networks. Today, direct marketing operations are more targeted, whether for the distribution of samples placed in the boxes sent on subscription, distribution operations related to online communications, or for the development of customer data bases. Another important growth area for us is the development of our presence in different markets. Regarding Europe, we have a very strong foothold in France but we have significant room for growth in other markets, such as the UK or Germany. We have therefore decided to strengthen our London team. A Project Manager will join the two Sales engineers already on site to liaise with our factories on development projects. We also believe that the offer of Carestia, our French site in Grasse, which is specialized in perfumed paper samples and scented items, has a huge potential in North America, particularly in the context of strong market development the country is currently enjoying. Premium Beauty News - Does this increasing product customization also concern the sample market? Carl Allain - Of course! It is also a result of digitization. We are moving towards increasing product customization in all markets. In our case, this is particularly the case with labels, and this, at different levels: to interact more with customers, to better measure the return on investment, etc. That is why we recently invested in digital printing by complementing our population of printers on the French site of Socoplan Airvault with a latest generation digital HP Indigo 20000 printer. Today, technical possibilities for customization and targeting are such, that an infinity of options can be imagined! With as a consequence, a reduction in the size of series. This is a general trend in the industry. Premium Beauty News - Do you have more investments planned in the coming months? Carl Allain - Investments in additional capacity are under way to update equipments and meet the highest standards in health and environmental matters. We are also investing in technology transfer between our different production sites. This is an important demand from our clients. The BeautiPod technology was for example transferred to Europe."
"""Lighter, more resistant and environmentally friendly products are the market's key challenges,"" Christophe Baudry, Metsä Board","Premium Beauty News - How does the 2016 year look like so far for Metsä Board? Christophe Baudry - The year is far from over, but I think the word ""consolidation"" is the one that fits best the Group's situation. We have continued our investments and were able to take advantage, with our customers, of the achievements made in previous years while preparing for the future. In April, we officially inaugurated our new folding boxboard machine at the Husum mill in Sweden. In total, we invested nearly EUR 170 million to upgrade the Husum site and forge on with our transformation as a global leader in paperboard produced from fresh fibres. The Husum site epitomizes our strategy perfectly: it integrates vertically the production of pulp and of paperboard. It perfectly reflects our desire to master the quality of the product, in particular its consistency, while delivering always more services and flexibility to our customers. The mill in Husum is located by the sea and has its own sea terminal, its production is mainly targeted at the Americas and the food markets globally, but it reflects the objectives of Metsä Board for all markets: environmental excellence, consistent quality delivered and service excellence. Premium Beauty News - Environmental friendliness could not be more strategic to the Group? Christophe Baudry - For the past thirty years, reducing the environmental impact of our products has been part of the company's DNA. And all the steps we take point in that direction. It is a strategic choice that also is perfectly, and increasingly, in line with the expectations of a large number of our clients. This is especially true for the cosmetics industry whose main promise is that of personal well-being that consumers spontaneously link to the well-being of the planet, reflecting an intact and plenteous Nature that must be preserved. Metsä Board is engaged in a policy aimed at lightening and reducing the environmental impact of its products. Today all our interlocutors also have this concern in mind. This is true for large groups that are often at the forefront of environmental policies, with ambitious goals and obligations regarding results, but it is also true for many independent actors, as a number of them also place environment at the heart of their brand image. It is true that with the development of e-commerce, lighter packagings have become a key component across the whole value chain. This junction point between Metsä Board and its customers is becoming stronger and stronger. And we intend to continue our efforts in that direction! But our environmental commitment is not limited at designing lighter paperboards. It encompasses our entire business, from the management of forests to the advice given to our customers including the entire manufacturing process. In practice this includes improving our energy efficiency, reducing CO2 emissions (with a 30% target per tonne produced by 2020), reducing the amount of water used (-17% per tonne produced by 2020). Our mill in Kyro, Finland, has been using for many years now a biopower plant that helped halve the site's CO2 emissions. These efforts are bearing fruit since, in 2015, Metsä Board was recognized by CDP, as Nordic leader for the quality of its climate change related information disclosed to investors and the global marketplace, (Carbon Disclosure Project). Last year Metsä Board also had the honour of being included in the exclusive Water A List of the CDP's Water Program for its actions on improving water security. Among the eight A-listers, Metsä Board was the only European company and the sole representative of the forest industry. Premium Beauty News - How does this concern link in with the challenges of e-commerce? Christophe Baudry - In e-commerce, product delivery is a key item, because of its cost but also of its key role in the customer's satisfaction and shopping experience. The main operators are therefore looking for as light as possible boxes – for cost and environmental reasons – and also very resistant, to guarantee perfect product integrity. Our lightweight liners are therefore perfectly suited to these needs. In parallel, especially in the luxury sector and for premium cosmetics, brands are seeking to achieve a ""wow"" effect when the product is handed to the customer and when she opens the box. Dream and enchantment are key in cosmetics. The moment when the customer opens the box should be a moment of pleasure, a genuine invitation to travel. But we must not overdo it, because during this returning to childhood, during this moment of pleasure and surprise, the consumer also needs to be relieved from her feelings of guilt in relation to packaging waste. Or otherwise, the final effect could well be: ""Wow all that waste."" In such a context, Metsä Board's environmental message has become more and more meaningful. Premium Beauty News - Finally, what is your insight on the main market trends and prospects for innovation? Christophe Baudry - Lighter, more resistant products are the main trends and key challenges of the market of higher-end paperboard. These themes are in line with all the current societal changes and macro trends, whether they relate to environmental concerns, the development of e-commerce or product premiumisation. In the longer term, paperboard has major advantages to offer the packaging sector. Its scope of application should greatly expand. Possibilities are many and we are very far from having explored all of them. These are long-term projects that require significant investments and time. ""But what wouldn't we do for our customers!"""
Yonwoo: The tube challenge!,"A development strategy for the tube that was decided two years ago only, and which is clearly bearing fruit, since, to meet demand, the Yonwoo team has already planned to install four additional production lines next year to increase the current capacity by 40%. ""Tubes already represent 13% of our turnover, emphasised Daniel Cha, and it is bound to increase."" The Head of the Korean company's Sales and Marketing department explains this success, by the ""positioning adopted, namely that of a competitive range of tubes positioned in the masstige segment and offering multiple possibilities in terms of novel and functional applicators. What matters today is the ease and safety of application and the gesture."" Constantly focused on innovation, the Korean company is continuing its research work in all areas of its expertise and is planning to launch in the coming weeks more novelties particularly in the area of ""Cushion"" cases. ""But our goal, obviously, is not to play the card of innovation for the sake of innovation, but to launch products that exactly fit the evolution of a market that has reached maturity. That is to say a competitive product, easy to manufacture, to fill, to use... In short, a product, which is functional and attractive!"" To be continued…"
Samhwa: A new plant,"Premium Beauty News - Could you please reposition Samhwa Plastic today... In terms of staff and industrial strike force? Thomas Hwang - The Company employs some 750 people and our turnover in 2015 amounted to US$ 78 million. We have a total of 90 injection machines including six bi-injection machines (with two more planned). Premium Beauty News - The buildings housing the new plant are located just next to the first ones? Thomas Hwang - Absolutely! The first, on a new ground area covers an area of 2422 sqm out of a total building area of 5278 sqm and it will be dedicated to production/operation activities and the second new building with an area of 1776 sqm on a total building area of 2,868 sqm will be dedicated to production and logistics. The total investment amounts to US$ 10 million. The new building will house 16 additional injection machines, 10 additional assembly lines including 3 sets of automatic compact assembly machines representing a total amount of $ 4 million. And we also have a new decoration machine, a machine for laser engraving. I must say that we have many requests for ""Cushion Compacts"" so we are investing in fully automatic assembly machines that will improve productivity for compacts. Premium Beauty News - what is today your strategy in terms of packaging development? What innovations will you introduce at MakeUp in New York? And finally what are the next steps in your development? Thomas Hwang - Our R&D strategy is a combination of our other activities. We believe that the trend of the other leading businesses can be the model for cosmetic packaging. We would like to benchmark leading business models in cosmetics. This year at the MakeUp in New York trade show, we will present a new series of slim ""Cushion Compacts"". And in the field of ""Cushion Compacts"", our new model is the thinnest in the world. On a global scale, Samhwa wants to extend its foothold on the market very aggressively. Our first Shanghai branch opened and generated a turnover of more than $ 10 million last year. We will also open a French office in a month. The office and staff are already in place. We are also looking at the US market where we plan to open an office next year. Premium Beauty News - Can you give us some details about your partnership with Pochet with whom you have joined forces, to offer a new generation of airless systems? Thomas Hwang - The joint-venture company SPPS was launched last year, and the product ""Pure Drop"" was successfully launched on the EU market. In addition to the joint venture, we have many other projects for which we will intend to use the different offices and factories of the Pochet Group around the world. This is under negotiation and we will have visible results in the course of this year."
Albéa consolidates its position in tubes with the acquisition of Scandolara Tub-Est,"Scandolara Tub-Est s.r.o serves global and regional brands across Europe, primarily in the oral care market. Its 130 people achieved sales of circa EUR 20 million in 2015. The plant holds multiple ISO certifications. This acquisition consolidates Albéa's regional leadership in tubes, extending its industrial footprint and capacity to serve customers across Europe where it now boasts six Laminate Tube facilities - in France, Germany, UK, Poland, Russia and now Slovakia. ""Together, Albéa and Levice will offer a unique combination of global reach and local presence, market-valued product and process innovation, as well as technical expertise, operating performance and agility,"" explains François Luscan, Albéa's President & CEO. With 15,000 people and 38 facilities in Europe, Asia and the Americas, Albéa serves large and small customers in 60 countries across the world. In 2015, Albéa's global sales totaled US$1.4 billion. The company offers the world's largest range of beauty and personal care packaging - with leadership positions in plastic and laminate tubes, mascaras, lipsticks, samplers and foam pumps; and recognized expertise in fragrance and skincare dispensing pumps, fragrance and lotion caps, compacts, lip gloss, promotional items and accessories."
Quadpack continues to invest in its production unit,"A new injection moulding machine was added last June at the Quadpack Plastics facility in Torelló, Spain, to complete the 11 existing lines. ""This EUR 180,000 investment is designed to manufacture high precision luxury jars and can work with both small and large size moulds,"" said the packaging supplier. The arrival of this new moulding machine marks the start of a two-year plan to deploy state-of-the-art injection moulding equipment at Quadpack Plastics. ""The new machine will allow larger cavitation moulds to be operated,"" added the company. The factory now boasts 12 injection-moulding machines, five screen-printing machines, two UV screen-printing machines, one pad printing machine and five assembly lines. Since April this year, Quadpack has been streamlining its production facility dedicated to plastic. ""The new setup ensures optimal workflow, from injection-moulding, through decoration, to assembly and warehousing. Each production line has been evaluated and upgraded where necessary, with some lines made redundant."" Decoration and assembly will be managed and supervised by Quadpack Impressions in nearby Torelló, to ensure consistent processes and output from the Manufacturing Division. Important investment has also been made into staff health and safety measures. Improvements include new safety rails, safety signage, protective enclosures on machinery and new uniforms and personal protective equipment (PPE), while factory personnel have benefited from additional professional training. Upgraded staff facilities are next on the list, with new changing rooms, showers and an improved dining area. ""We've done a great deal of work, but there's still more to do, as we prepare for future growth. Our plans are to maximise production efficiency and minimise reject rates, aiming for a 85% 'World Class' OEE (overall equipment efficiency). The objective is to achieve a EUR 5 million turnover in three years' time,"" said Ernesto Cara, head of the Manufacturing Division. Quadpack also made major investments in its wood packaging business, also located in Torelló. As part of its long-term environmental commitment, the Group invested EUR 400,000 in a regenerative thermal oxidiser (RTO) in the Technotraf workshop. This equipment processes emissions from the Technotraf factory's spray coating line and ensures its facilities exceed environmental regulations now and in the future. RTOs are the most widespread technique today for reducing emissions of volatile organic compounds or VOCs. Quadpack's new installation treats VOCs through a process of oxidisation at high temperatures, transforming them into non-pollutant components such as CO2 and H20, in a clean oxidation process. The heat generated is reused to operate the equipment, keeping energy use at a minimum. With a steady increase in production volumes at the Manufacturing Division, the new RTO will help ensure that its processes have minimal impact on the environment and remain compliant with current and future legislation."
Iggesund focuses on Japan with new sales office,"""Traditionally Iggesund has focused very much on Europe but we are now prioritising work to increase our global sales,"" explains Arvid Sundblad, Vice President Sales and Marketing for Iggesund. ""For more than a decade we have seen the conversion of packaging for consumer goods move from western Europe to other parts of the world, mostly in the east,"" he says. ""Brand owners with headquarters in one part of the world can have the manufacturing of both their goods and packaging in another. This is globalisation in a nutshell and we must adapt to it."" The Japanese paper and paperboard market is known for its high demands on quality. Iggesund's flagship product, Invercote, will be the cornerstone of the new venture. The paperboard is well established in the highest quality segments in the more than 100 national markets where it is sold. It is made of virgin fibre and meets exacting standards of purity, so it should do well in Japan. ""When we decided to focus more on global sales, one of the first steps was to develop our delivery service outside Europe,"" explains Ivan Chong, President of Iggesund's Asia Pacific operations. ""Since then we've built up new inventory and sheeting facilities on the US West Coast and in Taiwan. The result is radical reductions in lead times to Asia."" Iggesund has been represented in both Singapore and Hong Kong for almost two decades now and has been successful in building sales over that period. The improved availability means there are good prospects for the company to reach a wider market not only in Japan but also in the Asia Pacific region generally. ""The improved inventory and service are a game changer for us,"" Chong says. ""Now we can be competitive in contexts where before we weren't even an option due to the lead times. We've already gained a number of new orders due to our new delivery capacity."" ""We have great respect for Japanese business culture and are therefore only recruiting Japanese staff,"" Chong adds. ""We believe that this factor, together with our long-term commitment, will be decisive to succeeding in Japan. Quality is extremely important in Japan. Hygiene, purity, and taste and odour neutrality are just some of the aspects that are emphasised more in this market than in many others. That's why we believe Invercote has terrific opportunities to do well here."" Invercote has long been represented by the esteemed Japanese paper merchants Takeo with a focus on the graphics market and this arrangement will continue. The new sales office will further develop new business opportunities in the premium packaging and graphical segments, where the qualities of Invercote are especially preferred. ""We believe it is a clear advantage to have two channels into this demanding market,"" Arvid Sundblad concludes."
Albéa kicks off its digital revolution,"While digital is changing the rules of the game in the cosmetic market, Albéa is taking part to this transformation by implementing digital collaboration between its teams and experts networks, increasing the digitalization in its manufacturing sites and processes and developing the connectivity of its packaging. The group also strengthens its digital relationship with its customers, especially on social networks (Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and WeChat in China) and through the development of regional websites to be closer from its customers (the Indonesian site is already online). ""Global and local brands want to go ever faster on the market with instant value information,"" says the supplier of packaging solutions in a release. In this context, Albéa has developed the Albéa Connect app, which was presented in preview during the latest edition of MakeUp in Paris. This first experience of a B2B app in the packaging sector is part of the Albéa's strategy to strengthen its digital relationship with personal care brands. In a first step, the application has been offered to Albéa's sales teams. ""With this new app, Albéa provides its sales teams with an innovative system of instant visual recognition allowing their smartphone to recognize Albéa packaging and all useful information in few seconds. While holding the pack in your hands, you can explore all the product's featured and value proposition in an instant wherever you are - at the office, in a meeting or at a tradeshow. A new dynamic and efficient way to access information at all times."" Once the pack is identified, this user-friendly app gives you full access to all information about Albéa group and its latest innovations: product technical specifications, decoration capabilities, marketing stories, make-up effects… as well as videos of manufacturing sites, processes and product tutorials. Finally the user can send a direct request via the App for follow-up. With updates per year, the group is already thinking about other functionalities and user-experiences for this App that will bring even closer its sales force and all its customers worldwide. In September at Luxepack Monaco 2016, Albéa will release officially the first version of The Albéa Connect app, featuring all Albéa's latest innovations. Furthermore, to mark its immersion in the digital age, Albéa will present at Luxe Pack a fully digital booth as well as a series of innovations addressing major trends: customization and accelerated time to market."
Sulzer acquires Geka and enters the cosmetics market,"Through the acquisition of Geka, Sulzer Mixpac Systems (SMS) - a business unit of Sulzer's Chemtech division - is doubling its size and is gaining critical industrial mass and segment and geographical diversification. The SMS business unit is specializing in innovative high precision plastic injection moulding and develops proprietary B2B mixing and applicator solutions for the dental and industrial adhesives markets ""Both businesses share the same industrial core in high precision plastic injection moulding, which allows for significant cost synergies. Geka and SMS have complementary geographic manufacturing footprints, which will enable the combined business to compete globally as a leading solution provider,"" explained Sulzer in a release. SMS will add Geka's position in the cosmetics segment to its current leadership in the dental and industrial adhesive segments, thus extending its portfolio of B2B end-market segments for high-precision plastic injection moulding applications. Furthermore, SMS will combine its own healthcare business with Geka's emerging healthcare business. Geka, one of the world's leading manufacturers of brushes, applicators and complete packaging systems for the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries, has approximately 900 employees and has two manufacturing locations in Germany, one in the USA, and one in Brazil. In 2015, Geka opened sales and sourcing offices in Shanghai and Hong Kong. In addition, the company has successfully expanded its production capabilities in the US. With the acquisition of Oeka, a German manufacturer of plastics and metal components, in 2015, Geka has strengthened its foothold in the prestige market segment. Geka is expected to achieve revenues of around EUR 150 million and an EBITDA of around EUR 27 million in 2016. ""We look forward to working with Sulzer for the next chapter in our development and believe that Geka will benefit greatly from the opportunities in the healthcare market which our collaboration with Sulzer will bring,"" said Amaury de Menthière, CEO of Geka. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter, subject to regulatory approval. Sulzer, which will take on all Geka employees, expects a cost synergy run rate of EUR 9 million within three years."
PACKMAN: Banking on inventiveness and flexibility,"The creation of the PACKMAN company stemmed from a simple observation: there is a demand for very high quality and ultra-technical parts that only a few producers are able to make. ""It's the famous rare bird, the one everyone is looking for but that's always too expensive,"" explained Rémi de Précourt, co-founder and Director of the company. This was precisely the demand of the Reload Labs brand, a concept of light, reloadable, customizable, mini spray launched last October, and for which PACKMAN designed seven technically very different products combining Zamak, aluminium and plastic with a palette of Leather & PU material effects. Meanwhile, the Clarins Group entrusted the PACKMAN company with the design of the cap for the new perfume Azzaro pour Homme ""Wanted"". This metal cap is a combination of four different materials. PACKMAN also took part in the creation of other complex products for the Group, such as the cap of the Angel Etoile Collection, a multifaceted cap made of Zamak fitted on a PCTA crystal base or the pedestal of the women's perfume Alien by Thierry Mugler for which a specific galvanizing process had to be developed. To meet the very specific needs of its clients, PACKMAN evaluated 80 factories in China to eventually select three. ""It took us a full year,"" admitted Rémi de Précourt. The company also has a team based in China. ""We always strive to go beyond the simple trading – that does not suit the requirements of very complex and specific projects – and offer a real co-development with partners with a real technical competence. This philosophy, backed up by a local presence in China has allowed us to enter into exclusive agreements with our partners."" Beyond purely technical concerns, the PACKMAN co-founders have also wished to create a next-generation company, an inventive, innovative and responsive smart company, capable of working on a multitude of materials, and remain the sole interlocutor of brands. ""Today we need to speed up processes by streamlining procedures, moving forward as much as possible from the earliest stages of design of the project, thanks to a real partnership between the supplier and the client. From this view point, the lightness of our organization is also a big asset. Even the development of tools can be performed in a very short time and therefore guarantee our clients a good time to market,"" concluded Rémi de Précourt. In two years more than twenty references designed by PACKMAN were launched on the market. The company's forecasts are very promising, with many projects in the pipeline and especially the launch of a major innovation planned in a few months from now and which should be a growth driver."
Aptar expands its Irresistible range to address the success of natural cosmetics,"For Aptar beauty + home, there's no doubt about the current trend: preservative free cosmetics (or, at least, cosmetics with a reduced concentration of preservatives) are booming! ""According to figures from Mintel, over the period 2011-2015, the occurrence of the paraben free claim reaches 25% in Europe,"" says Florence Roullet, Skin Care & Color Cosmetics Laboratory Director at Aptar. ""And today, the United States are overtaking Europe."" Furthermore, consumers' suspicion is finding its way to regulations with public authorities, both in Europe and in the United State, attempting to pass more restrictive regulations on these issues. And sometimes, brands voluntarily decide to ban certain ingredients from their own formulations. ""Ultimately, this situation results in a shortened list of preservatives that are permitted in cosmetic products. Such a situation is highly challenging for formulators, but also for safety assessors, because a preservative-free cosmetic product is obviously more fragile and more likely to be contaminated by microorganisms,"" adds Florence Roullet. ""It is therefore important to adopt a global approach of the formula protection, which includes the use of a suitable packaging."" To address this demand, Aptar launched in 2010 a dispensing system named Irresistible, which associates two successive barriers against external microbial contaminations. – The first barrier protects the product from bacteria in the air. The pump uses 0.2 micron sterilizing filters that can stop the smallest bacteria. The technology is derived from the pharmaceutical industry, specially from nasal preservatives-free sprays. – The second barrier protects the product from retro-contamination via a contact of the user's fingers with the tip of the pump. The ""Irresistible"" pump features a shut-off valve, a needle embedded in the actuator which makes any product return impossible in the distribution channel and seals the actuator's orifice. With over 20 million units of the Irresistible range sold since its launch (with customers such as Yves Rocher, Melvita, L'Occitane, Stanhome, Sothys, Lionel de Benetti), Aptar is now the leader in this highly promising segment of the dermo-cosmetic category. To provide brands with an enlarged choice, the French supplier is declining this system in all the usual sizes intended for face products, with the addition of 20 ml, 30 ml and 50 ml sizes to the 40 ml bottle launched in 2010. Brands now have access to a full range of protective packaging !"
Eurovetrocap enters the make-up packaging market with Euromakeup,"With the creation of its Euromakeup subsidiary this year, the Eurovetrocap group is looking to take a new step forward in the make-up category. The new company is dedicated to the production and sale of primary packaging for all kinds of colour cosmetic products. It will supply companies in the make-up sector, from the contract fillers to the small and big brands in Europe and around the world, starting with Italian firms, whose excellence is recognized worldwide. ""Our aim is to replicate the business model of Eurovetrocap, which is based on a wide range, flexible MOQs, reduced time to market, efficient customer care, and competitive prices,"" explains Giampaolo Herrmann, General Director of the group. ""Our goal is to become a reliable partner with whom to develop successful projects."" The range includes a wide offer of make-up typologies: mascara packaging, foundation glass and plastic bottles and jars from 5 ml to 50 ml, airless pumps, lipstick cases, eyeliner packs and the Beautilock, an innovative air tight compact packaging featuring a special seal valve developed to offer a solution to drying issues of water and solvent based formulas. The Beautilock is a packaging made only by the assembling of three pieces, and its design is patent pending. Euromakeup intends to build on its privileged position within an industrial district packed with specialized suppliers mastering the most specific processes, allowing it to closely monitor the entire production process, from the development of the moulds to the decoration of the final packaging. ""With our team of designers and technicians we are able to develop innovative projects starting from a research on the latest trends, or from the customer idea. We use cutting-edge software for 3D modelling and rendering, as well as CNC machines and 3D printers for prototyping,"" Herrmann adds. The new company benefits from the support Eurovetrocap in all phases of the manufacturing and delivery processes, from the selection of the raw materials to the executions of orders. ""Each year, thousands of checks are performed in Eurovetrocap's laboratory, including vacuum leakage tests, tightening and separation force test for the caps, as well as aging tests in request to ensure compatibility of the packaging with our customers' products."" As flexibility and agility are key factors of success, and Euromakeup will also enjoys full access to the Eurovetrocap Group's warehouse facilities, which offers more than 22,000 pallet spaces between the Milan and Florence sites, managed by a latest generation software able to process thousands of orders per year minimizing the lead Times. ""Logistic technology is one of our strengths globally recognised,"" concludes the General Director of Eurovetrocap."
Glass: STO Masnières has just undergone a metamorphosis,"Those who knew the old Masnières glass factory and have not visited it recently will probably not recognize it! It only took a few months for Austrian group Stölzle Glass (STO), one of the main European glass packaging manufacturers for perfumery-cosmetics, luxury spirits, and pharmaceutical products, to transform the site. The objective was to make it a centre of excellence and the group's main point of entry for perfumery and cosmetics. Old disused buildings were destroyed, the others were rebuilt or renovated, and a showroom is under development, with meeting rooms and conviviality spaces for customers to receive the best welcome. ""We are enhancing our glassmaking business so we can provide the excellence brands demand and best celebrate its 200 years in 2018 – and prepare it for the next 200 years,"" jokes Étienne Gruyez, General Manager of the Perfumes & Cosmetics Business Unit. There is no doubt that, once the transitional difficulties following the site purchase from the Bormioli Rocco Group in December 2013 were overcome, STO worked exceptionally hard to make the Masnières glass factory the new standard bearer of their high-end perfumery & cosmetics business. Once the liquidation proceedings had ended in May 2015, the group invested 5 million euros to purchase new machines and renovate the site. Over the year 2016, 5 other million euros will be dedicated to automating quality control and decoration capacities, in particular by increasing the lacquering machine, hot stamping machine, and inkjet printers stock. Lastly, 3 to 4 million euros are also planned to be invested in 2017. All in all, it makes at least 14 million euros of investment in three years, plus 1 more million euros for a staff training programme (13% of the wage bill), to have a multi-skilled workforce on all production levels. ""We got outstanding support from our customers throughout the transitional period. Today, they can see the outcome of the investments made and the site transformation,"" explains Étienne Gruyez. With their 335 employees, an 80-ton furnace, and four production lines, including a mixed line for cosmetics, STO Masnières has been the point of entry and centre of excellence of the Stölzle Glass group's Perfumes & Cosmetics BU since February 1, 2016, alongside the Stölzle Częstochowa site in Poland (more than 500 employees and four production lines) and Stölzle Flaconnage site in England (two lines), which is mainly intended for the British market. In addition to building renovation and modernization, STO dedicated their first investments to upgrading the Masnières sites and ensuring perfect fluidity and uniform quality between their various production units throughout Europe. For example, quality control was largely automated by purchasing new aesthetic and dimensional monitoring machines with cameras. Once they have reached the end of the line, all cold batches are inspected, sorted out, and marked to be tracked down with a bar code. ""The Stölzle Glass group actually forms a single entity to provide our customers with ten production lines and a significant growth capacity,"" emphasizes Étienne Gruyez. STO Masnières now has their own foundry for making single moulds for test products and repairing and maintaining production moulds. Here, the idea is to be the fastest at placing products on the market. ""Reactivity is a guiding principle. That is what helped us win our latest markets,"" adds the General Manager. Now that they have a site located just a two hours' drive from Paris, Stölzle Glass aims to capitalize on this closeness to offer a service combining irreproachable quality, speed, agility, and flexibility. ""Once the project has been finalized, we can deliver the first glass prototype within 15 days, by producing all our test sections internally, from the first 3D-printed prototypes to the first glass test."" And it is also to gain some speed that the decoration capacities have been enhanced. Today, 80% of the decoration is carried out internally. Lastly, the group has been focusing on innovation, with an objective of 10 new launches by the end of the year. This very ambitious task was entrusted to Franck Legrand, the new Development & Innovation Director. ""We have more than 14 solutions under study right now, some of which are almost finalized, while others are still in the initial study phase,"" he adds. ""Brands expect their suppliers to come up with proposals."" A new range of perfumery standard bottles is already available, and a range designed for cosmetics is under preparation and will be showcased at the Luxe Pack Monaco show. In order to meet the high demand in this field, decoration has become one of the main innovation areas, with several finishing effects: the brushed carbon effect (Carbon Spray) developed in collaboration with plasturgists to produce a similar effect to that obtained with plastic on the glass, the crackle effect (Crackle Spray), a hot treatment that gives glass an iridescent metal mirror aspect, and for which STO holds a patent, a concrete lacquering effect, a colour effect (Prismatic Spray), a degraded partial lacquering effect (Indexed Spraying), and a glitter effect (Glitter Spray). In this field, STO's perfumes & cosmetics activity benefits from the group's expertise in the field of spirits. ""If material effects still account for most decoration requests, our customers expect a lot more now,"" adds Franck Legrand. ""Interactive decorations and accessory integration are two of the techniques currently under study"". The other innovation areas have to do with the very structure of the glass: the company is working on making it lighter, as demand is quite high, both for ecological and economic reasons, and unbreakable. ""We are far from having explored all opportunities. There are still endless possibilities to mix techniques and explore new shapes or more economic processes,"" he concludes. By investing simultaneously on all key aspects of competitiveness (reactivity, closeness, agility, and innovation), STO makes their ambitions pretty clear and does intend to gain market shares and be in a favourable position when brands get out of the ""flanker cycle"" and decide to reinvest in new launches. Beyond perfumery, the group is considering developing its presence on the cosmetics segment, where the share of glass – which plays a determining role in increasing the value perceived by customers – keeps rising. Now that the site's industrial transformation is almost over, STO Masnières aims for a 25% growth by 2020. Indeed, a second furnace is all ready to be assembled, as soon as demand justifies its use!"
Make-up cases: Italy's Marino Belotti is staying on the leading edge!,"Premium Beauty News - You are a proof that a manufacturer specialized in plastic injected parts for the beauty industry, and on top of it, for a very specific product - make-up cases, can be successful! Marco Sorze - You are right! And even be very successful since we are supporting our Customers with a production process based in two working shifts (three if necessary!) in our two production sites located in Chiuduno near Bergamo. This can be done thanks to our several production equipments (injection moulding machines, decoration machines and assembly equipments). Premium Beauty News - What is your secret? Marco Sorze - I would be tempted to answer with a single word: ""Quality""! But not only. One of the strong points of our company is that the entire production process, from the creative idea to the final product, are handled in-house. All projects are backed up by a wealth of experience accumulated over years of packaging production. Moulds are made internally by our workshop, which was the origin of the company. And this is why we are so competitive in terms of time to market response and flexibility. Our Industrial and Developing Department together with our Design Department are always developing new delivery systems, new visuals according to the raw materials, to come up with creations at the forefront of market trends. We work in close contact with our customers to ensure a perfect blend of colours and shape between the packaging and the contents, transforming a standard packaging in a tailor made product, with industrial footprint. Premium Beauty News - Your range of standard products is one of your specificities? Marco Sorze - Absolutely! They represent more than 80% of our business. And we are capable of customizing this range according to the needs of our customers. Customization is achieved through our capacity for completion, ranging from lacquering to varnishing including electroplating, hot stamping and pad printing, as well as debossed/embossed designs. We can process all plastic materials available on the market, from SAN to PMMA including polystyrene and ABS. Premium Beauty News - What are your objectives in terms of exports? Marco Sorze - Our export share is still around 40%, Europe excepted (with Italy coming first with 45% followed by France and Germany), but we clearly have the ambition to increment operations into the U.S."
Eurovetrocap: Agility and sustainability as key factors of success,"Eurovetrocap's history started in the 1940s with a first glasswork built by the Cattaneo family in Milan, which was sold to the Bormioli Rocco Group in the 1970. The Cattaneos then established a new company dedicated to the sales and decoration of glass and plastic containers for the cosmetic industry Eurovetrocap srl. During the last 35-years, the group has seen significant growth, also through the acquisition of some competitors, thanks to its strategy, designed to meet the requirements of the cosmetic industry and its fragmented supply chain. In 2015, Eurovetrocap had a turnover of 40 million euros, 100 employees, a sales force in 30 countries. Their products are currently sold in 98 markets with more than 3500 customers. ""The keys of our success are a guaranteed quality, in particular through a ISO9001 certification, short delivery times, the possibility to supply small quantities of standard products, and 20 resources dedicated to support customers,"" explain the company's managers. With one of the widest product range available on the market, Eurovetrocap offers an almost unrivalled variety of shapes and materials but still strives to expand its offering year on year with many new items being added. ""We are making efforts to develop new shapes, to use innovative materials and to improve engineering of new devices suitable to make our product always safer, cheaper and more effective,"" claims the company. To meet its customers' demands, Eurovetrocap stores more than 15,000 pallets of standard goods, between the warehouses in Milan and Florence and is now completing the enlarging of the Milan warehouse from 15,000 to 22,000 pallets to meet the demand for big quantities orders of standard items, and the number of references. To date 1,600 is references are immediately available and an automatic picking system allows collecting even less than 1,000 pieces per order in few days. The lead-time for standard items is about two weeks. ""Small quantities service is one of our strength since we started to work with the first cosmetic companies. A service that helps not only small laboratories but also bigger ones that need to make several pilot launches during the year."" In order to further reduce lead times, especially for the customized items, Eurovetrocap created a business community with its main suppliers that moved their production in the surrounding of the company's headquarter. A large variety of decoration techniques are also available to customised the products, including pad printing, traditional and UV silkscreen printing, lacquering, hotfoil stamping, metallization, galvanization, metal embossing/debossing, 3D sublimation and digital printing on glass. Eurovetrocap also made huge investments in renewable energy sources with aim to reduce its environmental footprint - in particular CO2 emissions - and meet the growing requirements of cosmetic brands with regards to sustainability. Since 2011, the energy necessary for the company's offices, warehouses and decoration equipment, has been provided by solar panels of 200 and 100 KwP. In winter, when the sun light is not enough to ensure the company's energetic autonomy, additional power derived from renewable sources is supplied by Repower. Furthermore, Eurovetrocap created INFINI-PACK, a collection of post consumer and post industrial PP, HDPE and glass. Eventually, the company offers BioBased HDPE, also known as Green PE, a raw material obtained from the maceration of the sugar cane plants."
Reboul to unveil two new lipstick mechanisms at Luxe Pack New York,"Reboul, a French company specializing in the production of high copper and brass components and cosmetic packaging for luxury products, and the inventor of the R2000 mechanism, will showcase two new lipstick mechanisms at the next edition of Luxe Pack New York, on May 11th and 12th at Pier 92 in New York City, and at the next MakeUp in Paris in June. First in the list, the RClips, a new version of the R2000 featuring a no glue hanging between the aluminium shell and the plastic spiral thus allowing a regular torque. According to the company, this conception meets the most demanding requirements in climatic testing and sturdiness. The other innovation, the RBackfilling, is a new three-piece only mechanism perfectly aligned. ""It suits to thin covering and the dough can be inserted by the bottom,"" highlights the company. ""Of course, it can also be inserted by the top."" These two mechanisms will be entirely recyclable. In addition, Reboul will launch ""La Perlite"", a new coating process on the aluminium cover. According to the company, this new coating brings a ""pearly look"" to the packaging, with a better sturdiness than classic anodization. The process allows the creation of a myriad of pastel tints never seen in beauty products so far. To develop these products, Reboul has invested 3.5 million euros (about 3.9 million dollars), mainly with two assembly lines for the mechanisms."
Linea Glam: Innovation as a target!,"Premium Beauty News - A few words on your positioning! Mauro Zulianello - It can be summarized by saying that we always do our outmost best to meet all market needs in terms of primary packaging to serve the Cosmetic, Personal Care and Make-up sector but also the Pharmaceutical Industry. What make us unique are our transparent working methods with all our customers, by offering them not only articles but also by highlighting how and where their products were made. Because behind each and every article, a huge amount of development and testing is necessary before the product hits the shelves and meets as best as possible market expectations. Moreover our flexibility comes from the fact we can be either agents or distributors, and the customer is perfectly free to chose what solution suits him best, not only aesthetically speaking but also in terms of conditions and logistics. Our customers appreciate our role as consultants or expert advisors with over 15 years experience in packaging and still as passionate about our activity. Our customers trust us for the quality products and services we offer them, providing them with customized, fast, and adaptable solutions. Our French and Taiwanese offices respectively in Poissy and Taoyuan consistently and efficiently manage the product development processes, logistics, and whenever it is necessary, the sourcing of new products and partners. We offer standard packaging solutions through a complete range of airless containers with various shapes and capacities, cream jars, make-up packagings as well as other accessories. But for customers who are looking for customized solutions related to their brand, packaging is a crucial element in the development of each product to help a product stand out from the crowd. That's why we help our customer to find and study a set of shapes, materials and capacities that make the discovery of what a product contains, unique and exciting. Quality certification and environmental needs of our partners are in line with the most rigorous international standard and constantly updated to meet our customers' requirements for a ""sustainable development"". This is why our main objective is to maintain a constant high level of service for all our customers, always and in all circumstances. The strong dynamic activity in the packaging industry is naturally boosting our innate creative strength and our ever renewed spirit of challenge toward the market. Premium Beauty News - Most of your partners are Koreans? Mauro Zulianello - Yes, this allows us to offer, almost systematically, new and above all, particularly innovative products. More broadly it enables us to develop highly customized projects, starting from a simple idea, through a feasibility study, research of materials, functionality, compatibility, industrialization, and then the finished product ready for use. We strongly believe that a packaging is more than a mere container, beyond a visual expression and a distinctive way: it should reflect excellence! Together, we create innovative and attractive lines! With Hana, for example, we launched a new scientific packaging, the Micro Pump Airless Compact. This innovative packaging design is to achieve all women's dream to carry all liquid-based cosmetics products, such as eye cream, BB cream, CC cream and serum, safely and conveniently in their handbags from and back to home. The exclusive packaging science of the Micro Pump Airless Compact is equipped with a micro pump engine and pouch system. The micro pump is the smallest airless pump to protect formulas with no metal contact and with a fine dosage. The idea of a refillable container was also chosen for this new compact. The Micro Pump Airless Compact (Ø: 74.1mm; H: 27mm), has a capacity of 13 15 gr. and a standard output of 0.20cc. The material of the outer compact is ABS and the inner refill case and lid consists of PCTA, the pouch is made of PE and the case of PP. The disc can be personalized with a PETG (in-mould labeling), metalized, or simply a plastic label. It is also available in three versions of ports (24, 8, or 1 port) depending of the customers' formulations. Premium Beauty News - What partner for what future? Mauro Zulianello - Atually we wanted to expand our product range with an extraordinary choice of pumps. That's why we turned our eyes again to Korea and approached the Chong Woo Company. It is a company with 150 employees, specialized in the manufacture of pumps, sprays, lotions and airless systems, which has no less than 50 injection machines and about 20 assembly machines. We plan to develop projects with them concerning new application systems using their pumps in the hair care and skincare segments. Pumps are a very technical and very versatile product, which therefore requires very specific manufacturing processes and knowledge."
Albéa launches Cats'Eyes a new range of mascara fibre brushes for a wide eyed look,"As every year, Albéa presented a new range of mascara brushes at the Cosmopack trade show in Bologna. The Cats' Eyes range features a series of extra slim fibre mascara brushes to enable agility in application. ""The extra slim design is very user-friendly and is suited to all types of lashes, even the small, straight and stiff ones,"" explains the French supplier. The new range includes two new brushes: Panther and Lynx. With its curved shape and its short fibres, the extra thin Panther brush was designed to deliver a perfect combination of coating and curling performance. ""Its design offers great agility in the gesture: the ergonomic curved comb brush pushes and curls simultaneously all the lashes from the root,"" explains Albéa. As far as the Lynx brush is concerned, it was designed to maximise volume. Thanks to its thin design, it is a very intuitive tool. The threaded rod reaches easily the base of the eyelashes and pushes them up to achieve a wide-eyed look. ""This extra slim brush with short fibres provides immediate access to the formula: in one stroke, the brush coats the lashes from root to tip for exceptional volume."" The two brushes are completely customizable from brush design to fibre options. Furthermore, the two packs presented by Albéa featured a special texture, developed in partnership with Eschmann Textures. This unique Cera-Shibo technology, which consists in the insertion of special sheet in the mould, can be applied on custom bottles as well as on Albéa's stock mascara bottles. These innovative brushes have been developed through the Albéa Tips Studio. This program brings together all the group's expertise and experience in applicators, from fibre and plastic mascara brushes to lipgloss, eyeliner and other beauty tips. It offers global opportunities for creating, developing and producing applicators for all-new beauty gestures and make-up effects. Albéa will also introduce its new Cat's Eyes range to Korean brands on the occasion of the next MakeUp in Seoul show, which will take place on 6-7 March 206 at the Conrad Hotel in Seoul."
"Geka opts for the ""TGV""!","Premium Beauty News - A good 2015 year and good prospects for 2016? Amaury de Menthière - Absolutely! Following the take over of the Oeka Company and of its activities, we are, as you can imagine, in an important consolidation phase. Among the important decisions, we will keep, of course, the Bamberg site, but the lacquering and metallization line will be transferred from the Korbußen site in eastern Germany to the Bamberg site and the line's production capacity will be doubled on the same occasion. This resulted in some significant industrial investments to support our growth. And don't forget that 2015 was also the year that marked the start of our production plant in Brazil, where we produce the containers for mascaras that we decorate. While the brush production remains in Germany. Of course, the Brazilian plant's productivity is scheduled to gain momentum this year. Premium Beauty News - You also stress on the diversification operated by the Group in the «Health"" sector! A strategic issue! Amaury de Menthière - Strategic, indeed! But finally very close to the expertise developed by Geka and Oeka who had also invested in that direction. We created a fully fledged HealthCare division to develop specific applicators. A division for which we have high hopes and that we strengthened through partnership agreements with several industry colleagues, such as the Rommelag and Neopac companies. Premium Beauty News - A few words on your so-called T.G.V. strategy? Amaury de Menthière - In our ever changing trade, you have to be fast, - like the French high speed TGV trains - hence this image, which could also mean ""T"" for Transversality..., i.e., having a presence both in the Beauty sector and in the ""Health"" and ""Accessories"" sector.... ""G"" for Globalization..., which we illustrate perfectly with a commercial foothold everywhere in the world, and industrially, in Brazil, the U.S. and Europe. Finally ""V"" for Verticality, in other words our aim to control the production process from A to Z. Mascara being a good example since we are capable of manufacturing the entire product: we are present from the fibres of our brushes that we manufacture ourselves, to the filling of the bulk and we are also capable of creating our own formulas if we want. Note that in the U.S., we recently increased our production capacity with new injection and injection blow moulding machines and we also strengthened our sales teams with, among others, the opening of an office on the West coast. In Asia, we recently opened two offices in China, one in Shanghai and the other in Hong Kong."
Sussex IM proposes a connected packaging,"Premium Beauty News - A few words about your company.... And what does ""IM"" stand for? Keith Everson - IM stands for Innovative Manufacturing, as well as Injection Molding. The Company has a long history. It is a spin-off of Hartland Plastics, which was acquired in 1963 by Revlon to develop makeup compacts and cosmetic packaging. In 1977, several individuals from Hartland Plastics started Sussex Plastics. Revlon became the first customer. The company was a value-added, entrepreneurial start-up focused upon cosmetic packaging innovation. In 1999, the company was bought by the Rexam Group. This was a strategic acquisition for Rexam that needed a best-of-breed North American cosmetic packaging site to fit into their global cosmetics strategy. Over the next 10 years Rexam grew its plastic sector to 72 plants with sales of $2.2 billion. In 2010 Rexam, decided to begin divest of its plastic sector and sold Sussex to us, and it became SussexIM. Our strategy then became to work with a balanced group of global leading brands and focus on innovation, from market focus to solving universal consumer problems. Premium Beauty News - A few key figures? Keith Everson - We currently employ some 400 employees and we plan to hire 30-40 employees in 2016. Our turnover in 2015 was US$65 million and the objective for 2016 is to reach US$70 million. Our primary investment in 2015 was the acquisition of Mogo (an innovative flavoured/scented mouthguard, a company we helped develop) for more than US$1 million. They created the exclusive, long-lasting Mogo Flavor Technology. In 2016, we plan to invest between US$ 5-10 million, which includes the development of a new facility (also based in Sussex). Premium Beauty News - What is your strategy, in a few words? Keith Everson - We want to grow in the cosmetic market and double our sales. Sales in that sector currently represents US$10 million, and our objective is to reach the US$20 million mark, by concentrating on North America and, in particular, the U.S. market. To reach this objective, we will obviously rely on innovation, particularly through our mastery of in-mould labelling. Our new digital-in-mold-watermarked-label development is now available for commercialization. The appeal of this technology is great for brands looking to connect to their consumers via their iPhone and to build a Brand community linking social-media to the brand. The process is cost- and time-efficient, and opens new brand-building horizons. It is a fantastic opportunity for a brand to be connected with customers. It is more than a QR code; it can be connected to a website. You have to load the Digimarc app to try it. One of our additional strengths is our mastery of digital-in-mould-labels to provide flexible quick change decoration that offers gloss, matte, and soft-touch laminations."
"Cosmetic Specialties International: Packaging, packaging... Nothing but packaging!","Premium Beauty News - Your company's strong point is its almost total integration? Kenton Gedwed - We do want to emphasize on the fact that our company is a leading plastic injection manufacturer providing end-to-end packaging services. We are not a wholesaler or broker we are a factory-direct supplier. Our customers appreciate one-stop shopping from tooling and production to in-house decorating from our single-source facility in Southern California. Our full-service capabilities include on-site tooling / mould design, design / engineering, rapid product prototyping, standard and recycled resin, and in-house decorating / assembly. We provide hot stamp foil banding on closures, offset Printing, silk Screening. Since 1978, we are a US Based manufacturer and distributor of innovative packaging solutions for the Beauty and Personal Care Industries. We make single and double wall jars and closures, but also custom cosmetic components and we are a national leader in mechanical pencils and nail closure design and manufacturing. Premium Beauty News - You require minimum quantities? And one of your assets remains the design and manufacture of moulds... Kenton Gedwed - We accept 25,000 pieces Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ), but we are always willing to be flexible with the MOQ in certain instances for a customer. You are right! Great tools make great products. Our mould design and build experience in the US and worldwide sets the industry standard for the highest quality injection moulds. Premium Beauty News - You have invested a lot in silk screen printing. Kenton Gedwed - That's right! It is one of the most popular decorating options. You are familiar with the technique of course. This process involves starting off with camera ready artwork, creating a film positive, (a photo image of the artwork), burning the image onto a photo-sensitive specified screen mesh and then pressing the ink through a screen with a squeegee , allowing the color to be applied only where desired. Each color is applied separately using a new screen to give a crisp design. The advantages of this printing process are the following: – Direct-to-surface printing. – UV curable inks. – Can decorate 360-degrees of the container surface. – High-speed production. – Multi-color capabilities.. But we also master offset printing and hot stamping. In offset printing the image of the design is transferred to plates rather than a screen. Each plate is individually engraved for every colour used; the ink is then transferred to a rubber ""blanket."" Blankets are attached to a rotating wheel, and each blanket contains one colour. Whereas in screen printing a separate pass is required for each colour, in offset printing, the entire process is done in a single pass. The advantages are: – Precise replication of even delicate designs and artwork when artwork has halftone printing demands. – Up to 2 pass application. – Direct-to-surface printing. Hot stamping is the technique of applying metallic accents to a closure through the use of heat, pressure and dies. The die is embossed with the image to be transferred to the surface of the container. The embossed die is then heated, pressing the foil onto the container. This method can be used to roll a 360-degree foil stripe around a closure. Main advantages of this printing technique: – Does not require post-curing or treatment. – Can be applied in stock gold or silver color. – Custom colors are also available upon request. – Offers precise design placement. Eventually, multi-process decorating which, as the name implies, combines a number of techniques — offset printing and hot stamping. Advantages of multi-process decorating: – Offers a high degree of customization. – Ideal for high-end items or to create a strong brand message. – Provides strong product standout on store shelves. Premium Beauty News - What are your main markets? And what will your next investments be? Kenton Gedwed - We serve some of the world's largest and most respected cosmetics, hair care, nail care, spa, bath & body, wellness, OTC, natural, and organic brands. We have developed many ""firsts"" in stock and custom packaging. Today, we are one of the leading U.S. manufacturers of cosmetic pencils, double-wall jars, caps, liners, dispensing caps, specialty closures, sealing discs and other products in traditional plastics and acrylics, and manufactures more than 200 million parts annually. As for investments, we strive to constantly improve our fleet of machines dedicated to injection (three new machines these past months), decoration and mould making."
For Westrock customization is key to a successful fragrance launch,"At Luxe Pack Monaco, last October, and at PCD in Paris, last week, WestRock presented a suite of fragrance decoration and customization options created within its Creative Studio for Fragrance. The Studio represents a sampling of dispensing solutions for fragrance - pairing decorative overtubes, WestRock's NoC invisible dip tube, and customized collars and actuators with new capabilities in extensions for spray caps - to create the innovative aesthetic effects. ""After having segmented vaporization, we focused ourselves on decoration and on ways to attract consumer's attention. It is increasingly important to give consumers the impression that each product is made for them,"" highlights Sandy Gregory, Marketing Director Global Fragrance & EU Beauty at Westrock. According to WestRock, consumers are looking to fragrance brands to provide new ways of self-expression and offer unique, tailored experiences. ""As brand owners are constantly on a quest to enhance the fragrance experience for consumers, they need a packaging partner who can help further unlock creativity and allow ideas to come to life in a practical, efficient way,"" says the supplier of packaging solutions. The Creative Studio for Fragrance is an example of what is possible with WestRock's customization capabilities for the Melodie pump which include: – Decorative elements, including overtubes, to allow for more design options and a differentiated look to help set brands apart; – WestRock's NoC invisible dip tube, which becomes the perfect complement as the patented invisible dip tube technology does not interfere with the design elements of the overtube and works cohesively with the rest of the pack; and – WestRock's Melodie Clikit technology, which allows the finished elements to be delivered to brand owners as a one-piece, pre-assembled unit. ""At WestRock, we study how consumers interact with packaging. We know from our insights work, which helped launch the Emotions of Spray Collection, that consumers notice, appreciate and feel connected by the nuances of the total fragrance experience: the way the spray touches their skin, the sound it makes as they spray and, of course, the overall look that will remind them of the magic of the story behind the fragrance. All of these elements come together to create a memorable experience with each use,"" concludes Sandy Gregory."
"Coverpla, a glassmaker for niche fragrance brands","Premium Beauty News - Can we say that now, more than ever, Coverpla has settled as the alternative perfume brands' glassmaker? Bruno Diépois - Today, Coverpla supplies almost 60% of the perfume bottles showcased in shows like Pitti Fragranze, a major reference in alternative perfumery. What makes Coverpla unique is its exclusive positioning. We work with the best European glassmakers – Pochet, Bormioli Luigi, or Saverglass – and we accept to manage a huge stock to meet the flexibility needs of our clients. We have a surface area of 8,000 m2 of workshops and warehouses, where we store about 2 million bottles, with 300 references and 1 million caps (with 50 basic references). It represents a high risk, but it also makes it possible for us to offer a matchless service. We are the only ones to have such an important stock. Premium Beauty News - Your service is also characterized by the possibility to produce very small quantities. Bruno Diépois - Definitely, but it is not just that. Brands expect flexibility, and that is what we offer them. Our orders amount to 6,000 euros each, on average, but this figure is not very significant, since the difference between the various orders is huge. In fact, the quantities we are asked to produce usually vary between 3 and 10,000 items per order… although of course, we do receive big orders from time to time. Beyond the reduced quantities we are requested to supply, our business has another feature: flexibility and speed. Can you believe that a third of our monthly turnover is generated by orders placed the very same month?! And we serve about 600 clients a year, which involves 60% of products destined for export. Therefore, we need to be extremely reactive and flexible, and both our sales force and logistics must be very strong. Premium Beauty News - You only work with standards. How can you meet brands' need for personalization, then? Bruno Diépois - First, we have a comprehensive catalogue and varied references, whether in terms of bottles, corking, pumps, or pump covers. Then, we innovate. We must keep creating and launching new designs if we want to attract customers. That is why we design three or four caps a year, in Surlyn, Zamak, aluminium, or wood. We take care of injecting Surlyn caps ourselves. Lastly, there is decoration. We offer a large choice of finishing techniques (decoration, lacquering, frosting…) that we usually use in our own screen printing (enamel - ink) and hot stamping workshop. Premium Beauty News - Is the niche perfumery market still as dynamic as it used to be? Bruno Diépois - We have not observed any slowdown in our market. Indeed, during our most sluggish years, Coverpla reached a growth of at least 2 to 3%. But we work with clients that represent small or medium-sized companies, and they come from all over the world. That is why Coverpla will be present at the CosmeTech CosmeTokyo show on January 20-22, 2016, then at the PCD show in Paris on February 3-4, at Cosmopack-Cosmoprof in Bologna, Italy, on March 17-21, at Beauty Eurasia in Istanbul on April 21-23, at Luxe Pack New York on May 11-12, at ExpoPack Mexico on May 17-20, and at the World Perfumery Congress in Miami on June 14-15, 2016."
Marcel Franck launches a range of luxury pocket sprays,"How can the pleasure of an exceptional perfume be preserved in a very special spray, any time of day, at work or on a trip? Thanks to the mini-spray for bags, answers Marcel Franck, which banks on an ultra-luxurious version of this traditional solution to the mobility problem! The French brand dedicated to luxury sprays for perfumery has developed a mini-spray composed of a glass bottle set in a brass shell and fitted with a pump designed and manufactured by WestRock. The shell can be personalized and ornamented according to fashion trends and/or the customer's needs. And there are many finishes (lacquer, soft lacquer, needle etching, sublimation), colours (fluorescent colours, python), and multiple materials (wood, pink gold, palladium, carbon fibre, etc.) available. ""We offer a collection of standard sprays with a rather classic design, but also a more trendy collection with limited series, depending on fashion trends, in particular bag and shoes trends,"" specifies Bernard Dennery, President. Living up to its reputation, the company has chosen to use the most noble materials (brass rather than zamac), to manufacture its products in Europe (France and Italy for the shells), and to approach craftsmen to design the decorations. ""We have drawn inspiration in particular from the techniques used for decorating luxury watches and glasses, for example with decorations in carbon fibre or guilloched with pink gold or palladium"", Bernard Dennery emphasizes. Marcel Franck sprays are sold with a funnel to make it easier for consumers to fill them in, despite the mounted pump that goes with the original perfume bottle. The company suggests a retail price between 150 and 200 euros, depending on the models and decorations. Lastly, Marcel Franck also offers high-end niche perfume brands to design tailor-made models online with the brands' DNA."
Six key packaging trends set to impact global markets in 2016,"""There's a parallel path between brands striving to engage consumers on a more personal level and consumers' expectations for packaging to deliver that experience,"" explains David Luttenberger, Global Packaging Director at Mintel. ""Digital print that creates 'hyper' personal experiences; clean-label messaging that enhances brand transparency and builds purchasing confidence; eco-responsible packaging that empowers social consciousness; next-gen hybrids that offer functional and environmental benefits alongside great shelf presence; right-sized product packaging that meets consumer needs and shifting use-occasions; and apps that support 'mobile-engaged' packaging. These are the key themes we see resonating with consumers in 2016."" Digital evolution Digital printing is capturing brands' attention by creating opportunities to engage consumers on a local, personal and even emotional level. Mintel forecasts that 2016 will mark the tipping point for digital package printing, as brands move beyond using it for limited editions and personalization, and capitalize on its economic and speed-to-market advantages for mainstream package decoration. Show me the goods With the growing number of on-pack claims competing for shoppers' attention, consumers are demanding more information about what they are really buying but seeking less on-pack clutter that confuses their purchasing decisions. Looking ahead, the concepts of clean labelling and clear on-pack communication are set to converge. Phenomenal flexibles According to Mintel, flexible packaging (specifically pouches) is no longer considered a trade-off. But at what point will it become non-differentiated? ""Truly innovative brands are looking to the next generation of rigid/flexible hybrids that offer functional and environmental benefits alongside great shelf presence,"" says the market research firm. More than ""just"" green packaging When product price and perceived product quality are equal, consumers will be increasingly turning to eco- and alternative-use attributes as the deciding purchasing factor, and brands cannot afford to ignore this as they develop their brand positioning and marketing strategies. Size matters The ability to reach consumers in time-shifting use occasions means brands must offer a greater range of pack sizes. Mintel says that in 2016, brands must deliver packaging that consumers see as right-sized for themselves and shifting use-occasions in order to overcome the growing lack of brand loyalty. Packaging ""mobil-ution"" Last but not least, Mintel says there's a revolution happening in mobile-engaged packaging tapping near-field communication (NFC) and bluetooth low-energy (BLE). ""Moving forward, as brands clamour for innovative ways to engage with shoppers, the mobile environment will become the new front line in the battle to win consumers' hearts, minds and wallets,"" the market research firm concludes. Mintel's Global Packaging Trends 2016 is available here."
"3C Inc., a service of its own!","Premium Beauty News - You have quite a few examples of brands that started with you, to then become major beauty players? Lou Della Pesca - That's true! In a way it's our trademark in the United States. Small and medium businesses have been our core market for almost 32 years.

"With Pure Drop, the Pochet Group and Samhwa aim to transform the skincare experience","Pure Drop is the product of a paradox; although airless is the type of packaging best suited to distributing complex or fragile cosmetic formulas, it is comparatively underrepresented in the luxury goods sector as it is limited by a field of considerable aesthetic and practical constraints. ""Airless represents the future of Skin Care and is an excellent solution for ensuring the protection of skin care formulas facing increasingly strict regulations and the growing expectations of consumers. We have endeavoured to find a solution to free airless from these constraints,"" highlights Tristan Farabet, Managing Director of the Pochet Group. Indeed, Pure Drop claims to be the solution to two types of aesthetic and practical constraints, offering t brands: – A system that gives them the total freedom of packaging design whilst fully benefitting from the combination of materials and savoir-faire of the Pochet Group, – Technical capabilities that go beyond the state of the art materials boundaries. Indeed, as far as technical capabilities are concerned, Pure Drop has inherited the expertise of Samhwa Plastic, a pioneer in airless technology in South Korea. ""Pure Drop has the ability to distribute high viscosity formulas with high restitution rate and perfectly controlled dosage, combined with a rewarding technical image for increasingly sophisticated high-end formulas that use fragile and precious ingredients,"" explains Sung Hwan Cho CEO of Samhwa Plastic. Regarding aesthetics, the projects can rely on the capacity of the Pochet Group to combine decorative materials and technologies. This know-how allows the incorporation of the airless pump developed by Samhwa into an almost unlimited variety of combinations of shapes and materials."
Bormioli Luigi pushes beyond the limits of design and lightness,"The first challenge for the Italian glassmaker was to address the needs of brand differentiation. At this level, the demand for new glass shapes is increasingly growing. However, in the same time, glass-forming techniques appear to have reached their intrinsic limits. To overcome this difficulty, Bormioli Luigi has developed an innovative glass-on-glass gluing technique to assemble components together strongly, permanently and with a complete compatibility with alcoholic products. The finished bottle is obtained by gluing different glass components, each of which made separately with one or more of the available glass forming techniques: blow-blow, press-blow, pressed. The result: a huge freedom of creativity. To achieve this performance, Bormioli Luigi has formulated a special glue. During the glass heating, the glue undergoes a vitrification process that welds both components with a more than tenfold mechanical resistance with respect to typical organic glues. ""The layer is totally inert and resistant to permanent contact with any alcoholic product. No toxic nor organic substance is present in the product, which does not require the REACH regulation registration,"" highlights the glassmaking company. Besides differentiation, Bormioli Luigi also addressed another major trend of the packaging: sustainability. In order to decrease the weight of the glass jars, Bormioli Luigi has reduced the glass thickness of the walls and the bottom to reach 40% of the weight of a jar of equal capacity. The decrease of glass quantity reduces the impact on the environment all along the supply chain. This new environment friendly glass required a new production process, including a glass treatment enhancing mechanical resistance and the adaptation of the machines."
Inaway to set perfumes free from glass bottles,"This innovation, called Inaway, was inspired from the food-processing industry, and is presented in the form of a Doypack ""pouch"", a portable, customizable 30ml pack inserted into a rigid, plastic, wooden, or metal frame that can take several shapes. ""The idea is to reduce both the product's carbon balance and the cost represented by the glass packaging of perfume bottles,"" explains Mathieu Reumaux, Director of Perfrance. Lighter – 30 grams of material compared to 144 for a traditional bottle – unbreakable, convenient, reloadable… this 100% French alternative can be personalized over and over again, and it reduces the carbon impact by 60%. In addition, according to its designers, Inaway has the same perfume preservation properties as a glass bottle. Perfrance mainly works on global markets. With Inaway, the company targets both mass market and luxury brands, with adapted premium versions. Thanks to the support it gets from Val d'Oise, an administrative area near Paris, as part of its Val d'Oise Innovation programme, and from the Parisian region, Ile-de-France, as part of the PM'UP programme, the agency has registered several patents, and is now working on a version with biomaterials."
VariBlend's multi-purpose dual dispenser addresses the trend towards customized cosmetic treatments,"Premium Beauty News - Why is this system so special? Gérard Sannier - Variblend is the only dual dispensing system with a patented technology enabling a custom mix of formulas. By simply twisting the head of the applicator, the user can select various formulations, or based on a choice of two components opt for a unique formula. Furthermore, the mixture remains unchanged whatever pressure is applied on the actuator. Premium Beauty News - Ideal for make-up products? Gérard Sannier - In fact, this exclusive system is ideal for products expressed in different strengths/concentrations, requiring a separation of ingredients, to select shades, or to achieve a final uniform mix. Premium Beauty News - How does it work? Gérard Sannier - Because it is a rotating head, the position of the disk putting pressure on the two pistons of the pump varies. Depending on the selected mixing ratio, the disc applies pressure on different areas of each pump piston. Mixing ratios can vary or a preset ratio can be determined. Volumetric pumps allow for accurate dispensing of each ingredient, regardless of their viscosity or rheology. Premium Beauty News - A product you presented only very recently? Gérard Sannier - Yes... And we will also propose a MiniMix model (with a 20 mm diameter) that will complement the existing range consisting of the MidiMix (40 mm diameter) and MaxiMix (49 mm diameter). This new model will be launched early 2016 and will feature seven preset mixing levels; both compartments will be of 2.5 ml x 2. In its standard configuration, it will have a special patented applicator to optimize the mixing of both components (Mixel) after pushing on the actuator. Applicators with custom designs are also possible (i.e., lip or eye contours). The MiniMix is intended primarily for cosmetic applications. Finally, I would like to point out that commercial developments of MidiMix and MaxiMix models have already been used in such areas as: – Haircare/Skincare products (USA & UK). – Skincare (Korea & Japan). – Foundations (USA). – Lip (USA, Australia & Japan). – Sun care products (USA). – Body care products (USA, Brazil & Turkey). – Oral care products (Holland). Many more applications are to come."
Packaging: the All4Pack Observatory can feel a wind of optimism,"In accordance with the ongoing changes in the sector, the two complementary shows, Packaging and Handling, will now be united under a new name, All4Pack Paris, which actually covers a broader spectrum of activities: Packaging, Processing, Printing, and Handling. According to the organizers, this new trademark reflects the global dimension of the event, makes its offering clearer, and represents the new potential of the show created in 1947. If, as usual, the show will be guided by creativity, All4Pack Paris still aims to highlight innovation: ""the main changing aspects of the sector will be tackled, and so will the themes of active and connected packaging, automation, smart warehouses, digital and 3D printing"", Véronique Sestrières promises. A new commercial policy is also announced, and the area will be larger and organized differently, thanks to the addition of Hall 7. Just like every year for 10 years, the show's Observatory has provided an accurate, instantaneous picture of the sector's players' perception: buyers, packaging suppliers, and components manufacturers. The Packaging Observatory (now All4Pack Observatory) relies on the data provided by Goodlink/MRCC, who conducted an online survey of 565 respondents in September – 15% of buyers in cosmetics, perfumery and hygiene –, in partnership with ASLOG (French association for the supply chain and logistics) and CISMA (union for construction, infrastructures, steel, and handling). The results highlight a certain optimism on the part of all players when it comes to production prospects for 2016/2018. As a matter of fact, 63% of buyers and packaging manufacturers are considering increasing their production within the next three years (compared to 60% and 58% in 2014, respectively). The figure rises up to 75% for cosmetics, perfumery, and hygiene buyers, who come second behind e-commerce/mass distribution. This optimism is obviously enhanced by the fact that calm has been restored as regards the cost of materials and the stability of operating margins: 65% of manufacturers remain confident on these aspects, compared to 49% in 2013. As a consequence, prospects are better in terms of employment, as 35% foresee a rise, compared to 28% in 2014, and investments (28% vs 14%). Closeness and the Made in France label remain important criteria, as 42% of buyers approach French players. France is followed by Germany and Italy. Innovation, a fundamental differentiation factor in a tense economic climate, remains the main concern: 63% of all players are working on projects for 2015-2016, and 89% are committed to luxury projects. And life cycle in terms of marketing and product development tends to take less long – about 2 years right now. The innovation essentials given by respondents are design, which is back at the top, in particular in the beauty sector, where it represents a major lever on which 69% of buyers are willing to bank for the two years to come, followed by convenience (55%), and recyclability (45%). It should be noted that connected packaging is growing: 15% of buyers have allocated specific means to it in 2015, and 26% of them are thinking about it."
Cosmetic Rigid Packaging: Albéa steps up the expertise of its industrial sites,"Premium Beauty News - A year of consolidation with the aim finally, to specialize by product segments? Guillaume de Demandolx - To give you a clear picture of the Cosmetic Rigid Packaging activity within the Albéa Group, you must remember that we are present in Asia (China, Indonesia and India), the United States, Mexico, Brazil and in Western and Eastern Europe... And that we employ some 9000 people on our sixteen production sites. We are operating in a very competitive market marked by a steady pace of launches, especially concerning make-up. In a volatile economic environment, our customers more than ever need to rely on suppliers capable of developing quickly and reliably their new products, to provide competitive technical solutions, and to guarantee a flexible and responsive supply chain. This is what we strive to offer them through our global manufacturing base and our networks of technical experts, and this in each of the segments we operate. And there are many of them! Because we are leaders in the lipstick segment, which represents about one fourth of our division's income and which is manufactured in France, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico and Brazil. We are also leaders in mascara, which accounts for another big fourth of CRP's activity and for which we can boast a recognized expertise not only in vials but also for all kinds of brushes, be they in plastic or fibre-based, with production units in Italy, the USA, Mexico, China and Brazil. The third ""quarter"" concerns closures and caps for fragrances and skincare products. Finally, the last ""quarter"", with compacts, jars and bottles, not forgetting ""metal"" processing with units located in China and the USA. Premium Beauty News - For each unit in the world one specialization … or nearly! You mentioned the setting up of a real network of technical expertise! Guillaume de Demandolx - It's a fact! Production sites that are specialized around an expertise, – whether a market or a technology –, enable to strengthen the industrial performance and to focus investments on the equipment the best suited to the needs of our customers. And I must say that this strategy of industrial specialization, we are now accelerating the pace of, is bearing fruits since our clients seem to recognize the performance and competitiveness of our already specialized sites. There is no lack of examples, like our sites in Bottanuco and Matamoros in Mexico for mascaras, those in Parigné and Bernaville in France specialized in perfume caps and galvanizing or our Indonesian site in Semarang dedicated to high-end make-up cases. Not to mention the site in Shanghai, with its integrated workshop for moulds and metal processing and a cutting edge tool for the production of lipsticks. In this area, we also want to offer our European customers a next-generation tool in the French site of Plouhinec, which will specialise in these products and for which we plan to invest nearly 10 million euros over three years. Premium Beauty News - Investments that focus mainly on what? Guillaume de Demandolx - As always, the idea is to improve efficiency, flexibility and agility. For this, it is essential to step up operational performance while ensuring competitiveness and quality. To achieve this, there is no secret recipe, it requires more automation, more robotization and more control systems, but also capacity investments and the renewal of our product range to best meet the requirements of our customers. Not forgetting training, to further strengthen the skills of our teams. Don't forget that Albéa, overall, invests annually approximately $ 100 million per year and represent about one third of this envelope. You know, I already had the opportunity to talk about that a year ago, ""Quality"" and ""Time to market"" are permanent objectives for us. We have implemented an entire process to accelerate the development of new products and make their development more reliable. We want to reduce or eliminate risks associated with sometimes complex... and very common projects, since as you know, almost a third of our portfolio is renewed every year! Premium Beauty News - A word on the latest product launches? Guillaume de Demandolx - We launched last year the Albéa Tips Studio programme, through which we invent, develop and manufacture high-performance and innovative application systems, ranging from the fibre or plastic mascara brush to tips for lipgloss applicators via eyebrow and eyeliner solutions. Like every year, our experts come up with new products: a plastic mini-brush, La Petite for short eyelashes or Cashmere for a super-gentle application, the Trilogy case with a specific applicator integrated and the brush Magnify for eyebrows - to name a few. For the lips, we launched a fun to use packaging around a new gesture, the LipKiss. A word also about CoolSpin, a ceramic applicator for the eye contour that enables to apply and massage accurately a refreshing formula. And of course, we are always exited to contribute to the development of outstanding products with our customers, such as the new mascaras MAC, Nars or Rimmel, the lipstick by Carlsan, Chinese are mad about, the latest Paco Rabanne perfume, the sumptuous prize-winning Guerlain case, and many others!"
What plastics solutions for cosmetics packaging in contact with formulas?,"To address these issues, DuPont, the market leader in thermoplastics, elastomers, biopolymers and finished pieces, has a large number of solutions tailored to packaging demands of cosmetic brands: – How to ensure the protection of the formula while preserving the aesthetic qualities of packaging? – What solutions to combine durability, cost reduction, aesthetics, functionality and overall regulatory compliance? – Compatibility between container/content and regulatory requirements? DuPont's plastic ranges are well suited for a wide variety of functional applications (pumps, mascaras, mechanisms of red to lips, primary packaging, etc.) while combining aesthetic and regulatory compliance. Beyond their purely industrial qualities, the resins specifically adapted to the requirements of cosmetics brands, also feature many sustainability assets to meet today's environmental challenges. Allowing, for instance, thinner walls, they can lead to material savings and packaging weight reduction. Thanks to their high aesthetic qualities, some resins may also free brands from the need to apply silicone coating on the packaging. Other well-known materials, such as Surlyn, have been improved so as to widen the possibilities of use in new designs. To answer these questions and explain the different offers, DuPont will held a free educational interactive webinar, on November 26, 2015 Three main topics will be featured: – Overview of the regulatory environment for the cosmetic packaging Mrs. Françoise Godts – Food Contact Manager EMEA – Addressing new cosmetic packaging challenges with DuPont Advanced Polymers Mrs. Alexandra Fabbro - Food & cosmetics segments manager at DuPont Performance Polymers – Design possibilities and innovation with the Surlyn material Mr. Philippe Milazzo - Global Market Manager / Cosmetic & Perfumes Packaging For more details and registration, please click on the link here after: Free Webinar – 26 November 2015 – 03.00 pm (Paris time) – 09.00 am (New York time)"
Heinz Glas innovates in digital decoration,"Heinz Glas has no doubt about it: as far as high-end glass bottles are concerned, the market demand is clearly oriented towards the diversification of decorations. The decor has become a key element to achieve a high differentiation level. The trend has been amplified by the proliferation of flankers, but also by the growing popularity of niche brands and the growing demand for customization, leading the multiplication of limited editions. For several years, Heinz Glas has invested heavily to master a wide array of finishing technologies. A new step forward this strategy was the recent launch of two new ranges of digitally printed decorations combining high added value and ease of customization. To present its new digital printing capabilities on cylindrical bottles, the German glassmaker launched at Luxe Pack Monaco a home fragrance produced in partnership with perfume creator Fragrance Contact. ""This new technique helps to achieve high quality decorations, including near-photographic quality prints, even for small series. And the possibilities are limitless,"" explains Yann Lefrancq-Béjina of Heinz Glas France. Two production sites of the Heinz Glas group are already equipped with this digital technology that can print in 3D on cylindrical bottles with a capacity that can exceed 10,000 pieces a day. The other innovation that Heinz Glas presented at Luxe Pack was a combination of digital printing and textured glass to imitate real material textures. In practice, a laser attacks the glass mould to produce the texture corresponding to the desired effect. Then the support is decorated with digital printing to finalize the material effect. Several decorations were presented at Luxe Pack: wood, slate, leather, wicker, textile and porcelain. An inlay of the original material was also glued on the bottle to strengthen the demonstration. Of course, the two new techniques can be combined, depending on the customer's imagination."
"Plastics: PRP, to invest two million euros!","The PRP Company based in Oyonnax, France, specialized in the production of plastic containers for the beauty industry, is about to invest more than two million euros in the complete reorganization of its production process. A reorganization that involves, among other changes, the systematic automation of moulding machines and finishing units. More than 3,000 sqm of buildings were built from the ground up within weeks, bringing the total plant area to 12,000 sqm. ""And there is more coming, explains Gérard Goujon, owner and CEO, we have also decided to invest in one of our specialities, finally relatively unknown, which is to produce airless containers with a built-in pouch."" A speciality, which nonetheless dates back to 1995. A time when this technology was still in its infancy. ""We can say we were forerunners in this area,"" emphasises Gérard Goujon. ""And these years of accumulated experience are paying off today."" Many projects are underway with some top cosmetic brands. To note the upcoming release of a standard range of airless containers with a pouch with sizes ranging from 15 ml to 100 ml. PRP is probably historically one of the oldest French family-owned companies specialized in the manufacture of plastic containers. It currently has seven injection moulding machines, fifteen extrusion blow moulding machines, sixteen injection blow moulding machinery, and its famous workshop specialized in the manufacture of pouches for airless concepts among others, which is home to four machines... Not to mention the workshop dedicated to finishing with eight automatic machines (screen printing, hot stamping) and a ""liquid"" metallization machine."
Seen at Luxe Pack 2015,"It would not be possible, of course, to make an exhaustive picture of all the new products showcased at the last edition of Luxe Pack. However, Premium Beauty News spotted some of them for you, among many others: – Albéa introduced Beauty Eye-D, its new line of three new plastic mascara brushes (La Petite, Signorina Couture and Cashmere) developed through the Albéa Tips Studio and manufactured in the group's European centre of excellence for mascara, Albéa Bottanuco in Italy. The French group also launched Cool Spin, an eye contouring applicator with a ceramic tip for a cool and relaxing sensation.

As far as sampling solutions are concerned, Aptar also introduced Easy Clip Card, an alternative aesthetic option, as economic as the open card, available in different materials (blotter, cardboard, metal, plastic). – Arcade Beauty has created, for Dior's J'adore fragrance, a fragranced blotter for distribution in magazines. The result is a blotter that is impregnated with the scent and housed in a decorative envelope, both manufactured at Carestia Arcade Beauty's facility in Grasse, France, which is specialized in scent strips and other fragranced paper products. – Cosfibel showcased Giftlux Box, a patented ready-to-use packaging solution that is both a box for the product and a gift package in its own right. – Cosmogen, the French supplier of brushes, accessories and cosmetic packaging, launched Attract One a patented skin care applicator, featuring a metallic ball magnetically attached to a fully customizable handle. The metallic ball is fully uncovered to gain up 3 times more surface application compared to usual roll on applicators. – Geka presented different mascara brush models and shapes and demonstrated its 3D mascara brush printing techniques allowing customers to test a variety of new brush models at a very early project stage. The German company also presented its ""Sandwich Technology"" - a patented manu-facturing method to produce moulded brushes.

Topline integrates the PSB Industries group,"Topline is the third company to join the portfolio of companies acquired by the PSB Industries Group in the space of twelve months. First it was the US company C+N Packaging Corporation (injection moulding and metallization) and then Plastibell, a company specialized in injection moulding for the health market in particular. Now organized around four line of business with ""Luxe & Beauté"" (approximately EUR 150 million in sales) to which belong Texen, C+N and soon Topline, then ""Santé & Industrie"" (about 100 million), ""Agro & Alimentaire"" (50 million) and ""Chimie de Spécialités"" (40 million), PSB Industries can boast of a total turnover this year of 340 million euros with a workforce of 2,100 people spread over 22 industrial sites in seven countries. ""And it's not over, says Olivier Salaun. Until recently, we have restructured our financing means around five banking partners. We have about 130 million euros to make other investments."" The story of the Topline Group specialized in the development, production and marketing of packaging and cosmetics is a true saga the way Americans like them. Topline, it is before all the story of an anticipation. That of having seen before many others what appears today as one of the greatest shifts in the beauty industry in the world, that is, the recourse of brands to almost total subcontracting. ""A precursor, indeed we are!,"" declared a few months ago Charles Chang, its founder, in Premium Beauty News, ""since we were, as of 1980, among the first to work with Asia for cosmetic packaging. And in the middle of the 90s, we also pioneered the introduction of full-service Made in China in the USA. We were capable of delivering a full service offer associated with true creative vocation."" Topline, currently owns three production sites: the first one in China, the second in the USA in Michigan, specialized in cosmetics (cases...) and the third in Mexico dedicated to the manufacture of cosmetics and the filling of perfumes and skincare products and which was given new production capacities (injection, injection blow moulding, decoration). Topline also owns a French subsidiary, Topline/Primapack, a real creative and commercial clout, based in Paris/La Défense, the result of the acquisition in 2013 of the Primapack Company specialized in the sourcing and marketing of packagings and accessories dedicated to the beauty sector. ""It is clear that what Topline represents today, emphasises Olivier Salaun, is truly an essential complement to the expansion of our Group in the global beauty industry."" Ambitions that do not stop here. ""We must absolutely expand our reach internationally,"" insists the head of PSB Industries""and be present in activities requiring technologies we do not master yet, such as metal, pumps, airless systems or lipsticks"". On the industrial side, the Group has decided to invest about 6% of its turnover every year especially to extend robotization and automation in its plants. One million euros was spent in the implementation in France of an innovations cell, the ""Texen Lab"". To note that this Texen Lab area is equipped with an injection moulding machine unique in its field, capable of implementing different injection, completion and automatic assembly methods, as well as a vacuum metallization pilot cell. ""But also and above all the human investment remains one of our major concerns, be it at a technical or commercial level,"" insists Olivier Salaun. ""And the ""Luxe et Beauté"" sales team, for example, will be reinforced in the coming months with increasingly international profiles."""
"Airless: the French group Pochet and the Korean company Samhwa plastic join forces to propose ""pure drop""","Premium Beauty News - It is not just about a partnership for the development of an umpteenth Airless system? Sung Hwan Cho - Of course not! We decided to join our forces to propose a new Airless system, representing the next level of the category. Pure Drop's value proposition is to be ""the most customizable airless system on the market, with best-in-class functional performances"". Each partner brings the best of their respective expertise to this common programme: Pure Drop inherited its performances from Samhwa Plastic and its beauty from Pochet. Premium Beauty News - Why Pure Drop? Tristan Farabet - Pure Drop emerged from the realization that there is a continuous high demand for Airless packs, thanks to the benefits that this packaging technology offers in terms of formula protection, ability to dispense a wide range of viscosity, ergonomics and to its high-tech image that enhances the perceived value of advanced skincare formulae. Yet, the airless packaging is paradoxically under-represented in the Prestige segment (9% in volume), because of two significant limitations: 1. Design limitations, due to the fact that the current offering is dominated by cylindrical standards geared towards mass and masstige segments. Indeed some elaborate, dressed-up airless packs do exist, but their development is long and tedious and they generally come with complex logistics (association of several suppliers, delivery of several sub-assemblies with a very specific assembly process…). 2. Functional limitations, due to the fact that most current airless evolved by making compromises on functional performances. As a consequence only few current systems can pretend being 'true' airless packs, and most brands have to derogate from their own specifications if they want to be able to offer a so-called 'airless' solution. Here also high performance packs do exist, but they are generally limited in design and decoration options and not suited for the sophisticated brand image of the Luxury cosmetics segment. Pure Drop emerged from the will to solve simultaneously both these limitations, hence offering a system with unlimited design freedom, associated with best-in-class performances. Premium Beauty News - Why a Samhwa-Pochet association? Tristan Farabet - The Pochet Group is a recognized leader in luxury beauty packaging, with a main historical focus on the Fragrance category. We set ourselves with the goal to grow in the skincare and make-up segments, and have chosen to do so through innovation in products, processes and services. The Airless category was an obvious choice for supporting a strategic growth in both skincare and make-up, and we decided to develop a high-end airless, both in terms of design options and technical performances aimed at luxury and masstige brands with an appetite for high performance. Our group is totally legitimate in the area of highly designed and decorated packs, associating the widest range of materials and finishing technologies in the industry, and to reach the high level of technical performance that was targeted, it chose to look for an association with an Airless expert. We conducted an analysis of the dispensing market actors and quickly concluded that the best airless technology was to be found in South Korea. We then established contacts with most major airless suppliers in South Korea… and were impressed by Samhwa's technological excellence and the cultural affinities between our two family businesses! Sung Hwan Cho - Samhwa, founded in 1977, is the 2nd largest cosmetic packaging supplier in South Korea and the fastest growing one. We are an airless pioneer, who developed the first airless pump in Korea in 1994 and patented the first Pure Flow pump in history in 2001. We are a recognized leader of this category with innovative, high performance products in skincare and make-up categories. On our side we were also engaged in a strategic rethinking of the future development of our company, with a dynamic strategy of expanding internationally and into the Luxury segment. To achieve this goal we were contemplating an association with a Western company that could accelerate our reach of the Global market and complement our own capabilities for decorative parts. It became soon obvious that the two companies had a lot in common, including their strong values rooted on their family owned businesses. A mutual trust emerged from the discussions and common work over two years, who leads today to the creation of a 50/50 joint venture focused, for now, on Pure Drop, but with an open view that the partnership could evolve further and cover more product categories."

Chinese company Ying Shuo opens a new factory,"With 40,000 sqm, 150 injection moulding machines with a capacity ranging from 50 to 550 tonnes, six bi-injection machines, six blow moulding machines (including four blow-moulding injection and two blow-moulding extrusion machines), a complete workshop for the design of injection tools, the new site, which employs more than 1,000 people is impressive. The Chinese company also took the opportunity to double its lacquering and vacuum metallization capacity, bringing it to over two hundred million pieces a year. Investments also concerned workshops dedicated to finishing operations (hot stamping, screen printing, pad printing, transfer printing...) and the assembly workshop which is home to more than ten lines. This new plant is also very environmentally-friendly since it has, a heat recovery system – using the heat produced by machines – to heat the whole site, a more energy-efficient (by 20%) air conditioning system and an air-treatment system to renew the air in the injection workshop. Ying Shuo's main ""customer"" market remains packagings intended for skincare and make-up sectors (90% of sales). ""We also transform parts for the perfume sector,"" explains Arnaud Billon, General Manager of Ying Shuo Europe, ""but it's true that our core target remains skincare and make-up, with, for the latter, a strong presence in make-up cases, lipgloss, mascara, pens, among others. As for the skincare sector, we are also very active in the area of jars and, more generally, in that of thick-walled containers."" Like a lot of Chinese companies, Ying Shuo exports most of its production (60% of its turnover), with two-thirds for the US market and the remainder, to Europe. ""We work with the top 5 global brands,"" emphasises Arnaud Billon. An international strategy which was strengthened in the past two years with the opening of a subsidiary in Paris and New York, followed by the opening of an office in Tokyo, not to mention two new sales offices in Hong Kong and Canton, combined with a regular attendance to major international trade shows."
A new record year in sight for Luxe Pack Monaco,"Premium Beauty News - How do you think this edition of Luxe Pack Monaco will go? Nathalie Grosdidier - This year, Luxe Pack Monaco will host 450 exhibitors, compared to 400 in 2014 - and 70 of them are new here. Just like every year, the show will offer the opportunity to launch a multitude of new products - 300 on average - and decipher the major trends on the market. In our programme, we have decided to highlight those that are the most likely to revolutionize luxury packaging, like smart, connected packaging, or 3D printing, but also underlying trends, which are still very powerful, such as differentiation thanks to new sensorial, tactile, or visual effects, as well as ethical and sustainable development. Talking about this aspect, as the United Nations Conference on Climate Change (COP21) is to take place in a few weeks, we will put forward energy efficiency, in particular in relation to the Luxe Pack in green prize, which will be awarded in the presence of Monaco's Minister of State. As the premier luxury packaging platform in the world and showcase for tomorrow's trends, Luxe Pack makes it possible to feature the best practices and coordinate efforts on all luxury markets. Lastly, this year, we will have the pleasure of welcoming French stylist Chantal Thomass as a guest of honour. She will share her creative experience by dealing with ""The Art of Reinvention"". Premium Beauty News - We have heard a lot about changes in the scheduling of the shows usually held in autumn. Nathalie Grosdidier - As far as we are concerned, it has been a while since we started trying to organize our show earlier, so that it no longer takes place during French school holidays. The schedule of shows was modified in Cannes, which led to major changes for Monaco events. We seized this opportunity, so 2016 will be a transition year: Luxe Pack Monaco will be held in September, and then, starting from 2017, it will be on the first week of October, which was found to be the best in terms of availability for brands' decision-makers. Premium Beauty News - Last year, you launched a new section dedicated to cosmetic formula manufacturers, Luxe formulation. How is it organized? Nathalie Grosdidier - This new section is still developing, and it will feature about forty exhibitors this year. There are strong expectations for innovative formulas, as this demand is driven both by regulations and the market. Beyond trying to develop new products, the issue of container-content interaction compels formulators and packaging suppliers to constantly exchange. Therefore, it is really logical to welcome full-service suppliers to an event like Luxe Pack. This year, again, Luxe formulation will also have its own conference programme, with presentations on perfumery, in particular niche perfumery, natural and organic cosmetics, textures and sensoriality. Premium Beauty News - How can Luxe Pack and Luxe formulation develop in such a limited area as the Forum Grimaldi? Nathalie Grosdidier - The issue of space is crucial, indeed. However, starting from this year, we will enjoy additional areas, in particular with the opening of Hall Indigo, a former bar-restaurant whose concession was acquired by the Forum Grimaldi, and which offers terraces with a view on the sea. Besides, we have also gained an unused part of Hall Diaghilev. And we are constantly seeking to optimize spaces. Premium Beauty News - If we think beyond Monaco, what about the international development of Luxe Pack? Nathalie Grosdidier - Luxe Pack New York gathers about 200 exhibitors every year in May, and Luxe Pack Shanghai, about 150 in April. The New York event is now well-established and recognized throughout North America, with visitors coming from the whole region. Our objective is now to gain some appeal in the northern part of Latin America, for example Mexico. Luxe Pack New York also comprises a Luxe Promo pavilion dedicated to gifts in the beauty and beverage sectors. It features high-end promotional tools with a real synergy in terms of visitors. Since February 2015, we have had our own offices in New York, with two people working on strengthening our presence even further. As for Luxe Pack Shanghai, the show grows every year, as it differentiates itself from other Asian events thanks to a very strong focus on design and marketing. As these are increasingly important concerns in China, the show is literally booming, both in terms of exhibitors and visitors."
Yonwoo enters the stock exchange and invests heavily in tubes,"In thirty years, Yonwoo has become the world number one producer of piston airless packaging. It was in 1995 that the company marketed its first airless packaging with a piston on the Korean market. It currently owns 55% of the Korean market for airless containers and stands as one of the leading players in the global market with a production capacity of more than 240 million units per year. Main assets of the Korean company, a maximum integration, from moulds designing, including injection, stamping of metal parts, all the finishing techniques (coating, plating, anodizing, hot stamping, screen printing etc.), and, of course, assembly. In recent years, several new buildings have seen the light within the main production plant in Incheon, including a brand new one, which is home to a production centre dedicated to the production of limited packaging editions and which can meet all test requests. Airless, of course, but not only... Because, since 2007, Yonwoo also manufactures plastic and aluminium/plastic tubes. The company also announced this month the construction of a 14,000 sqm factory entirely dedicated to the manufacture of tubes. A product that today represents a turnover of USD 25 million and for which the Korean manufacturer has big ambitions, anticipating a production capacity which will be tripled by 2020 and which will weigh 23% of its turnover at that time. Objective, be the number producer of tubes in Korea! A well thought out strategy for tubes that consists in offering its customers high added value product ranges. Added value mostly generated by the use of pumps, dispensing systems and sophisticated applicator ranges that transform the tube into a premium product offering previously unknown services. ""The aim is to offer customers tubes and systems suited to their needs and enabling them to create value and write a real story,"" explains Daniel Cha, Sales and Marketing Director. ""Concerning other products such as jars and airtight cases, we are working on it, emphasises Daniel Cha, but as usual we do not want to be followers but initiators. So I can tell you we are working on the development of innovative products in this area."""
Safety of plastic packaging: Towards standardized test protocols?,"Premium Beauty News - Since 2011, you have been animating a cross-sectorial and multi-company working group on plastic packaging for cosmetics, what is the purpose of this group? Dominique Appert - The group was created after a day of exchanges between professionals in plastic packaging and cosmetics, during which participants realized the importance of strengthening ties to better understand the constraints of each sector. The group is articulated around 15 companies: industrial members (Eastman, Elian-A.Schulman, Laboratoires Expanscience, LVMH, Promens, PRP Création, Strand Cosmetics Europe) and support members from the academic and scientific community (CED [1], Allizé-Plasturgie, Centre Technique de la Conservation des Produits Agricoles - CTCPA, Itech, Lagep-université Lyon1, toxicologue). The group has the particularity of bringing together stakeholders from across the whole value chain. Premium Beauty News - What actions have been taken since the creation of this working group? Dominique Appert - We have spent some time getting to know one another and creating a climate of mutual trust, which is a prerequisite when you are going to exchange data which is confidential to each company. The group took a particular interest into risk factors to health, related to the migration of substances from the packaging to the cosmetic formula. A total of 225 factors were analysed using the Failure mode, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA). This year, to strengthen the cooperation between stakeholders in the value chain, a two-day training for the two sectors (cosmetics and packaging) will be organized next Fall, it will be based on the work and reflections originating from the working group in the past 4 years. Premium Beauty News - Since the new cosmetic regulation came into force in July 2013, the content/container interactions are among the information to provide. Yet no standardized protocol is proposed and the tests required are left to the discretion of companies. What are the answers of the working group on this issue? Dominique Appert - The cosmetic regulations prescribes, for what is not known, to refer to the food regulations. But this is satisfactory to no one because the cosmetic product is not a food product either in terms of exposure, or in terms of uses or risks. For manufacturers, it is very difficult today to use new ingredients, which are a real obstacle to innovation. This therefore keeps them from using new bio-sourced or recycled raw materials, in spite of their strong interest. This year, the working group is launching a major research project to set up standardized and simple test protocols to validate the compliance of cosmetic packaging and guarantee the safety of cosmetics. The project, broken down into seven working stages will be carried out by a main service provider, the Centre Technique de la Conservation des Produits Agricoles (CTCPA); in collaboration with group members for a budget of 300,000 euros. It is supported by the CED and Allizé-Plasturgie. We want to provide, in the next two years, a positive list of authorized substances in the formulation of a plastic material used for a cosmetic packaging, issue a best practice guide and have a test protocol for packagings that could stand as a normative reference. Premium Beauty News - Is the working group open to other participants? Dominique Appert - The group is indeed seeking to offer seats to new industrial members to strengthen our work across all applications (skincare, hygiene, perfume, make-up). Knowledge sharing is one of the means chosen to maintain the cosmetic sector at its level of competitiveness. Raw material suppliers (plastics, dyes, additives, ingredients), cosmetic formulators, packaging suppliers, brands and intermediaries are all welcome."
Taiwan's glass maker Jih Hsin releases an airless glass bottle,"""This new product is exactly the illustration of our approach,"" explains Jane Huang, Sales Manager. ""Jih Hsin Glass not only delivers high quality bottles but also does other additional processing, like silk screen printing, frosting, and coating. We can also provide caps, pumps, and other accessories for the bottles. Our goals are quality assurance, good pricing, on time delivery, quality service, and continue to improve to meet our customer's needs."" The glass maker created in 1973 and who has gradually specialized in manufacturing almost exclusively bottles and jars for the cosmetics industry now exports almost all its production to the United States, Europe (Spain and Germany) and the whole of South East Asia (Japan and China). To note also a specialty, the production of nail polish bottles. The production equipment consists of a 45 tonne furnace, which supplies five production lines. In terms of decoration the firm offers the whole array of available techniques (Glass bottle polishing, printing, coating, frosting, electro coating). It also offers a variety of pump, caps, and other accessories to fit with the bottles. ""Our turnover, says Jane Huang, is mostly generated by the commercialization of our standard ranges (60%), the remainder being specific series. We decided two years ago to invest more on the segment of design and innovation. And indeed it pays off! The proof, this new airless glass bottle that we have just finished developing and filed a patent."""
"""3D printing has the potential to challenge plastic injection and moulding,"" Arnault Coulet, Fabulous","Premium Beauty News - Since its emergence a few years ago, 3D printing has gained a foothold in companies! Arnault Coulet - Yes and no. We mostly hear about 3D printing for small equipment, often used for prototyping, without really realizing the industrial potential behind this technology. However the time when this technology was limited to prototyping and very small series (1-10 pieces) is already a thing of the past. Today what is at stake is to challenge in a near future traditional methods of production of objects, in particular plastic injection, but also moulding. Premium Beauty News - What are the advantages of 3D printing? Arnault Coulet - First 3D printing, or more precisely additive manufacturing, allows saving a huge amount of time as it requires no mould. Another well-known benefit, it allows for an infinite level of customization: files can be reworked and all objects produced as a single version. 3D printing is completely in line with the current trend for high-end limited series. It also enables to deal with very complex shapes and therefore give life to design objects, which would have never seen the light of day with traditional production techniques. Finally, it enables to reduce production costs, in particular working metal with very little loss of material and again no moulds. From a broader perspective, 3D printing will probably be a factor for the relocation of production. Not only is it suitable for the production of customized limited series in a very short time, but it also requires a more skilled labour force than with conventional production processes. Previously, the speed of printing and the volume of printed objects were limited. But these technical issues are nearly resolved. And don't forget that 3D printing can be used for stainless steel, steel, titanium and precious metals and even ceramic. It is therefore not limited to plastics. To date, there are about 200 different materials compatible with additive manufacturing and we have also published a guide on the main materials used with their possible developments and advantages. For metals, we currently use a laser melting technology, which has many advantages over traditional moulding: with an increased homogeneity of the material, parts with a higher resistance can be produced. Premium Beauty News - Could it cause the same upheaval as digital printing? Arnault Coulet - Unlike digital printing, 3D technologies are not stabilized yet, actors are emerging. For industrial projects, investments are still very high and amount to millions of euros. Risks are high because technologies can soon become obsolete. But we are really entering into a new era, with both an ever growing number of needs and volumes produced. Production increases twofold every year. Currently, more than 1,000 parts of the Airbus A350 come from additive manufacturing. Premium Beauty News - Customization is an important asset, but is the quality of products always up to par with other technologies? Arnault Coulet - Fully finished parts cannot be designed yet. For luxury products, in particular, one or more finishing phases are needed after the initial production. Like for example, polishing, varnishing or application of paint. But mind you it is also very often the case with other production technologies. Premium Beauty News - What are your recommendations? Arnault Coulet - Given the speed at which these technologies are changing, we encourage our customers to rely on production networks and explore in this context the possible business applications. We are a driving force for brands on projects for which 3D printing offers real benefits. We have recently accompanied Lancôme for the production of POS with dummies featuring seven different sizes and colours, which were delivered in the brand's European and American flagship stores. Thanks to 3D, such POS equipment can be produced in a week!"
"""Packaging Innovations has seen phenomenal growth since the show launched back in 2010,"" Alison Church","Premium Beauty News - This edition of Packaging Innovations and Luxury Packaging London will take place in a new venue. How will the show look like in this new location? Alison Church - Packaging Innovations has seen phenomenal growth since the show launched back in 2010. And of course, with the addition of Luxury Packaging in 2011, the event has since doubled in size over the years. The Business Design Centre served the event well in its infant years, but now that it has evolved to become the exclusive event for branded and inspirational packaging in the capital, we needed to find a new home that allows for continued growth. We are really excited to be holding the sixth edition in Olympia for the first time, to really provide an enhanced visitor experience. The Central and West Hall in Olympia is a new, beautiful modern venue. It provides extra floor space, as well as having the added benefit of being on one level, allowing visitors to move freely throughout the hall. This year we have over 170 exhibitors taking part. We have seen the attendance of the cosmetics industry grow over the years. In fact, the highest proportion of attendees in 2014 were from the cosmetics industry! This was due to providing specific content relevant for the cosmetics industry including hosting the Beauty Symposium which has grown in popularity each year. We have a wealth of innovative exhibitors taking part too who cater for the cosmetics market, including Miran, Quadpack, FlacoPharm, Print Park, Richmond Containers, Vesna, PET Power, Toly and Elanders to name but a few. Premium Beauty News - What will be the new features of this edition? Alison Church - Well, where do I start? We have so many new features and initiatives being launched at this year's show! We have four new features being launched: – the Brand Innovation Programme, boasting nine leading creative agencies across the two days, including Webb deVlam London, Brand on Shelf and Icicle Group; – the Great Innovation Debate, chaired by The Retail Institute and exploring the term 'innovation' in relation to packaging; – the Live Design Challenge, a timed competition which will see three designers go head to head in a bid to design a rugby themed pack in homage to the Rugby World Cup; – the Innovation Showcase, where top exhibitors present their innovations on stage and Pimm's O'Clock where visitors to the show can enjoy a free glass of fruity Pimm's. We have also introduced two new initiatives: – the Platinum VIP scheme which recognises purchasers from leading brands who are coming to the event specifically to buy – and the Rising Star Scheme which recognises young and up and coming brands to help find the right suppliers for them and to make the most out of their visit. And if that wasn't enough, we also have returning show favourites such at the Drinks & Beauty Symposia, the Learnshops seminar programme featuring speakers from Marks & Spencer, Müller, Nabeel Perfumes and Liberty and the Luxury Packaging Conference. Premium Beauty News - And what about the Luxury Packaging event. Alison Church - The Luxury Packaging exhibition is the UK's only event for luxury packaging. This year the show will be brimming with the latest innovations, techniques, products and solutions, giving visitors and their products that real aspirational look and feel. This year we are pleased to announce that we are able to host the Luxury Packaging Conference free of charge to attendees. The conference will feature senior representatives from Crabtree & Evelyn, Harrods, Diageo and Lush. The conference will evaluate, debate and celebrate the latest creative thinking and innovations in luxury and premium packaging and designs. The Luxury Packaging Awards, hosted by Packaging News and run in association with our Luxury Packaging Exhibition, is a great opportunity for the luxury industry to network and celebrate the very best packs in the luxury market. As a judge, I got a first-hand look at the products and there were some truly amazing luxury packs! It will be an exciting event to see the winners revealed! Premium Beauty News - What are the differences between the London and the Birmingham editions? Alison Church - London is at the heart of the design, brand and innovation community; it is the show that designers and buyers working for major luxury, prestige and mid-range brands attend when looking for new ideas and inspiration. Birmingham incorporates all parts of the packaging supply chain. It covers everything from design and materials to packaging and print machinery all under one roof. It is much broader whereas the London event has a much stronger focus on creativity, marketing and branding."
Iggesund enhances its distribution service in Asia,"Swedish paper and cardboard manufacturer Iggesund Paperboard is improving its distribution service in Asia with the main aim to reduce delays and to offer Asian customers a better service. The improvement of the company's logistics includes the opening of a new storage centre in Taiwan. ""We are continuously evolving together with our customers' needs. We have therefore set up a sheeting and warehousing capability in Taiwan, which will be operationally ready by the end of July 2015,"" explains Ivan Chong, Business Area Director G&P, Asia Pacific. ""This channel will strive to enhance Invercote's availability in the Asian market and will help Iggesund and our customers to gain new business."" However, Iggesund is not just establishing a distribution channel in Asia. The company will also keep Invercote in stock and offer local sheeting from a service point in Taiwan in order to minimise lead times. Sold in more than 100 countries, Invercote - a bleached high quality board designed to pack consumer goods requiring high graphic performances - is one of Iggesund's bestselling products. ""Invercote is a niche product aimed at customers who place high demands on appearance and function and who want the end result to attract attention on the retail shelf and encourage purchase,"" comments Arvid Sundblad, Vice President Sales and Marketing, in charge of global sales. ""Unlike basically all SBB paperboard made in Asia, Invercote has a multi-layer construction, which means it does not crack along the creases. This is a huge advantage, supported, of course, by Invercote's strong environmental and economic sustainability properties."" Iggesund's enhanced service in Asia is part of its efforts to become more global by strengthening its delivery service outside Europe. For instance, the cardboard manufacturer recently announced the strengthening of its distribution network in North America. The company is also recruiting staff to reinforce its sales efforts. It has also launched a broader service concept to inform its customers of the many resources and support functions available to them. ""Care by Iggesund"" includes the quick and easy ordering of samples and inspirational material, the provision of product safety information and certificates, and access to the analytical services of Iggesund's accredited Laboratory of Sensory and Chemical Analyses. Iggesund's extensive environmental documentation is also part of the service offering. ""A guarantee that customers will not encounter any unpleasant surprises due to the origin of the forest raw material used in their paperboard,"" claims the company. Iggesund's service offering includes everything associated with the company's products, from technical support in local markets to Iggesund's own paperboard expertise in the form of various reference works. ""We don't just want our customers to buy our paperboard - we also want them to get the most out of it,"" Arvid Sundblad comments. ""All our documentation, together with our team of technicians, who are out in the local markets and who have experience from projects and operations similar to those of our customers, exists to ensure this. Some of this support we have had for a long time but we haven't been clear enough to our customers in general that all this service exists."""
Verreries Brosse: The new ambitions of a historical glassmaker,"There are hardly any suppliers that can claim they have been partnering with the most prestigious luxury fragrances French brands, from the late 19th century to present days. The Verreries Brosse are one of them. Since the early 1920s, the company founded in 1854, have been supplying brands such as Chanel, Lanvin, Carven, Patou or Guerlain. ""For Verreries Brosse, it's a heritage and a mission that constitute a perennial honour, and a responsibility,"" says Olivier Caspar, managing director of the company. Nevertheless, the weight of this legacy could have been fatal to the company, which missed the take off of the automatic glass production and carried on manufacturing high end glass bottles with the semi-automatic process that ensured flawless quality but was soon limited to luxury glass containers for perfume extracts and to giant factice models. In 2002, the acquisition by the Italian glassmaking company Zignago Vetro Group marks the opening of a new era for Verreries Brosse. The start up of a new automated furnace that doubles the company's production capacity in 2009 allows Verreries Brosse to meet the demand for glass bottles in large series with the aim to transfer to the automatic production the culture of high quality and high-end standards acquired with the semi-automatic production. However, Verreries Brosse did not give up semi-automatic production, their historical expertise, which there were the last one to use in Europe. Today, the combination of automatic and semi-automatic production tools allows the company to be the only glassmaker in Europe able to produce the entire range of bottles needed by luxury companies: from miniatures to dummy models and special bottles for extraits, plus stoppers, jars and carafes… ""Our automated production makes it possible to complete a minimum of 30,000 units per day. But we can also deliver the bottles for a market test or a limited edition of 5,000. Being different and thinking strategically: that is Verreries Brosse's commitment to the market. We meet the needs of our clients, whether they want a million bottles, a small series of a few thousand or just enough for a test project, at prices adjusted according to the process involved. This flexibility is made possible by the complementary nature, unique on the market, of our two production tools,"" explains the company. Thanks to these assets, complemented by a catalogue of twenty standard bottles (including recent models launched at the Luxe Pack Monaco tradeshow in 2014 and two new models planned for the 2015 edition), the supplier aims to challenge the industry's leaders and to become a key player in the production of in high-end bottles. To achieve this goal, Verreries Brosse rely on growing their automatic activity in the perfume sector and their semiautomatic business in premium wines and spirits, without any compromise regarding quality standards. For instance, the company maintain visual control of each unit produced on its lines. ""The human eye is indispensable, it is able to see defaults that are not identified by cameras,"" explains Laurent Santarelli, the Director of Vieux-Rouen-sur-Bresle production facility. As far as finishing is concerned, Verreries Brosse work in partnership with the Nigermat Pariche group. ""This partnership with a decoration specialist, headquartered in a nearby location in the Bresle Valley, allows us to do our own developments,"" says Olivier Caspar. Actually, Verreries Brosse have chosen to focus their investments on the production of glass, with two main areas of research: the distribution of glass and the internal decoration of bottles. The first results should be showcased at the next edition of Luxe Pack in Monaco from 21 to 23 October 2015."
Cosmogen unveils wide range of innovations,"""It is not enough to push a technical innovation, it must also be integrated into a market and a usage habit,"" says Mylène Meunier, Cosmogen's Sales Director. The French supplier of cosmetic applicators and packaging therefore carefully surveys the women's needs, including on forums, blogs and social networks. ""Women are not always comfortable with makeup application techniques. They want tools that can help them to achieve a perfect makeup at home even if they are not an expert."" Through its innovations, Cosmogen therefore seeks to facilitate makeup application by proposing solutions inspired from professional tools but adapted for use by the general public. Cosmogen offers brushes and pens with a wide variety of tips to beautify and enhance the eyes. Felt tips allow the use of very fluid formulations, while silicone or synthetic fibre tips facilitate a precise application. To meet a strong trend in Asia as well as the demand from younger consumers, who are looking for a fun makeup, Cosmogen has developed seven tips (made of felt, hairs, synthetic fibres or silicone) to easily create graphic patterns on the eyelids. To accurately highlight the outline of the lips, Cosmogen is launching no less than twelve curved felt tips that can also be used to plump up the lips when using the tip laterally. The search for perfect makeup implies the possibility to correct the unavoidable errors made during the application process. Therefore, Cosmogen has launched nine tips that can be used to remove mascara or gently correct the lips contour. The tips are suitable for liquid formulations and several points are coloured in black for an absolute cleanliness effect. On this segment, women are mainly looking for a way to slightly colour their lips and bring brightness. The formulation must be imperceptible but able to plump up lips. To address these needs, Cosmogen launches eight ultra-soft applicators with several forms to fulfil their different missions and allow brands to stand out from the mass. Available on handles or bottles, they can also be coloured on demand. By allowing consumers to easily reproduce the professional techniques, jumbo twists are also in line with the same general trend. Cosmogen thus proposes sponges and brushes addressing different needs: to hide imperfections, to apply blush, to sculpt the face, etc. In addition to the original Asian cushions, which can also be sourced by Cosmogen, the French supplier also offers less complex and more economical products to meet the demand of certain markets, such as Latin America and the USA. A sponge suitable for liquid formulations is placed in an easy to carry airtight jar. A showroom in the deep heart of Paris Cosmogen recently move into new offices at Boulvard Haussmann, #160, in Paris. These new premises in a very central location now also include a showroom dedicated to both brushes and packaging innovations, Cosmogen's two main businesses. ""We wanted a tool and a forum for our customers. The showroom is like the heart of the reactor. This is where it happens, where ideas are born, mature and take shape. Then we met the conditions for where creativity happens,"" says Renaud van den Berg, the company's General Manager."
Arcade Beauty develops comprehensive ranges of makeup samples,"Arcade Beauty, the group resulting from the merger of Arcade and Bioplan, operates 12 production sites worldwide. This large sales and industrial presence allows the samples company to offer consumers around the world a full range of marketing solutions, from large trial dose runs to exclusive designs and full-service. On the occasion of MakeUp in Paris, which was held in Paris last June, Arcade Beauty showcased a complete range of samples for all make-up segments: complexion, eyes, lips and nails. Among the solutions being developed are flat or volume sachets, tubes, vials, capsules, thermoforming, cards and labels. Each sample can be adapted to different textures and applications: powder, hot-poured cream, liquid foundation, lipstick, lip gloss, mascara and nail polish. ""Arcade Beauty is meeting its clients demands by offering 100% customizable products (printing, shapes, types of application…), and whose generous quantities allow the end-consumer to better experience the product for sale,"" says the company. Thanks to Arcade Beauty's global expertise, brands can create a complete kit of beauty samples or mini-doses to promote a summer look, a specific trend or even an exclusive collection. ""This offer is adapted to all distribution channels: press, direct mail, point-of-sale, digital, cross promotional operations and direct sales,"" highlights Arcade Beauty. For foundation, Beautipod, manufactured in the US and launching in France at the end of this year, contains an ideal dose of product for a true testing experience. A spout facilitates the application process, no matter what its position. In addition, the size of the card transforms the sample into a communication medium. For lips, the Lipspop allows consumers to test the product directly on the lips in a single gesture. For powder, ShadeSeal allows to present up to four shades of foundation, blush or eyeshadow on a single card, to be applied with a finger or an applicator. A transparent film both protects the formula and highlights the shade inside. This type of sample offers the same texture as the product for sale and mimics the application gesture. Other solutions showcased by Arcade Beauty include the nail polish, and blister makeup palette with applicator for lips or eyes. The mini-mascara, a thermoformed version or tube on which the brush—the same as on the product for sale—is twisted on."
Cosfibel strengthens its international network,"Since its creation in 2002, Cosfibel Network (56 million euros turnover in 2014, or +13 % compared to 2013) has continued to develop its Urban Network, a network of sales offices focusing on creativeness and proximity. ""Working with a client in its own local market or internationally is key to the company's,"" explains Cosfibel Premium in a release. In Europe, the group is present in Paris, Edinburgh, London and Barcelona, and in Asia it has locations in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Singapore. In the Americas, in addition to its presence in New York and Mexico, Cosfibel Premium has grown its network with offices in Miami, Lima and Bogota. In 2015, Cosfibel Premium will open an office in Dubai, UAE. Through this proximity network, Cosfibel Premium aims to service both global brands and major local players. In tandem with its sales offices, the company is also expanding its sourcing network. In addition to China, a historic supply partner, Cosfibel Premium has selected partners in Turkey, Tunisia and Portugal to reduce time to market—a crucial aspect in the promotional segment. ""Along with its global presence, Cosfibel Premium offers creative and technical expertise, value analysis, oversight of logistics and full service and a code of ethics. In a market rife with consolidation, Cosfibel Premium is the only company with such a wide offer,"" the company adds. Recent months have also been marked by the success of the CARES program, in particular in China, France and Turkey. Launched by Cosfibel in fall 2012, the CARES program (or Cosfibel Actions for Responsible and Ethical Sourcing) campaigns for diversity, solidarity and an ethical stance both in the workplace and in its business relationships. Within this approach, Cosfibel partners with companies committed in the fight against exclusion of minorities and the underprivileged. Lancôme's Beauty Box (Christmas 2014) is a prime example of what this program can do: for its assembly, wedge, product packing, wrapping and shipping, Cosfibel Premium called on handicapped workers in China for the Asian market and in France for Europe."
Brivaplast: A twofold increase and a series of new products,"You can be a SME specialized in packaging for colour cosmetics and still be able to compete on equal terms with the biggest market players. Brivaplast is a proof of this! There too, a key word, innovation and industrial responsiveness to adjust to changes in demand. The firm did not hesitate to open a production unit in China in 2006 at WuJiang (Shanghai). ""The continuous growth is given anyway by various factors: strong investments on innovation - for packs and applicators, on new machines - the industrial process is fully controlled by us - and on people,"" says Cinzia Bessi, the Marketing Director. ""We have big ideas for the future and a high growth target, in addition we are working with a lot of passion that is in our Italian DNA!"" To note that Brivaplast has just launched its patented plastic brush ""Archy"". In terms of novelties, some of which will be presented at MakeUp in Paris, to note: – A new gloss with a ""glass effect"", with very thick walls and bottom. – A new gloss format that looks like a lipstick.

Technotraf adds sophistication to luxury wooden packaging,"For several years, Technotraf has worked to turn wood into a must-have material for luxury beauty brands. At the last edition of Cosmoprof, the subsidiary of the Quadpack Group thus presented a multitude of shapes and decorations that were never seen before on wooden packaging. ""Our goal is to add more and more value to wood as a material, including very fine decorations,"" says Jaume Ordeig, the company's sales director. ""We also work on new shapes in order to create wooden designs that have never been thought before."" Breaking the mould once again, Technotraf recently showcased a new compact crafted from maple wood sourced from PEFC certified sustainable forests. ""The Wooden Compact is hewn from maple wood for an exceptionally smooth finish. Maple endows feminine elegance to the pack, with its unique texture that appeals to the senses. Technotraf's expertise enables the slim, fine dimensions necessary to achieve the aesthetics required for premium make-up packaging,"" claims the company. Technotraf has decorated the pack using a new technique - called Groove - engraving a fully customisable geometric design deep into the top surface. The surprising design achieved using this technique can be enhanced by silk screening, laser etching and hot stamping for infinite creative potential. A magnetic closure connects the two halves of the compact. Each half is studded with tiny round magnets set flush into the wood. ""With its smooth feel, textured decoration, special closure and a grain pattern that is unique to each and every single item, the Wooden Compact engages users on multiple levels. Added to this sensory assault are its environmental credentials, giving consumers everything they could want to feel good about owning a precious piece of nature itself,"" concludes Technotraf."
Cardboard maker Iggesund expands its presence in North America,"Iggesund Paperboard has established an inventory position and sheeting capabilities in Pomona, California, with the objective of making Invercote - a bleached high quality board designed to pack consumer goods requiring high graphic performances - readily available for quick turn market demand and better serve the commercial print and packaging cluster in California and beyond. ""We've been in the US for more than thirty years but our distribution footprint has been concentrated on the east coast,"" explains Rickard Österlindh, President Iggesund Americas. ""Now is the time to increase our presence on the West Coast, where we know there is a density of brand owners who will appreciate the quality level we offer with Invercote."" Iggesund will focus its sales and marketing efforts on premium packaging and graphical print applications, building on the foundation of offset and digital print business recently established through a network of merchant distributors. ""Invercote is a niche product in the US. Unlike domestically produced paper and paperboard grades, Invercote's is manufactured using a multi-layer construction, which means that it will not crack on the fold; neither with nor against the grain. This is an incredibly powerful selling point, which is further strengthened by a second-to-none environmental sustainability platform,"" comments Neal Haussel, Sales Director & Marketing Manager US. Enhanced distribution from coast to coast in the US is just one step in Iggesund's overarching effort to strengthen its service platform outside Europe. In step with that effort, the company has launched Care by Iggesund, a broader service concept featuring the fast, easy ordering of samples and inspirational materials, the access to product safety information and certificates, as well as information of the origin of raw materials or the preservation of the environment, and access to the analytical services of Iggesund' s accredited Laboratory for Sensory and Chemical Analyses. Iggesund's service offering encompasses everything associated with Invercote – from technical support in local markets to the paperboard expertise the company offers in the form of a wide range of reference materials. ""We don't just want customers to buy our paperboard,"" Rickard Österlindh concludes. ""We want them to get the most out of the products we produce by making a resource base of knowledge available to them. All our documentation, together with an experienced team of local market technicians exists to ensure that."""
Stölzle: Individuality by innovation,"Design and decoration have become increasingly important to allow products gain individuality and shelf appeal. Most brands rely on sophisticated and innovative decoration techniques to enhance and improve the branding of their products.

Norline Atelier has new ambitions,"Based in Grigny (20 km from Paris, France) since its creation in 1961, the family business was originally a manufacturer of leather or imitation leather briefcases for schoolchildren but shifted to the luxury markets during 1980 due to the Chinese competition in its initial business. The strategic move proved beneficial as it allowed Norline to survive the massive imports of Asian made products. Most of the company's production now includes rigid customized briefcases produced in very small series featuring an average of 20 to 40 units, but orders of 1 to 5 units are not uncommon. Today, a total of 1,000 to 2,000 pieces comes out of the workshop each month. ""Our expertise lies in our ability to design and manufacture high-end customized products in very small series, in a very short time and at reasonable prices,"" says Arnaud Gaget, President of Norline Atelier. To address the demand of customers from the luxury industry, Norline has gradually integrated its subcontractors. Today the company employs 22 people, mainly in production since most of the process is manual. Given the required quality and the small series, the workforce represents approximately 50% of production costs. From graphics to sheathing through the wood structures, everything is done in-house. ""Responsiveness is one of our greatest strengths. Our multidisciplinary structure provides complete satisfaction in terms of production lead times, and our know-how is recognized by our customers as a guarantee regarding the quality of their products,"" says Olivier Grandière, who joined Norline in November 2014 as General Manager. With over 250 customers, mainly in the perfumery and cosmetics business (70%-75% of the turnover), Norline Atelier's sales reached 2.5 million euros in 2014, 19% of which with foreign customers. Capitalising on its good reputation, the company now wants to strengthen its position internationally and to become one of the European leaders in this market where the demand does not weaken. ""All the brands are staging their products and betting on premium merchandising,"" says Arnaud Gaget. Eager to find the best quality combined with short series, niche fragrance brands (Le Galion, Dyptique, Jo Malone...) are an important growth driver for the company that participated in the Esxence tradeshow held last month in Milan. However, Norline also wants to open up new markets beyond the cosmetic and perfumery sectors. Spirits already accounts for 15% of orders and interesting opportunities are emerging the eyewear, jewellery and fashion sectors. The company therefore made new investments to increase its production capacity. Already equipped with two UV LED printing machines, Norline also invested in a new laser cutting machine in March 2015. The company also strengthened its teams, especially in the production area. Eventually, Norline Atelier targets a turnover of 3 million euros in 2015 and 4 million euros within three years, including 25% abroad, mainly in Europe."
"Lacquer effects, by Mega Airless","Beyond traditional shiny and matte varnishes, other lacquers offer a surprising range of effects. In addition to Soft Touch, clever designs, such as crackled or fissured textures, rough stone and wet-look effects are coming to the fore. These new-generation lacquers give standard packaging a custom design that reflects the formulas found inside. ""With its velvety feel that can be applied to all or just a portion of the product, Soft Touch remains a favorite for its texture,"" says Mega Airless, which offers Soft Touch finishing on bottles and caps for all of its dispenser and cap ranges. The company also boasts new decorative finishing options with surprising tactile and visual effects. Applying lacquer via silkscreen, for example, to produce a surface aspect that is both resistant and can be easily printed. A rough stone effect evokes strength and resistance to time - a perfect fit for a men's skincare line. For this option, printing follows lacquering, which can then be decorated with hot-stamped pieces. Crackle or fissured effect is available in several shades. As it is transparent, the effect allows the user to see the formula inside the bottle. It also plays on the colors of the pack and its contents. Additional printing is possible before or after the lacquer is applied. Wet effect evokes freshness. Droplets appear on the surface with a slight relief effect. This option is a good fit for purifying skincare ranges, suncare or lotions with floral fragrances. Printing before lacquering."
M&H expands its range of plastic packaging solutions,"Part of the RPC Group since December 2013, M&H Plastics was founded in 1973 and merged with RPC Manuplastics in April 2014 to create M&H Group. With a production capacity up to 1 billion bottles, 50 million tubes and 150 million jars a year, M&H Group counts among the big players in the Personal Care, Beauty and wellbeing market. The latest innovations of M&H include foil-wrapped tubes, which offer the flexibility and cost efficiency of plastic with the prestige appearance of metal. Plastic also helps the pack to maintain its original form and not to crush as with metal. This new development allows numerous options of decoration. Another innovation is the Fusion Cap which allows brands to create distinctive cap colours for the same packaging, for as little MOQ as 10,000 units, compare to 100,000 units which is the standard in the industry when using a bi-injection machinery. In terms of product size, the packaging manufacturer has also launched a 15ml for its Vogue range to create opportunities for the promotion of product and the hotel and travel market (sample or travel size). Last year, M&H also developed braille printing for tubes and bottles and won the prestigious Horners' Bottlemakers' Award. To bring even more flexibility to its product offering and reduce the time to market, M&H are able to fast-track sample packaging on demand through 3D printing. Life size product can now be created to help with the process of creation. ""Manufacturing flexibility, customer service and product quality are key factors to retain clients or attract new ones. We know the beauty market and, as part of the RPC Group of companies, have access to production facilities across the world. We truly understand the needs of our clients and we can answer any standard or custom requirements,"" Howard Frost, Marketing Manager at M&H told Premium Beauty News. On the environmental side, the manufacturer can source materials such as resins, Biodegradable products, PLA (Polylactic Acid), PCR (Post Consumer Regrind) or PIR (Post Industrial Regrind) as well as polymers drawn from sea shell to offer sustainable products. M&H serves clients from all around the world including the EU, Sweden, Australia, North America & Russia, serving brands from the premium market as well as the mass market. The integration of the company within the RPC group, which after the recent acquisition of Promens has become one of the world's leading suppliers of rigid plastic packaging, should also enhance the capacity of M&H to meet global demand."
Lipstick tubes: the Kemas answer,"More than thirty years ago! It was in 1980 that Ladjuar Dinata, a former employee of the Revlon Group, decided to set up his own production company. Thirty-five years later, Kemas continues to grow strong with a global expansion in sales. The company has become one of the biggest, if not the largest producer of lipstick tubes in Southeast Asia. Kemas produces approximately 100 million units globally per year! In 2013, the company has given itself a 'little more' – some will say ""much more"" – means to achieve its industrial expansion. ""Our current industrial capacity would allow us to easily increase our output by twofold,"" explains Alex Hong, Account Manager. That is, 200 million units! But not under just any conditions! 80 injection machines (the majority being high quality German made machines) with 29 of them installed in the new site, which operates entirely under strict temperature controlled, cleanroom environments that extends throughout the production and assembly process. Ladjuar Dinata continues to expand the business with the help of two of his children, one of which being his daughter Dina Kumara Dinata, Marketing Director. Investments undertaken in 2013 will have amounted to 10 million dollars. As a result on this continued investment, Kemas has implemented a 'state of the art' manufacturing process with a high level of automation, the whole process operating in a cleanroom atmosphere. Dina claims, ""we are not done yet"" with an emphasis to develop and implement a 5th automated assembly line in 2015. Complex, a lipstick tube? Yes, very complex with extremely narrow tolerances. ""There is no room for error,"" insists Dina Dinata. ""We are walking a very fine line in achieving the most optimum mechanism specification and performance,"" adds Nata Dinata, Director of Product Development and the son of Ladjuar Dinata. ""This is the reason why we continue to use only the highest quality tooling coupled with the best equipment in the market. Kemas prides itself in being able to consistently control the quality we put out, thus ensuring that the millions of Lipstick cases we supply to market continually meet the high standards our customers expect from us,"" states Urip Tjendera, President-Director of PT Kemas since 1994. Kemas has a portfolio of a dozen different mechanisms and knows perfectly well how to take advantage of its in-house expertise, which also includes the design of all its injection moulding tools. Even though lipstick components still represent the majority of production activity to date, the leaders at Kemas have not neglected other sectors such as jars, make-up cases and lip gloss packaging. ""We have now expanded into the manufacture of eyeliners and who knows what the future holds with other product categories,"" concludes Urip Tjendera. On the commercial side, Kemas has now expanded its Sales and Support presence in the USA with a fully functional state base team. ""Since 2013 the US based team is responsible for providing a complete end to end service to our customers,"" states Darren Eade, VP of Sales. ""To help strengthen our position in the Global marketplace, it is important for us to continue to diversify our product portfolio in-line with our core competencies."""
The Pochet Group steps up the pace of its investments,"To Irène Gosset, President of the Board of Directors, and Tristan Farabet, Managing Director of the Group, the company's future remains firmly rooted in the high-end perfume and beauty products market. With about 5,500 employees all around the world, 18 sites across four continents, and a 500 million euro turnover in 2014, Pochet has got it all. The group's origins date back to the creation of the Du Courval glass factory in 1623, almost 400 years ago. It is now renowned for its wide range of expertise: glass, of course, but also metal and plastics (Qualipac), and decoration-finishing (Solev). Pochet's managers have undertaken to give a new impetus to the group to meet brands' growing productivity and innovation requirements. ""We must rely on unique services, technologies, and innovations"", emphasizes Tristan Farabet, who joined the group a year ago, after having managed the French Coca-Cola subsidiary, among others. First step: excellence of the industrial facilities. The Pochet Group initiated an ambitious investment programme whose volume doubled between 2013 and 2014 to reach more than 40 million euros – 9% of the group's turnover – and which will remain at the same level in 2015. The glass division received almost half these investments, in particular via the rebuilding of one of the four furnaces of the plant located in Blangy-sur-Bresle, Normandy, France, for a total amounting to about 15 million euros. Since the beginning of 2015, this furnace has been producing high quality glass in improved environmental conditions, most notably with a strong decline in energy consumption. In addition, the group has modernized and automated several lines for its French subsidiaries specialized in finishing, for example by installing video control systems intended to monitor quality. And new decoration lines have also been put in in Brazil. As for Qualipac, priority was given to China, with the plant in Shanghai being moved to completely new premises. The surface area is now twice as large as the previous site. The construction of this new plant also represented an opportunity for a large-scale renewal of the equipment (almost 60% of the presses are new), with a view to supply not only Western customers, but also local ones, mainly in compact cases and jars for makeup and skincare. On top of that, the group has started to extend the capacities of its IPEL subsidiary in Brazil. As the historic leader of the makeup segment in this country, IPEL received technology transfers, in particular in Surlyn transformation, and 30% of its activity is now dedicated to perfume capping. Lastly, new lacquering and metallization lines were installed on Solev's premises in France in 2013, and a series of investments on automation were made in 2014, by developing the company's laser engraving equipment. All these investments were intended to strengthen the expertise of a group that boasts a strategy of excellence and of controlled know-how and technologies that its competitors do not have. As for glass, Pochet du Courval had already shown its mastery of glass distribution when La Vie Est Belle (Lancôme) and Jour d'Hermès were launched. With Eole, the glassmaker goes even farther in terms of performance thanks to a patented process that enables to literally draw the distribution at the bottom of the bottle. As for the in'pressive! technology used for the bottle of La Panthère (Cartier), it actually makes it possible to carve the glass within the bottle! In terms of decoration, Solev recently showcased several original creations resulting from the combination of different techniques (liquid metallization, screen painting, sublimation, laser). ""Most of our innovations are made possible thanks to the complementarity and synergy of the expertise of the group's three divisions"", Irène Gosset underlines. As an example, the bottle of La Panthère by Cartier and the launching of Louboutin nail varnish result from a close collaboration between Pochet du Courval and Qualipac. Clearly, the group's priority is to reinforce and strengthen its production capacity and know-how. But still, an external growth operation is not excluded. ""We will do it when and where we think it makes sense,"" specifies Tristan Farabet. The Pochet Group is not much into debt, which means it has significant financial means, and it has identified several growth areas like perfumery in Brazil, skincare in China or, on a more global scale, makeup. ""The continuity and commitment of our family shareholders is a considerable strength. We have a vision in the medium and long terms and the ability to go beyond the contingencies related to the current situation and invest for the future. This constitutes a real strength, and it is actually viewed as such by our customers,"" concludes Tristan Farabet."
Thai supplier of cosmetic packaging Thai Hoover Industry reaches a new stage,"Premium Beauty News - The industrial adventure of Thai Hoover actually began in 1972! And not at all in the cosmetic sector? Voravit Damrongvatanapokin - Indeed! At the time my father started doing business by making toys and it was not until several years later that Thai Hoover started manufacturing its first packagings for the cosmetic sector. Today we employ about 1,500 people in one site of nearly 37,000 sqm (398,000 sq.ft.) in the suburbs of Bangkok. Its main original feature: a fully integrated production process. The factory handles every step of production from the raw material to the finished article, dealing with the client's order rapidly and efficiently. The plant works with plastic, aluminium and brass, therefore providing an extremely wide choice of products. Our Quality Control Department oversees every stage of the production process as well as the testing of the end product. In 2003 Thai Hoover industry was ISO9001 certified for the designing and manufacturing of plastic and metal cosmetic packaging, and in 2011 it received the GMP certification for the manufacturing of plastic and metal cosmetic packaging. Note that since 1993, Katsushika, our Japanese partner transferred its metal-working and finishing technology to our factory. Premium Beauty News - You undertook major industrial investments in 2010 and started this year the construction of a new building to house a brand new automatic anodizing line! Voravit Damrongvatanapokin - Indeed, five years ago we invested heavily in new injection moulding machines, which allowed us to significantly increase our production capacity in plastic parts. In 2011, we also reorganized several of our rooms into clean rooms for assembly operations. Finally, this year, we started the construction of a new building that will house a brand new automatic anodizing line. Today, our population of injection machines totals 150. We have four semi-automatic anodizing lines and sixty transfer presses. We also have four vacuum metallization chambers and six coating lines. Not to mention of course a whole range of finishing equipment for hot stamping, silkscreen printing, an so on. As you can see our main strength is the full integration of our production, including plastic extrusion and mould designing in a dedicated workshop that we never stop modernizing, like recently, with new and high performing automatic milling machines. Premium Beauty News - The main production is lipstick tubes ... but not only? Voravit Damrongvatanapokin - Not only, indeed! It is true that we have made a reputation for ourselves in the manufacture of lipstick tubes, but we are also very present in the manufacturing of jars, make-up cases, lipgloss, caps and closures for the perfume industry, etc. We are also planning to produce mascaras in the near future. Roughly half of our packagings are off-the-shelf items and the other half specific products. Premium Beauty News - You are one of the packaging suppliers serving some of the leading Japanese brands with a firmly established reputation for quality! Voravit Damrongvatanapokin - Our company first developed itself chiefly by supplying key customers in the Japanese cosmetics industry: Shiseido, Kanebo, Kose, etc. but it is also a leading company for the supply of standard cosmetic packagings in Thailand. Additionally, and for the past 4 years, it is also one of the main suppliers of lipstick tubes for the L'Oréal Group."
Louvrette increases production capacity,"Louvrette has had a brand new 1,000 m2 storage space since the end of last December. And the German SME is now waiting for the delivery of its production site extension: an additional space of 800 m2, whose construction should be completed by May 2015. This extra surface area will first enable to use seven new injection machines - most of them will be operational in June 2015. These investments will make it possible for the company to double its production capacity on the airless packaging segment and get an additional margin of over 30% for the production of thick-walled jars and their caps. ""This building work also represented an opportunity to restructure our whole site,"" explains Lyne Hélène Bouchard, Sales and Marketing Director. It should be noted that the company manufactures and maintains a large part of its tools itself; therefore it must have specific areas dedicated to these activities. All in all, almost 5.5 million euros were invested (2.5 million euros apart from the acquisition of the machines, periphery, and tools). ""Increasing our production capacity will help us better meet the growing demand for high quality jars and packaging from mass market brands that tend to premiumize their offers,"" Mrs Bouchard concludes. The German company is planning new extensions, in particular with a view to integrate decoration lines as from 2016."
Pujolasos and Decopak launch metallised wooden cap for perfumes and cosmetics,"Showcased at the latest edition of the Paris PCD Congress, ""Luxury Wood"" is a range of metallised wooden caps for perfumes and cosmetic products. The metallization process has been developed and patented by Pujolasos wood & pack and Decopak Europ, two companies based in the province of Barcelona. The launch of this new product is the outcome of research carried out by Pujolasos wood & pack in recent years and Decopak Europ's continued investment in R&D. The goal of the two companies' R&D departments was to develop a technique that could lend a sophisticated touch to wood, while preserving all of wood's characteristics as a noble material with a close bond to nature. ""The elegant, distinguishing hue is achieved using a metallized varnish, and comes in a wide range of colours and tones. The product can also have a matte or shiny finish, with metallic features added, with graded colours and personalised decoration. To guarantee the resistance of all the finishes, they have undergone the most rigorous quality control tests,"" Pujolasos explains in a release. All the wood used by Pujolasos is certified with the PEFC seal, an international seal promoting the sustainable overall management of forests, from forest managers, companies that transform forest products, to the end customer. Through the PEFC certificate, customers receive a guarantee they are buying sustainably managed forest products, and that they are also helping to combat illegal logging. ""Wood is Pujolasos' raison d'être, because due to its unique features, we achieve an elegant and exclusive product, which is also sustainable,"" states Àngel Pujolasos, CEO of the company."
Toly opens its new corporate offices and innovation centre,"Undoubtedly the company based in Malta, through the impetus given by its President Andy Gatesy, has equipped itself with a tool, certainly one of the most performing in terms of innovation. This dedicated centre is the result of many years of research focused on new packagings and new applicators for the perfume and cosmetic sector. The client can have access to the 800 models on display, try them, test them, and compare them. Few companies of this type in the world can boast having such a tool through which the Head of Toly intends to stay one step ahead of competitors. ""We continue to create a hundred new packaging each year,"" insists Gatesy. ""To this end, we equip ourselves with the best performing equipment in terms of software and 3D printers."" ""A world leader needs world leading offices and I believe we have reached our goal with this building,"" says Andy Gatesy ""I want all the visitors who walks into this building to clearly understand who Toly is, our history, who we are today and be inspired as to where we are going. Our purpose built Innovation Centre is a state-of-the-art facility which includes and showcase: our trends, our full range of standard packaging across all categories, our technologies, our innovation."" Note that the Maltese firm has installed a new metallizing chamber. Cost: 500 000 euros. ""We are targeting 100 million euros in sales in the next five years,"" added Gatesy."
Metal: the US company Anomatic invests more than USD 12 millions,"Premium Beauty News - A new investment package that comes after the 10 million dollars already invested in 2014 in the development, among other things, of two new fully automated anodizing lines.... A substantial effort indeed? Scott Rusch - Substantial, yes, but necessary! To remain competitive and be at the forefront of the aluminum parts processing technology, intended among others, to the beauty packaging sector, there are no other alternatives than to have the following qualities: – Innovative to develop new solutions to growing markets. – Scalable, to meet global demand. – Responsive, to have the required industrial flexibility to react Instantly and meet customer demand. – Vertically Integrated, to be one source for all the packaging needs of our customers, from design through assembly. – Flexible, to be capable of creating any color, any finish, any decoration to perfectly extend the brand of our customer. – Reliability, to consistently deliver high quality on time, every time. Premium Beauty News - A ""family"" story that of Anomatic! And what a long way you have come since the initial manufacturing of ammunition cases intended for the US Army during the Vietnam War! Scott Rusch - Indeed, we can say that we are one of the few family businesses in this sector in the world. We were even one of the first companies in 1965 - year of the founding of the company in Chicago - to really own the first automatic anodizing line, which was also patented two years later. In 1974, due to a need for increased capacity, the company moved in Westerville, Ohio. Fifteen years later, in the early 90s, we expanded our business with a new production facility in Newark, again in Ohio. In 2007, it's the great leap forwards with the construction of a plant in China in Suzhou, an exact copy of our US units. In 2010, we invest to build a comprehensive tool and a die shop to expand the metal stamping capacity in the Connecticut facility to 27 metal stamping presses. This capacity increase enables Anomatic to design and build tooling onsite. En 2012, the LEED (Leadership in Energy Environmental Design) certified our building begins operations in New Albany, Ohio. In 2013, a cGMP room is built in Anomatic's ISO 14001 certified plant in Suzhou, China. In 2014, the record result speaks for itself: we have six global offices ... we opted for vertical Integration ..., we are an integral part, on our site of New Albany, of a new Beauty campus, where are grouped more than fourteen companies in the sector... 95% of all tooling are built in-house... our total capacity is of 2.5B units..., and that same year two new anodizing lines were added. We own some 68 transfer presses, 27 assembly lines (including three new ones this year). Premium Beauty News - You company has really specialized over the years in supplying anodized aluminum parts to the Beauty packaging industry? Scott Rusch - Absolutely! And to achieve this, you had to have the highest anodizing capacities to stay ahead of consumer demand for beautiful products and packaging. The anodizing technique enables to increase sales by adding luxury and prestige, to extend the brand with custom colors and finishes, to stand out on the shelf amongst the competition, to customize a packaging with logos and artwork. Anomatic can reproduce Any color imaginable. Anomatic can achieve any appearance from bright high-gloss to matte and antique. The cold feel, reflective look, and pristine touch of metal push the limits for luxury brands. Premium Beauty News - You have placed a strong focus on innovation! Scott Rusch - That's right with the creation of an Innovation & Design Centre. We have a team of dedicated innovation experts, consisting of chemical, product, industrial and manufacturing engineers; product development experts; and marketers. We provide a Custom Colour Matching, which enables a perfect color representation and a 3D rapid prototyping (metal and plastic). Finally we have a Product Library, showcasing the company's 50 year history. Premium Beauty News - This year 2015 is marked by a major new investment on the site of New Albany! Scott Rusch - The site expansion has just begun. It is a $ 12.5m investment, which consists in doubling the size of the first level by adding 70,000 sq. ft. The unit hosting the assembly machines is going to grow from 6,500 sq. ft. to 17,500 sq. ft. There will also be an additional 21,000 sq. ft. of warehousing and approx 22,500 sq. ft. of Class 100,000 Cleanroom manufacturing space to be added for new technologies. Premium Beauty News - The environment is of course an essential parameter for a particularly sensitive industry like yours. Scott Rusch - Anomatic is committed to global environmental sustainability through innovation and is dedicated to exceeding standards worldwide. We continually reinvest in state-of-the-art environmental and recycling equipment. We transform aluminium, which is 100% recyclable."
Albéa wants to use its new centre of excellence in Italy to strengthen its position in applicators,"Albéa's new site in Bottanuco has an area of 18,400 square meters, 250 employees and a production capacity of 160 million units per year. This plant consolidates production from two former industrial sites in Verderio and Imbersago, which had been operating for nearly 35 years in the Milan area. Joining the other manufacturing sites of the Cosmetic Rigid Packaging division, in particular in Mexico, Brazil and China, the Bottanuco plant strengthens Albéa's leading position in the mascara packaging market. Thanks to its integrated injection, extrusion-blow moulding, decoration, surface treatment and assembly technologies, the site can produce packaging and applicators for mascaras, lip-glosses and eyeliners. Furthermore, the Albéa Tips Studio will also be setting up its global Center of Expertise at the Bottanuco site. This program brings together all of the group's expertise in the areas of innovation, development and production of applicators, including fibre and plastic mascara brushes, lipgloss tips and eyeliner applicators. The centre also features a comprehensive library of fibre and plastic brushes as well as rapid prototyping capabilities and a makeup test laboratory to evaluate the trio formed by applicator, wiper and formula. In a makeup market notable for its rapid pace of innovations, one of Albéa's main goals is to reduce development delays. From the customer's brief, and thanks to the brushes library, the supplier can deliver a first sample within three days. Rapid prototyping methods have also been deployed to enable the production of new brushes in reduced time and with harmonized assessment methods. The creation of the Albéa Tips Studio is also due to the growing importance of the applicators in the makeup industry, especially for mascaras and lip-glosses. ""In this context, Albéa wants to strengthen its position as an expert in both the fields of applicators and packaging,"" said Anne Rutigliano, Albéa Tips Studio Manager. Indeed, another objective of Albéa is to to increase the added value of its production by selling more packaging and applicator sets. Every year, the supplier already launches about 20 new applicator designs and prototypes. ""This implies to have a perfect knowledge and understanding of the needs and expectations of consumers, in particular through consumer analyses, focus groups, consumer insights, for each region of the world, considering the global scope of the centre,"" adds Anne Rutigliano. Albéa therefore relies on this new site not only to improve its industrial efficiency and responsiveness, but also to offer a wider range of value-added services."
Korean airless specialist Hana carries on investing,"Founded in 1993 by Sung Il Kang, a former engineer in charge of packaging development at Amore Pacific, this company with 85 employees qualifies itself as a ""Global Top Expert in Airless Dispenser & Dual Packaging"" and as an ""Innovation leader in Mechanical Dispensing Systems"". Considering the company's products offering and the list of its customers, the two qualifications seem far from being exaggerated. The company obtained the ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certifications in 2001 and in 2005 respectively. In 2010, it started supplying the La Prairie brand with a particularly sophisticated airless packaging. In 2013, it reached record sales of US$ 21 million, a figure which largely superseded last year, with a new 27 million record mark. The year 2015 promises to be just as exceptional as this figure is expected to exceed 38 million! Any secret tricks? Simply innovate and invest! Hana now owns some 38 injection machines (Arburg, Toshiba, Fanuc), six automatic assembly machines and seven semi-automatic assembly machine for pumps and a varnishing and metallization line. The investment programme plans to increase the equipment population to 57 injection machines and 21 assembly lines by the end of 2015. In terms of developed and marketed products, Hana relies on the success of both its very sophisticated airless packaging line and on a series of new products such as a new pump with an automatic closure that preserves the content; an airless packaging with a customizable dual compartment; another airless packaging with a very clever system for mixing two components upon use; a new lipstick tube with an automatic opening; a new mechanical pencil and, most of all, a new airtight and airless compact equipped with one of the smallest pumps in the world (8.5 mm high). European market is among Hana's priorities and benefits from a cooperation with Mr Jürgen Kloebbe in Germany (Pulheim-Dansweiler), appointed as responsible of the European Sales Strategy, Mr Mauro Zulianello of Linea Glam France ( with offices in Paris, Venice and Taiwan) appointed as responsible for the French and Italian markets."
Draeger GPP to usher luxury packaging into a new digital era,"The first designs intended for the market are now visible, and it has to be said that NeXtep, the new digital solution deployed by printer Draeger GPP, produces amazing quality results! It is hard to the naked eye to distinguish a cardboard box digitally printed with this technology from another offset-printed box. Two packages made with different printing techniques can now be displayed side by side on the same shelf. A first! ""It is the first time digital printing has produced almost the same results as offset printing. With this technology, the focus is on the screen, and it avoids the pixelisation flaws that used to be observed with digital techniques. The whole Pantone colour range can now be printed,"" explains Olivier Roussier, Sales Manager and VP Sales GPP Prestige. The NeXtep concept directly results from the Draeger GPP group's know-how in digital printing. It widens the digital printing capacity of the company to folding boxes, while upgrading it to the industrial level. Given the quality level obtained, the NeXtep technology is immediately available to meet the increasing need for small series, but also for brand new applications. ""There is a growing demand for short series. The number of references is rising, and so are limited or customized series, or the will to leave references that have reached the end of their lives on the market,"" explains Roberto Nardini, Director of the Draeger GPP Group. As for new applications, the NeXtep technology is perfectly adapted to meet the booming demand for personalization, as consumers aspire for their individuality to be considered. ""NeXtep offers numerous possibilities to customize packaging and create new purchase experiences,"" adds Roberto Nardini. ""We can now print thousands of units on an industrial scale, all different from one another."" Many new marketing strategies can thus be imagined. ""For many people, digital technologies make delayed customization possible. That's true. But NeXtep also helps us make customized products right from the start,"" Olivier Roussier insists. For example, it is possible to differentiate product animations according to the point of sale, and create series dedicated to VIP customers or to the most faithful ones. Each packaging can also be personalized by fixing the regulatory elements and those that constitute the brand, and customizing what is left to be printed. There are endless possibilities! Draeger GPP can thus help their customers make marketing or industrial choices by offering them two complementary systems to manufacture their products: offset printing for classic productions, and the digital technology for customized or differentiated productions. ""Our NeXtep solution does not only rely on a new generation of laser printers. We have implemented a whole production system to offer our customers the best packaging generation,"" emphasizes Roberto Nardini. In fact, a whole new production line had to be set up, with a new generation digital printer (new HP Indigo 30000), but also adapted finishing machines and digital laser slitting machines. This investment amounts to almost 2 million euros in total. The technology will be featured on February 4-5, 2015 at the PCD show."

HCT takes advantage of the dynamism of California beauty brands and of the Chinese growth,"The Thorpe family definitely had a very good idea to choose to establish its headquarters in Santa Monica (Los Angeles) several years ago. ""We certainly had a lot of flair,"" admits Tim Thorpe, ""but it is true that reality exceeded our expectations."" So much so that today more than 60% of the Group's global turnover is achieved on the West Coast. ""The end customer is very discerning and the cosmetic industry has to react quickly and establish their point of difference. May West Coast brands recognize this and HCT Group has fulfilled the demand for unique and highly sought out products,"" we were told at the headquarters in Santa Monica. ""And to achieve this,"" explains Thorpe, ""it's a straightforward business model: master the production of all components, at the lowest costs, in a timely manner and with the highest quality level."" With seven production sites in Asia in the form of joint ventures present on every industrial compartments, proposing among other services, plastic injection, metal and Zamac processing, surface treatment, brush manufacture and filling operations, HCT has beautifully managed to fulfill its contract to such an extent that the company has become unquestionably the world leader in its field in terms of turnover. ""The additional plus,"" we were told in Santa Monica, ""being that we are strong on most global markets and also in the forefront to supply a booming Chinese domestic market."" In two years the HCT Group's share for this market increased by 5%! And that is probably just the beginning. The craziest figures currently circulating... ""But let's keep a cool head,"" tempers Thorpe, ""I expect an extra 10% in 2015."" Another shift, and not the least, taken by the beauty sector in the past decade, is the massive recourse to full service. ""Again,"" underlines the President of HCT, ""we managed to anticipate correctly."" Nothing exceptional here, since the value added on the ""pack"" offer alone, could only but continue to decline. Hence the interest for HCT to produce and keep producing packs in China (the company is seeking to further increase its production capacity) and propose in parallel a fleshed out offer in formulations with on top of it, why not, an acquisition in Europe in the long term. As for the Group's commercial positioning, Thorpe is clear: ""We are making it a priority to further strengthen our commercial ties and offer our innovation to key clients who truly value it."" With a turnover of more than USD 300 million for an out-of-plant staff of a little more than 200 people, the HCT Group has further consolidated its presence in both the US and Europe. ""France, in particular,"" emphasizes Thorpe, ""has shown significant growth."" It may be recalled that the HCT Group's product offer includes make-up cases, lipstick tubes, mascaras, lipgloss, eyeliners, brushes, applicators, and so on. Note that the Group will be attending the forthcoming MakeUp in Seoul with its partner Pum-Tech."
RPC wants to buy Promens for 386 million euros,"RPC is a UK headquartered international manufacturer of rigid plastic packaging, supplying to the food and non-food consumer, industrial and vehicles markets. Earlier this year, RPC acquired British plastic packaging manufacturer Maynard & Harris Group Limited (M&H Plastics) in a 124.5 million euros deal. RPC operates 55 plants located in 20 countries and 4 continents and employs approximately 7,500 staffs. Promens also produces rigid plastic packaging and components for the food and non-food, consumer and commercial vehicles markets with a global reach and use similar plastic conversion technologies as RPC, but in addition rotational moulding and reaction-injection moulding. Promens' manufacturing footprint comprises 40 facilities of which 35 are located in Europe. It employs approximately 3,800 people. The combined RPC-Promens could have annualised revenues approaching 2 billion euros across 95 plants and 11,200 employees. The merger would expand the geographic reach of RPC throughout Europe. As far as personal and health care products are concerned, Promens offers a diverse customer base including global consumer and healthcare companies and local Western and Eastern European brands. Customers in personal care value extensive design and technical expertise and continuous product development. According to RPC, ""Promens has a track record of innovation in this field and benefits from being located in close proximity to customers' centres of excellence and filling locations in France."" Promens has also demonstrated a track record of growth across its Eastern European facilities in Poland and Russia. ""Given Iceland's current capital restrictions it is difficult to provide the necessary investment to enable Promens to meet its ambitious growth targets. I am supportive of the proposed combination with RPC and believe this would prove to be an excellent opportunity,"" commented Hermann M. Thorisson, Chairman of Promens. The closure of the operation is expected on 7 January 2015."
Quadpack inaugurates manufacturing division,"At the end of 2014, less than ten months after the acquisition of Krampak in January 2014, which confirmed the group's new industrial strategy since the acquisition of Technotraf in March 2013, Quadpack has officially inaugurated its new manufacturing division at Torrelló, in the heart of the Catalan 'cosmetic valley'. Quadpack is therefore relocating a significant part of its business in Europe. Actually, manufacturing and / or decorating beauty packaging in Catalonia enables the group to cut turnaround times, a key criteria when cosmetic brands intend to respond as quickly as possible to emerging consumer demands. ""We also have a responsibility to the environment and, on a social level, to our community. Local production means a smaller carbon footprint, more jobs and a much-needed boost the local economy,"" highlighted Tim Eaves, Quadpack Group CEO, at the end of 2013. In practice, Krampak was moved to new renovated premises, including a brand-new, purpose-built 650m2 decoration area. In parallel, Technotraf's premises have been modernized almost entirely, including the creation of a new decoration workshop dedicated to wooden products. ""We have consolidated all of our industrial capabilities on the same site, to create a single, streamlined Manufacturing Division, where we pool our talent and share our knowledge to create great new packaging concepts,"" said Tim Eaves. The 10,000m2 site now comprises five areas: – The wood manufacturing plant of Technotraf Wood Packaging, which can produce 15,000 wooden pieces per day. – The decoration facilities of Krampak. – The 'Inspiration Room', where Quadpack's creative teams can meet with customers and conceive their future beauty packaging. – A 110m2 sample warehouse. – New warehousing facilities. According to Quadpack, over 500,000 euros have been invested in upgrading the current facility. Thus, the new decoration area housing Krampak, is furnished with the latest screen-printing, tampo-printing and hot stamping equipment to cope with all types of demands from brands. The sample warehouse stocks over 1,000 different packs from Quadpack's standard range in controlled conditions, ready for shipping to anywhere in Europe within 48 hours. The warehousing capability stores semi-finished products for decoration on demand, thus reducing lead times."
Louvrette celebrates its 50th anniversary and plans new developments,"Premium Beauty News - Where does the name Louvrette actually come from? Fabian Erlhöfer - My father founded the company in 1964, together with his brother. Louvrette was then built up and led through good times and hard times until 2006, when the company was passed over to me. The question of the name Louvrette is often asked and I can tell you a short story to explain the origin. During the early 1960s in Switzerland, my father worked as a toolmaker and design engineer. One day a customer commissioned him to develop a plastic powder compact - these had previously been made from metal. But my father was unsuccessful in finding a producer for the item. Then, when they spent Christmas with the family, my father and his brother (who was also a toolmaker) decided that they would make an offer for manufacturing the compact and produce it in the garage with a used injection moulding machine. The customer - whose company was called Louvre S.A. - agreed and suggested that my father and his brother should name the new company Louvrette, meaning ""Little Louvre"". Premium Beauty News - The company has now been operating on the market for 50 years. To what do you attribute this success? Fabian Erlhöfer - I think that our success is the result of the whole team, which participates with passion. We have never lost our focus for high-quality cosmetic plastic packaging, our focus on our customers, on consistently high quality, on reliability and service. In addition to that, we have managed over this long history to consistently adapt to market changes and growing customer needs. Premium Beauty News - Your product range today is very different to the early days... Fabian Erlhöfer - Oh yes, you're right, it is very different. Over the first 30 years, Louvrette explicitly developed and manufactured powder compacts. This is now only a small part of our business. Since the mid-90s, we have been manufacturing thick-walled cream jars, and today our main turnover consists of jars, airless dispensers and bottles. We offer a variety of standard shapes that we decorate and refine individually according to customer requirements. Of course, we also manufacture specific products for our customers and build the tools for them in our own toolmaking department. Since the foundation of the company, we do all this at our location in Kierspe and therefore we provide 100% 'Made in Germany' products. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, how do you see the future for ""Made in Germany"" products? Fabian Erlhöfer - Our main market is in Europe and it certainly makes sense to produce close to the customer, so that the delivery route is kept short. I see it like this: If you do it properly, you can produce very well in Germany and be competitive, or being competitive because of it. With a well-qualified and motivated team, as well as sensible automation, we are absolutely competitive in Germany, where in my view, we have the best infrastructure in the world. Together with consistently high quality and innovative products, we should be able to offer our customers the best cost-effectiveness ratio. We believe in our location and that is the reason for our current expansion. We are extending production, warehousing facilities and important operational areas which will allow us to optimise our internal processes in order to be more efficient. Furthermore, the extension provides Louvrette with the necessary space for further growth. I see enormous potential for Louvrette both now and in the future. Premium Beauty News - What priorities will Louvrette be setting during the coming years? Fabian Erlhöfer - Our strategy is clearly defined to continue to concentrate on our known market segment and look closely at other opportunities. For example, supply markets and sub-segments in which we are not yet active today. I'm very sorry that I cannot go into detail at this point, as we would like to surprise you and our customers."
"""Packaging facilitates access to beauty,"" Philippe Thuvien, L'Oréal","Premium Beauty News - How was the packaging activity in recent months? Philippe Thuvien - The Group's Packaging activity was very strong in 2014 with more than 25,000 packaging items specifications, and more than 680 moulds developed with on average more than 13 cavities per mould. Our Packaging teams, organized by geographic areas (Europe, Americas, Asia and Africa/Middle East) and by category (hair care, hygiene, perfume and make-up), develop for their areas and for regional hubs. Support functions (Design, Innovation and Expertise) serve the operational Packaging and Development teams. Premium Beauty News - What were the main developments? Philippe Thuvien - This year 2014 was marked by major launches with innovative packaging such as: – The Grandiose mascara, with a transparent cover and a straight standing rose embedded in the transparent material, a ""Swan's neck"" wand and its ""wiper"" adapted to the specific shape and a elastomer brush for ergonomics and precision. This mascara enables to achieve a balanced make-up of both eyes, and an easy access to all lashes, from corner to corner and root to tip. – Maybelline's Color Elixir, a liquid lipstick with a design recalling traditional Lipstick codes and whose performance is based on a flexible applicator with an extra-soft flocking for a controlled and precise application. – The double tube from L'Oréal Professionnel, combining a styling gel and a hair care cream in the same packaging; the challenge being to manage to deliver homogeneously and with the same quantity, 2 types of formulas with different viscosities. – Bonbon by Viktor and Rolf, with its pump bottle and a slightly pulled in neck into the wing-shaped shoulders of the bottle, a significant glass weight considering the size of the bottle, folds in the ""wings"" that make it difficult to ""load"" the glass into the mould and finally the lacquering of the bottle. Premium Beauty News - What are your goals for the future? Philippe Thuvien - The cosmetic world is facing increasingly fierce competition from global competitors, but also more and more, from local actors. Packaging makes beauty more easily accessible to women and men on the planet with ""product answers"" tailored to their needs. Our objective for the years to come is to actively contribute to the conquest of a new billion consumers by developing attractive and functional designs, visible and sustainable innovations, total quality and safety control which are all values perceived and expected by our consumers. Premium Beauty News - Your group is targeting a billion new consumers! A significant impact on the packaging activity? Philippe Thuvien - Conquering a billion new consumers means for the L'Oréal Group, developing products that meet their needs and expectations. Packaging must help emerging markets access to beauty, with accessible innovation meeting beauty routines and aspirations, climate and culture. Visible innovation, perceived value, and products performance will be key to conquer these new consumers but also to retain our existing customers. Premium Beauty News - One of the issues is the container/content interaction? Philippe Thuvien - Stability and the container/content compatibility are major issues in the development of our new products. The packaging protects the product from external conditions (contamination, light oxidation, gas...) but its interaction with the formula must not present a risk to the stability of the product and therefore its performance. The role of our Compatibility teams is, of course, to perform tests on products, but also: to participate upstream in the packaging design by making recommendations on the basis of formulas characteristics, to perform risk analysis in order to move towards standard tests, reinforced or reduced, or extrapolations. Premium Beauty News - What is the role of Open Development in your strategy? Philippe Thuvien - It's a ""win-win"" partnership; our suppliers present us exclusive innovations in Packaging and ""Finished Goods"". Our aim is to speed up the time to market of these innovations, we are working with these partners to the delegation of their certification. Premium Beauty News - The environmental issues of Packaging in the conquest of a new billion consumers? Philippe Thuvien - Our ambition to conquer a new billion consumers poses a challenge to us: producing more with less environmental impact. This means improving the footprint of our products and, consequently, that of our Packagings which are, with the exception of rinse-off products, the biggest impact contributors at the product level. L'Oréal is committed to sustainable innovation: in 2020, 100% of our products will show a positive environmental or social impact. For this, we are going to measure the impact of our products so that our innovations and renovations present improved environmental and social profiles. We will continue to work on reducing the weight of our bottles, which are already for some, such as Fructis by Garnier, among the lightest on the market, and integrating recycled material (PCR) to reduce the depletion of natural resources. L'Oréal also wishes to use generation 2 bioplastics if they come from renewable resources such as wood, to limit the depletion of fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Premium Beauty News - What are the main lines of development for the different Beauty sectors (perfume, hair care, body care, skincare, make-up etc.)? Philippe Thuvien - The main lines of packaging development will mainly be answers to consumers' needs, which are for example: – Boost product performance with make-up applicators or with new delivery systems for hygiene or styling products. – Ease the use of products with functional designs like for the senior's market Sustainably innovate in all categories – Better protect our formulas to help reduce or eliminate preservatives like for the launch of Tolériane Ultra from La Roche Posay. – Make Beauty accessible to emerging markets with affordable innovation. – Add intelligence to our packaging to achieve ""custom designed"" products."
Pak 2000: Bags add value to the product being purchased!,"Premium Beauty News - First, a few words on the company… William B. Gram - We produce our bags in both the United States and Asia. We provide our customers with a full range of support, right from the first meeting through to worldwide distribution, with as little or as much hand-holding as the client requires. We'll even assist with project goal analysis to decide upon the correct course of action. We participate to the design, manufacture, and conveyance of the selected product. Our project managers have packaging engineering backgrounds and years of experience in the management of manufacturing. All requirements are taken into account including graphic development, sampling, quality engineering, manufacturing, and distribution. Every detail of a project is analyzed and closely monitored to meet the most demanding expectations. All our offices employ multilingual staff, experienced at providing clients with a level of support appropriate to global businesses. You should also know that for nearly four decades, Pak 2000 has managed the distribution of its clients' products, nationally and internationally, utilizing ocean and air freight and that we can also deliver warehousing, and store-door service. Premium Beauty News - Some however will say that there is nothing more ordinary than a paper bag! William B. Gram - Well, they're wrong! All of our work is of the highest quality and designed to add value to the product being purchased. The companies with which we work are not only in the business of providing consumers with excellent products, they also offer esteem, as part of a lifestyle choice. For many, being able to be proud of a purchase is just as important as the quality of the product. Providing a complete customer experience is part and parcel of luxury branding. Our solutions are designed to maximize not only a company's ability to market their brand post-purchase, but also to provide the consumer purchasing the product with a suitable outer packaging that increases esteem. Premium Beauty News - It might be useful to recall the main benefits of these famous bags? William B. Gram - It's actually worth recalling. When they choose one of our bags, companies enjoy the following benefits: – A portable billboard which provides a branding opportunity to increase exposure while the consumer is on the move, between the store and his final destination. – Recurring brand exposure opportunities, as our premium bags are normally saved and re-used several times by the consumer throughout the normal life cycle of the bag. – An additional element that adds value to the purchasing experience, as part of the luxury lifestyle indicated by the premium brand purchased. Premium Beauty News - You do not just manufacture bags! You also manufacture boxes? And even if you also offer plastic based products, you really are a fully fledged player of the paper industry! William B. Gram - This is true even if boxes are not, strictly speaking, our main activity! Concerning the materials we transform even if paper is the main material, our philosophy is to use the finest materials available. Different materials have different costs, and it's up to our customers to select the materials that will fit their projects' economic parameters. We use for example a high grade quality coated paper in a variety of thicknesses to ensure the correct amount of rigidity for specific projects. Customers can select from a paper coated on one side (C1S) or covered on two sides (C2S) with a gloss or matte finish. We also use Kraft paper. Paper undergoing the Kraft process tends to have a higher tensile strength than other paper materials. It is relatively inexpensive and when produced is naturally darker than other papers, though it can be bleached to produce an excellent clean, white look. Although the line between paper and board is often blurry, our use of chipboard is extensive, as it's a sturdy material normally created with a high volume of recycled content. But we also use cotton, the undisputed king of modern natural materials; cotton offers a variety of benefits. It's a fully sustainable resource, it's lightweight, strong, easy to clean, and can be as soft or as tough as required. Bags made of cotton are completely washable and are favoured by consumers as a luxury item when accompanying a purchase. Jute, the coarser and less well-known cousin of cotton, is even tougher though it's not quite as soft. It is also one of the most inexpensive natural fibres available. On the plastic side, Polyethylene (PE) is the most common plastic in the world; it is used to create bags that are both recyclable and reusable. Most plastic shopping bags are made from different thicknesses of PE, thanks to its durability and ability to expand. Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) is lower in density than its parent material, meaning it has less tensile strength. The upshot is that this ensures the material is softer and much more ductile, excellent for producing soft-touch items. Polypropylene (PP) is a thermoplastic used in a variety of applications; PP is a packaging industry mainstay. It's a tough material and can be made into a variety of forms. Most reusable shopping bags today are made from non-woven PP. Premium Beauty News - Environmental concepts are of course essential in your business? William B. Gram - We offer multiple solutions that address packaging concerns for a smaller environmental footprint. Paper bags can be reused and recycled, and our non-woven or PE bags can be reused. All of our bags have many finishing options from which to choose, which use materials designed to minimize waste, keeping harmful chemicals out of the ecosystem. To note that we hold numerous industry certifications, allowing us to provide our customers a high level of confidence and security. Though many are industry standard process- and production-oriented, we also hold many specialty certifications that ensure excellence in a number of more specific areas. Hence we hold the Forest Stewardship Council™'s official Chain of Custody Certification, which applies to businesses that in some way use FSC-certified forest products. This certification ensures the validity of claims associated with all FSC-certified material and products throughout the production chain. The same goes for the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, which is an international non-profit, non-governmental organization dedicated to promoting Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) through independent third-party certification. The PEFC is an umbrella endeavour that endorses national forest certification systems. With threats to free commerce becoming more commonplace, the Customs/Trade Partnership Against Terrorism is a voluntary government-business initiative, fostering relationships that improve overall international supply chain and U.S. border security. The initiative works with importers, carriers, consolidators, licensed custom brokers, and manufacturers to ensure the integrity of security practices and verify the security of business partners within the supply chain. Finally, EPI is the developer, licensor and distributor of Totally Degradable Plastic Additives (TDPA®). EPI's technology has been designed to control and manage the lifetime of products made from the most common plastics used by modern society. Due to stringent laws governing the use of terms like ""degradable"", ""biodegradable"", and ""compostable"" in many parts of the USA, companies like EPI, working in concert with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), offer a seal of quality to those companies that voluntarily participate in quantifying their use of such terms. Premium Beauty News - Your development strategy covers both the United States and Europe? William B. Gram - We are a global company that markets its products worldwide but Europe is a very important market for our Group. France, in particular, remains one of the first markets in the world for premium brands. And we intend to strengthen our position there. We're probably the ones in the best position for this!"
A lighter and whiter high-end cartonboard from Billerudkorsnäs,"The new product, BillerudKorsnäs White 220 gsm, is based on BillerudKorsnäs White, the Swedish company's flagship cartonboard product. BillerudKorsnäs White 220 gsm has been significantly upgraded on four major points: – A grammage range extension to a new low basis weight at 220 gsm (compared to 235 gsm before), – A move from double to triple coating provides a super-smooth surface capable of sharper detail and contrast in image rendering. – A higher whiteness and brightness, for a better colour reproduction and a vibrant colour quality. – A improved surface structure, thanks to a higher standard of fibre formation, which, according to BillerudKorsnäs, adds two important benefits, first a more even, calmer print particularly noticeable in large monochrome areas and, then a dependable quality consistency, ensuring users the same high quality through each reel, each batch and each new order over time. BillerudKorsnäs White, the company's most exclusive high-white cartonboard combines strength, formability and an excellent printing surface. It is especially made for the premium segments of consumer packaging. It is widely used for exclusive branded goods such as health and beauty products, perfume and cosmetics, jewellery and luxury beverages and is now available in 220, 235, 255, 270, 290, 315, 340, 370 and 400 gsm. – Triple clay coating – Bleached chemical pulp – CTMP mixed with bleached chemical pulp – Bleached chemical pulp – Light coating Beyond its White cartonboard, BillerudKorsnäs also enhanced the qualities of its three other highly specialized cartonboard grades: – Artisan, a lightweight cartonboard with a silky-smooth surface, offering quality print as well as a nice haptic experience. – Carry, a strong cartonboard for packaging and protection of heavy content, highly suitable for designs involving hanging or handles. – Light, a strong and moisture-proof material. ""It is more than just a general facelift,"" says Magnus Levinsson, Business Segment Director Cartonboard, BillerudKorsnäs. ""This is the next generation cartonboard, one that sets new standards for printability."""
IPack: a factory in Spain,"A great family adventure indeed, probably too rare in France, and which deserves to be praised. A company, which now manufactures in the Val de Reuil, tens of millions of products a year, with fourteen plastic injection machines running (from 35 tonnes to 270 tonnes) and who has managed to develop itself in several very specific market niches, with the manufacture of spray caps and dispensing system (capacity: 800 000 pcs/week), distribution system (400 000 pcs/week) and decorative parts for perfumery (500 000 pcs/week). ""Actually there is no secret recipe behind our growth,"" explains Daniel Rosa, President, ""the daily obsession of the company can be summed up in a single watchword, Innovation! This is true concerning our products but its is also for our production tool, because there aren't that many solutions to keep a competitive edge. You need to rely on automation and be as flexible as possible."" The firm that dedicates 90% of its work to specific developments owns to date eight assembly machines on its site in the Val de Reuil and continues to invest in automatic machine control systems and in new robotized lines. Among the latest innovations to date, a new distribution system to refill bottles showcased at the latest Luxe Pack. In terms of specific developments, IPack signed the design of the new Mercedes Benz packaging. A cutting edge realization that required careful adjustments. The packaging consists of a galvanized ABS front tightly snapped in a shell, which supports a bottle thanks to a clever ""fork"" device, which enables to reduce chain of dimensions and to ensure the positioning of the specific push-button at the very top of the bottle. There is also the design of the new Mont Blanc, through joint work with the technical department of Interparfums, which resulted in the design of a cap that ensures that there is no gap between its base and the shoulder of the bottle. A patented built-in rack mechanism actually enables to absorb the play between the different components. ""The decision to establish ourselves industrially in Spain in 1700 sqm of buildings, says Daniel Rosa was quite simple to take. This is due both to a business opportunity and industrial reality. In fact, we were increasingly working with decoration specialists and suppliers of metal parts in the region. And more generally speaking, we needed to increase our assembly capacity so it made sense to want to develop the integration of components and services locally. This does not mean that we are not investing in France, on the contrary, as part of our development, we have launched a recruiting programme focusing of eight new job creations, and new talents have already joined our Quality and Design Departments, and we are still actively looking for additional staff, particularly two press set-up technicians and an adjuster""."
The growth dynamics of Pusterla,"With patience and also a great deal of tenacity, Giuseppe Meana will have succeeded in building one of the most tonic European companies in cardboard processing . And his sudden and unexpected death, a few months ago, caused a shock in the European packaging sector. With flair and intelligence, he will have achieved his goal of making of this small factory in the Milan area, a major player in the European cardboard sector. And like he had explained it in Premium Beauty News in 2013: ""We must be vigilant on all fronts and, more specifically, on that of our production system. Challenges facing us are not simple. Competition is fierce, we have to keep our prices as low as possible, market requirements are important and we must constantly adapt ourselves. For us this adaptation, started several years ago with the desire to be present industrially on the theatres of operation where we needed to be. Hence the successive acquisitions of the company Coffrets Création in 1999, located at the heart of France, then of Cazelles in 2009. Meanwhile we built from scratch in 2004 a factory in Romania, Dacica Teca to meet the increasingly important demand for handmade boxes. The objective of this whole strategy being to create complete and high quality products, by integrating as best as possible the expertise of the four companies under the same brand name. But this strategy of industrial integration is not sufficient. It was important to upgrade our whole production system in the four factories and fully optimize all production stages…."". Among the successful challenges met by Giuseppe Meana and his team, the transition from a small Italian company that was mostly involved in folding boxes, to one of the biggest European players in the field of mounted boxes, currently representing three fourths of its sales. At the heart of Pusterla's strategy, the decision, to concentrate the whole of the group's printing activity in Italy, in its historic factory to leave the processing and shaping activity to satellite companies. Another key decision, to only focus on high-value niches like beauty, of course, but also the wine and spirits sector. One of the reasons also for the take over of the British firm The London Fancy Box (LFB) whose full takeover was completed a few days. An acquisition that also occurs in a context of strong complementarity. Pusterla, based in Italy with manufacturing facilities in Milan, France and Romania have been manufacturing since 1880. Their product range covers rigid boxes and carton supplying into the Wines & Spirits and Perfume & Cosmetics market as well as other luxury sectors. Pusterla is, and will remain, owned and managed by the Meana family. LFB based in Dover UK shares a long history (115 years of family ownership) and supplies presentation packaging to the Beautycare, Entertainment, Wines & Sprits and Publishing markets. The LFB management team remain in place. ""And now?"" explains Luca Meana, Giuseppe's son and CFO of the Group, ""life goes on, of course. The Group Pusterla, thanks to the envisioning of my father and his entrepreneurial talent, is surely today the cardboard company the best equipped in Europe to face the challenges of our industry. The chair of the company shall be held by Luigi Provasoli, a longtime friend of my father and an entrepreneur and the General Management by Roberto Marini, my cousin who is also a shareholder. We are firmly established in Europe in high value added sectors. We are following closely the United States, where the market is still open and growing. We continue of course in parallel to invest in our production tool. A fourth 6 colours + varnish offset printing machine has arrived in our printing factory in Italy."""
Seen at Luxe Pack 2014,"It would not be possible, of course, to make an exhaustive picture of all the new products showcased at the last edition of Luxe Pack. However, Premium Beauty News spotted some of them for you, among many others: – Albéa introduced ""Lash Mania"", its new line of mascara featuring two new plastic brushes (Dolly, Sensual) under the aegis of the Albea Tips Studio (ATS), the group's new expertise centre for makeup applicators in Italy.

The entire Aptar expertise in distribution systems has been gathered to propose solutions for various types of makeup textures: liquid foundations (atmospheric solutions, Evolution or Evolux pumps) or creamy foundations (Evolux and EvoClassic airless solutions). Actually, the whole Aptar offer was reorganised by categories (Color Cosmetic / makeup, The Lab / skincare, The Perfumery ...) with the aim to get a greater visibility of the different solutions. – Aptar's Serumony airless cosmetic pen, which was launched last year, was redesigned to fit with different the needs of various segments: masstige, natural, dermocosmetics, DrBrands, prestige, premium cosmetics. Furthermore, a smaller format (Serumony Nude Touch, 10ml) was developed for makeup applications. – Regarding pumps, Aptar presented several decorative solutions, either for dip tubes (Magic Inside + Overtubes), or for the pumps themselves with the application of different graphic techniques (Exclusive Collection), or through the launch of a new screen-printing technique for polyester patterns on bulb sprays (Blue Collection). – Bioplan presented ""Thermo Pop"" its new lipstick sample technology. – Cosmogen also reorganized the presentation of its product lines to illustrate how each product can match the needs of different product categories with the aim to facilitate and accelerate the creative work of brands.

As far as Pochet du Courval is concerned, the glassmaker showcased ""Eole"", a new illustration of the possibilities of glass distribution. For Solev, Luxe Pack was an opportunity to present Metallic Mirages, the result of a liquid metallization technique that can be combined with screen-printing. – After a 2013 edition marked by the launch of the Slidissime airless jar, Promens presented this year a new range of standard wooden caps adaptable on its Diamond 50ml and 50ml Slidissime jars. – Finally, SGD introduced Fine Arts a new decorative technique with ultra-accurate prints. Many other new features have been introduced and of course we will detail them in the coming weeks."
Derjin Plastic Packaging Co.: significant investment plan in Haimen,"Premium Beauty News - For which main market segments does Derjin Plastic Packaging produce today? Joe Wang - Our primary business focused in the provision of cosmetics packaging solutions to our customers, in the area of skin care and colour cosmetics, from design / development to manufacturing of products, such as airless, spray, lotion pumps, bottles, jars, compacts, mascara containers & etc. Of course, we also develop new patented products in pump engines and lipstick mechanisms.

With the rapid development of China's economy in recent years, the cosmetics industry is developing very quickly in China. Having 30 years' experience in establishing factories in local China and with the wish to meet all customers' needs, we finally located the new factory in HaiMen, JiangSu, after multi-parties' investigation and evaluation. The formal signature ceremony with the HaiMen Port New Area Administrative Committee was held on July 8 , 2014. The first 99,000 sqm production plant is scheduled to start operations on the 1st July, 2015. Eventually, the new plant will cover an area of over 360,000 square meters with a three phase investment plan. Besides the existing various cosmetic packaging which were currently made in the Shanghai plant, our HaiMen plant will be further extended to environmental aerosol valve, pharmaceutical, food packaging and other products. Premium Beauty News - The fact of owing your own factory for the design of moulds obviously is a plus? Joe Wang - Quite a plus indeed. SDK is well known to have expertise in manufacturing moulds (cold and hot runner system), blow mould, injection blow mould and vacuum-forming mould. SDK collaborate with international renowned cosmetics giant enterprises, like Johnson & Johnson, Nivea, Unilever & etc."
The future of packaging design to be discussed in parallel to the Emballage tradeshow,"Creator of thedieline.com, an online platform, which is a reference for packaging design in the United States, Andrew Gibbs is convinced that design could change the world. According to him, ""global companies are beginning to highlight the work of packaging designers, in particular for their ability to generate growth and to think a brand as a whole, in a holistic way."" Andrew Gibbs would like this event to be an opportunity for the youngest generation of designers in Europe to address a simple question: ""What is the future of Packaging Design?"" After a first collaboration with the Emballage tradeshow in 2012 to showcase the winners of the Dieline Awards, Comexposium, the event organizer, has given carte blanche to Andrew Gibbs for selecting the speakers among industry leaders and spokespersons. The conference begins on Sunday the 16th of November with a networking event in the presence of the guest of honour, Rebecca Costa, a US sociobiologist and author of the controversial book The Watchman's Rattle,. Several workshops and a roundtable will offer European designers and packaging developers an opportunity to better understand its role in brand strategy. ""Without having to cross the Atlantic we can share with the leading American designers and better understand their approach and vision of today's and tomorrow's packaging. I'm sure already that this event will have a fruitful impact on both our minds and our business,"" said Fabrice Peltier, President of the INDP (French National Institute of Packaging Design), which supports the Dieline Summit together with the EPDA (European Association of packaging design). The opportunity was seized by numerous design agencies (Bunt Design Russia, Dragon Rouge Germany, Hasan & Partners Finland, Bendito Design Brazil, .... ) and brands (Cartamundi, El Corte Ingles, L'Occitane, Eco Packaging, Nestlé, ...) from 15 different countries. The future will also be showcased at the Parc des Expositions Paris Nord Villepinte during the Emballage tradeshow. In partnership with the Strate College, a series of packaging designs developed by students of five international design schools (Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Turkey) and illustrating their vision of the future will be visible throughout the duration of the show from 17 to 20 November 2014. See, among others, the foundation pack developed by the Strate College team, the soap flakes by the Politecnico di Milano or the Henna applicator by the Istanbul Technical University."
"Albéa, twelve tonic months","Premium Beauty News - The end of 2014 is at the corner. Your division accounts for more than a third of the turnover of the Albéa Group, which will exceed $ 1.5 bn in sales. And the envelope of industrial investments earmarked for CRP is commensurate to the ambitions set by the Group to develop this activity! Guillaume de Demandolx - That's right! Our Group proves once again its ambition to offer our customers all the possibilities in terms of packaging solutions but also of applicators for their brands. I remind you that this division, CRP, that I am heading, includes all the packaging solutions for the make-up industry but also the skincare and perfume industry. Our factories are located in every part of the world, and another particularity is that the turnover generated by each main region is very much balanced between Europe, North America, Asia and South America. The other division of the group, to be equivalent in size is the one that produces plastic and laminated tubes. The past few months have been, as you said, particularly tonic for CRP. To start with this new production site which was commissioned recently in Bottanuco (Italy) and which specialises in mascaras (brushes and packs) and gloss applicators. It is the result of the integration of two existing sites in Italy, near Milan (Verderio and Imbersago). It has a production area of 3,000 sqm and a warehouse capacity of 3,000 sqm. Warehousing, tooling, injection, extrusion, and blow moulding, decoration and assembly, thermal varnishing, UV lacquering and metallization are all fully integrated. The facility will hosts a dedicated development unit for mascara brushes and a comprehensive brush library for both fibre and plastic brushes. Amount of the investment, several million euros. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all the teams who enabled this move to happen in the best conditions possible and with no direct impact on our customers. The creation of a single integrated site not only enhances our manufacturing efficiency and responsiveness but also delivers a wider range of value added services and encourages the interaction between our customers and our teams. In line with this investment, I also want to recall that we are launching ""Tips Studio"" that brings together all the group's expertise in terms of applicators: mascara brushes (fibre and plastic), lipgloss, eyeliners. We are working on innovative or conventional applicators, mass or prestige, available off-the-shelf or developed specifically for our customers, and which are based on proprietary technologies. Our teams decipher both women's expectations and the latest trends. Through cutting-edge prototyping technologies, our ambition is to constantly offer customers new application solutions that meet the market's various demands. Premium Beauty News - Another significant investment is the start of the new facility in Suzhou, near Shanghai in China. Guillaume de Demandolx - This is so far Albéa's only site to house in dedicated buildings the complete scope of the group's core expertise: tubes, cosmetic plastic packaging (mascaras, lipgloss, compact, bottles) and dispensing systems. The site was designed to reduce time to market and improve flexibility and logistics performance. The new site expands over 30,000 sqm and represents an investment of $ 14m. It was built in just 15 months. Suzhou is Albéa's centre of excellencein China for mascaras (brushes and small bottles) and dispensing systems. I remind you that the Group also has four other sites in China (in Zhongshan, Shenzhen and Shanghai), each a centre of excellence for a particular packaging, and two sales offices. Premium Beauty News - Another major project focuses on improving the development process of new products. Guillaume de Demandolx - Yes, this is very important and all of our sites are concerned. It is essential to respond quickly to customer needs and, above all, to be able to make available for them, in no time, our latest innovations. Our President, François Luscan, had already clearly highlighted this in your columns, a year ago. He was already saying at the time that, concerning innovation, you must always be ready, not to say ahead of competition... ""Quality"" and ""Time to market"" are ongoing topic for us. We have therefore implemented an entire process to improve the reliability and accelerate the development of new products. Deadlines, quality, competitiveness... we want to reduce or eliminate risks associated with complex and sometimes recurring projects. Consider that almost a third of our portfolio is renewed every year! Our French factory of Parigné-L'Evêque was one of the first to adopt this new process and performed particularly well this year with several very successful launches in spite of their complexity. Premium Beauty News - We reviewed France, Italy, China... Guillaume de Demandolx - I can also say a word on Brazil where we are investing in new technologies for the assembling of lipstick. As for Indonesia, it reinforces a little more each day its expertise and excellence in the manufacture of compacts and is developing in a still dynamic regional market. Premium Beauty News - And what about 2015? Guillaume de Demandolx - These last 24 months were dedicated to industrial investments, our future investments will be more concentrated on both technical innovation, operational excellence, new product launches and what's essential, the training of our teams. Premium Beauty News - Make-up remains CRP's driving force? Guillaume de Demandolx - It's almost 65% of our business! It's therefore very important! And, as you know, ""the gesture"" has become an essential element that guides our research and developments. Premium Beauty News - A word on the latest launches in which you participated? Guillaume de Demandolx - We will showcase at Luxe Pack Monaco a host of novelties. In my category, new mascara brushes (plastic) and innovative lipgloss applicators complementing the existing applicator offering, renamed 'Albéa Tips Studio'. Albéa Tips Studio brings together all the group's expertise in terms of applicators: mascara brushes (fibre-based or plastic), lipgloss and eyeliners. With the opening of the new site in Bottanuco, our global centre of expertise gets a new development and testing centre. While the production of applicators is performed in regional platforms in Italy for Europe, in the US and Mexico for America and in China for Asia. – In the tube category, we are launching Reflection: PBL (Plastic Barrier Laminate) tubes featuring a web structure with multiple metallic effects and with bounce back properties similar to traditional plastic tubes. – In the dispensing systems category: Albéa via Rexam is at the origin of the Panache technology, which has revolutionized the perfume industry with the launch of the high-end, airy, light, fragrance spray. We are now launching SP22 Panache, a ""fine mist"" version for skincare products that is going to transform the skincare routine. – We mustn't forget the full service category: our full service activity is still in its infancy but growing quickly, outside its homeland, the USA. What we offer is full-service as part of a industrial approach."
Beauty packaging: the PSB Industries group is stating its ambitions,"Premium Beauty News - A bit of history first... Olivier Salaun - Yes, and history is important! Especially since the history of the Group dates back to 1904, the year when the Baikowski family founded the Pierre Synthétique Baikowski company in Paris. The company started manufacturing synthetic gemstones, from ultra pure alumina powder for the watch and jewellery industries. Already the ""luxury"" segment! The relocation in Annecy where our headquarters are, dates back to 1919 and the company's initial public offering of 1955. In 1984, The Entremont, Cachat, Wirth and Provendis families acquire stakes in the company and begin a policy of acquiring companies in new business segments. Five years later, 100% of CGL Thermoformage and a 55% stake in Ceica (Texen) are acquired by the group. In 1991, Jean-Baptiste Bosson is appointed Chairman of Pierre Synthétique Baikowski, subsequently renamed PSB Industries. The group then refocuses on its niche markets, implementing an active organic growth and acquisition policy, and will continue to strengthen its activities in packaging (custom cosmetics, perfumes and thermoforming) and specialty chemicals particularly overseas. In 1996, the factory in Mexico is created, then in 2008, Mar-Lee, an American company, based in Fitchburg, Massachusetts and specializing in injection moulding for the personal care and healthcare industries, is acquired. This year, as you know, we acquired the US company C+N Packaging, who is a recognised player in the design of plastic packaging components for the fragrance, cosmetic, and consumer product industries, and who serves prestigious customers like Avon, Estée Lauder and Elizabeth Arden, with its plants in North America and Poland. Clearly, this acquisition will help us accelerate our international expansion on the Luxury & Beauty market by enriching our customer portfolio, strengthening our industrial and commercial position in North America and also by reinforcing our presence in the fragrance and wine & spirits segment. PSB Industries has become over the years a responsive and innovative group of companies with solidarity-minded and responsible industrialists heading them. It is a dynamic group, listed on the NYSE Euronext, with more than half of its turnover generated by international sales, with production sites in France, Poland, the United States, Japan and Mexico, whose main shareholders are French industrialists. Premium Beauty News - You have plans for 2020! Olivier Salaun - Absolutely! For over a century, the success of PSB Industries has been based on its values and the combined strengths of the three brands: Baikowski, CGL Pack, and Texen. Each is a market leader, and each has decisive advantages and a genuine culture of accomplishment. This exceptional industrial heritage enables us to establish new objectives, as set out in a project that we called ""Ambition 2020"". This project shows, in stages and in clearly defined markets what our course should be. This is a winning strategy for customers, partners, employees and shareholders. The strategy will encourage us to nurture the values shared by our 1,600 employees, (including C+N Packaging), the complementary fit of our skill sets, the rich array of our talents and our passion for innovation. Our very strong values are based on respect, customer satisfaction, team spirit, performance and creativity. Premium Beauty News - What were the main strategic focus areas in terms of industrial investments over the past months and what are the ones planned in the short and medium term? Olivier Salaun - Generally speaking, to better serve Luxury & Beauty markets, we need to strengthen our manufacturing presence in the Americas and set up operations in Asia to benefit from growth in emerging countries. Don't forget that we clearly stated that we wanted to double our sales in our strategic markets with acquisitions in France and internationally, targeted investments and a dynamic culture of innovation and continuous improvement. On the industrial side, we invest about 5% of our turnover every year more particularly to automate and robotise our injection and surface treatment plants. We recently invested a million euros in the implementation in France of ""Texen Lab"", our Innovation Unit, and there is more to come... But I must also emphasize on the human investment all this represents, a key strategic focus of our Ambition 2020 plan being Sustainable Development and Human Capital. Our group has been driven by strong behavioural and action values and principles that form the basis for the relations of confidence that should exist between the company, its partners and its shareholders as well as between members of its staff. Our responsibility primarily covers our customers, to whom the Group's companies undertake to provide high‐quality products that comply strictly with safety and environmental impact standards, but it also covers our employees. Concerning this last point, we are very careful to develop employees' skills and working conditions, especially with respect to their safety and the protection of their health. It is also with this in mind that the Group's active environmental protection approach is an integral part of its transparent sustainable development policy. (CSR). To ensure the coordination of all these actions, I created the position of Corporate Human Resources Management in January 2014, to make sure that we give us the means to achieve our ambitions and support the development of our skills. Premium Beauty News - Beauty packaging often means ""Full service""! Moreover, are there activities in the beauty packaging segment where you are not present! What is your insight? Olivier Salaun - This is typically the role of the people who are in charge of the ""Business Development & Strategy"" unit, with the Senior Management and the sales and marketing teams We are currently reflecting on all these points. It is a fact that full service is an underlying trend that calls for an answer, particularly in certain geographic areas or for some customers who do not want to integrate production or packaging operations. We're working on it. Concerning other trades or technologies in which we are little or no at all involved, and you're probably referring to the sub-segments of metal, mascara applicators and pump systems, we are also working on it! Premium Beauty News - In one of your recent communications, you talk of making ""winning marketing choices""! Olivier Salaun - That's true! Making ""winning marketing choices"" is to sometimes disengage from non-core markets and develop, in particular internationally, to position ourselves as a leader on our core markets and acquire new customers. It is important to diversify our portfolio. Making ""innovative"" marketing choices also means being a permanent source of innovation and improvement to ensure the success of our partners through co-development. But the ""key"" element is a strict financial management. We must constantly strive to improve our financial performance to provide the means to achieve our ambitions and ensure the Group's future. And finally, we have developed a new corporate graphic charter, with a slogan that suits us, perfectly illustrates our vision and will bear our Ambition 2020 strategic plan: Industrial Imagination!"
Cosmetics packaging: 3 trends to be followed,"Increased market speed Over the recent years, the lifetime of a beauty product on the market has been shortening dramatically. Cosmetics companies are under constant pressure to renew and refresh their ranges. In the make-up category, about 1/3 of a line is renewed every year. Even in the perfumery industry, where successful creations may stay on the market for decades, brands are now creating the buzz with seasonal flankers, special editions and lately, charitable editions. One consequence is that brands are always looking for innovative packaging and decorations to stand out from the mass. And they need to go fast to market to address the very last trends with more customised and diversified decorations in smaller quantities. In such a context, proximity, flexibility and reactivity are key factors of success for suppliers. Greener packaging Another striking change is the higher pressure for more ecological solutions and the use of recyclable and sustainable materials. Several big players in the cosmetics industry have set ambitious sustainability targets and asked their suppliers to help them to meet these goals, either by taking their part of the burden through more environmentally friendly processes or by proposing innovative green solutions. In the luxury market, brands may face specific difficulties with this environmentally friendly trend. Indeed, packaging is fully part of the luxury experience and its main aim is to win over consumers and reinforce product satisfaction. However, luxury brands are also sensitive to ethical and sustainability issues and are searching new ways to combine premium aesthetics with lower environmental impact. Relocation Ten years ago, few luxury packaging suppliers claimed to have production lines in Asia, today, it's the opposite that strikes you. Actually, the increase in quality of Asian beauty packaging suppliers has been impressive. However, after having flown away to Asia is a significant part of the packaging production coming back to Europe or to North America? Several major packaging suppliers recently announced plans to open new manufacturing sites, closer to Europe to better serve their customers in these markets. Quadpack - a group that used to be exclusively centred on quality packaging sourcing, notably in Korea - recently acquired a plant in Spain and is investing intensively to upgrade it. Another supplier of primary packaging, New Jersey's Topline Products, which set up its first factory in 1995 in China, now operates four production units in the United States, in Mexico and in China and is preparing the opening of a new plant in the outskirts of western Europe, to better serve this market. Among the factors that promote the inshoring movement, the main drivers are probably ethics (consumers are increasingly aware of the social and environmental consequences of their purchasing acts), costs recalculation (rising salaries in Asia, higher transportation costs and integration of quality and coordination problems), and the tightening of European regulations (REACH for instance). Moreover, with the shortening of products lifecycle (see trend #1), speed and flexibility are becoming key factors of success on the market and proximity makes it possible to streamline flow, shorten delivery schedules and thus customer stocks. Nevertheless, in an increasingly multipolar world, new factories will continue to open in Asia and Latin America and in the other emerging markets. But the possibility that Asia could become the single world's supplier is just fading away."
Draeger introduces new customisation solutions,"Through a series of index cards listing the main milestones in Draeger's history, since its creation in 1886, all the techniques have been illustrated in the catalogue with the aim to provide a comprehensive set of possible final achievements. Draeger created its own decorative illustrations, or gathered the most iconic ones in each era, to serve as a creative support of its production capacity. ""Thus we'll put forward printing, varnishing, hot stamping and embossing techniques on several types of materials, but also the material-like visual effects that we have developed with our partners and that allow working on any type of paper grain or decorative stamping and to match perfectly with the printing,"" says Olivier Roussier, Sales Manager and Vice President Luxury at Draeger-GPP. ""Other important features in this catalogue include the digital printing and 3D varnishes on which we have worked."" The Technical Catalogue will be presented as a ""Pantone Index"" with a packaging specially designed for Luxe Pack. It will be a complement to the more traditional presentation of the launches to which the group collaborated with its clients such as the Repetto Eau de Parfum by Inter Parfums, or Bazaar 34 by Diptyque, Aqua by Creed and many others. One of the key events this year for Draeger GPP will also be the introduction its Nextep concept. Based on up-to-date solutions in terms of packaging customization, the company aims at providing the best possible response to its customers' needs, especially in terms of flexibility. ""Significant investments in digital printing and direct product customization have been completed or are in progress in the Truccazzano site, in Italy, and soon in Palaiseau, France, with the strong willingness to create additional value for our customers,"" said Olivier Roussier. To be seen on the Draeger GPP's stand at the Luxe Pack Monaco tradeshow, which will be held from October 27 to 29, 2014 at the Grimaldi Forum."
Ancorotti Cosmetics is growing,"Quite an impressive performance, in five years only, for this company based in Crema about sixty kilometres south of Milan. Starting at square one in 2009, the turnover of Ancorotti Cosmetics this year will reach 24 million euros for a total staff of a hundred people. The company gradually expanded in the industrial area of the small Italian town to finally use no less than nine sites representing a total area of 14,000 sqm. The latest to have been invested, a 2,000 sqm building which has been, since September, the Group's administrative headquarters. Mascara, lipgloss, powders and a whole range of products for the skincare market: the young firm's strategy is still geared to conquering new markets. ""With powders alone,"" explains Renato Ancorotti, President, ""we will achieve this year a turnover of 4 million euros."" I must say that the technological choice, of relying on ""100% back injection"" played an important part. No less than twelve machines were installed in Crema in the last twenty four months. ""A great technique"" emphasises Ancorotti. ""A technique, which enables to produce high performance products in terms of finish, texture and application. Not to mention the high accuracy and reliability in production and, especially, its cleanliness."" The current production capacity of Ancorotti Cosmetics per shift, is no less than ten million pieces/year. Quite enough to cope with future requirements! ""We are at the beginning,"" confirms the head of the Italian firm. ""This type of product is bound to become a standard. Now we are going to develop it and promote it with new formulas, new effects."""
The Japanese group Yoshida is investing in Vietnam,"It had become a recurrent subject these past months... the information has just been disclosed by Yuzo Yoshida, President of Yoshida, a recognized Japan specialist in the moulding and decoration of high added value plastic parts... ""The construction of the new factory of the Group, he detailed, just begun in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, on a plot of 20,000 sqm. The production area will initially be of 3,000 sqm, enabling to host a dozen injection blow moulding machines with a production capacity of three million plastic bottles per month."" Amount invested, ten million dollars. A factory which, according to the President, ""should enable to increase by one and a half its production capacity in the next three years."" It may be recalled that Yoshida, whose total turnover amounts to 180 million dollars, owned so far, six production sites, including four in Japan, one in Tianjin, near Beijing, and one in Taiwan, as part of a partnership. The group employs about 1,100 people and is still very focused on its domestic market, which accounts for 80% of its turnover. The group has two sales offices abroad, one in New York, and the other in Issy-Les-Moulineaux, near Paris. With operations in all cosmetic segments With the exception of lipsticks, Yoshida is now present in all segments of cosmetics. Currently, the group is best known abroad for its make-up cases and especially for its airtight cases. Yoshida also boasts an extensive know-how in eco-refills. The group also produces flexible tubes and has recently invested in a new filling unit in Shizuoka. Latest development to date, its popular product, Plaglass™, developed with the DuPont group and which enables both, to design a over moulded glass like bottle and above all to vary shapes while perfectly protecting the decoration printed between two walls. ""We have also developed our own technology,"" explained Yuzo Yoshida, ""that we are developing in Japan, of course, but that we will also be developing in our other plants, including the one in Ho Chi Min City."" The cosmetic sector accounts for about 65% of sales and the remaining, telephony. The make-up sector at large is by far the group's leading market closely followed by skincare. Not forgetting also its activity in flexible tubes (35 million annually), which is not insignificant. The Group invested about a year ago in a tube filling factory in Shizuoka."
Hermann Koch: a new managing team for a new start!,"Since the end of September 2013, Hermann Koch GmbH and its sister company Kunststofftechnik Straufhain GmbH specialized in the manufacture of jars, sticks and plastic bottles is under the direction of a managing shareholder. Dr. Eng. Thiemo Hagedorn took over the shares of the two companies in September 2013. It may be recalled that the German company has a fleet of 80 injection machines ranging from 25 tonnes to 320 tonnes, including six electric presses and three bi-injection machines (all of them Arburg), 15 blow moulding machines including a Magic four prints, which can produce 1,200 bottles per hour, 10 screen printing machines and 8 hot stamping machines. Not to mention the 7 compression machines for bakelite products. Mr. Lacher started his professional career in plastic machinery construction and founded in 1995, along with financial investors, Singulus Technologies GmbH, which is listed as a public company since the end of 1997 at the German stock exchange in Frankfurt. Mr. Lacher directed Singulus Technologies over 12 years as Chairman of the Board and was subsequently nominated for a further 5 years as Chairman of the Supervisory Board. Within that time, the company grew to a world leading business in the vacuum thin film technology and market leader for development and production of optical data storage media; CD, DVD, Blue-ray."
Pibiplast: A record growth in three year's time!,"Pibiplast indeed stands as a company like no others, located in the small town of Correggio a few kilometres from Reggio Emilia, and which is finalizing the extension of its main factory with the addition, by the end of the year, of 4,000 sqm, representing a total surface area of 14,000 sqm. Firmly established, for the past several years, in the manufacturing of hollow plastic parts and injected caps and closures, using extrusion blow moulding and injection blow moulding techniques, it will have managed to take several strategic turns in time, essentially through acquisitions. After the takeover of the Bomal company in 2002, which enabled Piblipast to invest more heavily in the make-up segment, the Italian firm acquired, last year, a company, based near Turin and specialized in the manufacture of tubes, which became the Pibitubes Division, then it was the turn of Plastline, another company specialized in extrusion blow moulding for GDOs (large production series) to join the Group this year (25 people, 18 blow moulding machines). And that's not all, since another acquisition in the domain of tubes is planned by the end of this year. So much so that the industrial strength of the Pibiplast Group already represents some 55 blow moulding machines, plus fifteen injection stretch blow moulding machines, forty five injection machines, 4 extrusion lines for the manufacture of tubes, a dozen screen printing machines and 8 hot stamping machines. ""Integrating tubes in the manufacturing process appeared to us as a natural extension of our expertise in the area of beauty packaging,"" explained Stefania Bosi, Sales Director. ""Our customers often ask us to supply some to them. It is a market where you have to be very responsive, very dynamic and very flexible in terms of swift order processing. We currently have a capacity of nearly 80 million tubes per year and our delivery times are in a range of four to six weeks at the most."" Eventually, over the past five years, the sector of packaging for colour cosmetics has gradually taken the upper hand in the activity of the Italian firm with nearly 40% of its turnover. Investments in machines conducted during the past year - to integrate in the supply chain all the industrial processes related to the manufacture of packaging for make-up, with three new production lines for fibre brushes to start with - have paid off. The company recently presented two new complete lines of small mascara and lipgloss vials, one with a wide neck and the other thick-walled. ""The development of complete lines remains a major focus for us, emphasised Bossi. In addition, and in conjunction with our specialization in tubes, we are also working on new lipstick applicators."""
"""The brand is the most powerful creator of value,"" Thierry de Baschmakoff","Premium Beauty News - With more than 6000 references achieved for major international brands, Aesthete is one of the most recognized design agencies. Why then did you engage in this new organization? Thierry de Baschmakoff - Because customer demand has changed considerably and so has what they expect from a design agency. We had to rethink our way of working to make clearer our service offer, by capitalizing on our main skills and various expertises acquired over the years. Today a design agency not only creates forms, it is also at the heart of the brand value creation. Hence, our creative offer was restructured around three modules: – The Studio, which is at the heart of the agency's system of creation, such as it was founded 30 years ago, and which is recognized for its expertise in the design of luxury products, with clients such as Guerlain, Jimmy Choo, Versace, Dior, etc. – The Brand Machine, a service dedicated to the construction of the brand identity and image, and their enhancement, a service which can be entrusted with the overall creation of a brand, the relaunch of sleeping beauties, the repositioning or diversification of brands, – And EATS, for Extrude Along The Spline, a kind of garden centre for innovators, which is an opportunity for us to support young designers in a start-up spirit. Premium Beauty News - The construction of brands' identity seems to be more and more at the heart of the designer's activity. Thierry de Baschmakoff - It is both a reflection of a time where brands appear increasingly as the most powerful creators of values and a logical evolution of our business. Design is a major element of the identity of a brand, even if it is not, far from it, the only component. From this point of view, perfumery is an excellent school because each launch is an opportunity to tell an almost completely new story. Over the years and with the growing reputation of our agency, we were asked to work on different briefs, far beyond the usual design activity. We had to develop internal skills or rely on external expertise. The combination of our experiences has enabled us to acquire quit a unique know-how that we divided into 10 phases of interventions, which can be treated in full by the agency, either internally or with partners. Finally, as a design agency, we also have an additional advantage: a mastery on the implementation of projects. Premium Beauty News - What are the brands for which you worked on this concept of identity? Thierry de Baschmakoff - One of our very first experiences was the development of Parfums Bulgari. The idea was to create a brand territory of its own and not just make a perfume variation of what was proposed in jewellery. We can also mention our achievements for the British brand Atkinsons. Founded in 1799 in London, the brand had a very strong DNA but it needed to be relaunched. By analysing its history and values, we had the idea to create the shield, which is now an integral part of its brand identity. The list is too long, but I want to mention also The Different Company, a global brand that we created from scratch and which was elaborated to be able to express itself in different territories. Premium Beauty News - Compared to the Studio and The Brand Image, two modules more brand oriented, EATS appears more like a free electron. Thierry de Baschmakoff - It is a place conductive to freedom and exploration. It is a talent incubator through which we want to help reveal a new generation of designers. It also represents for us a way, in spite of the difficult economic environment, to continue to imagine, create and innovate. EATS creates, develops, design, extrudes everyday objects to turn them into objects of tomorrow. It's this structure who hosted the team who created OBO, the much talked about new perfume brand with its nomadic jewel-applicators."
"The 'Emballage' packaging exhibition, in tune with cosmetics and design","Premium Beauty News - What does this 2014 edition look like, and more particularly for the Beauty sector? Véronique Sestrière - We have an exciting representation of 1,500 exhibitors, all sectors included, among which, 15% dedicated specifically to the Health / Beauty / Luxury sector, which is fairly consistent and in line with its market share in value. We also expect more than 100,000 visitors, 10% from big names in the cosmetic and luxury sector, like L'Oréal, Beiersdorf, Clarins, P&G, Avon, Caudalie.... This concerns mainly the purchasing departments, the packaging and conditioning departments etc.., but all functions are represented at a high level, which goes to show the strategic importance of packaging for brands. Premium Beauty News - What are the motivations for visiting a multisectorial show like Emballage? Véronique Sestrière - It is very complementary to a so-called ""niche"" trade show – and there are several –, often of high quality too. Given the rapid pace of innovation, it seems essential to update one's benchmarks in all sectors of activity, I am thinking in particular of the food industry, which is very close to the Hygiene/Cosmetics universe. In terms of market intelligence, a trade show is the best tool in the world, it is important from time to time, to stand out from one's inner circle and Emballage fulfills this need for multisectoral points of reference. It is also a way of sourcing new partners. With 30% new exhibitors and 40% of new visitors, this trade show is an opportunity to broaden your contacts. Premium Beauty News - Precisely what will be the importance given to innovation? Véronique Sestrière - Emballage is a gathering of experts and we do a tremendous job in the creation of contents, of tools and animations, to help decode the news, trends and innovations in a global or more sector-specific manner. Concerning cosmetic packaging and its trends, will be discussed among others, 'cushions' foam applicators, airless systems of course, and finishing techniques. Premium Beauty News - Concurrently to the meeting in Villepinte, will take place The Dieline Summit, can you tell us more? Véronique Sestrière - Indeed we are inaugurating this year a major appointment, targeting packaging design: The Dieline Summit@Emballage. The Dieline, created by Andrew Gibbs in 2007, is the most visited site in the world in the field of packaging design for professionals and students. Its objective is to identify and promote the best packaging designs, and offer a venue where the packaging design community can review, comment and stay informed on the latest trends and projects created in the field. With over 300,000 visitors per month, it stands as an international reference in the field. Its success led to the creation of the Awards that we had already exposed in 2012 at the last edition of emballage, and to conferences up to now only organized in the United States. For the first time we will be organizing jointly with Andrew ""the Dieline Summit"" in Paris, in the fringe of Emballage on 16 and 17 November at the Palais des Congrès. It is a new format, with interventions never seen before in Europe. [1] Alongside seven Anglo-Saxon speakers, this summit aims to bring together an audience of 300 design professionals (agencies and brands) for a broad discussion on the future of packaging design and its ability to change the world. A shared vision from the two sides of the Atlantic which could be identified as a ""proposal"" to invent the future of packaging..."

Main customer markets for KVS: the pharmaceutical sector almost on a par with pest control products and then followed by the cosmetic and food industries. Finally, the last group entity, Klocke of America, (KOA) located in Florida, whose activity is similar to the one of KVS (pharmaceuticals excluded). ""It's a fact, says Richard Schwemmer, Commercial Director, one development out of four undertaken at KVS, concerns samples and single-doses for the beauty and skincare industry!"" The Weingarten Factory has no less than thirty thermoforming lines against ten for the one in Florida. Engineers at Klocke have a thorough understanding of what they're doing and continue every year, to use new materials and update transformation technologies (thermoforming, embossing, etc.). First customer market, make-up with the lipstick sector coming first followed by coloured creams. ""You should know that historically, explains Schwemmer, the first sample of hot poured lip stick to be marketed in the early 1990s, came from the Klocke workshops. Since then our engineers have made significant progress and developed other technologies like in particular, the filling/sealing of injected parts, to better position the company in the niche of retail single-dose. We work a lot on application techniques and gestures."" Latest innovation to date, a cleverly designed single dose of nail polish. [1] These polishes come in single dose format: each pod enables to perform a complete manicure. Convenient for women who want to change shade according to their moods without having to collect bottles and then throwing them away one after the other, because they became too dry, to liquid or too pasty."
Trends and packaging design... and the development of a holistic brand experience,"What are the current challenges for brands? Matthias Pach - The market poses a certain dilemma. Brand managers act in a controversial field, because customers are so much more demanding, more saturated, and less easily accessible than they ever were before. Dominic Bakic - The shelves of drugstores and supermarkets are filled in with semi-successful brands that struggle to meet steadily growing customer expectations while at the same time trying to differentiate themselves. All this takes place in an environment of saturated communication and target groups that can be heavily influenced by social media. The most important task in brand management today is to find a unique positioning and to assert it in the long term; rational factors play only a subordinate role in this equation. And what solutions are there? Matthias Pach - In our experience, there is only one long-term successful approach: embracing a holistic perspective of the brand and using targeted homogenous or synchronized brand touch points. ... could you please explain and elaborate? Dominic Bakic - At the heart of this approach is the idea to carve out a brand's value and put it in the spotlight. We focus on character, tonality and benefit. The benefit may be functional or emotional. It is important to clearly and consistently implement all three elements across all the touch points of a brand. This can be illustrated with the example of a professional hair care brand, where colour competence is at the core of the brand. Values like science, professionalism, and technology can be inferred, and this should be reflected in a clear and reduced style of the product design. Matthias Pach - However, if you would now try to implement the described brand, we would drown in the ""sea of equality"", because the brand would still be one-dimensional. Therefore, we mirror the brand's colour competence in a design concept with strong colours and well-known design elements from the world of painting throughout all touch points. And this is enough to build a sustainable, multi-dimensional brand? Dominic Bakic - No. A holistic approach like the one we are following requires that additional values are transported. An emotional perpetuation has to take place, in particular through the communication tools, the advertising campaign's image world and the associations it triggers. Matthias Pach - In order to emphasise the creative elements of the hairdressing profession and to reach the target group with a positive emotion, we used every-day items and tools used by hair stylists as design elements in our layouts, in order to infer a positive, artistic value to the craft. All we have left to do now is to transport all these elements at brand touch points, in order to create a holistic brand experience. The way you put it, it sounds quite simple. Matthias Pach - In theory, it is. The only problem is that there are very few service providers like us who have an intrinsic understanding of the international market and at the same time have the competence and the experience to give holistic support to a customer and work professionally on all brand touch points. On the other hand, it would be utterly impossible to coordinate several specialised agencies. Dominic Bakic - In our method of operation, we follow the holistic approach that allows us to build brands, develop products, and to launch them on the market. We service our customers beyond the POS to the POA (point of action), because this is where products must hold their ground and be convincing. Our specialisation and our understanding of the beauty language and its development help us create unique brand identities. How do catch new trends in this fast moving sector? Dominic Bakic - Thanks to our international set-up and customers on five continents, it is possible for us to give forward-looking advice to our customers, and to discern and develop new trends even before they reach Europe. For instance, we now see a trend we call ""authenticity is the new organic"". In the future, it will not suffice to be simply organic or eco-friendly ... Matthias Pach - ... or we observe the development of highly effective components for the cosmetics industry from so-called superfoods. Even if sometimes we can't imagine that there is still room for innovation in the beauty segment, the market is constantly moving and it remains exciting to see what will happen next."
Baralan is gaining momentum,"The history of this company is indeed quite a long one. A company which has managed over the years, to carve a place for itself in the competitive sector of beauty packaging, both in Italy and abroad. It owns a plastic injection factory, Labor Plast, which manufactures closures and plastic containers and a finishing unit, Gloss Tech. Products are designed and produced by Baralan's creative teams and the moulds belong to the Italian firm which closely handles all the development stages and productions with its engineers up to quality inspection performed on every site. Main advantages put forward: creativity, of course, but also flexibility, a very comprehensive product range, adaptability and service with a permanent, abundant storage capacity from warehouses in various locations around the world. ""We specialize in small and medium quantities and through our vast availability we become the best support to start-ups but also an important financial backing to our customers. We fully rely on both our versatility and adaptability. We have a comprehensive range of standard products. This does not keep us from also offering customized products,"" the company's CEO says. This commitment to be global is not an empty word, since the company operates in more than sixty countries and has set foot in the United States since 1980, in New York, in California and in Florida, and it even has established itself in Shanghai in 2011. ""We still believe in servicing our clients face to face, we approach our commitment to the Cosmetic Packaging Industry seriously and invest our resources so that we can be close to our customers for support. An extensive presence at Worldwide Trade Shows helps us to also capture a growing audience."" Main, almost-historical market, nail polish. ""In fact, explains Baranes, the history of nail polish dates back to the creation of Baralan."" Today this sector still accounts for almost 70% of the Group's activity. The Italian firm has become one of the market leaders for the supply of bottles but also closures and accessories with a particularly large and diversified offering. ""We are lucky, admits Baranes, because it is certainly one of the most dynamic markets even though there is presently a slight drop in demand we continue to see certain companies grow."" A sector where the standard glass bottle rules (the company has more than 150 moulds for bottles) ""Every year, we create three to four new lines of standard bottles,"" we were told at Baralan. Baralan also stands out with several particularly attractive private creations like the bottle range designed for Morgan Taylor which was designed specifically to meet the needs for a new launch. ""Private design with the assistance of our design group is one of the strengths the group has worked on over the years, and watching the entire Team provide their experience and input to help a company brand their identity is truly satisfying."" ""But we are not limited to nail polish, far from it,"" insists Baranes. ""We also focus a lot on the niches of skin care, perfume, essential oils, make-up and roll on. It is also one of the reasons for this new momentum we are giving the Group today. To clearly show that we are the undisputed full service leader in packaging in all these segments, that our assets are hinged on strong concepts like innovation, design, originality, but also style, passion and above all, quality."" Baralan's new slogan says it all: ""Packaging Made by Italian Creativity."" The company's revamped website (www.baralan.com) encompasses all this. But above all, it aims at being a real technical and commercial tool. Baralan's comprehensive catalogue can be browsed online with all the possible combinations presented in terms of bottles, caps, closures accessories and other finishing options. ""Baralan International has created a Global Footprint over years of careful planning and is now moving forward to secure itself as the place to go to source Cosmetic Packaging,"" concludes Baranes."
Brazil: Albea is investing,"Premium Beauty News - Brazil, a country where Albéa offer its full range of products and services. José Filipe - Absolutely! The entire range of products coming from our four activities is available in our two Brazilian sites with namely packaging solutions, tubes, rigid cosmetic packaging, pumps, promotional items and accessories. But pumps, for which we manufacture the engines on site, remain today our most important activity, closely followed by the cosmetic packaging activity. All the more closely followed actually, since everything concerning spray caps and deodorants is developing strongly. Premium Beauty News - The habit of offering in South America and also in other parts of the world, a wide range of products and to combine your know-how, is part of your group's DNA? José Filipe - Brazil is no exception, indeed... And all our industrial investments are done to this effect. They will represent this year, like in previous years, more than 10% of our local turnover. It started in 2010-2012 with the relocation of the entire cosmetic packaging site from Sao Paulo to the Mogi plant. Then we purely and simply doubled our integrated metallization capacity between 2012 and 2013 on both sites. These industrial investments, also complemented by the training of local teams, are aimed to maintain our leading position in this Brazilian market where we have been operating since 2000! We mustn't forget all our ongoing initiatives in terms of social responsibility: safety of the teams, involvement in our communities, integration of the most disadvantaged... these are values that we share with our customers. Premium Beauty News - The Mogi site has the reputation of being no more and no less than the largest industrial sites in the world? Along with the Jundiai site, you mostly supply South America? José Filipe - Our factory in Mogi is impressive, it's true! It extends over 55,000 sqm, and it's Albéa's third largest factory. With the site in Jundiai, 90% of our production goes to large local players, mostly in Brazil but also in Argentina, Peru, Colombia – and also to international companies that have settled in the region. And we support the emergence of new regional, small and medium local brands. Premium Beauty News - Brazil therefore still remains the Eldorado of the Beauty sector? José Filipe - Not quite the Eldorado, although few countries in the world have a beauty market that can boast today and for the next fifteen years, an annual growth rate of 5% to 8%! And on top of it, don't forget that the country has 200 million inhabitants... Perfume, skincare, make-up therefore remain sectors where growth is not ready to slow down. And distribution networks are rapidly changing. All this amply justifies our commitment and investments in the country. Premium Beauty News - A word on the new launches to which you took part in Brazil. José Filipe - We recently participated to the launches of the deodorant and perfume line Quasar and of the Make B. fragrance line by Boticário, to Natura's new fragrance Urbano and to Jequiti's new deodorant."
Formula protection: is a pack an active in its own right?,"Following the increase of ""paraaben free"" claims, recent news about methylisothiasolinone (MIT) has shown that no easy answer exists. Regulatory constraints, combined with the marketing restrictions that some brands impose, tend to reduce the number of available options. At the same time, the market trend is clearly oriented towards less use of preservatives and even towards launching preservative-free products. The most widely used protective packaging solution used today is airless. Airless dosers are inviolable, non-pressurized distributor systems combining mechanical pump action and a container that delivers the product without taking in more air. Thanks to that feature, they can provide, as such, a relatively good protection. Airless systems can be just as easily adapted to a bottle as a jar, pen or syringe. Promens even recently introduced Slidissime, an airless model of identical size to classic jars, which does not work with pressure but makes it possible to get the dose of cream needed for the application by lightly touching a membrane (tactile pump). Almost simultaneously, Aptar beauty + home launched Serumony, an airless stylus pen intended mostly for delicate, precious skincare formulas. However, even if it considerably reduces the risks, a simple airless doser is not enough to totally guard against the risks of retro-contamination. Every major specialist in the sector thus developed its own complementary or alternative solutions: Aptar offers the Irresistible pump, with sterilizing filters of 0.2 micrometre and a hermetic valve, Promens the D.e.f.i.. system, a capsule with a patented closing system that makes it possible to keep a sterile formula absolutely intact, and that can be adapted to a simple tube, and Megaplast a pushbutton valve system. Another type of packaging solution consists in modifying the chemical nature of the material to give it a bacteriostatic character. The company Pylote is thus working directly on plastic materials. ""We are modifying the composition of plastic pellets while adding mineral particles in keeping with our patented Pylengo® process. These pellets are then used for producing every type of plastic bottle and make it possible to avoid bacterial contamination inside the packaging,"" explains Loïc Marchin. The action mechanism is linked to the direct contact between the packaging and the formula and not to a diffusion of particles in the product. As for Strand Cosmetics Europe, it has developed a solution for treating the textile fibres of mascara brushes with a finisher made of a preservative, according to a patented Purcilon® process. ""Since 2007, we've offered the first antiseptic mascara brush"", boasts Dominique Bouvier, head of the Lyon-headquartered company. But whatever its effectiveness, packaging will never be enough in itself. Not using a preservative also implies knowing how to produce clean formulas, non-colonized by microorganisms, and to be able to keep them in this state throughout the packaging process. As many raw materials, notably of natural origin, transport microorganisms, a decontamination phase is required. Among the available methods are: UHT sterilization (""ultra high temperature""), irradiation (the sending of ionizing rays onto the product placed on palettes), and sterilization through high-pressure technologies. But these methods are still marginal, notably on cost reasons. As concerns filling, several solutions exist. Filling under laminar flow makes it possible, for example, to obtain an environment whose particle rate is very low. In practice, the air passes through an absolute filter and is vertically pulsated, expulsing the non filtered air outside of the protected zone, so products can be filled in a practically sterile environment. Inerting with nitrogen means you can stabilize and control oxidation to protect and increase the preservation time of actives contain in the formulas. ""However, be careful. Though laminar flow system has been used for a long time, inerting is rather new technique and requires a bit of distance, but it seems interesting for future where preservatives are less and less accepted by consumers,"" says Aude de Livonnière, head of Livcer, a French company specialised in the creation and filling of thermoformed samples and single doses. In a stringent regulatory context, with self-restricting marketing practices to boot, a strong trend toward innovation has this begun and another vision of the profession and the product is underway."
Brazil: the Pochet Goup invests with Qualipac!,"Premium Beauty News - What does the industrial potential of Qualipac currently represent in Brazil? Pierre Marand - The industrial potential has grown significantly over the past two years thanks to increased capacities in terms of injection, the installation of a second coating line and of two vacuum coating bells in addition to the existing one, and finally of new automated assembling and decorating capacities. Brazil is a key focus in the global development of Qualipac and of the Pochet group. We were already a key player in make-up. And two years ago, we announced that we wanted to develop our operations in the world's largest perfume market. We successfully penetrated this segment with the implementation of efficient synergies based on existing technologies on our French sites. This teamwork is now bearing fruit. Premium Beauty News - What were the main industrial investments of the Group in recent months and what are the ones planned for the coming months? Pierre Marand - We have increased by 15% the physical area of the plant and have also gained space in a relevant optimization approach of flows. We will continue to invest in the production capacity and cost reduction. We are showing our clients that we are ready willing and able to support them. Technology is not everything. The Ipel team has managed to develop remarkable and extremely close relations with our clients. This trust is the most precious thing that we are committed to cultivate and develop with all our customers to serve them even better. Premium Beauty News - How is Qualipac's offer deployed over there in terms of products (by sector)... And to cover more specifically what area? Pierre Marand - We are still one of the leaders in the Latam region, in the make-up segment, which accounted for 100% of our turnover two years ago. We continued to grow in this segment, while in parallel we started developing perfume applications. They now represent 30% of our sales! This goes to show the trust of our clients in Qualipac's ability to support Ipel's growth in the region. Premium Beauty News - What are the key clients that you supply? Pierre Marand - We owe our growth to clients like Mahoganny who was the first to trust us for a solid Surlyn cap. This client is also the first to have worked with the Pochet group via Pochet du Courval in Brazil! We then owed the bulk of our growth to the Grupo Boticario for various perfume brands. Avon and Natura also called upon us and now contribute to our growth. Finally, other U.S. or European customers rely on us, like Elizabeth Arden or Coty, to help them develop their filling operations in Brazil."
Finishing: a new strategic step for the Verreries Brosse,"This is a new milestone in the industrial development of the Verreries Brosse - validated by its owner, the Italian Group Zignago Vetro. The partnership agreement signed with the French company Pariche Nigermat specialized in finishing, should enable a greater responsiveness in terms of development and of innovation in decorative techniques. ""Decoration is a stand-alone trade which requires a very specific know-how,"" explains Olivier Caspar, CEO of the Verreries Brosse, ""and the Pariche Nigermat group undoubtedly has this know-how that we need to satisfy increasingly demanding customers in this area."" Initially, in 1979, Gérard Pariche, the founder Pariche was an artisan. Its main activity was at the time centred on the decoration of bottles at home, on behalf of the biggest names in Perfumery and Glassmaking. In 1981, the Gérard Pariche Company was created with as a core business, frosting. Five years later, while still developing its own expertise, the Pariche Company created Nigermat, to complete its finishing activities services with finishing and sand blasting. 2004 saw the introduction of a second activity: lacquering. Nigermat in partnership with Pariche is able to offer all types of finishing (screen printing, hot stamping, pad printing, sandblasting, decal application). To note that sandblasting is historically the first activity of Nigermat. Backed by more than thirty years of experience, the company produces prestigious perfume bottles using derivatives of this ancestral technique (Mechanical cleaning, Sand engraving). The Verreries Brosse employ 370 people and currently have two ovens running, under semi automatic and full automatic processes, with four production lines. It may be recalled that in March 2011, the Italian group Zignago Vetro had acquired the Polish glassmaker, Huta Szkla Czechy (HSC), a producer of bottles for the cosmetic, perfume, food and beverage industries. At the time, officials at Zignago Vetro had stressed on the huge potential of the Polish company ""located in a strategic geographic area, both because of the growth potential of the Polish market, but also because of its proximity to the traditional EU markets and high growing markets of Eastern Europe."" A factory which was also equipped last year, with a brand new lacquering line fully dedicated to perfumes and cosmetics, and that can come in support of the Verreries Brosse for large series. To note, among recent investments carried out by the Verreries Brosse, the operational implementation of a programming software for decoration with the aim of carrying out a real-time management of information flows concerning orders with subcontractors. ""Our development focus, explains Olivier Caspar is now more oriented towards innovation, responsiveness in development and in mastering logistics and in the development of new ranges of standards, particularly in cosmetics."""
Henkel Beauty Care launches in lighter aerosol packaging,"Henkel and Ball are entering the race for more sustainable aerosol packaging. Thanks to an innovative metal technology, Ball can use recycled aluminium in the manufacture of extruded aluminium packaging for aerosols. According to the US-based packaging supplier, the resulting new metal alloy exhibits increased strength and allows lightweighting of the container without affecting package integrity. Ball says this technology breakthrough will allow to lightweight the company's extruded aluminium aerosol packaging by as much as 10 per cent, with further lightweighting expected in the future. After months of collaboration, Ball's global metal technology experts and innovation teams developed a method that will allow the company to use either post-consumer recycled aluminium or aluminium recycled from its global beverage can operations to produce its new slugs. ""As global sustainability leaders, Ball and Henkel continually strive to improve our environmental impact while responsibly running our businesses and increasing stakeholder value,"" said Michael Feldser, Ball's chief operating officer, global metal food and household products packaging. ""We were able to add recycled aluminium from Ball's beverage can plants into our slug manufacturing processes, reduce the amount of metal used and lightweight the industry's standard extruded aluminium package. This helps improve the carbon footprint of a popular product and enhances the environmental performance of both companies."" Currently, almost all extruded aluminium aerosol packaging is made from virgin aluminium ""slugs."" These metal disks are impact extruded to produce packaging for aerosol products ranging from body sprays, sunscreens, air fresheners and numerous other markets. Ball has applied for patents on these new packaging and will begin producing cans made with this new technology initially in Europe."
"""Applicators have become essential to the success of a cosmetic product"", Renaud van den Berg, Cosmogen","Premium Beauty News - You have been assuming control of Cosmogen for a few months now. What are your main strategic objectives? Renaud van den Berg - We mainly aim to keep developing what Cosmogen has become over the past few years, that is, a company that is rather focused on the development of innovative products, in particular of applicators, rather than on pure trading. We also intend to become a true partner for brands, with a real expertise in consultancy when it comes to choosing the applicator-container couple. Today, our activity of pure trading does not represent more than 30 % of our turnover. Everything else comes from specific developments, from our registered and patented designs or from existing patent licences. Premium Beauty News - There is obviously an ever-growing variety of applicators on the market, and much innovation in this field. Renaud van den Berg - This is a basic trend. Cosmetic formulations are both increasingly more varied and fragile. They require new application systems as well as more protective applicators that can also improve the efficacy of the formula. This results in a growing need for advice. As formulas are getting more complex, and the market more segmented and naturally innovative, application has become a trade in its own right and a key element to the success of a cosmetic product, whether it is to protect the formula, facilitate the application, make consumers' movements evolve, or produce a mechanic action on the skin. Cosmogen is now a recognized expert on this market, and our customers, among whom there are the world's leading groups, do listen to us when we offer them real innovations. Premium Beauty News - Do you intend to develop a production activity? This is what some of your competitors have decided to do. Renaud van den Berg - We do not have authority to invest in production. However, we do have our own moulds and specifications for a large part of our patents. Therefore we are reinforcing our control on production, and strengthening our relations with our industrial partners. This strategy also allows us to benefit from the required technologies, where they are, according to the changing demands of our customers. Premium Beauty News - Cosmogen owns trade offices in Europe, the United States and Brazil. What are your ambitions on an international scale? Renaud van den Berg - Cosmogen benefits from a substantial export growth. In 2013, our turnover increased twofold in Brazil, and now represents about 15 % of our sales. Our international sales team includes two people in the United States, one for the East Coast, the other for the West Coast, and one person in Brazil. We manage our European sales from France. All this is supervised by Mylène Meunier, who is now responsible for our global sales. Purely Chinese brands are developing rapidly, and some of them will become leading international groups. I am convinced a commercial presence in Asia is essential; we'll be ready by the end of the year."
Stora Enso reinvents travel packs,"Recreate Packaging was organised for the second time by Stora Enso and Aalto University's International Design Business Management (IDBM) Program aimed at challenging conventional thinking and the use of materials in packaging. Actually, Stora Enso is convinced that tree-sourced polymers could replace many oiled-sourced polymers, in particular in packaging applications. ""A key motivator of the competition was the recognition that current packaging practices and solutions are not always innovative and do not use the full potential of new materials and design,"" said Prof. Mikko Koria of the International Design Business Management (IDBM) Program at Aalto University School of Business and the head of the international jury of seven representatives from the beauty care, transport, packaging and design business sectors. [1] And the winner of the first prize of EUR 8,000 is the beauty care travel packaging concept ""Have a Nice Trip"" by German designer Arthur Schmidt. The moisture-proof primary dose packs of shampoo, shower gel and body lotion are covered by a protective sleeve that offers generous printing space for branding and communication. The jury of the competition especially appreciated the simplicity and ease of use of the package, which is ""logistically efficient and protects the contents well"" and ""could be easily incorporated in a beauty care product family as a supplementary travel version."" The international expert jury evaluated the competition entries based on their functionality, market potential, innovative use of materials and suitability for production, retail and logistics. ""I worked with the materials that were provided with great pleasure and it was quite easy. I believe that moisture-proof primary packaging made of board has great potential in the global market. In addition, I am sure that this kind of paperboard and corrugated board will replace plastics in many fields of packaging in the future,"" highlighted Arthur Schmidt. Second prize in Recreate Packaging 2014 was granted to ""Travel Shaver"", a shaving product kit designed by a team made up of freelance designers Ville Merisalo and Antti Ojala together with August Salo, a student of the Lahti Institute of Design, from Finland. The suggested packaging solution for liquid, gel and aftershave products offers the possibility to use a combination of renewable carton board and corrugated materials instead of plastic packaging, and enhances the user experience in many ways. Third prize was won by Duncan K. Anderson and Jenna Parkkinen, students of the Lahti Institute of Design, Finland. The jury liked the shape and functionality of their concept, called ""Reloaded"", which uses barrier-coated board for primary packaging and corrugated board for secondary packaging. The concept is also suitable for other product segments, from cosmetics and beauty care to confectionery and foods, consumed at home or on the go. The Recreate Packaging jury also gave three honorary mentions: the ""Pocket Travel Kit"" by Marta Wrzodak, a student of the Academy of Fine Arts in Gdansk, Poland; ""Get&Go"" by Ivan Pajares, Jordi Ros and Koldobika Goikoetxea, students of ELISAVA, Spain; and ""?"" by Serena Bonomi, a student from IED Design Milano, Italy. ""The designs from Recreate Packaging serve as our inspiration and are attracting interest from our end-user customers across all segments. They are a platform for discussions on completely new packages and I look forward to seeing some of these designs being further developed and finding their way to retailers' shelves shortly. I hope to see one or two of them in my own hand luggage,"" concluded Lasse Johansson, VP Commercial, Stora Enso Consumer Board."
"Brivaplast, a strong growth","Premium Beauty News - In fact, you are the perfect proof that a medium-sized company can succeed in a very competitive market? Especially in mascara? Toni Cappellazzo - That's true! This is also one of the reasons for our strong growth in recent years. We have gained many new projects. The reasons are simple: our constant desire to innovate combined to a good responsiveness in terms of development to respond quickly and effectively to requests from our customers. There again, there is no secret formula, in recent years, we have heavily invested in our production capacity, in our assembly and decorations lines, between 35% and 40% over the past two years. Third reason, the close partnership we have developed with several subcontractors specialized in formulas, enabling us to develop, particularly for mascara, the product that fits exactly to the texture and its application capabilities. And finally, the fourth reason, we are one of the few, if not the only one today, to remain a family owned company in this segment. Therefore we can say that our approach is first an industrial one before being a financial one. Premium Beauty News - Mascara remains the flagship product of Brivaplast? Toni Cappellazzo - Yes, it is the flagship product but our expertise is also recognized in the manufacture of lipgloss, eyeliners and lipstick tubes. And as you know, there is a renewed interest in lipstick currently. As for mascara, we are integrated to manufacture both injected and fibre-based brushes and, of course, the containers. In addition to our range of standard products, we also develop an increasing number of specific products. Premium Beauty News - Your area of influence is mainly in Europe? Toni Cappellazzo - No, not only! As you know, we took the risk in 2006 to establish ourselves industrially in China with the clearly stated objective to be present in this part of the world to supply the Asian market. And actually I can say we were successful. Europe absorbs 80% of the production of our Italian factory located thirty kilometres from Milan. The remaining 20% go to other parts of the world and, in particular, to the United States. It is clear that our medium-term goal is to continue to increase our export strategy. Premium Beauty News - Hence a medium size family-owned company manages to play its cards well today! Toni Cappellazzo - Our growth on the market proves it! No? And it is certainly not finished. I would like to add that there is room for everyone, and that our industrial positioning is suited for a certain type of customer. With us, customers find what they were looking for, namely appropriate quantities, flexibility, innovation, speed of development and speed to market. Premium Beauty News - A few words on your latest launches? Toni Cappellazzo - We have focused at Cosmopack on Majestic pack, that's the newest, imposing and elegant mascara container, proposed with brushes with different application: a gorgeous volumizing fibre brush, one for a perfect curling (17,2 % is the average increase of angle of curling!) and lengthening, and one for a 3 in 1, all proposed in the most trendy nuanced pack: yellow/orange, pink and rose. Brivaplast is continuously developing new packs, new applicators, many of them patented as they are exclusives, for mascaras but also for lipgloss and... see you soon at MakeUp in Paris!"
"Lumson launches Envers, its new airless packaging","Premium Beauty News - Your presence at Cosmoprof Bologna and in a few days, at MakeUp in Paris is sure to be a conversation starter in the aisles of both events. Innovation is more than ever at the heart of your approach. Starting with your new TAG Luxea series. Stefano Focolari - As you know, most experts in the field define TAG as a ""Revolutionary Packaging"". TAG is the first airless system in a glass bottle and the only packaging that combines the advantages of airless technology to the beauty of a glass bottle. Now TAG Luxea is ready to be launched on the market. We were inspired by a stylish and feminine design and we enriched it with TAG technology to offer our clients new beauty shapes. Thanks to our designers we gained an amazing result. TAG Luxea stands out with its thick based glass bottle, its beautiful decoration options and highly customizable accessories. The real touch of class comes from its original design. The bottle and accessorizes have a semi spherical shape which is spaced out of two flat surfaces. Despite this exclusive design, TAG Luxea can still be entirely decorated. Our technicians were determined to be able to customize the glass bottle using the entire available surface and by making the decoration with the ceramic screen printing, this special technology gives the graphic designs an unequalled strength and sparkle. Another wonderful decoration, specifically developed for the TAG, is the ""Glass Enhancer"" an inner spray lacquering created to enhance the glass bottle, and also customizable with pearl or metalized colours. TAG Luxea is available in 30 and 50ml sizes, perfect for skin care and make up textures. This unique packaging will be able to satisfy even those customers who require accurate distribution and a high protection of their formulas. Premium Beauty News - This year you have voluntarily chosen to focus on the luxury segment? Stefano Focolari - Absolutely! Hence, our new packaging line, The Collezione DeLuxe has been based on studies of Cosmetic Companies' needs and desires. Beauty, quality and technological innovations are the features that have been gathered together by our designers and technicians; they have then been merged into a single collection, totally developed in Italy. Composed of two elegant glass bottles in 15 and 50 ml, and one 50 ml glass jar, the collection holds the entire essence of beauty and luxury, adorned with the High Premium Quality and beautiful decorations. The aesthetics are not the only one feature that makes the Collezione DeLuxe so special, this collection indeed is unique also for the airless technology associated, inside the glass bottles. Called ""Airless Pouch Technology"" this innovative airless system used in all our Airless Packagings (TAG, APP, TAG Luxea, TAG de Luxe, APP 355S), in a multi-layer pouch, has been created, developed and patented by Lumson to guarantee 100% protection of formulas. Even the jar assures an High End/Selective positioning of the product, thanks to the beauty of the glass, the very large size impression of the pack and the possibility to spray colour the inside of the jar, just like we do with our TAG Systems. As the matter of facts if the product in our airless systems is protected because it is inside the pouch, in the Jar De Luxe the product is actually placed in a plastic container (in PP) inserted inside the jar. We have dedicated a great deal of research on the accessories and decoration: the pump, with a minimalistic cylindrical shape has been combined to the Actuator Pearl 223, developed for its new ergonomic and feminine design. Completing the pack is the over cap that can be customized with metallization, hot stamping and tampo printing on top. Even the jar has had a custom cover developed, a cylindrical shape and covered in aluminium to add a touch of class on such an important and precious jar. The entire Collezione DeLuxe can be decorated using our Glass Enhancer technique, a special decoration that allows spray lacquering made on the inside of the glass bottles and Jar, furthermore it can create the exclusive ""Mirror"" effect, selective brands appreciate so much. The cosmetic formulations are protected by the pouch or by the jar insert, meaning they never touch the decoration, guaranteeing to keep the formulas pure. Premium Beauty News - Your L4Belle division will also be coming up with a lot of new products? Stefano Focolari - L4Belle increases its offer adding more products to the most renowned primary packaging solutions for the Colour Cosmetics market.

Inspired by the trend ""Woman on the Go"", the new product ranges are perfect to be carried around, thanks to small capacities, flat shapes and smooth edges, all dedicated to a woman who enjoys urban life and spends a lot of her time travelling, without compromising on beauty and seduction. L4Belle has created a useful presentation box in order to introduce these new products to customers and suggest them new gestures for the daily make up. Offering user friendly packagings for lips, eyes and face, L4Belle's box includes the new lip gloss Kate with a smooth flat shape, a Slim glass jar (5ml) with a highly printable cover and with our very successful ""High Sealing Gasket"" that works perfectly with highly volatile products and make-up mousses and a compact Sophia for pressed powders.

Premium Beauty News - But one of the most striking novelties showcased will be your new packaging ""Envers""! Stefano Focolari - Envers, it's a revolutionary airless packaging inspired by our love of looking at thing differently and designed to turn around the idea of cosmetic packaging. We are sure that Envers, available in two different shapes/designs, will collect success and appreciation among clients, and it will add an original and exclusive Italian touch. In fact, it is an airless container which was literally designed the ""other way around"" [1] compared to a conventional container. The guiding principle for its design was that the container itself could be concealed by the cap and that is could therefore act as the part to operate to deliver the product with a light finger pressure. We presented our new ""Envers"" as a worldwide premiere at Cosmopack-Cosmoporf 2014 to selected clients and by appointment only. This is quite innovative pack and we want to introduce it on the market starting with selected brands at first, which is why we still do not want to unveil too much about it yet. But we have also focused our efforts on the evolution of APP, Airless Plastic Packaging, developed in a new slender and feminine design called APP355 S. This new packaging combines the new airless smart pump AA355 S with the new PEARL actuator 223 and the new plastic bottle APP 355 S, while the airless system remains the same, the reliable airless pouch technology developed and patented by Lumson. They are special products created in 30 and 50 ml and dedicated to the prestigious cosmetic brands who desire a plastic airless packaging highly customizable. With a wide range of decorations such as colour inner spray, metallization, screen printing etc, APP 355 S is the perfect choice."
Albéa launches a new upside-down foamer,"Albéa's Dispensing Systems division, world's leader in foam packaging solutions, has presented EZ'R, its latest patented foam technology, at the latest edition of the Cosmopack tradeshow, which was held on April 02-05, 2014 in Bologna, Italy. Albéa's aim was to simplify the way consumers use foaming personal care products, while offering a constant foam quality all along the product lifetime, with no propellant gaz. ""Consumers can enjoy constant high-quality foam with a one-hand squeeze on an upside down bottle,"" said Laure Deschamps, Product Manager Foam at Albéa. ""Foam is dispensed with a fun and convenient gesture. This is ideal for a variety of applications, including facial care, baby care, shampoos and shower gels, sun care, and much more."" EZ'R also addresses consumers' preoccupations about sustainability. Indeed, the new foamer allows reducing water consumption and packaging size. ""With foam, water consumption decreases up to 22 percent in comparison to liquid soap products. Also, EZ'R needs up to 65 percent less formula per body wash usage, which allows a packaging size reduction up to 50 percent,"" adds Laure Deschamps. In the case of liquid soaps, it means up to 1,500 litres of water per year and per person. EZ'R thus helps optimizing the supply chain and shelf space. EZ'R is developed and manufactured in Alkmaar (Holland) and Thomaston (U.S.A.). It has been conceived with a snap-on, flip-top cap and is designed for a one-step filling process. For a greater on-shelf differentiation, EZ'R provides unlimited design possibilities of bottles and flip-top caps. Albéa's new foamer is available in three sizes: 150, 250 and 300 ml."
SGD multiplies decoration options,"Premium Beauty News - Decoration seems an increasingly strategic element in luxury glass-making. Gaëlle Verjus - Of course, decoration is a key differentiating element for all brands. It contributes to creating original sensorial emotions, and it is essential to generate desire. SGD aims at meeting these customer expectations by pushing decoration limits further and further: that's why we have been working on developing new technologies, and on constantly adapting our industrial tool. This is a field in which we have been investing and will continue to, because there is a high demand from customers. Premium Beauty News - You presented four of these technologies at the last PCD trade show in Paris: ""Colored Emotion"", an inside colour coating technology, ""Radiant Emotion"", an interior mirror treatment, ""360° Emotion"", an off-limit pad printing technique, and ""Printed Emotion"", a hot-transfer technique. Can you tell us a bit more? Gaëlle Verjus - ""Colored Emotion"" is a patented inside colour coating technology that SGD has developed and mastered for three years in a dedicated workshop. It enables to colour the interior of a bottle with multiple tints, from crystal to opaque, or from pastels to darker shades. A great number of colours and aspects (pearl, metal, mat, gloss) are available. This technique does not require any inner layer, but it does need tests of compatibility with the liquid that will fill the bottle. Premium Beauty News - ""Radiant Emotion"" also enables to decorate the interior of the bottle. Gaëlle Verjus - Absolutely. This interior mirror treatment was conceived, industrialized and patented by SGD, and it is now well-established, since it has been used since 2008. Thanks to it we can now create a mirror effect to highlight the noble character of glass. It can be combined with any other perfecting technique. If it is refined with lacquering, a bottle can be transformed into a precious object: for example yellow lacquering provides the illusion of a bottle filled with molten gold. Simple screen printing is magnified by the mirror effect, continuing as far as the eye can focus. Again, this technique requires tests of compatibility with the liquid filling the bottle. Premium Beauty News - Then the other two techniques are more standard. Gaëlle Verjus - Yes and no. We have actually pushed the limits of well-tried techniques. ""360° Emotion"" is a pad printing technique which allows decoration in areas on which screen printing cannot be done: it is now possible to reach areas that had never been printed upon before. The bevelling is now dressed with colour, arabesque styling adorns the bottle's neck, and curves can now display designs and logos. Lastly, with ""Printed Emotion"", we can carry out the automated hot transfer of printed designs on the surfaces to be decorated. Thanks to this technique, the industries of perfume and fashion have never been closer. There is no limit, whether in the delicacy of lines or in the number of colours available. And bottles can be adorned with print in a single pass. Any textile pattern or picture can be accurately reproduced. And this was made possible thanks to a partnership with our film supplier."
"The Ileos Group, in battle order for 2014","With a turnover of some € 400 million in 2013, 18 manufacturing sites in the world (Brazil, China, USA, Spain, France and Poland) and 4200 employees, the Ileos group enjoyed between 2010 and 2013 a sharp increase in sales (+ 45%), thanks to its organic growth but also through targeted acquisitions outside Europe (Mappel in Brazil, Le Papillon and Aphena in the United States). A trend that continued in 2013, with an increase in the group's turnover of about 14%. ""The year 2013 characterized itself by significant differences from one market to another,"" pointed out Jean Rollier, the new President of the group. ""Growth was quite low in Europe, between 0.5% and 1% depending on areas, with few launches. The year was good in the United States, yet the pace of growth slowed down in the last quarter. And growth remained strong in Asia and Brazil"". The activities of Ileos cover three main areas: a metal and plastic area with Axilone, which accounts for 28% of the turnover of the group (€ 110 million in 2013); a full service, formulation, sampling and single-dose area with Bioplan, representing 40% of sales (€ 160 million in 2013), and a graphics area (folding boxes, cases, leaflets, wedging systems…), with Alliora and Packetis (€ 130 million in 2013 and 32% of the group's turnover). The group is present in two main markets: beauty (perfume, skincare, make-up) and pharmaceuticals / health. It is undoubtedly Bioplan who has been the most active during 2013, with on the one hand, the acquisition of the U.S. Company Aphena Health & Beauty, a specialist in thermoformed sampling solutions for the make-up and skincare markets, and on the other, the strong development of activities in Brazil. Today, more than half (52% exactly) of Bioplan's turnover is generated outside Europe, this proportion was only of 14% in 2010. ""Regarding Brazil, sales were driven by local demand and the desire from international actors to produce locally"", explained Ludovic Anceau, CEO. ""In the United States, we have now fully integrated Aphena, which enables us to strengthen our expertise in thermoformed technology for this market. Finally, in Europe, we have strengthened synergies between our different sites in order to increase our responsiveness."" Axilone recorded in 2013 a significant increase in new businesses, all product lines included, indicating a significant increase for 2014. The year was marked by a consistent investment program, with new lacquering and metallization lines on its sites in Britain and the construction underway, of a new stamping plant in Spain. Regarding the graphics area, the pooling of the technical and industrial capacities of Packetis and Alliora has enabled, according to Philippe Delclerck, the CEO of Iléos Graphic, ""to better serve the hygiene and skincare segment."" In this area also, important multi–year investments are planned, particularly in the offset domain, in fully automated monitoring and in tools to fight counterfeiting. As for 2014, caution seems to be the watchword, given the many uncertainties in the various markets. Growth could well slow down in emerging countries. ""In Brazil, forecasts are contradictory, China's anti-corruption law has affected the market for corporate gifts,"" he said. As for Europe, tensions in Ukraine could have significant economic consequences, complicating an already sluggish equation. ""We are cautious but not pessimistic,"" insisted however the new President of Ileos. ""It might be more accurate to speak of measured optimism. We indeed made good business and the market remains positive"". Observations are the same with Ludovic Anceau. ""If demand remains strong in luxury, we have very little visibility for 2014"", said the CEO of Bioplan. In spite of these uncertainties, the group is continuing its investments. Bioplan is continuing its structuring work and started to transfer the activities of the plants inherited from the various acquisitions, to the Flexpack site in New Jersey, which was broadened. The priority is to align the entire industrial tool on an industrial standard in line with a global market context. Axilone's new Spanish plant will be operational as of September 2014, with an automatic anodizing line that will partly replace the current hand–operated lines, enabling to process larger volumes. In addition, the group does not exclude further external growth operations. ""We are working on several opportunities and we have the support of Oaktree, our shareholders, for that. But our ambition is not to become the largest operator in the arena. Investments, whether internal, on new technologies, or external, through the acquisition of new businesses or new geographic coverage, only make sense in terms of complementarity with our current activities,"" said Rollier."
Heinz Glas continues to invest in decoration,"Premium Beauty News - So, was 2013 a fruitful year for Heinz Glas? Rudolf Wurm - We are quite satisfied with the results. Our turnover, for the glass and plastic activities, was of € 330 million, representing an increase over the previous year. In short, 2013 was a good year. We took part to several major launches, which enabled us to highlight our expertise in vacuum metallization and laser cutting: Just Cavalli, from Roberto Cavalli, See by, by Chloé, Nobile Leather, from Yves Saint Laurent, L'Eau, from Nina Ricci, Candy L'Eau, by Prada, Bulgari's 15ml Jewel Charms, Fuel For Life Spirit, by Diesel, Leather Edition, from Roberto Cavalli, Opium Collector, from Yves Saint Laurent with its outstanding transparent metallization, and nail polishes for Yves Saint Laurent and Armani. Premium Beauty News - What were your main investments? Rudolf Wurm - We invested approximately 30 million euros in 2013. Most of which concerned decoration equipment, with a second vacuum metallization line, hot-stamping machines, a five–axis assembly machine. We also continued the implementation of the camera quality monitoring system. Premium Beauty News - What do you see as the main market trends? Rudolf Wurm - The trend is clearly towards increased decoration and more value added, especially for flankers that brands use to animate their lines, and for which, decoration remains the main mean of differentiation. Mastering decoration and finishing techniques is therefore paramount and is both one of our key assets and our main development strategy. In all our glass factories, the integration of decorations processes is continuing. On the market side, although Europe is struggling, our customers remain dynamic on emerging markets and we benefit from this momentum. And on our side, we strive to support their competitiveness, particularly through the quality of our products. We commissioned a new furnace in Peru last June 2013, to better serve the South American market which is enjoying significant growth. Our Peruvian factory is specialized in glass for perfumery, and there too, we integrated decoration techniques in the production site. Premium Beauty News - How does 2014 look like? Rudolf Wurm - We are confident and we are well equipped to meet market demands."
Packaging satisfaction is low across the globe,"Fewer than 20 per cent of U.S. consumers, and only 7 per cent of consumers in Germany and the UK are ""very satisfied"" with product packaging. According to Packaging Matters, the annual study of the role packaging plays in consumer purchasing behaviour, brand loyalty and overall product satisfaction, conducted by US based packaging supplier MeadWestvaco Corporation (MWV) [1], only of 11 per cent of global consumers say they are completely satisfied with packaging. According to MWV's study, functional attributes, such as protecting the product from spilling and making the product easy to get out, are considered more important packaging attributes to consumers across all product categories. However, these same attributes are underperforming in the eyes of consumers. By comparison, attributes related to the appearance of packaging, such as being attractive and easy to find, are overachieving based on the perceived importance to consumers. However, the research shows packaging plays a significant role purchasing behaviours. In brick-and-mortar retail, packaging's role is apparent in the purchasing process (trial, repeat or switch) in which consumers trial a new product and depending on the experience, subsequently repeat that purchase, or switch to another brand to test a different product. For instance, 57 per cent of German and 64 per cent of British consumers said they have tried something new because the packaging caught their eye on the retail shelf. Also, 31 per cent of German consumers and 28 per cent of British consumers (41 per cent on average among the studied markets) mention packaging as the factor that has induced them to purchase a product again (repeat). Eventually, 36 per cent of consumers have switched brands because of negative experiences with new packaging (19 per cent of German consumers and 30 per cent British consumers). The Packaging Matters study also examines online shopping habits of global consumers, and the research reveals a host of behaviours that can be influenced by packaging. When shopping online, consumers report that product packaging has led them to research more information about a product (29 per cent), write an online review that mentions the packaging (22 per cent), ""friend"" or ""become a fan"" of a brand/company on social networking sites (20 per cent), post something about that product on social media (18 per cent). ""Packaging continues to play an important role in building brand loyalty and driving repeat purchase in-store and, increasingly, it is also a vehicle that connects brands and consumers online,"" said Steve Kazanjian vice president, Global Creative, MWV. For analysis, the surveyed countries were categorized as Developed Packaging Markets (Germany, Japan, U.K., U.S.) and Developing Packaging Markets (Brazil, China, India, Russia, South Africa and Turkey), based on factors such as total GDP, purchasing power of the middle class, sophistication of supply chain, and the prevalence of modern retailing. The results show that packaging is more than twice as important to overall product satisfaction for consumers in Developing Packaging Markets compared to those in Developed Packaging Markets (54 per cent vs. 20 per cent). Packaging also impacts the purchasing process (Trial, Repeat or Switch) much more in Developing Packaging Markets than in Developed Packaging Markets. ""Packaging also has a greater influence on online shoppers in Developing Packaging Markets, who may have adopted habits more quickly with the prevalence of mobile devices, compared to peers in Developed Packaging Markets,"" MWV adds."
Quadpack invests in finishing and customisation,"Another industrial investment for the cosmetic packaging provider after it acquired wooden component manufacturer Technotraf in March 2013. Last December, Quadpack announced its will to make further investments in Spain. With the acquisition of Krampak, Quadpack intends to improve efficiencies, accelerate response times and increase flexibility for its customers. To that end, the newly acquired company will benefit from a substantial investment to upgrade its facilities over the next few months. ""With this move, we are responding to the needs of the market. Our clients are increasingly demanding shorter lead times to help them react tactically to market changes. What's more, combined with our facilities at Technotraf Wood Packaging, we will be able to offer a host of manufacturing and finishing services right here in Europe, from bespoke wooden components, through screen-printing, spray painting and, eventually, warehousing,"" explains Quadpack CEO Tim Eaves. However, despite this partial relocation of its operations, sourcing in Asia will still be an important part of what Quadpack is doing. ""Technological and economical benefits continue to exist in that territory. What we are doing in Spain essentially helps overcome some of the logistical shortfalls,"" Eaves continues. Krampak provides decoration services to the beauty industry, including screen-printing, tampography, thermal printing, digital printing and laser engraving. The integration within the Quadpack group should enable the firm to make the necessary investments to upgrade its manufacturing equipment. ""At Krampak, we have always focused on providing great service and bringing the latest advances in decoration to our clients. With Quadpack's support, we can ensure continued innovation, increase our visibility and expand our business,"" highlights David Tanya, the company's founder. While serious investment is planned, Krampak's operations will continue uninterrupted. A relaunch of the revamped facilities is planned for September this year."
Metsä Board launches new cartonboard for luxury packaging,"Exactly as the other other beautycare grades offered by Metsä Board, including Carta Elega, Carta Integra, Carta Solida, Avanta Prima, Chromolux and Modo Northern Light, the new Carta Allura cartonboard is made from fresh forest fibres grown in sustainably managed forests. ""Traceable fresh forest fibres are pure and safe for use with sensitive products,"" underlines the Finnish manufacturer. For this new high-end cartonboard, Metsä Board especially worked on surface smoothness, pointed as Carta Alura's main asset. It also has high brightness and an attractive visual appearance that creates the right impression when used for premium products. Furthermore, Carta Allura's reverse side is also coated to ensure a good finish to the inside of the carton. ""There is a trend towards using special effects to distinguish packaging,"" explains Christophe Baudry, Commercial Director Beautycare & Healthcare, Metsä Board. ""Hot foil stamping and foil lamination work best with an exceptionally smooth surface, and that is exactly what Carta Allura provides."" Like the other cartonboards in the Metsä's range, Carta Allura is a lightweight board that provides an identical firmness for a lighter weight. A unique environmental benefit according to Metsä Board, who adds that ""its consistency and stiffness make production processes trouble-free."" The new cartonboard's assets are summarized by Christophe Baudry in the promotional video produced for the launch: Carta Allura is produced in Finland, at the Tako facility in the centre of Tampere."
"Niche perfumery, the difficulties of creation","The success encountered by several alternative fragrance brands has triggered many a vocation. Makers of fragrant compositions and bottle makers have all witnessed the same phenomenon: an increase in demands from brand founders. And it is not always possible to follow up on these demands, notably when the development time is too significant compared to the quantities envisioned, or when the cost of industrial production is too steep. From the founder's point of view, it's the number of people involved and the steps required for development that can be disturbing: creating the fragrance, making the bottle, decoration, choosing a pump and a cap, sourcing possible accessories, designing and printing a box, etc. All total, about 40 different professions come into the creative process. So, for those who want to do something simple and quickly, recourse to a turnkey specialist is necessary. Companies like Perfarium, Flair or Boss'M offer full-service creation, bringing together the skills of their network. Depending on their desires - and budget - clients can call on an independent perfumer/ creator, or look through the catalog of a major house. It's a sensitive point, considering the importance of fragrance in consumer purchasing decisions, above all in the case of brands betting on difference. Most often, major fragrance composition houses do not invoice the expenses for creating. But, as their profitability rests on sales of the jus, they are dependent on quantities. Materially, it's not possible for them to increase projects for small, emerging brands. To reduce development delays, the solution consists in offering compositions from their catalogue that correspond to the brand's brief, with a few adaptations at times. The independent perfumer's project will, on the contrary, be that of a customized development that resembles the brand's DNA as closely as possible. But it involves the costs of creation. As for the bottle, founders of small alternative brands will come up against a similar dilemma: choosing between customized and standard. Again, the question cannot be neglected since packaging is the first point of contact between consumer and product. The making of special bottles, because of the costs involved (design, the making of moulds, minimum production amounts), is most often unaffordable for a small brand. The first solution offered by suppliers consists in personalizing a standard bottle. ""We suggest they enhance our standard bottles, and these are strong, interesting technical challenges,"" explains Isaure de la Noue, general manager of Metapack, French supplier specialized in bottle design, production and decoration. Considering the relatively small quantities and the complexity of operations sometimes required for products seeking to be exceptional, sometimes part of the work must be done by hand. CCI Productions, which offers different production and packaging services, has at its location in Acquigny in Normandy, manual lines and an ""haute couture"" workshop intended for small series and the most sophisticated products. La Factory, another specialist of ""bespoke"" packaging (glass, cap, packaging, filling,...), has sites in France and Romania. Finally, in terms of packaging, options for personalization are such that the recourse to a standard bottle should not be perceived as something to slow creativity. The real obstacle is rather financial: aside from flagrant cases of fakes, this is what generates resemblances that are damaging to brand identity, from the fact of under-investing in the perfecting process. Intermediary solutions between standard and special products, between ""made in France"" and sourcing in other countries, are also available. A few glassmakers offer semi-automatic production. One example is Verreries Brosse. ""The mastery of semi-automatic processes enables us to make series of only 2,000 to 3,000 pieces, while automatic processes require 10 times more volume,"" explains François Chéru, sales director. In addition, companies such as Flacon Couture are specialized in developing special bottles in small series, intended for the niche fragrance segment. ""The difficulty lies in reconciling emerging brands' very high demands for quality with small series, while remaining within the realistic budgets,"" says Xavier Vaisière, company president. If glass is popular and makes up most of the market, one should not forget that interesting solutions are also offered by other materials: plastic polymers, like Surlyn from DuPont, wood, with remarkable bottle examples created by Spanish companies Technotraf or Pujolasos, and also stainless steel, largely used for concentrates but which hasn't greatly pierced the market due to high costs. When the budget is not a problem, remarkable solutions are available, as those offered by Marcel Franck. Only set up again recently, the company offers luxury sprays inspired by those the brand was known for in the early 20th-century; and it also offers a collection of glass bottles in very limited series. ""These are very high-end bottles, made of blown glass by master glassmakers,"" explains Bernard Dennery, president of the company. These are the extremes of craftsmanship."
Orimono: the marriage of textile and packaging,"A considerable and largely untapped potential! According to Christelle Lavaure (former Director General of Papillon Ribbon & Bow) and Marine Forlini-Crouzet (founder of the agency Les Belles Choses, and former Executive Director of Raison Pure) textile isn't given the place it deserves in the packaging world. ""Currently, textile is used mainly as a ribbon, always more or less the same way,"" underlined Christelle Lavaure. And most of all, techniques used for fitting the ribbon are often hand-done. However, for packaging designers to be able to use textile as a material of its own, its use must be automated. This is what have clearly understood the two young women, who partnered with Lambert Henckens, the creator of the company Lembart in Saint-Étienne, to develop a set of solutions for the processing of textile materials to offer ready to use patterns. This is how the Orimono project emerged in 2013. ""Technical barriers are important because textile is a delicate and difficult material to work, the strength of Orimono lies in the mastery of this new know-how, based on an industrial network of exclusive partners: material suppliers and converters,"" explained Lavaure, Associate Director. However, many difficulties have already been overcome. At the last Luxe Pack in Monaco, Orimono presented an ""Écrin des Matières"" in partnership with the Italian paper and cardboard manufacturer Fedrigoni, the French company, MR Cartonnage Numérique specialized in the printing of mock-ups and small series, and Dwain, a graphic design studio. ""This allowed us to illustrate the potential behind the different technical solutions that we have developed,"" emphasised Marine Forlini-Crouzet, Marketing Director. This ""Écrin des Matières"" contains a booklet decorated with a multi-component label, which is cut, glued and then fitted on the cover, two samplers (paper and textiles), a folding case adorned with a non-removable ribbon, automatically laid, the whole of it in a cardboard box decorated with a textile surface on the back cover. For the perfume and cosmetic market, Orimono already offers four decorative techniques: Etoff a solution enabling to lay textile solids on bottles and cases, Pliss, to decorate a bottle or any other type of packaging (glass or cardboard) with a woven sheath, Damask, to fit a non-removable textile ribbon on a cardboard box, before folding and Reverso, a solution which consists in laying a piece of fabric at the back of a open-worked cardboard. ""Most of these solutions enable to create a wide variety of graphic worlds,"" detailed Forlini-Crouzet. They are, in any case, definitely part of the trend to always bring more value to packaging, particularly through the addition of a material of its own and of an always more diversified sensuality."
Stölzle Glass Group acquires French glassworks Verreries de Masnières,"Stölzle Glass Group, one of the leading European manufacturers of high-end packaging glass for perfumery and cosmetics, prestige spirits, and pharmaceuticals, has acquired Verreries de Masnières SAS and Bormioli Rocco Valorisation SAS from Bormioli Rocco Group SpA. Both sites, one dedicated to glass production and the other to glass decoration, are situated in North of France. The transaction became effective on December 31, 2013. This acquisition allows Stölzle Glass Group to increase its production capabilities and its network, which includes: – 5 European production sites in Austria, France, England, Czech Republic and Poland with respective back-up capabilities. – A total of 2000 employees. – 6 cosmetic furnaces, 2 furnaces for amber glass. – 39 production lines including several feeder colouration lines. – 3 in-house decoration facilities (including multi-colour silkscreen printing, hot foil stamping, acid etching, organic spraying, decals,…) in France, England and Poland. The production plant as well as the decoration facility will be fully integrated in the Stölzle Glass Group, headquartered in Austria. ""This acquisition will suit perfectly to Stölzle's prestige glass network built up constantly since the nineteen nineties,"" explains the company in a release. ""This is another step towards being the first choice partner for unique products: from the concept to design, then to production and the addition of market leading decoration techniques,"" adds the group. Stölzle Masnières will showcase its products within the Stölzle Glass Group's booth (#D25) at the next PCD trade fair, which will open its doors in Paris on the 5th and 6th of February 2014."

MWV celebrates the 50th anniversary of their Barcelona plant,"MWV's Barcelona plant was founded in 1963 by Antonio Puig with a team of 50 employees. In 1987, the plant moved to its current location in Via Trajana, consisting of more than 9,000 square meters of production space. With a team of 240 employees, MWV has continually reinvested in new assets and capabilities for the plant, including a doubling of production capacity in 2012 with the initial Melodie Spray Collection launch. The plant manufactures a range of beauty and personal care packaging solutions including sprayers, dispensers, airless pumps and foamers. It also produces engine and head components for sprayers that are shipped to other MWV sites for local assembly and customization. Today, the Barcelona plant serves a portfolio of customers including luxury brands such as Puig, Chanel, Interparfums and Burberry and is a ""key strategic facility for MWV,"" according to Ángel Fernandez-Carbonell, the plant manager. Fragrance sprayers have been key to the success of the Barcelona plant and MWV's global Beauty & Personal Care business. Recent keystone innovations developed in the facility include the Emotions of Spray Collection, comprised of the original Melodie pump, Melodie Agile and Melodie Forever, plus three new sprayers - Melodie Pure, Melodie Delicate and Maestro Extravagant - that have distinctive spray characteristics allowing brand owners to tailor the spray to the positioning and personality of the fragrance, which should result in a more luxurious perception of the fragrance and increase brand loyalty. With planned production expansion in 2014, all six sprayers of the Emotions of Spray Collection for the European market will be produced in Barcelona, with additional engine and components supplied to plants in other regions around the world for local assembly. The Barcelona facility also led in the development of MWV's patented technology, NoC invisible dip tube, a world's first that brought an end to the era of unsightly dip tubes in the luxury fragrances segment. ""With a clear focus on the customer, the Barcelona team has significantly improved productivity in the facility over the past two years with the introduction of lean manufacturing practices, enabling the company to be more nimble and responsive to customer needs,"" the company claims. In 2013, the plant passed the ISO 22716:2007 certification audit for cosmetic Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). ""This anniversary milestone is a reflection of our legacy in the market and the evolution of our Beauty & Personal Care business,"" says Sandy Gregory, global fragrance marketing manager. ""MWV has continually invested in research and development as well as our manufacturing capabilities to increase production capacity and deliver the industry best solutions for our customers,"" she concludes."
Seidel invests for the future,"With the right tools you can do anything. Seidel is continuously investing to always be one step ahead and at the forefront of technology, with an ever more flexible and competitive production tool, or in the words of Andreas Ritzenhoff: ""to make this rigid industry a flexible one"". By always playing the innovation card, the German firm has managed the staggering feat of doubling its sales in ten years while increasing its workforce by 20%. ""There is no secret to such an achievement,"" adds Ritzenhoff, who is also the owner of this family company employing 600 people and situated an hour's drive from Frankfurt. ""We can and must respond to the demands of an increasingly hard-to-please market, but our customers have to also accept our need to invest. It is the only way to continue producing in Europe."" Seidel reinvests a significant portion of its annual turnover each year. A good example is the impressive transfer press (sixteen stations) that has just arrived at Fronhausen with settings that can be changed in just thirty minutes, a technological break-through. Not to mention the new Fronhausen plant. In this new building - awarded for its low energy consumption - injection moulding equipment and automated assembly lines are installed, in additional there is significant warehousing space that will allow the company to respond more quickly to the demands of both internal and external customers. There are practically no obstacles to hinder production flow. ""The design of this facility allows us to reorganize quickly and in a very flexible way the various production activities, according to the requirements of our customers' projects. Furthermore, with our land and the possibility to construct new buildings we are able to meet needs arising from the company's future growth,"" says Ritzenhoff. The whole facility was built in eight months only. Other areas of development pinpointed by Seidel's manager include the rapid introduction of automated machines. To the several robots currently positioned throughout the assembly lines will soon be added many more, beginning early next year. Already installed are high-speed decorating machines, some capable of embossing on metal, screen printing and in-line pad printing, and a pilot anodisation line allowing for in-depth research into new surface finishes. ""Production line control and environment protection,"" are the watchwords of Seidel's CEO, whose production plants are ISO 50001 certified for energy management; 80% of whose energy needs are provided by renewable sources, certified by the German TÜV. Seidel's original 20,000 m² plant located in Marburg, about fifteen kilometres from the new site, employs half the group's staff and has three automatic anodising lines. The Fronhausen plant houses the fourth. ""We are also developing new technologies,"" says Ritzenhoff, whose senses seem to be permanently on the alert for developing new markets. ""All I can say is we're currently working on new developments involving the transformation of our material that will change in depth both the company and the market in the months to come. These developments aren't necessarily related directly to the perfumery and cosmetics industry, but they will greatly benefit them."" Another important objective is Ritzenhoff's desire to improve and increase logistic information flow with Seidel's customers. ""It's a bit difficult right now,"" he says, ""because we're right in the middle of an industrial relocation, but this is essential and we fully intend to succeed. This also requires great mutual trust with our customers, so that we can act as a partner to support their growth."" And we have just been told that Seidel, 80% of whose sales are generated by export activities, will be opening a subsidiary in Brazil early 2014..."
Interview - François Luscan on Albéa's missions,"Premium Beauty News - So, we can say this merger was successfully achieved? François Luscan - Absolutely! And not only successfully conducted but above all, considered as a positive and welcomed merger by the Rexam teams who very much wanted it to happen! We thoroughly reorganized the industrial and commercial tool, defined a strategy, set up a real investment policy by injecting the equivalent of 10% of our turnover in each business segment. We had to re-assign everyone with specific areas of work and, of course, increase the pace of training. Of course, some work still needs to be done, but at least we were able to give both personal and collective development prospects to the teams who were in dire need of them. Premium Beauty News - You consider training, as a key point for the Group's development! François Luscan - Absolutely and I'm very pleased to see that you have placed this question on training in second position among your list of topics, because I have always considered this point an essential one. It's one thing and a cliché to say that each and every business can only develop through the women and men who are part or it or will be part of it. Still concrete action must be taken in that direction, not only in developed countries, like we just did, for example in France in Sainte Ménehould in the Marne area where we recently inaugurated a new site for the production of plastic and laminated tubes and where we also set up a training school in partnership with the École des Arts et Métiers, but also and especially in developing countries. This is the case in Indonesia, where we are taking part in the development of three schools in the periphery of our main production site. This is the case in Brazil and Mexico. This is the case in India. This is obviously stating the obvious to say that hope should be given to all those people who want to work and, of course, to all these young people. 15% of our staff is currently being trained. And training is also a guarantee of safety and quality. A proof of this is that we improved this year by more than 20% our customer satisfaction rate and by 15% our customer complaint rate. Premium Beauty News - Train but also support industrial sectors! François Luscan - More than ever! This is certainly also one of our missions. We were lucky enough - but we mostly gave ourselves the means – to invest heavily on an industrial scale to meet the expectations of our customers whatever their location in the world. These investments also enabled us sometimes to support companies in a tight position. Because we too often forget to mention, that some of our colleagues also happen to be from time to time our subcontractors. I think we can be quite proud of what we just did in Annecy in the French Alps area, where what was at stake was no more and no less a matter of saving a great French and local know-how in the field of metal processing. Know-how is so important! And nothing must be neglected to prevent it from vanishing. For example: try to find someone to supply you in Europe with mirrors for make-up cases? Premium Beauty News - A global Vision ... but also a local vision! François Luscan - This is not incompatible, far from it! Quite the contrary as far as I'm concerned! And we are proving it every day. Never before have we invested so much in the world. I can't mention all the sites, but you should know that we have built in Indonesia what is probably one of the most beautiful plastic processing plants in Asia, employing more than 2,000 people, with 170 injection machines and 7 lacquering/metallization lines running. China is not outdone, where we are completing the construction of the largest site ever designed on this continent. And the same goes for Mexico and Brazil, where we plan to double the production in the coming months. These investments are earmarked to follow local growth. But it's a global strategy that takes into account our customers local needs and also, to a larger extent, our core mission, which is namely to preserve and develop the industrial fabric in Europe. The new tube factory we just opened in France in Sainte Ménehould is a proof of this. We invested 20 million euros in the process and took the opportunity to incorporate the production of our two sites in the Marne area, (Sainte Ménehould and Vienne Le Château). Albéa Argonne thus becomes the Group's Centre of Excellence for our tube activity and will help us support our ambitions to gain market shares in this mature segment. But this is not the only example. I already told you what we had achieved in Annecy. I could also tell you about what we are doing in Plouhinec, in Parigne in the perfume sector and in Simandre where we are investing to improve our responsiveness and customer service to ensure record-time and very secure ""product"" developments..., or what we are actually doing in our Dispensing division where we will also double our capacity on a global scale. Don't forget that 15% of the Group employees are located in France. And you will soon find out more with the new mascara production plant that should soon be inaugurated in Italy near Milan and which should help the Group step up by 50% its production capacity, be it in vials, fibre or plastic brushes. Generally speaking, ""global"" and ""local"" concepts are closely linked. Our local presence enables us to guarantee responsiveness, service with the possibility of relying on the other entities of the Group in all parts of the world. Premium Beauty News - Yet, so called ""emerging"" countries represent the largest share in terms of industrial installations? François Luscan - No at all! You mustn't be mistaken. Although our presence outside Europe is important, it only represents 30% of our turnover. This is obviously not the same in terms of staff since Asia (including India) accounts for 40% of our workforce. But it is clear that we expect these countries to post the strongest growth rates in the future. Premium Beauty News - Innovation, quality, time-to-market, prices... Central subjects? François Luscan - And not always obvious to deal with, it is true! As an industrialist my answers are both simple and complicated. On innovation, we are always ready, not to say ahead of competition... But we need our customers to be willing to pay more for it. Quality and Time-to-market are ongoing concerns for us. We strive to improve logistics with our customers. It also means developing partnerships in the medium and long term, sometimes with certain exclusivities. This partnership concept, be it with customers but also with other suppliers is I believe, essential. Our mission is truly to be a project manager first. And one of the finest illustrations I can give you of our vocation is the Beauty Solutions Division, which as you know, intends to offer a comprehensive promotional offer to our customers. And it works! As you know, this division achieved in the past two years a growth rate of over 40%. Premium Beauty News - The Asia/Americas/Europe axis seems to be an unchanging one! François Luscan - And why not Africa? It could be the subject of our next conversation..."
Quadpack is looking for new acquisitions in Catalonia,"Is Catalonia's 'Cosmetic Valley' ripe for a revival? This could be the outcome of Quadpack and Alba & Andrea's will to strengthen their portfolio of local beauty packaging suppliers. Actually, Quadpack, which is traditionally sourcing in Korea and China, recently invested in a production facility closer to home when it purchased wooden component manufacturer Technotraf, in a joint venture with Alba & Andrea last March. Six months on, the move has been so successful that it is no surprise the partnership is looking for similar opportunities in the Spanish region that two decades ago was known as 'Cosmetic Valley' - Catalonia. ""Sourcing closer to home makes sense on multiple levels,"" explains Quadpack CEO Tim Eaves. ""Manufacturing or finishing products right here in Catalonia clearly cuts turnaround times, but our commitment goes much further than that. We also have a responsibility to the environment and, on a social level, to our community. Local production means a smaller carbon footprint, more jobs and a much-needed boost the local economy."" For Alba & Andrea, this is not new territory. The company has had similar success in local investments, notably in the fields of furniture, playground equipment, payment terminals and public lighting. ""Technotraf was our first venture into the beauty packaging sector and we are buoyed by its success. Our alliance with Quadpack shows a real synergy in our outlook and the expertise we can bring to smaller companies. On our part, we offer manufacturing and business know-how, while Quadpack boasts an impressive sales & marketing operation. What we need now is the right manufacturer or service company that's ready for expansion,"" announces Joaquim Carandell, the company's owner. Specifically, the two companies are looking for either manufacturers of beauty packaging or service companies that can process unfinished products imported from outside of Europe. Services provided might include packaging design, decoration, metallisation, finishing or assembly. ""There exists here a pool of skilled local companies that produce first-class products, but lack the investment and infrastructure to grow outside of their limited area. This talent was widely recognised 20 years ago when I first came to Spain. The 1990s was the country's heyday, when everyone was buying cosmetic packaging from Spanish –and particularly Catalonian – manufacturers, before everything moved to China. What we aim to do now is recapture the region's glory days of the 90s. We want put Catalonia's Cosmetic Valley back on the map,"" Tim Eaves adds. Alba & Andrea and Quadpack are considering a variety of investment types, including acquisitions (coming in as capital partners), financial, technical and/or commercial support, or joint ventures. In doing so, they intend to replicate the experience that is being carried out successfully at Technotraf."
Albéa wants to grow faster than the market,"Albéa, the world's leading producer of cosmetic packaging, just inaugurated a new facility dedicated to the production of plastic and laminated tubes. The plant is located in St. Ménehould, in Northeast France. The Albéa Argonne new facility results from the merger of the group's two factories in the region (Sainte Ménehould and Vienne Le Château). Albéa invested about 20 million euros in the new site that will become the group's centre of excellence in the tubes business with the aim to support its ambitions to gain market shares in a segment that is deemed mature. According to François Luscan, Albéa's tubes business, which accounts for 33% of the group's turnover, is expected to grow by approximately two digits. With 600 employees, four production units (caps, laminated tubes, small diameter plastic tubes and premium plastic tubes), an R&D and quality control laboratory, a colorimetry service and several decoration lines including hot stamping, screen printing, offset or flexography, the Albéa Argonne facility has a production capacity of 1 billion tubes and caps per year. To date, it is group's largest factory. This new site, which started operations in June, is mostly serving French clients (90% of the business). It is located a hundred kilometres from the Albéa Vandières plant, which also specializes in the manufacture of tubes, and ""is integrated into a European network for plants that is being modernized and allows us to boost our market,"" says Laurent Villemin, President Albéa Tubes France and vice president of Albéa Tubes Europe. Through this investment, Albéa bets on the advantages of being located close to its main European customers, and on a strong flexibility. Not only the site is located close to the highway but is also adjacent to a storage site for 15,000 pallets, which is dedicated to Albéa and is managed by its logistics partner TransAlliance. Main advantage, according to the group: ""a strong optimization of transport, a better control of incoming and outgoing flows, as well as the optimization of intermediate stocks and truck fleet."" Every step of the supply chain has also been redesigned to reduce the overall carbon footprint of the site and products. Thus, according to Albéa, CO2 emissions will be reduced from 6.5 tonnes to 1.3 tonnes and 20% of energy savings will be achieved. ""If we are able to produce quality products in France, at a reasonable cost, and to deliver them within short delays, there is no reason for our customers to source in China or elsewhere,"" adds François Luscan. For him, the main strengths of the plant are the technical skills of its staff, its responsiveness and flexibility and the integration of finishing steps, which reduces the time-to-market. Albéa also relies on the increased flexibility of its sites and on its European network to absorb the variations in production needs. Variations that can reach 20-30%, according to François Luscan, and need to be transferred from one plant to another depending on changes in customer needs. Albéa intends to continue its investment strategy and to further reduce the time-to-market for its customers through its global implementation strategy. With 16,000 employees and 45 production sites in 14 countries, Albéa is located on all continents except Africa, which is currently delivered from India or from Europe. ""But this is an area that we observe closely,"" says François Luscan ""beyond a critical volume, a local presence will prove necessary."" In the future, much of the group's growth will come from emerging markets. Albéa has been among the first to settle in Indonesia and has tripled the size of its local factory. The group will also open a new plant in Brazil, where it forecasts to keep growing at a double-digit rate. ""This year we have invested between 8 and 9% of our revenue and we'll do the same in 2014, and at a worldwide scale,"" insists François Luscan. In Europe , the next step will be the opening in 2014 of a new mascaras plant in Bottanuco, near Milan, Italy."
"L'Oréal's ""CherryPack"": a more internationally focused third edition featuring new categories","Premium Beauty News - Another ""great"" moment for all marketing and Research teams of the Group! Philippe Thuvien - We hope so; that was the goal!, Don't forget that the founding principle of CherryPack - launched three years ago - is to address all the brands of the Group and to provide innovations to the Marketing and Research teams, for their future launches. An operation that has enabled to put on the market over the past two years more than thirty products with novel packaging solutions and exclusive innovations to the L'Oréal Group. This initiative was jointly managed by the Group's Purchasing and Packaging & Development Departments, and aims, in the background, to always better anticipate consumer expectations, and this for all areas in the world. Premium Beauty News - Can you give us some examples of new products that emerged from previous CherryPacks? Philippe Thuvien - Yes of course! There is in particular the self-loading dropper of Lancôme's Génifique developed in partnership with Yonwoo; the Revitalift Laser X3 tube with a zamac head or Quad Pro Star Secrets the make-up palette for L'Oréal Paris; Cellu Destock Expert, Vichy's ""triball"" tube or the ""encre gonflante"" décor for YSL's Touche Eclat. Premium Beauty News - An operation that surely requires a great deal of preparation? Philippe Thuvien - The preparation is actually essential to fully capture the expectations of our Brands and better respond to them; this is the role of Development Teams with their Marketings. The CherryPack required eight months of preparation with several dozens of suppliers who were presented before an Evaluation Committee, and to have in the final phase, ten of them selected. Six packaging suppliers, three subcontractors and a manufacturer of POS material. These companies are Alpla, Aptar, Crystal, Edelman, Intercos, Majrani, Shya Hsin, Spatz, Tokiwa and Yonwoo. Emphasis was placed this year on-time-to market with over 50% of projects available in a time period of less than 18 months. For this year we also wanted a very internationally focused CherryPack since we welcomed suppliers from Asia, Europe and America. Finally, and this is also very new, within the selection criteria, we included the concept of intellectual property, that is to say, that innovations presented were previously the subject of a priority research to guarantee that they me freely exploited. Premium Beauty News - Innovation was also part of the organization of the CherryPack itself? Philippe Thuvien - To facilitate the conduct of these two days and the hosting of our eight hundred guests, we distributed to each of them an iPad to enable them to scan the QR code attached to each highlighted product and thus to get real-time information on the product (description, cost & delays). Each Group member also had the possibility to give a mark to each product listed. This enabled us to have parallel a feedback on the interest shown by our visitors and thus, analyze the individual needs. To note that 90% of products were scanned during these two days. Premium Beauty News - Overall, the activity of the different teams in packaging & development, you are in charge of, has been particularly tonic? Philippe Thuvien - That's right! And it is quite natural since, I remind you, we must support our Businesses in the quest for a billion new consumers. In terms of major launches, we can mention: – Spray Cream hair colouring with ""Préférence mousse absolue"" of L'Oréal Paris which won the European Aerosol Federation (FEA) Special Jury Prize. – A new so-called temporary hair colouring, ""Hair Chalk"" by L'Oréal Professionnel. – The ""L'Infinie Platine"" by L'Oréal Professionnel which now comes in the form of a 500 g. sachet of a discolouration powder in replacement of a jar, for which we just received an Oscar de l'Emballage in the environment category. – ""Armani Si"" the new Giorgio Armani perfume, which has a massive hood without any parting line and a very fine ""snap collar"". – The Baccarat edition of ""Lancôme Absolute"" whose jar is made of black faceted crystal. Premium Beauty News - a dynamics in packaging innovation, which is boosted by the reinforcement of teams? Philippe Thuvien - The Group actually decided to allocate more resources this year to Packaging Innovation and Functional Design, two essential components of product innovation. Hence, we reinforced the ""Innovation"" teams, set up a ""Functional Design"" structure (in charge of finding new gestures, more ergonomics and a greater ease of restitution, sensoriality...) and establish ""Packaging Innovation"" teams in North America and Asia; the goal being to significantly increase the synergy between the Innovation Department, the Research for new formulas and Packaging Innovation to accelerate a global product innovation offering. Among significant and recent examples of this dynamics, we can mention: – The deodorant ""Deo Caress"", by Narta, – The ""Faux Cils Papillon"" mascara by L'Oréal Paris (""Votre Beauté"" Award) – The gloss, Gloss In Love (Oscar de l'Emballage in the ""Luxury"" category). Premium Beauty News - The concept of environmental ""preservation"" is intrinsically present in your approach. Philippe Thuvien - This is a strategic priority for the Group and as part of the activity of the Packaging & Development teams. We have developed a guide and a tool for the life-cycle analysis to reduce the amount of packaging required for the shipment of our components from our suppliers to our facilities to enable a reduction of packaging waste. The efforts of the Packaging & Development Community to lighten our components, use recycled materials and reduce the volume of our packaging materials were highlighted by the press through several awards: – The Eco Emballage Trophy for the Ivy tube of La Roche-Posay – The Walmart Award for Excellence in Sustainable Development with Garnier U.S. – The Greener Packaging Award (similar to the Belgian Eco Emballage) to single out the use of PETG thermoformed trays, 50% lighter than PS trays used by the Luxury Division. Premium Beauty News - What are the objectives of the Packaging and Development Community for the coming months? Philippe Thuvien - Our objective is to actively participate in the growth of the Group through ""affordable innovation"": – For the Development teams, be real business partners of our Brands by accompanying them still further in the construction of their launch plans, in accelerated innovation and ""design- to- cost"". – For the Packaging teams, share the expertise with robust and standardized designs to accelerate the ""time-to-market"" and focus on high value-added developments. And then, of course, packaging with its ""3Rs"" (Respect, Reduce, Replace) policy, is an integral part of the Group's ambition for Sustainability, through its 2020 program ""Sharing Beauty with all"", presented by our Directorate General last October 23, 2013."

The combined group will have an unrivalled capability to meet the demanding requirements of our market sectors within Europe."""
Yonwoo: thirty years already!,"It was a particularly moving and successful ceremony, which took place last week in Incheon. On the occasion, Yoonwoo officials spared no efforts for this event. The main hall of the Songdo Convensia Convention Centre in Incheon hosted more than a thousand people for a non-stop show that took place during the whole afternoon and part of the evening of November 11th. Moving indeed because, at the image of this unique company, it was team spirit which was single out on that day. Alongside local politicians who came to applaud this success, it is the whole staff of Yonwoo and its main partners abroad like Quadpack and PKG who were given the place of honour by its leaders, and especially its leader, Mr. Joong Hyun Ki. In 1983, with the creation of an anodizing plant, the man was certainly unaware at the time that he just started what would become, thirty years later, the world's number one producer of airless packs with a piston. In 1990 he had the idea of starting to manufacture pumps. At the time, they were all imported. Very quickly, demand is was there, and in 1992, he settled into a new factory fully dedicated to the manufacture of these pumps. In 1995 Yonwoo released its first airless pack with a piston. The progression was fast. In 2008 the company was posting a turnover of over USD 72 million, which jumped to USD 95 million the following year, reaching USD 155 million this year. Meanwhile, the number of personnel was increased from 562 in 2009 to 1140 people today. Yonwoo currently accounts for 55% of the Korean market of airless and believes being one of the leading players in the global market. Main assets of the Korean company, its maximum integration from the production of moulds to injection moulding, including the stamping of metal parts, all the various finishing techniques (coating, metallization, anodizing, hot stamping, screen printing, etc.) and, of course, assembling. Over the past three years, several new buildings were added to the main production plant in Incheon, one of which, brand new, where has been installed a few weeks ago, a production centre fully dedicated to small production runs of packs, to meet all the test requirements. Representing an investment cost of USD 3.3 million. One and only watchword in the Korean company, ""innovation."" No less than 90 people work at the R&D department. Airless systems, indeed but also tubes. Because, since 2007, Yonwoo also manufactures plastic and aluminium/plastic tubes. Not to mention also leak-proof make-up cases. Quadpack is a company specializing in the development of standard and customized packaging solutions for the beauty industry. The company, which was founded in 2003, has become a global independent Group that works with leading brands on the prestige masstige and mass markets."
Tesem: full-scale developments,"Premium Beauty News - A few words on Tesem? Albert Sala - Tesem is before all a specialist in the processing of aluminium parts intended for the perfume and cosmetic markets and also the wine and spirits market. We run in Torello near Barcelona four factories covering a total area of 18,100 sq. metres and two laboratories, one for the approval of parts and the other located in the anodising plant. Our production capacity exceeds 325 million units per year. Premium Beauty News - What is the secret of your growth? Albert Sala - Firstly with our ability to constantly adapt to market changes. When we first started in the trade, we were only a supplier of anodized and stamped metal parts like many others players on the marketplace. We then identified that there was a real need for more sophisticated parts and especially a huge demand for full-service. So we decided to integrate in our site a production line for plastic parts. This of course resulted in significant investments in injection moulding, assembly machines, but also decoration machines like laser engraving (6 PLCs), screen printing (4 PLCs). We also invested in a new white room mainly intended for the cosmetic sector, which enables us to guarantee a dust- and particle-free packaging to protect sensitive formulas. Premium Beauty News - 70% of your turnover comes from exports. How do you adapt to internationalization? Albert Sala - Clients tend towards concentration and launches are increasingly global. To better communicate with them we have just invested in a latest generation video conference system. This enables us to share high precision documents in real time during the packaging development stage. Premium Beauty News - The market for metal parts is booming. What are the current market trends and how do you address them? Albert Sala - Clients are looking for suppliers who can offer them full-service solutions, thus managing the entire production process for the various components. We have heavily invested in this direction in recent years as I explained above. As for the product, it has become increasingly sophisticated and sometimes even becomes a decorative object. And it is not only a functional packaging. In addition we have a R&D Department on the lookout for new materials and new sophisticated technical solutions that we develop in close collaboration with the brands' packaging development teams. The white room is a perfect example of this concern. Premium Beauty News - You are setting foot on the market of wines and spirits packaging, can you tell us more? Albert Sala - We launched the concept of ""la parure du bouchage"" with Pierre Tixier Manager of the VIP Company for the champagne market, an easily customizable product (as regards shape, colour, brightness...), a first diversification for us. We are also thinking about make-up, where our responsiveness, innovation capacity and creativity could be real assets."
"Valérie Bernard, the colour of design","A yellow-orange shade between saffron and mango, a rusty red turning brown, hemp and flax shades combined to a taupe shade, aqua blue in harmony with chocolate, not to mention the infinity of blues... Valérie Bernard's Studio, rue de Wattignies in the 12th district of Paris, where was previously established the Dorin factory, offers a display of pigments and shades. ""Each colour has its own meaning and a strong evocative power. To coordinate them, like in music, is a matter of harmony. There are those that go together naturally and blend together to create a world of their own, and the ones that collide, shock us and surprise us,"" she explains. A graduate in a graphic school, Valérie Bernard began her career in design with Alain de Mourgues and then Joël Desgrippes. But it was in Japan in 1991, that she created her first agency after working during nearly a year and a half for Kosé. After her return to Paris, two years later, Asia continues to inspire her work. ""In the early 90s, design really began to draw the attention of European skin care brands. Japan, and its products with beautifully worked shapes, seemed very much in advance in this matter."" With a very sensory approach of design, she rapidly focuses on the role of colour in the attractiveness of objects. ""I immediately started creating my own colours in my studio,"" she says. ""Each colour has its own meaning and a strong evocative power. Therefore, choosing a colour over another may have important consequences in terms of image and identity. Colour is also what helps differentiate oneself from others. It is a strategic choice."" Even if some segments are still resisting, especially in dermo-cosmetics where the proximity of the medical world seems to limit the range of possibilities, the use of colours in the skincare world has become widespread. Neutral colours have not disappeared from shelves, but they no longer impose their rules. The world of luxury itself is concerned. Hence, colour is gaining ever more ground in the world of perfumery, especially with the development of flankers that must be clearly differentiated from one another. Among the achievements of the Valérie Bernard Design studio, there are many different creations like candles (Rigaud), perfumes (the packaging design and graphics of the limited edition Fleur de Narcisse, L'Artisan parfumeur; White Reseda, Roger & Gallet), luxury make-up (Les Météorites, Guerlain), of mass or masstige make-up (Fun by Espoir, Amore Pacific; les monos by Bourjois ; Aube de Kao), toiletries (Les Bains Essentiels, Yves Rocher ; Eau Précieuse, Omega Pharma) and of course skincare products (the design of graphics and the colour of the Oxyance range, woman and man, by Sensiblu; the design of the corporate image and the packaging of the Filorga products, and several lines from the Dr. Pierre Ricaud brand with which she has been working for fifteen years). To these references in the world of beauty, can be added a line of wrapping paper for Sephora. ""The brand had the idea to develop a range of colours of papers, with a range of varied Pantone colours but guaranteeing that the combination was harmonious."" In another domain she created in 2012 for the famous champagne producer, Dom Perignon, a corporate colour named ""DARK"". Just like shapes, but in a much more pronounced way, colours obey to fashion. Colour designing requires to be attentive to changing lifestyles and to immerse in trends. ""There are the colours of the moment, and the ones which are already dated. My role is to become imbued with the spirit of the times and to focus on colours which are on the up and up or on the contrary, on those who will flourish over time. It all depends of the needs of my clients. Sometimes you must dare move away from fashions and trends."" Especially since the correspondences between the cosmetic discourse, which relates to molecules, effects on the skin, is not always easy to transpose in a coloured form. Remains the question of cultural differences. We know that the symbolism of colours varies from one civilization to another. But for Bernard the trend on this matter also, is clearly globalization. ""Cultural differences tend to fade. When I started in the trade, some colour codes were very marked from one market to another. This is less true today, even if some colours still remain sensitive. I remain cautious on reds, gold, etc. But all this has changed a lot. Fashion and trends have gone global. The result is that many impediments have been removed and that we can now dare propose more colours. Yet some colours and combinations remain more acceptable in some countries than others."" The studio, which still has many clients in Asia, mainly in China, continues to regularly make itself acquainted with cross trends between Europe and Asia, its two main sources of inspiration. But the designer's work does not stop with the definition of colour harmonies. ""Once found the perfect colour, the whole challenge is then to industrialize it. The different manufacturing techniques available do not render colours the same way. Some colours will not work with certain techniques. This requires a close cooperation between designers and manufacturers,"" emphasises Bernard. ""The designer's role is to guide the industrialist on the way the colour was obtained. My job even consists in the industrialization of the chosen colour."" If indeed the different colour scanning tools have facilitated exchanges between the various actors, for Bernard, ""an experienced human eye remains indispensable."" Indexing tools, she says, do not necessarily render accurately colours with a heavy content in nacres nor material variations. A delicate and sensitive work, sometimes difficult to put into words, but so essential to the success of new developments."
BillerudKorsnäs launches its next generation cartonboard,"In the wake of the merger of the two Swedish companies Billerud and Korsnäs in November 2012, BillerudKorsnäs, the new entity, has made a series of investments intended to gear up for the new demands of tomorrow's packaging industry. The latest extensive remodelling of the board machine has opened up possibilities to tweak the properties of the high-performance cartonboard material further, especially in terms of appearance and printability. ""It is more than just a general upgrade,"" says Magnus Levinsson, Business Segment Director Cartonboard, BillerudKorsnäs. ""This is the next generation cartonboard, one that sets new standards for printability. We have made the print surface more even and applied a triple coating. This contributes to reduced white top mottling and improved colour printing. You get more even print, more vibrant colour, a wider colour gamut and more life-like colour reproduction. Furthermore, the new cartonboards offer improved quality consistency, which means that you can expect excellent results at all times."" BillerudKorsnäs offers a range of four highly specialized cartonboard grades, specially designed for brands in market segments such as luxury beverages, fine foods, perfume, chocolate and health&beauty products: – BillerudKorsnäs White is the company's flagship cartonboard, dedicated to luxury brands with its combination of strength, shapeability and printability. – BillerudKorsnäs Artisan is a lightweight cartonboard with a silky-smooth surface, for quality printability as well as a ""nice haptic experience"". – BillerudKorsnäs Carry is a very strong cartonboard that offers good protection of heavy content. It is highly suitable for package windows and designs for hanging or handles. – BillerudKorsnäs Light is an ideal material for dry, chilled or frozen foods. It is moisture-proof and extremely pure, no effect on taste or smell. ""The launch is a big, complex process, that also includes grammage extensions,"" says Levinsson. ""Besides the improved properties, the remodelling of the board machine ensures increased capacity."" With 8 production units and sales offices in around ten countries, approximately 4,400 employees in 13 countries and net sales of 20 billion Swedish crowns (about 2,3 billion euros), BillerudKorsnäs can offer a comprehensive product portfolio and packaging solutions for a wide scope of applications and market segments (sack paper, kraft paper, fluting and liner, cartonboard, liquid packaging board), all of them based on primary fibres. ""Our target remains to deliver smarter packaging, both through better materials as well as better solutions. Smarter packaging adds value at every step of the value chain; attracting consumers, increasing productivity, lowering cost of transportation, reducing waste and not the least lowering environmental impact,"" says Per Lindberg, CEO BillerudKorsnäs."
Seen at Luxe Pack Monaco,"It would not be possible to offer a comprehensive overview of all the new products showcased at the last edition of Luxe Pack. Here are some of the trends and innovations that Premium Beauty News spotted, among many others: – In a context marked by consumers' mistrust regarding preservatives and the search for maximum convenience, airless experts have redoubled efforts to protect fragile formulas and create new gestures. Promens' new Slidisisme jar and Aptar's new stylus pen Serumony are perfect epitomes of this trend. – Regarding fragrance packages, Premium Beauty News already noted the trend towards pumps' ultra segmentation, with the launches by Albea (Panache Pulse), Aptar (Precious) and MWV (collection of six pumps ""Emotions of Spray ""). – The trend towards and increased sensoriality of materials and the multiplication textural effects continues. In 2012, with ""Texture"" of Pochet Courval had successfully combined visual and tactile dimensions on the glass surface, and this year with ""Texture 2"" the glassmaker further expands the creative possibilities of this technique. – SGD for its ""Les Cosmiques"" range has combined make-up pigments with different decorative inks to create new finishes with startling depth, thus revealing metallic effects or optical illusions. – Bormioli Luigi has looked for new visual effects too and launched Inside, its solution for internal coating adapted to fragrance bottles and allowing virtual 3D effects. – Solev showcased its new ""Metallic-MIllesime"" technique, a metallization process that gives the glass a vintage appearance. – As far as samples are concerned, Bioplan launched ""The Chameleon"", a high-precision solution for sampling campaigns that allows to place the sachet as closely as possible to the page, so as it becomes an integral part of the design. Livcer introduced Touch Kiss, its new lipstick sampling solution launched in September at Makeup in New York, and Aptar Gift announced that, after France and China, Cosm'in, its ""flat jar"", is now being produced in the United States and will soon be available for production in Brazil (at the end of November). – Cardboard makers have also have made big shifts, with a new version of Iggesund's Incada box board and improvements made to the Metsä Board range and the launch of a new liner. At BillerudKorsnäs, it was time to present the assets of the new organisation, following the merger between Korsnäs and Billerud, but also a fully renovated range of box boards."
Iggesund launches an upgraded and greener Incada box board,"This year, it is the Incada board that Iggesund Paperboard put under the spotlights at the Luxe Pack Monaco tradeshow. Actually, the Swedish papermaker just launched an upgraded version of this its folding box board, which is used for packaging but also for book and brochure covers, and other graphical applications. The new Incada will be whiter and lighter and also have a number of improved properties affecting printability. Incada Exel, which is more of a specialised packaging board, will also have improved stiffness, with a gain of up to 10 to 15 per cent for grammages over 300 g/m2. ""This enables our customers to reduce their packaging weights while keeping the same protection for the contents,"" explains Guy Mallinson, sales manager at Iggesund. The improved stiffness has also led to a revision of Incada Exel's grammage range to better suit the demands of the current customer base. The whiteness improvement amounts to 7.5 units on the CIE scale and most of it lies in the L value, which is critical for colour reproduction. Runnability is also improved so that Incada can function even better in customers' processes. ""Incada was introduced in 2001 and since then we've made many small quality improvements,"" adds Robin Lewis, product manager for Incada. ""This is a big leap forward and will definitely strengthen our market position."" The biggest change of all for Incada, though, has no effect at all on printability or the economy of customers' own processes. Incada is manufactured at Iggesund Paperboard's mill in Workington. This spring the mill changed its energy source from fossil natural gas to biomass, which is burned in a new combined heat and power plant. Overnight the mill eliminated its fossil carbon emissions from more than 190,000 tonnes a year to zero. The reduction is the equivalent of the annual emissions from more than 65,000 cars, each driven 20,000 kilometres a year. ""This adds even more power to our sales message,"" Lewis concludes. ""Paperboard in general is a very sustainable packaging material. By changing our energy source and upgrading Incada we are now at the summit of the folding box board market in terms of both product properties and sustainability."" This investment in the new biofuel boiler is also a matter of profitability and is regarded as a way to stabilise energy costs. Indeed, Iggesund anticipates that fossil-based energy will rise faster than that of biofuel. Iggesund Paperboard in Workington is the UK's only producer of folding box board and has 400 employees. ""Thanks to investments spanning more than a decade, Iggesund Paperboard has raised the standard of what was a very middle-of-the-road paperboard mill to one that is state of the art,"" comments Ulf Löfgren, the mill's managing director. ""Including the 108 million pounds spent on the biofuel boiler, we have invested more than 200 million pounds in this transformation."" Step by step the investments and renovations have raised both the quality and quality consistency of Incada. As a result, the mill has found new end uses for its product and gradually improved its profitability. First deliveries of the new Incada can are beginning this November."
HCT in full industrial redeployment,"Representing the majority of its business, the Unites States remains the continent on which the company performs best, and by far. It is followed by Asia, where the Group boasts considerable growth. As we know the HCT management team has turned its attention to Europe in recent months, and has repositioned its business in the Old World, boldly and with success, with a full-service offer aimed at servicing retail-owned brands (PremiumBeautynews.com, 15 April 2013). The result: sales in excess of €45 million and a desire to make a strong comeback in Europe with an innovative packaging solution, proven by Arnaud Audebourg's arrival in the team a few weeks ago at the head of this business activity. Within the space of five years, the face of the HCT Group has radically changed. What was originally a European packaging vendor has become a full-fledged industrial player in the full-service sector for formulas, packaging, filling and cosmetic brushes. A new business model that has thrust the company to the forefront of the scene as a key industrial player in the sector. Today, HCT employs in excess of two hundred people and more than four thousand in the world if you include those working in the Asian factories owned in whole or in part by the Group. As a result, the company's ambition has multiplied with its desire to become a global player. Not only do HCT's leaders invest some ten million dollars each year in their Asian factories, but they also aspire to having an industrial presence in North America, in South America and even in Europe within the space of two years. A new factory in China is also on the point of being commissioned. HCT's current product range couldn't be more extensive or comprehensive. It includes make-up boxes, lipstick tubes, mascaras, lip glosses, eyeliners, brushes and applicators. The latest product to hit the catalogue is a full range of airless packaging in partnership with the Korean firm Pum-Tech. ""But our great strength lies in our unwavering determination to propose innovative solutions and to live by our credo, which comprises two key words: flexibility and responsiveness,"" says Tim Thorpe, Group President. Another plus is the company's complete mastery of formulation development and manufacturing. ""We surround ourselves with the best specialists in this field. We attach great importance to maintaining and even fostering this constant open-mindedness that has served us so well over the years. We are open to everything, and are always prepared to enter uncharted territory"", says Nick Gardner, Executive Vice President of Sales."
Digital printing appeals to beauty brands,"At first it sounds like a bold challenge. In 2008, date of its foundation, MR Cartonnage Numérique immediately bets on an emerging technology that is far from having passed all proof tests in the world of high-end packaging: digital offset printing. ""When we explained our project, we were considered with a lot of surprise,"" recalls Jonathan Mihy, Sales Director and co-founder of the young French company. ""Digital printing for prestige packaging was something entirely new and the general opinion was barely sceptical."" Nevertheless new technology already had many advantages: firstly, production is easy to launch (initialisation usually requires 3 sheets only, against 3-400 for traditional printing), secondly its flexibility makes it ideal for producing mock-ups or small batches (1 to 10000 units) at acceptable costs, producing the exact amount of units required, therefore without generating surplus or accumulating stock. What remained then largely unknown from potential customers was the quality of the final products. ""Clearly, digital printing was viewed as a poor quality office printing technology, and unfortunately it is still sometimes the case."" Thus, the company's beginning was focused on new and specific uses, mainly the production of prototypes, which the new technology made feasible at a very reasonable cost, as well as preproduction. Digital printing appeared ideal for fine-tuning luxury products packages, as the sector is striving for perfection. ""This allowed us to demonstrate the level of quality we were able to get,"" said Jonathan Mihy considering that today ""there are no qualitative difference between industrial offset and industrial digital printing"". Such an achievement has been made possible thanks to the use of more efficient technologies, namely the HP Indigo digital offset, to the know-how acquired by the company, and the mastery of all decoration techniques (including varnish protection, selective coating, laminating, embossing, stamping, Braille, cutting, gluing). No need for specific cardboards, the same grades as those of traditional offset are used, depending on customer specifications. Of course the limit of digital printing is volume. Beyond 10 or 20 thousand units, depending on the project, industrial offset is more competitive. In contrast, small and medium series (1 to 10,000 units) are a natural market for digital printing that offers a real qualitative solution not only for emerging brands and niche products, but also for the limited series of major brands or to meet the growing trend towards the personalization of products. ""The big companies call us for their models or limited series. Smaller structures are asking us to take charge of their entire production,"" confirms Jonathan Mihy. For instance, the founders of DiCorsica, a young beauty brand offering wellness products based on plant extracts from Corsica, have chosen MR Cartonnage Numérique for printing the external packages (folding boxes and gift boxes) of their products, while opting for a cardboard sourced from sustainably managed forests. Eventually, MR Cartonnage Numérique, which currently employs 19 staff, has met success. In 2012, the company moved into new premises in the Paris greater area, quadrupling its surface (from 400 to 1,600 sqm) and invested more than one million euros in new machines, including a new printing machine, and in a converting line. The aim of the management team is to stay ahead of what they see as the future of printing. ""Digital printing quality is already a reality, with true achievements,"" concludes Jonathan Mihy."
Collcap draws on expertise from Mexico and South Korea with new packaging solutions,"Collcap Packaging, a supplier of primary packaging for perfumery and cosmetic brands, located in northwest England, has a new supply partnership with the Mexican manufacturer Olan, becoming the exclusive European supplier of Olan's products. Olan have over 50 years' experience in the industry manufacturing specialist fragrance and lotion pumps. Collcap thus aims to serve to the European market with competitively priced high-end components. In addition, Collcap is the exclusive European distributor of Samhwa, supplying airless pumps and packaging systems, one of the industry's leading manufacturers based in South Korea. Having recently returned from visiting the region, European Account Manager Dave Cobley told Premium Beauty News that the time spent in Korea was invaluable, especially in experiencing firsthand the market trends in the region. ""Many brands from the premium to mass market are now using airtight compacts to hold liquid BB and CC creams, protecting their advanced, lighter formulas, and we can see this trend emerging in the mid/premium sector across Europe. Samhwa's patented bi-injected sealing mechanism and established expertise can only help Collcap's growth in this market."" These findings in South Korea have contributed towards the inclusion of a rectangular compact to Samhwa's airless collection, to be launched at the end of 2013. The current range of airtight compacts is already proving hugely popular in the Korean and Japanese markets and is suitable for solid or liquid bulk formulations, in 10 or 15ml capacity. Samhwa and Collcap also offer a range of specialist dual chamber airless pump packaging which meet the demand for separated products within the same pack. With these investments, Collcap plan to answer the growing demand for airless products. Beyond those distribution partnerships, with 20 years' experience in the cosmetics industry, Collcap offers full-service, bespoke and standard packaging solutions. With its in-house design team and 3D printer (Stratasys Objet) Collcap also manufactures working prototypes in plastic resin, which provide results close to the final product in glass or plastic. This industry-leading investment allows customers to view their concept before manufacturing commences. With a turnover of over 12.6 million pounds in 2012, the business created by John McDermott in 1993 has grown rapidly, and now serves many international brands, including renowned perfumer Clive Christian for whom they supplied No1, ""the world's most expensive fragrance."" Collcap has offices in England and China (Shenzhen and Shanghai), Taiwan, France and in Hong Kong."
Louvrette about to celebrate its fiftieth anniversary,"Premium Beauty News - You are probably one of the oldest companies in the sector in Germany. For years you have been highly specialized in the manufacture of packaging for the make-up industry. Today you are concentrating more on skincare products. Lyne Hélène Bouchard - That's right! One can even say that this is the last year we will be manufacturing make-up cases, which have, as you know, contributed to establish the notoriety of Louvrette for decades. A renewed focus, which now dates back to several years and which has been strengthened this year with our new Managing Partner Fabian Erlhöfer, given the predominant part the skincare sector now represents in our customer portfolio. The ""jar"" alternative was clearly chosen twenty years ago. Three years ago, we decided to set foot on the market of airless packaging in partnership with the Megaplast and Gaplast companies. Aside from that we also sell bottles and all their complementary accessories (caps, closures, etc...). Premium Beauty News - Your Company will turn fifty next year. The opportunity to announce new investments? People talk of 3 million euros. Lyne Hélène Bouchard - That is true and we are quite proud of that. By a happy coincidence, we will also take the opportunity to launch a series of investments. This will firstly concern a significant expansion of the factory in April 2014 (+ 2,500 sqm on two levels). A surface extension that will take place in two stages. A first stage, which will enable to create a new storage area and to install four additional injection presses and a second stage to install new production machines, some injection presses and more importantly, the integration of our decorations workshop for our packages. In total, we will have in the end more than 30 injection machines. But what is also important is the technological shift Louvrette took several months ago. A shift that materialized upstream by acquiring new digital high-precision machines for the design of our moulds and at the same time, the intend to focus increasingly more on the manufacturing of PET packaging with thicker walls (9,5 to 13mm), for jars, making them more suitable for the conditioning of next generation cosmetics. So far, our jars were mostly designed in SAN, PP, SMMA, with PET only representing 5% of our products. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, let's talk about your products! An important share of your production is dedicated to airless packaging. Lyne Hélène Bouchard - However, jars remain one of our main assets. Jars even became airless since we have been offering for the past months a jar of this type with an inner pocket, always in partnership with Megaplast and Gaplast. But there is more to it. We constantly offer new standard lines also including blow moulded bottles. We offer both standard and custom-designed solutions. We provide a complete solution from the concept phase to the product launch. Our team manages the design, product development with 3D technical drawings, prototyping, tool making and in-house manufacturing. Our jars are available in sizes ranging from 5 to 200 ml. In 2011, we actually developed the Airless Regula Prestige jar. With its bag-in-bottle technology it offers maximum product safety. 15, 30 and 50ml airless bottles are also available. 150, 200, 250 and 400ml bottles are also available in HDPE (glossy or satin-finish) or in co-extrusion with a soft-touch surface. They are complemented by single or two-part caps, functional closures (Disc and flip tops) as well as lotion and spray pumps for which we specially developed high-class caps. Premium Beauty News - France is one of your main markets? Lyne Hélène Bouchard - Just behind Germany, that right. But we have operations throughout Europe and we are starting to develop ourselves in the United States, Asia and Russia."
The Ileos group about to cross the 450 million euro line in sales sales in 2014?,"Premium Beauty News - Your Group posted a turnover of 320 million euros end of 2011 and you are forecasting 450 million by 2014! Pierre Hémar - But don't get me wrong! We are not generating revenues for the sake of it. All the acquisitions and productive investments we have been making for nearly two years and that we will be announcing shortly, fall in line with the broad range of businesses of Ileos. The Group has a past and present history. We are building the history to come. Premium Beauty News - In terms of productive investments, you have made several announcements... Pierre Hémar - We are focusing our efforts this year on our French site in Guidel where the plant will benefit from an extension of more than 2,000 sqm and from the installation of a first lacquering/metallization line, which should be running at the beginning of next year. Thus, we wanted first to provide more added value and responsiveness to our customers by enhancing our closure and capping solutions. In Spain, we have engaged ourselves in a ""breaking ground investment"", with the construction of a new plant equipped with a new automatic anodizing line, to be operational in the third quarter 2014. Again, the industrial strategy was to support our customers in achieving more complex products and with increasingly shorter deadlines, to achieve a differentiating packaging for consumers. In China, we are going to diversify a production, so far largely dedicated to lipstick tubes, to other areas in skincare and perfumes. Don't forget that, thanks to this Chinese production tool, Axilone was able to gain a 20% market share in lipsticks in just a few years' time. In addition to this, there is a permanent challenge driving us in the face of rising costs and the growing strength of the local currency: increase automation and improve productivity, which are clearly top priorities in China. Premium Beauty News - A word on the cardboard activity? Pierre Hémar - Our goal is to bring to a completion what we started, by grouping together Packetis and Alliora in order to create an entity capable of serving a very wide scope of customers from the pharmaceutical to the luxury sector, including both spirits in perfumes. A special effort was undertaken to pool the good manufacturing practices of both companies, and to capitalize on their respective expertise: the quality and diversity of the cardboard's finishing steps for Alliora, and the mastery in standards and pharmaceutical processes for Packetis. The commercial effort is also coordinated to better serve customers in skincare who have expectations on this whole spectrum of expertise. Premium Beauty News - And in terms of acquisitions, you made major moves... Martin Haye - Absolutely the end of 2012 was particularly active, with two acquisitions in the United States, and Brazil. In the United States, you followed our acquisition of the company Le Papillon ($ 60 million in sales, two production sites in New Jersey, 120 staff), the U.S. leader in perfume unidoses. This acquisition, carried out by our Bioplan division strengthens our leadership in the market of perfume samples. This movement definitely establishes the international presence of Bioplan, which has steadily expanded its international network, since the acquisition of Socopol (Poland) in 2007, and that of Mappel (Brazil) in 2011 and 2012, Premium Beauty News - And South America, precisely? Martin Haye - You know that our presence in South America began in July 2011 with a majority stake taken in Mappel a Brazilian company, specialized in the manufacture and packaging of health care products. It is clear that this presence in Brazil, with Mappel – a leader in its market, and with 230 employees in two production sites in Sao Paolo – opens many opportunities for development locally. End of 2012, the group completed its takeover by acquiring the remaining shares to its founder and CEO, and by appointing the General Manager of Biopack, at the head of the company. We now have full powers to push further the company on a market full of promises. Pierre Hémar - I must add that the South American continent remains a strategic area for the Group. We are currently considering other avenues of diversification, for a number of our divisions, in both the cardboard and metal & plastic sector. Unfortunately, it is too early to say more, but the Group has demonstrated that it knew how to deal with both organic and external growth. Besides, Oaktree, the investment fund is in line with our strategy and is fully supporting us with our very aggressive approach, which has been the Group's spearhead for several years now. Martin Haye - We can however tell you we are on the verge of finalizing an acquisition in the United States, which could be announced very shortly!"
CEP Cosmétique signs a representation agreement in Asia with Yoshida,"On the occasion of this agreement, the leaders of the two companies, Géry Dambricourt, owner and CEO of CEP, and Yuzo Yoshida, President of Yoshida, declared that this agreement had been all the more possible thanks to the fact that both companies shared the same values in their desire to innovate and to focus their successful development on research. Officials at Yoshida are convinced that this new range of injected sampling tubes will enjoy a great success in Asia where this market is still predominantly in the hands of manufacturers of traditional sachet-type samplers. On the side of CEP Cosmétique, people say that this partnership will obviously help strengthen its international development. ""It is a first step,"" officials say on both sides. ""Further developments in common are possible!"" It may be recalled that the turnover of Yoshida, a family business, will exceed this year US$ 180 million and has a record of a number of major developments in injection and decoration processes. The latest to date, Plaglass™, its flagship product, developed with the Du Pont Group and which enables to design an overmoulded bottle that looks like glass, and most of all, enables to vary the shapes while perfectly protecting the sandwiched printing. A Group also specialized in the production of flexible tubes and who has recently invested in a new filling unit in Shizuoka. A Group, finally, who plans to set up a new industrial facility in Southeast Asia next year. The CEP group (€ 36 million in sales), also family owned, now consists of three separate entities: CEP Cosmétique(16 million in sales broken down between injected and extruded tubes, and capsules – for jars and bottles - with a high added value in terms of decoration and assembly), CEP Agriculture (injected products for the garden and nurseries) and CEP Office Solutions (storage accessories for office use). CEP Cosmétique, who took on June 11, this year, the reins of the Plastitube factory in Bayonne, previously owned by the Soupletube Group and who was put into receivership a few months ago. The factory located in Thiers, in the Auvergne region, houses thirty injection presses, including five bi-injection presses and several ""in-house processes"" for the assembling and decoration of capsules, not to mention three offset printing machines, two screen printing machines dedicated to the decoration of tubes with a diameter of 16 and 19, and an ""in-house-designed"" line dedicated to the screen printing and hot stamping of tubes with a diameter of 30 and 35. It was recently granted the ISO 22716 certification (Good Manufacturing Practices)."
"""Arcade and Carestia are very complementary,"" Philippe Ughetto, Arcade Europe","Premium Beauty News - Arcade already owns production sites in North America, Brazil and China. The acquisition of Carestia allows you to get hold of the industrial tool you were looking for in Europe? Philippe Ughetto - A major trend in the market is the globalization of brands. We have anticipated this for several years already and we are supporting our customers by exporting our expertise, as close as possible to the markets where they invest and grow, especially in Latin America and Asia. Thus, in addition to North America, our area of origin, we have production sites in Brazil and China. We are present in Brazil since 1999, and run locally two production lines dedicated to samples for the perfume, skincare and make-up sectors. We have made significant investments in 2012 to equip this industrial tool with all the technology we usually offer our clients. As for China, we have operations on this market since 2011 with a production site in Wujiang in the Jiangsu Province, dedicated to skincare and make-up. The acquisition of Carestia is also part of this approach, but not only. What we are seeking first, is to develop a product portfolio very complementary to ours and with a true international potential. Premium Beauty News - You are still planning to use Carestia's production tool? Philippe Ughetto - Yes, we are currently studying the implementation of the industrial synergies. This represents advantages in terms of logistics and customer proximity. But the acquisition of Carestia does not limit itself to the purchase of an industrial plant in France, the land of perfumes. For us, Carestia also holds a remarkable know-how with a corporate philosophy very close to ours: high quality products for upscale markets and customers looking for exceptional products. Carestia has a unique expertise in the manufacture of fragrance strips, blotter cards and even in the printing of small formats. The company also has an extensive know-how for all specific and highly specialized hand-made projects. Carestia's range of products is very complementary to the one of Arcade and there are many synergies to set up. Carestia generates today most of its turnover in France and Europe. We are going to use our commercial force for their product portfolio and offer it to our international clients, particularly in North America. For the time being we are in an integration phase. The project should be fully deployed in the course of 2014."
"""Innovate means taking risks,"" Valérie Pasmanian, Artistic-Director, Designer","A stakeholder and an attentive and passionate observer of the world of luxury and creation, Valérie Pasmanian has learned a lot from her encounters with remarkable and sometimes atypical personalities from the world of perfumery and cosmetics. But she has always kept an eclectic look, by increasing her areas of interest and projects. ""My first years dedicated to pure prospective have taught me to immerse myself in all the trends, go find fractures where others only see fads"". Alongside Vera Strubi and Marielle Belin, she appreciates the spirit of cooperation, the versatility and responsiveness of the small team of the Parfums Thierry Mugler. She works on both packaging projects, POS materials and press kits. ""This is where I discovered that innovation was vital to a brand,"" she explains, ""but also that innovation meant taking risks"". A spirit of innovation, the true leitmotif of a team that was then playing the role of a challenger, in the face of brands with much more significant resources. ""Everyone remembers the launch of eco-source perfumes that have revolutionized the relationship with the brand and the bottle. We were proposing at the time an exceptional but expensive bottle and it was not reasonable to ask customers to just throw it away and buy a new one at each end of use. Hence the idea of proposing to refill it in the outlet. This was the idea of Vera Strübi, but no one had ever done that before. And the beginnings were difficult. Technically speaking, it took three generations of sources to make them fully reliable."" But still today, the brand appears as a pioneer in the field. Art director and freelance designer for over ten years, Valérie Pasmanian is at the heart of creative developments in the world of beauty and luxury. Paradoxically, she says, the acceleration of launches was not followed by an equally marked acceleration of innovation. ""What made most progress first was a shorter time-to-market, which made possible the development of the full service offer and which also helped stimulate it,"" she explains. And creation did not escape this phenomenon. ""The designer himself is increasingly in demand for turnkey projects. This changes the way of working. You must have a multitude of readily available projects. The encounter between a creator, a designer and a project has become increasingly rare, except for high end projects, who still favour singularity."" The phenomenon was also accentuated by the growing number of standards available on the market and the increase in their quality. ""If you combine to that, the vast array and the increasing variety of customization possibilities, you finally manage to play your cards well and propose small series with a level of quality, which would have been impossible to achieve just a few years ago. I think this contributes a lot to the development of niche brands in perfumery."" For Valérie Pasmanian, the other major change in the job of a designer concerns technological changes. ""At every level technological breakthroughs are considerable. Today, the materials available to manufacture a packaging have increased. Oil is no longer the unavoidable resource. We can even use flexible solar panels, we can imagine all kinds of packaging decorations for products with a new type of functional packaging."" But not everything can immediately be transposable, technology needs to mature, especially for a relatively conservative industry like the beauty industry. ""Those who will manage to adapt these innovations to the luxury and beauty codes will keep their businesses on the leading edge."" Especially since all these changes occur in a society unsure about its future. ""More than a crisis, it is a mutation towards other systems that we are experiencing. The population is aging, the purchasing power is declining in developed countries, and there are increasing inequalities."" Innovation and marketing must logically integrate these new parameters, ""take into account the actual needs, of the sacrifices that consumers are ready to make, of choices they will make."" Although the situation is well known, Valérie Pasmanian considers that few conclusions have been drawn from it. ""For example, with the advent of the internet, what explains that products sold online are available in the same packaging than those sold in stores? Is it necessary, is it legitimate, is it wise?"" Relevant questions and answers which are far from simple. ""Design is a bugbear. The product must be beautiful, but not too expensive, technically feasible and as clean as possible..."" For her, ""a synergy and cooperation between all stakeholders,"" are the most effective ways to solve this equation."
Lindal aims at eliminating the need for overcap with new actuator,"The Lindal Group, a global developer and manufacturer of valves, actuators and spray caps for aerosol products used in pharmaceutical, cosmetics and food applications, recently launched a new twist-lock, overcap-free actuator that it claims to represent an appealing new alternative for makers of deodorants and antiperspirants, sun protection and self-tanning products and more. ""The Sunny actuator's attractive, ergonomic design was developed for easy actuation and high top-load resistance, for use in a wide range of personal care product applications. The actuator is already winning the attention of savvy brand owners, and a major retail launch is imminent,"" the company says. The actuator is produced at the new Itupeva facility in Sao Paulo, Brazil, that Lindal inaugurated at the beginning of the year. ""Here is the first example of how our custom-built, expandable new facility can benefit customers throughout the hemisphere and around the globe. And in emerging markets, where rising local market consumer spending power will boost demand for personal care products and innovative aerosol packaging solutions, our offerings will have particular appeal,"" said Moacir Camargo, Lindal Brazil's Managing Director. The Lindal Group earned Unilever's Partner to Win Award for Winning Innovation, at the company's largest-ever supplier summit, held in Singapore. Lindal was awarded for co-developing the aerosol valve that allows product concentration in the Sure, Dove and Vaseline brand deodorants."
The new ambitions in tubes of CEP Cosmétique after the take-over of Plastitube,"The interest of the CEP Group in the segment of cosmetic packaging actually started in 1990, when Géry Dambricourt, owner and CEO of CEP for only five years, decided to acquire a unit specializing in the manufacture of capsules. The company, which developed at the time the famous bi-injected capsule for Vichy's face care range in jars (Liftactiv-Neovadiol). In 1993, the first research work was carried out on the manufacture of an injected tube. The same year, a brand new factory dedicated to the cosmetic packaging activity was built in Thiers. The CEP Group currently consists of three distinct entities, CEP Cosmétique (with the CEP Industrie and the CEP Tubes entities), CEP Agriculture (injected products for gardening and/or agriculture) and CEP Office Solutions (storage accessories for office use). Total turnover, 29 million euros for a staff of 210. The factory of CEP Cosmétique, located in Thiers, in the Auvergne region, owns thirty injection presses, including four bi-injection presses and several ""in-house processes"" for the assembling and decoration of capsules, not to mention three offset printing machines, two screen printing machines dedicated to the decoration of tubes with a diameter of 16 and 19, and an impressive ""in-house-designed"" line dedicated to the screen printing and hot stamping of tubes with diameters of 30 and 35. Latest innovations of the past two years include: atwo-piece mini-mascara/sample, and the ""Minicep"" a new single material breakable tube/sample, which is resealable and claims to be as competitive as a sachet. And finally a new HDPE injected tube, and no longer with linear LDPE, developed in 2010 and marketed in 2011, and which has the advantage of offering exactly the same properties as extruded tubes in terms of flexibility and barrier properties. ""As soon as the Soupletube Group started stating last March, that it would separate itself from the Plastitube factory, we rapidly got interested in it and built a project after several site visits,"" detailed officials at the CEP. ""The decision to take over the Plastitube factory was not easy: this plant had cruelly been lacking industrial investments in recent years to adapt to global competition in the area of the production of tubes, and we had to undertake an in-depth restructuring of the company to start on good bases. But on the other hand, this tool does exist and many professional skills are attached to it."" Managers at the CEP believe that development prospects are real. Firstly, there is a perfect complementary in the Tube supply between the CEP's injected range and the range of extruded tubes at the Bayonne factory. CEP is now in a position to offer a complete range of tubes, ranging from Ø16 to Ø56, in all lengths, with an offset, screen printed, MAC or labelled decoration, in mono-extrusion and co-extrusion, and with different cappings. The respective client portfolios are complementary, and that was a good surprise too. Our first challenge was to reconfigure the organization of production to be able to produce the same number of tubes as before. Indeed, CEP has acquired 100% of Plastitube's customers, markets and commitments. A month later, this first challenge has been successfully met, even if the schedule will remain tight until the end of August. To support this reorganization, we will make some investments, as of this fall, to automate a number of tasks and standardize the production lines. The aim of CEP is to constantly provide real breakthrough innovations in the tube area. The technical limitations of the injected tube were impeding us, and we are now going to be able to make great strides in some areas, by bringing together the extrusion skills of the teams in Bayonne and the know-how in injection of the CEP at Thiers. Our first three main axes are: provide solutions on issues regarding barrier properties and preservation following the gradual phasing out of preservatives; offer innovative and competitive solutions in the delivery/restitution of creams (interaction between the skirt and the head of the tube); propose alternative materials, in particular bio-based ones."
"Yoshida: ""Do what nobody else can and do what nobody else will""!","Premium Beauty News - We can feel that you want to raise the plastic injection business to the level of a true industrial craftsmanship. Yuzo Yoshida - Plastic moulding and decoration that extend the freedom of product design. This is our business domain. Ever since the establishment of Yoshida Seisakusyo in 1946, we have continued to take on challenges with the spirit of ""CHALLENGE what nobody else can"" and ""DO what nobody else will"". Before we knew it, many of the requests that came to us began to be ""what other companies can't"" and ""what the world has not yet challenged"". Our history is about the history of the challenges we took on together with our customer designers and developers. And we are determined to never stop the wheel of development. I can tell to all designers and developers: ""Let us challenge your difficult requests"". Premium Beauty News - Your Group was the first company in the world to develop the in-mould technology (widely known as In-Mould Decoration) consisting in moulding and decorating a product at the same time. Yuzo Yoshida - Absolutely. We were probably the first in the world to properly master this in-mould decoration technique, but it is not the only one. For the layman, we can recall what the main key advantages of this technique are: In-Mould Decoration is performed by inserting an ink decorated foil into the mould at the time of plastic injection moulding. Compared to the standard method where the product is printed or painted after the moulding is completed, you are able to get a finished part with a single process, shorten the lead time and improve the yield rate. The front and back sides of a product can be decorated at once by placing two foils in the mould so that they sandwich the product (Double Sided In-Mould Decoration). By injecting transparent plastic into the mould, a thickness is created between the designs of the front and back foil, creating a design with a three dimensional image. There is also a method for combining different materials, by pushing out aluminium plates within the mould and performing injection moulding at the same time. By integrating metal and resin, the product gains a luxurious metallic image. The Deep Draw In-Mould Decoration has also been developed by our Group with the original invention of a unique mould design and foil structure so that in-mould is even possible on curved surfaces and box-like (3D) deep drawn forms. In the past, In-Mould Decoration with thin walls was thought to be impossible. However, by improving mould design, developing a special foil and coming up with a new method for moulding, we have also been able to realize thin wall In-Mould Decoration. Making the products thinner and lighter will also lead to the saving of resources. The same way, The Mask Mould technology realizes what was not possible before; the decorating ""deep drawn"" formed products with patterned design. This process is achieved by inserting the preformed decorative sheet and moulding of pneumatically moulded objects. The entire surface will be beautifully enveloped with a design that cannot be expressed with just the painting or printing of flat surfaces. We have also a technology called ""DIP"" which is for directly printing digital data such as photos and illustrations onto the surface of plastic products. Printing is possible on not only flat surfaces but also slightly curved surfaces. What we call the ""Dichroic Decoration"" is a type of deposition that decorates a product with layers of thin films that change colour according to the angle at which it is viewed. Finally you should know that the standard transfer foils and foils for In-Mould Decoration can be created with the ink-jet printer. Full-colour foils can be instantly created without making plates; therefore it is possible to actually check the samples of the transferred design ideas and prepare original transfer foils for extremely small lots. Premium Beauty News - All the most sophisticated injection techniques are part of Yoshida's assets! Yuzo Yoshida - We can say that we master all of them. For example, in the case of Multiple Moulding, the first and second mould with different colours are moulded into one. This technology can be used to combine transparent resin and opaque resin for expressing designs with depth. In the case of Marble Moulding, this technology is for the simultaneous injection moulding of 2 or more types of resin, of different materials or colours. A variety of marbled patterns can be created according to the design. In the case of ""Thick Wall Moulding"", Products with thickness are moulded by using the Multiple Moulding or hot runner technology. Finally in the case of our Plaglass™ technology, by over moulding blow moulded bottles with a heavy copolymer thickness, the inside and outside of a container can be of different forms. Resulting in the creation of bottle containers with the luxurious look of glass. Premium Beauty News - Yoshida's third strong point, closing techniques, especially for make-up cases. Yuzo Yoshida - That's right. And we received many awards for it, with for example, our YK-Hook system, which enables to open a case using one finger only. The assumption that compact cases could only be opened with both hands was shattered by the development of this case. But we have also worked a lot on airtight compact cases. A functional airtight compact case that prevents highly volatile contents from evaporating. This case is being widely adopted by many of the world's leading cosmetic companies. We also behind the creation of a special net that acts as an inner lid placed over the refill content in the compact case. This allows you to take the proper amount of powder foundation with the puff, without scattering it all over the place. Finally, we have developed a case that opens by pressing on the sides. This button-less compact case has the mechanism of the lid opening when it is squeezed from both sides. This uniquely designed case is very easy to use. Premium Beauty News - Today the ""beauty"" sector is the main activity of Yoshida? Yuzo Yoshida - The cosmetic sector accounts for about 65% of our revenue, the rest comes from telephony. The make-up sector in the broad sense is by far our largest market closely followed by skin-care. We mustn't forget also our activity in flexible tubes (35 million per year), which is significant and represents a growing sector. Actually, we are also currently investing in a tube filling unit in Shizuoka. Concerning this subject, we can say a word about our Tri-chambered Tube. One or two inner tubes are inserted inside the outer tube. This prevents the outer tube from deforming and maintains the appearance of the tube while the content is being consumed. Premium Beauty News - You have already mentioned in the past your intention to expand internationally. Yuzo Yoshida - Japan still remains our largest market, absorbing 80% of our business but due to the fact that this local market is aging and contracting, we are forced to turn more and more to other countries. The United States have become important but also Europe including France and, of course, China. An effort that concerns not only our business strategy but also our industrial strategy. I can already announce the construction of a new Yoshida factory in South East Asia for next year."
Procos aims its production to be 100% FSC® certified,"Specialising in perfumery and cosmetics, fashion, decoration, jewellery, wines and spirits, Procos provides a wide range of promotional packaging goods (paper bags and boxes). Its tailor-made production methods have made it a valuable partner for luxury brands. The company, which is headquartered in Munich, in Germany, has two sales offices, one Paris, France, and the other in La Jolla, in California, USA. All the production is made in China, through a local joint venture and industrial partners. ""For certain limited edition customer requests (under 1,000 units) for product launches or special events, we may call upon our European partners for the manufacturing process,"" says Leander Kritokos, founder and president. Over the years, Procos has been working on the development of more and more eco-friendly products. Thus, the company has offered since 2017 a so-called Greenline, fully eco-designed at ""a price almost identical"" to a traditional bag. For instance, Procos recently developed a paper bag for the German brand of natural cosmetics, Dr. Hauschka. Attention was paid to the environment at every stage of the production process: starting with the choice of materials (FSC® certified paper), though printing with soy based inks and assembling with mineral glue, and the use of renewable materials for the finishing touches. The aim of the company is to produce 100% of its bags from FSC® certified paper. ""Our goal is to develop production methods and tools allowing us to make high-end products, while decreasing our environmental footprint,""adds Leander Kritikos. ""It is really a huge challenge in the current economical, where there is a strong pressure on prices and the need to reduce production costs,"" he concludes."
"Lumson: innovation, the mainstay","Premium Beauty News - A few words on Lumson? Matteo Moretti - Since 1975, we design, develop, produce and customize packaging solutions (mostly ""standard"") for the cosmetic market. We offer all possible solutions in glass or plastic, whether they are bottles, jars, pumps, caps, closures, etc. Our main asset is to control the whole production chain, from moulds to bottles including pumps, plus all the decoration techniques. Thus, it all started in 1995 when we decided to design and produce our first cosmetic pump from scratch. In 1998, we got the ISO 9001-2000 certification. And in 2009 we devised our famous ""TAG"" concept. The first airless system integrated in a glass bottle. Then in 2011 the PMP Ltd Company joined us and in 2012 we obtained the ISO 14001 certification. Premium Beauty News - TAG is THE turning point for Lumson. From where/who came up the idea? Matteo Moretti - I must admit.... it came from me! The principle may seem simple, but it's not! However, I will remain voluntarily discreet. The system is patented and, as you know, no one is allowed to visit our workshop. However, I can tell you about the many advantages offered by the system. It is of course completely airless and enables an exceptionally high evacuation rate. It works perfectly with highly viscous formulations. The filling system, from the top, is quick and easy and requires no special tooling. All the glass finishing techniques are possible. The plastic part can be easily separated from the glass part which allows having a fully recyclable packaging. The pump works in all positions (360°). Premium Beauty News - In any case, the success is the one expected, with a series of launches. Matteo Moretti - It is true! Many cosmetic brands have trusted us. The latest to date, La Roche Posay. For its product ""Substiane Serum +"", the company chose a 30ml glass bottle with an inner white coating (Glass Enhancer finish), a UV matt silver metalized pump and a white actuator, topped with a transparent cap. I can also tell you about the new remodelling serum that reshapes facial contours by the Elemis company who chose a bottle with a dark grey coating to achieve a metal finish and create a play of light and reflections with the décor made from silkscreened white enamel. Premium Beauty News - What are the next steps for Lumson? Matteo Moretti - We are of course working on several important projects. What I can tell you today is that make-up is a very important subject for us and that we will very shortly introduce new concepts."
Covit: 350 million pieces per year,"""With over 150 years of experience in the stamping of metallic parts, and thanks to this new automatic anodizing line, we can support our customers in their packaging development projects, offering a standard range but that we can customize,"" explains Joan Quintana, Research and Development Coordinator. ""Covit, he insists, has been known for long years on the cosmetics and perfumes market but is still often considered as a supplier of standard pieces, which is not the case anymore!"" Covit's workshop now has 36 fully checked transfer presses. The firm employs 150 staff highly specialized in designing parts for perfumery and cosmetics. ""Our teams, the company claims, can develop customized products as well as new concepts for sectors that innovate constantly, such as the makeup one."" So, what is Covit's secret asset? Maybe the fifteen engineers of the R&D and development departments who, among other things, have been working over the past two years at improving the surface and the touching sensation of pieces, in order to avoid the polishing step. Covit can now offer complex parts with different plates, stripes, geometric shapes while offering various finishing options such as pad printing, screen printing, varnishing or painting and laser. Or maybe, the company's secret asset is its state-of-the-art laboratory! A laboratory that has been working mainly on the reduction the range of colours to ensure a better stability during the process. In 2012, Covit generated an EBITDA of EUR 800,000. ""Many of our competitors would be glad to display similar positive results!"" No wonder that the company sees the future with optimism: ""We have made the demonstration that we can develop innovative products for the perfume industry, as shown by our recent launches: Couleur by Kenzo, L'eau des Merveilles and L'Ambre des Merveilles by Hermes, Dior Homme and Dior Homme Intense, by Dior, and also La Petite Robe Noire, by Guerlain, Amber for Men, by Prada and My Givenchy Dream, by Givenchy."" So, what's the future for Covit? To strengthen its position in selective perfumery but also to its ability to offer its innovations capabilities to skin care, but also make-up brands."
"Qualipac: export the ""Made in France"" know how!","Premium Beauty News - Indicators are all green? Pierre Marand - They are for the time being! We achieved a good 2012 year, both in Europe and Asia not to mention Brazil. On the latter continent, our growth even exceeded 15%. Premium Beauty News - A growth driven in particular by the perfume industry where you have, it seems, significantly increased your presence? An area that remains predominant at Qualipac, followed by make-up? Pierre Marand - Absolutely! It is clear, for example, that Qualipac's performances in Brazil were largely due to this growth in fragrances. More globally, our industrial know-how (plastic injection/zamac and aluminium) and our ability to innovate have also greatly contributed to this. A know-how that we keep on strengthening with new investments (capacity and productivity). Our plant in Brazil has also benefited from heavy investments with an increase in the surface area of more than 15%. China was not left out in terms of capacity building since we started both a new injection and assembly workshop in June 2012 and we are in the process of building a new facility dedicated to the local market to host injection, decoration, and assembly lines. The new plant will help improve our ability to serve our key customers. Premium Beauty News - You did say a factory for the ""local"" market? Pierre Marand - We strive to offer the same quality of service to our customers, regardless of their location and reach. It makes no doubt that Qualipac can take advantage of a ""Made in France"" know-how and we are eager to promote it with major players in the Chinese market. Our choice of proximity is reassuring for those customers. They trust our ability to help them develop their brands. Premium Beauty News - The products you manufacture in China are not only intended for China? Pierre Marand - It's true! We manufacture in Asia, a lot of the packs intended for the make-up industry, thus allowing us to supply Europe but also the United States. We have the huge advantage of being present industrially everywhere to best meet the needs of our customers, whether they are global or local. Premium Beauty News - The watchword at Qualipac seems to be ""innovation""! Pierre Marand - Actually this word is the mainstay of our strategy. To, according to our motto, ""make the dreams of our customers come true,"" the choice is simple: ""Be the best in terms of innovation."" This means both in terms of ""talented people"", Research, technical and industrial capacity, flexibility, responsiveness, service. A whole array where each stage is essential. Innovation – an approach which is in line with the spirit of collaboration of the other Divisions of the Pochet Group –, today is a strategic focus of our development. Several joint projects are being rolled out and should, in the short and medium term, significantly change the sensory perception of perfume, skin care and make-up. Premium Beauty News - Some examples of recent launches to which Qualipac took part? Pierre Marand - Among recent, current and future product launches to which we collaborated we can mention: – The collection of cases Hypnôse Doll Eyes designed by Alber Elbaz for Lancôme with specific decorations using the Speed Picture technique. These palettes and eyeshadows are also fitted for the first time, with magnetic applicators produced by Priminter (launch scheduled on June 15, 2013). – The aluminium cap of Gentlemen Only topped with the engraved Givenchy logo. – The new tassels in zamac and enamel of Paco Rabanne's Black XS Lxcès line – The Encounter caps for Calvin Klein and Pink Friday by Nicki Minaj and those of Carbon by Eudora for O Boticario, the first fragrance development of our Brazilian site Ipel, which was awarded a ""Prêmio Embalagem Marca."" To note that with Génifique Yeux Light-pearl, Lancôme has completely redesigned its eye care application and we were chosen to work on the development of this innovation. The challenge was to integrate to the cap a special applicator with a functional and high-tech tip, designed in the same material as surgical tools. This Light-Pearl applicator required an attachment system that would be both flexible and resistant: – Flexible to facilitate the massaging gesture over the entire eye contour area with a 50° rotation angle; – Resistant, to guarantee the user a perfect hold of the pearl on its axis. The interactivity between Lancôme and our teams for the development of the applicator, enabled to achieve the level of precision and perfection set by the brand. These examples of launches allow me to conclude by stressing on a key point of our positioning: We are clearly operating in the prestige segment and intend remaining there. It's in our DNA."
Marcel Franck wants to support the development of high end niche perfumery,"Great-grand-son of Léopold Franck, the founder of the company, and grand-son of Marcel Franck, the man who developed it and helped it to thrive, Bernard Dennery is taking up today, alongside his own children, the challenge of giving a new lease of life to this emblematic company which has long been the leader in luxury sprays. In the early twentieth century, the Marcel Franck Company, established in Paris in 1882, provided its sprays to perfumers like Molinard, Worth or Orsay and its frames to glassmakers like Baccarat, Saint Louis, Galle and Lalique. But the brand was also well known to elegant Parisian, and even New York women, who appreciated its chic and practical bottles and sprays, ideal for their favourite perfumes, and which they purchased directly. Very active until the late 1970s, the company, however, was unable to cope with the sector's increasing industrialization, to the competition from mass-produced mechanical pumps or that of standard sprays, and ceased all activities in 2001. ""Today, the development of premium niche fragrances and the trend towards limited luxury editions, allow us to consider the renewal of the brand,"" explains Dennery, who bets on a high-end positioning and on the use of luxurious materials (brass, possibly coated with electroplated palladium or gold). ""We wish to support brands with rare and high quality perfume brands in their search for exclusivity, particularly through the creation of luxury sprays capable of enchanting the eye, while jealously preserving quality juices,"" he adds. Hence, the trademarks and models of the Marcel Franck Company were registered again and the activity relaunched in 2011. This is how Escale, an emblematic model of the brand, originally created in 1935, was brought up to date with the technical assistance of university partners and the competitive cluster of the Cosmetic Valley who approved the project. If the exterior design of the initial spray was used, the entire internal mechanism was redesigned using the latest technologies and new materials available, such as ceramic, which enables to guarantee the quality of spraying. The product is 100% made in France. The development of a purse spray is also under way and prototypes should be ready before summer. In the image of the company created in 1882, Marcel Franck not only offers luxury sprays, but also small series of glass bottles. ""These are very high quality bottles, mouth-blown by master glassmakers,"" explains Dennery. These bottles, along with the sprays, target perfume enthusiasts and collectors who wish to own emblematic objects. They will be available in specialized perfumeries among rare fragrances, and Marcel Franck has also relied upon the expertise of Différentes Latitudes, the company run by David Frossard, specializing since 2005 in the distribution of alternative perfume and cosmetic brands in Europe. The offering and the expertise of Marcel Franck also fits into the trend of refillable products which are enjoying an increasing success in the perfume world, and it can also meet the needs of brands launching higher end special operations. Very small runs (100 to 200 pieces) are therefore possible. Dennery believes that ""these luxurious bottles are intended to be kept almost forever to keep the juices successively discovered by perfume lovers."" With prices for sprays and bottles ranging from 500 to 1,000 euros, it is anyway a far cry from mass production. And subcontractors working for Marcel Franck do not come from the perfume sector, they are specialists in luxury lighters and watches, or fine artwork glassmakers, based mainly in France and Italy. Several partners of the company are also part of the list of companies belonging to the ""Living Heritage"" list that distinguishes French companies with outstanding artisan and industrial skills. The revival of Marcel Franck, reflecting the revival of historical French perfume brands, like Lubin or Jovoy is part of a near-craftsmanship-like, very selective and high-end positioning, where the love for beautiful high-tech products is the priority. ""The traditional definition of luxury, in a way"" says smilingly Dennery."
"Geka, sixteen months later!","Premium Beauty News - Can you situate Geka today and give us a rapid summary of the last sixteen months? Jérôme de Prémare - Created in 1925, Geka has always been a pioneer company, specialising in plastic processing for mascara brushes and packaging. Its two production centres of excellence are situated in Bechhofen, Germany and Elgin, Illinois (USA), and we have a sales office base in Paris, France. The Group employs around 650 people worldwide and last year it generated a turnover of around 120 million Euros. We can consider that in the field of mascaras, our worldwide market share is around 30%. Premium Beauty News - At the time of its takeover, 3i published a release stating ""The future growth of Geka will depend on its capacity to innovate and its international expansion"". What decisions have been taken in this direction? Jérôme de Prémare - It is undoubtedly the challenge! Our objective is indeed to reinforce the development of Geka's activities both in Europe and in the USA, but also to expand into new markets, as much in Asia as in South America, specifically in China and Brazil. I can already announce the imminent opening this year of a sales structure in Sao Paulo and our plan is clearly to set up ""Geka do Brazil"" by early 2014! Looking at the innovation side of Geka, it is an essential aspect of our being. Innovation has, and always will be, the genetic factor of the company and we are continually strengthening it. Our objective is to enlarge our portfolio and over 10% of turnover is committed to industrial investments and new product launches. Premium Beauty News - International expansion and reinforcement of the innovation strategy… but not only? Jérôme de Prémare - Yes indeed, it is also the positioning of Geka that we aim to reinforce around the simple notion of being: ""a Global Beauty & Health Packaging Group for complete delivery systems"". It is only through this framework that we can continue to offer our customers the ""agility"" they should expect from us. We are a specialist in the production of packaging and applicators for mascara, be they moulded or twisted, but undeniably, not only this! We are also working on other ""systems"" for other markets and will be in a position to present something more concretely very shortly. Premium Beauty News - One of the major events of 2011 for Geka, was the launch of its filling line in Bechhofen. Is this a growing activity? Jérôme de Prémare - It is a complementary activity which occupies our present filling machine full time and whose growth depends essentially on our customer demand; a demand which continues to develop. In conclusion, 2013 will be an excellent year with a new dynamic integrated throughout the company and the projected achievement of performances announced by Yves Dominioni to the board of directors. Our three year strategy presented in October 2012 is going according to plan with the major priority being to place customer satisfaction at the heart of all our decisions."
Cosfibel launches its first ethical collection,"A global supplier of packaging and merchandising solutions, Cosfibel Premium has a high level of activity in China. Fully aware of the importance to take into account all the issues linked to sustainable development when selecting its suppliers, Cosfibel launched in fall 2012, an ethical sourcing program, which aims at supporting suppliers that employ underprivileged workers for the long term. Cosfibel Premium has entrusted this full-time mission to Ms Laura Moore, who is based in the company's offices in Shenzen, China, and who's going out to the field to meet with all of the players involved. Named CARES, for Cosfibel Actions for Responsible and Ethical Sourcing, the program is based on the idea that everybody has a role to play in the global economy. ""CARES fights for diversity, solidarity and ethics in corporate and business affairs,"" says the group in a release. As of today, Laura Moore met with some 25 factory managers, 6 provinces and 9 governmental agencies with the aim of increasing awareness for this new concept and to identify needy populations. In addition, a monthly newsletter will be published to inform factories on ethical sourcing and a publication will come out every two months to report on projects underway to the group's clients. Actually, CARES is based on three goals: to integrate, train and produce. The first step therefore consists in identifying and integrating handicapped or disadvantaged persons (such as minorities or the elderly). For instance, a new logistics partnership was signed with a ""Social Welfare Enterprise"" - a company whose staff includes 25% handicapped employees. In 2012, suppliers that had attended information and training sessions on this issue hired nine handicapped workers. The long-term goal is to have some 1.5% of factory staff be made up of handicapped individuals [1]. The program also features a series of on-site training sessions to assist the local community. ""For example, training sessions on the use of sewing machines were held to help single mothers in one factory in China. Contacts with local family planning associations will result in numerous similar initiatives in other factories,"" claims Cosfibel. Eventually, the program produce must lead to the production of ""CARES Fair Trade"" collections. The first catalogue of fair trade products has just been published. Designed by Cosfibel Premium's creative team in Paris, the first range of products, including small leather goods, accessories and paper items, is made by small Fair Trade manufacturers in Nepal and India that are opening up to the global market. Furthermore, the catalogue itself was produced by a non-profit Chinese company that employs hard-of-hearing workers. This initiative complement another one already implement the North-Eastern region of Brazil, where Cosfibel Premium has created a partnership with a company that employs social minorities for the production of cases, pouches and bags. Cosfibel will showcase this new ethical collection at Pack & Gift in Paris on 12-13 June, 2013."
Sleever launches its SleeverMakeUp Lipstick solution,"Premium Beauty News - What were the constraints? Éric Fresnel - Propose an attractive packaging design, a faithful reproduction of the lipstick shade and a wide choice of special effects, without forgetting to include some useful tips. An also meet the high expectations of marketing services: Through a faithful reproduction of the lipstick shade, the possibility to work the colour shades and have access to a palette of rich and varied colours, a sharpness of printed details for a perfect readability, a flexibility for multi-references, a broad palette of special effects and the possibility of producing mini-series for consumer tests. On the side of procurement and logistical services constraints were not small either with, in particular, the eternal desire to reduce packaging costs, the constraint on a variable and reduced size of batches, plus a good responsiveness of the supply chain (<3 weeks). Premium Beauty News - To successfully meet this challenge, you had to work on the development of a new film. Éric Fresnel - That's right! And we came up with the C-PET-KG 050, a film that enables the packaging of complex shapes, which has a shrinkage rate of 75% and enables a cost reduction of 15 to 20% (low density, reduced thickness). We optimized the quality of the opening thanks to a controlled ""tearability"" of the film. Its printability, transparency and brightness are perfect and very well adapted to the performance requirements of the machine. Just for the record, the constraints are the following: 360-degree and top-to-bottom decoration printing, the exact duplicate of the lipstick's colour, the possibility of infinite colours and of special effects (soft touch), the use of technical varnishes (bright, pearly, iridescent) and a ""cosmetic-optimized"" opening mode. Premium Beauty News - Did you also have to modify the positioning machine? Éric Fresnel - Yes. The LPK80 is a new equipment which complements the range of SleeverLogicpak machines, perfectly suited to the sleeve positioning and horizontal shrinkage of small containers (pencils, lipsticks, mascaras, creams, nail polishes, ...). The LPK 80 sets a new standard for the make-up industry with an optimized footprint reduced by 50%, very fast format changes of less than 10 minutes, a multi product/formats flexibility (mascaras, pencils, lipsticks, gloss); an ideal machine for end lines with a output of 60 to 80 items per minute, an outstanding ease of use, great ergonomics, accessibility and operator's platform on both sides, drawers for the storing of tools, transparency and the key word, a great versatility."
"Draeger GPP, back at the forefront","He is back! After selling his company to an investment fund in 2006, which in turn sold it in 2008 to the 21 Investimenti investment fund owned by the Benetton family, Piero Capodieci had taken the reins from 2007 to 2011 of Assografici, the Italian Printing and Paper Converting Industries Association. But after the liquidation of the group in April 2012 and an agreement with the unions, the Italian entrepreneur is heading again the GPP Group, whose activity will have finally never ceased, with the aim to redress the balance. ""Our strategy will be the same as when the group was first created. In a sector where there are no real economies of scale during production, or important entry barriers, the competitive advantage comes from purchases. This is why is interesting to have significant volumes. Conversely, value added is found in sectors with moderate volumes. It is therefore interesting to be present in both mass packaging, for volume, and specialities (luxury goods, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, POS materials), for value added,"" says Piero Capodieci. The Draeger Company, founded in 1886 and located in Palaiseau, France, is the mainstay of the Group's high-end production. Since the beginning of 2013, the group has made investments in the refurbishment of the factory and an additional 1.5 million euros is earmarked for the production equipment itself, with the aim of replacing Draeger in the role of major player in the luxury industry that it was still playing in the early 2000s. Hence, significant investments are planned in die-cutting equipment, as well as in machines enabling to produce innovative finishes, offering customers the possibility for a true differentiation (3D effects, hot stamping, plasticizing). ""Beyond machines, we are also investing in people,"" says Capodieci. The will to also capitalize on men was given concrete form in December 2012 with the appointment of Olivier Roussier as Commercial Director of Draeger GPP and Vice President Prestige Sales for the entire GPP group. ""My challenge is of course to reinforce the position of Draeger on the road to its success and development by relying on dynamic and volunteer production, development and commercial teams whose know-how dedicated to the prestige market has remained impressive,"" says Roussier. In the trade since 1992, with an 8 year stint at Nortier and then 12 years at the SPIC (now Edelmann France since 2006), Roussier can rely on his perfect knowledge of the industry and of its players. To successfully achieve his mission, Roussier intends to rely on one of the main assets of the company: flexibility. ""The Draeger factory is located in the suburbs of Paris, close to most brand owners, this is an important advantage in an environment where deadlines are getting shorter and shorter,"" he says. ""In addition, the flexibility of our production tool allows us to offer lead times twice as low as what our competitors offer on average. This enables our customers to reduce their stock levels."" This reactivity can be explained, according to the management team, by the rationalization as much as possible, of flows within the company, and by the internalization of production stages, to avoid back and forth movements with suppliers. The group also has its own design studio in France and Italy. The group is also paying a particular interest in major advances in terms of digital print quality and has a stake in a Hungarian company specialized in this field and in POS material. ""For small series or to achieve a complete differentiation, digital may be of interest,"" emphasises Capodieci. A sign of its desire to re-establish itself in the sector, Draeger GPP will be attending this year both the Gift & Pack and the Luxe Pack Monaco shows."
Metsä Board makes improvements to its folding boxboards,"Metsä Board, Europe's leading producer of fresh forest fibre cartonboards, recently made a series of enhancements to its Avanta Prima, Simcote and Carta Elega folding boxboards. These changes are following technical improvements made at its mills during the 2011-2012 investment programme. ""We are responding to customer needs by making our world class boards even more fit-for-purpose,"" says Pasi Piiparinen, Head of Metsä Board Paperboard. ""Developments include better yield, optimised shades and improved surfaces, according to the requirements of each end-use."" According to Metsä Board, the product enhancements improve the suitability of each cartonboard in the range for a particular packaging end-use such as food; beautycare; healthcare; or luxury packaging and graphics applications. Thus Metsä Board has improved the bulk of its Avanta Prima cartonboard range, meaning a lighter weight can be specified whilst maintaining the same thickness and stiffness. As a result Metsä Board has further light-weighted grammages across the range. Also, this range - which has been developed to meet the requirements of the healthcare market - has been optimised to allow for 2D data matrix coding. Its shade has also been optimised to enhance visual whiteness. Similarly, the shade of Carta Elega has been optimised to enhance its visual whiteness – an important characteristic in the beautycare market. Eventually, the Simcote range, more specifically designed for food packaging, now has improved bulk, thus allowing to light-weight all the grammages across the range, while maintaining the same thickness and stiffness. ""Our customers will be able to utilise an even lighter weight board, achieving the same or even better performance in a finished carton,"" adds Pasi Piiparinen. ""Using a lighter weight board also offers sustainability benefits, as less raw material is used, less weight carried throughout the value chain and less waste is generated."" Metsä Board says the enhanced board range can be ordered starting mid-May, with availability from June 2013."
Kurz France is celebrating its fortieth anniversary!,"A new centre on a covered area of 3,500 sqm including 500 sqm of offices employing forty people, and whose main activity consists in receiving large widths of rolls of foils and to cut them at the size and length required by customers. Walter and Peter Kurz, the owners, have wished to recall all the commitment they had for this French entity whose administrative and sales offices are still located in the heart of Paris, close to the Place de la République. A historical but also economic commitment since Kurz France remains currently the Group's largest subsidiary in Europe. It may be recalled that the Kurz Group currently has nine production facilities located in Europe, Asia and the United States, employs some 4,000 people, has 23 subsidiaries and 70 representations and/or sales offices worldwide. To note also, that the Kurz Group owns companies like PolylC, specialized in polymer electronics, Hinderer + Mühlich, a manufacturer of hot stamping dies and stamping tools, Baier, a manufacturer of stamping machines and OVD Kinegram AG, the global leading manufacturer of optical security elements against counterfeiting and falsification of identity documents and banknotes. The company has recently expanded its range of holographic hot stamping and cold foil range with a new design series featuring lens motifs. These diffractive foils emulate the refraction properties of optical lenses and simulate an extraordinary spatial depth. The lens motif with the special depth effect is available in many different versions. The range includes lens motifs in a wide variety of sizes, as single images or continuous designs, in geometric figures like ovals or rectangles, as well as water drop or heart shaped lens, etc.). There are also designs with oil drops, air bubbles or foam bubbles, and lens shapes that can be combined with other special designs, for example a reptilian pattern. To note again, a new cold transfer foil for UV Offset printing, a foil, which according to Kurz, will set a new standard in terms of quality. The cold stamping foil called Luxor / Alufin KPS-OP provides consistently good results. When it is necessary to apply foil to large areas, the cold foil will achieve uniform coverage. Conversely, when filigree details are required, KPS-OP will produce a high edge definition transfer. Even fine rasters are easy to implement. While it is possible in principle to transfer glossy metallic layers as a raster using the cold-foiling technique, adequate results have only been obtainable in the past for coarser rasters. The cold foil KPS-OP was developed for UV offset printing but is equally suitable for conventional offset printing. It generally adheres equally well to conventional and UV-cured adhesives, and can be overprinted with conventionally drying as well as UV curing inks and lacquers. ""KPS-OP embodies a great deal of development work and accumulated know-how"", explains Dr. Ulrike Plaia, a product manager at Kurz. ""We have put many years of intensive research into cold foiling technology, in close collaboration with machine, adhesive, ink and rubber blanket manufacturers. This new cold foil grade is the result of the cumulative experience we have gained. The users of this product have confirmed that it delivers an excellent print result and a very high gloss level, in particular on flat surfaces. it is uncomplicated to process."" The Luxor/Alufin KPS-OP cold foil is a silver-coloured foil. It can be used to produce a wide variety of metallic colours when overprinted. However, the film can be produced on request in other colours. There is also an identical cold foil grade with a selection of holographic designs. Finally, Kurz engineers have improved their diffractive authenticity feature, Trustseal. They have equipped their OVD (Optical Variable Device) system with new technologies that can only deter the best counterfeiters. This includes not only the lenticular technology and relief and contrast effects, but also hidden features that only become visible at specific viewing angles or under very high magnification. Thanks to the design flexibility and high functional potential of the Trustseal technology, it is possible to continuously integrate new security features into the OVDs, thereby creating an unfamiliar and ever increasingly difficult barrier to counterfeiters. Hence, the new PM Premium technology offers an extremely high level of counterfeit protection. PM Premium is a range of products in which a simulated surface relief is combined with further diffractive elements with transparent areas. The process of partially metalizing image elements poses manufacturing challenges that can only be overcome with specialized know-how."
Aminoplast resins: the proactive strategy of Technicaps,"Premium Beauty News - What finally is a thermosetting resin made of? Jean-Louis Revel - It is mainly made of cellulose originating from managed forests, of urea, which is one of the most widely used fertilizers in the world, of formaldehyde and pigments. Urea is the result of nitrogen and oxygen and formaldehyde originates from natural gas and oxygen. The pigments do not contain heavy metals. Regarding formaldehyde, it occurs naturally in the atmosphere (for the record, the quantity in ppm of formaldehyde present in one of our parts is ridiculously small compared to the amount of formaldehyde present in a pear of pork meat). Formaldehyde is eliminated through decomposition in the air and is biodegradable in the ground or water. Premium Beauty News - Clearly, these different products that enter into the composition of a thermosetting piece make it a product especially in line with current and future environmental concerns? Jean-Louis Revel - This is a real opportunity and a tremendous asset to the perfumery and cosmetic sector. Because it doesn't stop there! At the level of the manufacturing of our compounds, waste material from the manufacturing process are scattered in the fields as a slow-release fertilizer. While the waste we have generated is reprocessed and used as an abrasive to remove paint from aircraft cabins. Premium Beauty News - You have wanted to scientifically verify with your upstream and downstream partners the safety of this product. Jean-Louis Revel - Indeed, we wanted on the one hand to check with our suppliers, that our employees operating in the workshop were safe, and secondly to be able, to ensure that for the end user, there was no formaldehyde in the air. This required the characterization of thermosetting resins at our suppliers. And I must say they have made considerable efforts to undertake these permanent controls under the ISO 14000 and 18000 certification processes. We also wanted to proceed to an air analysis in our own manufacturing premises. This analysis concluded to a full compliance under the regulations. As for consumers, tests were also conclusive. Tests conducted last year resulted in the conclusion that formaldehyde was not detectable for example by submitting caps to temperatures of 23°C and 35°C in a room for 28 days. Hence, there is also no heavy metals, no halogenated compounds and no organic solvents. In addition, the powder is biodegradable. To note also that our resins are not submitted to REACH. In conclusion, a responsible industry that guarantees users the safety of a product which is friendly to nature upstream and downstream the production channel. Premium Beauty News - You also undertook an analysis of the life cycle? Jean-Louis Revel - And the results, again, are convincing. Main arguments: a 37%, bio-sourced origin, a 70% renewable origin (cellulose, nitrogen, C02), impacts of the same order of magnitude than those of other plastics used in cosmetics, identified areas for improvement."
Livcer: an obsession with quality,"Premium Beauty News - Your operate both on the cosmetic and pharmaceutical market? Aude de Livonnière - We can say we have really become in a few years the French specialist in thermoformed samples and single doses. We strive to meet all the new requirements of the cosmetic market. We offer our customers a choice of more than a hundred standard moulds, both for skincare and colour cosmetics. By playing on the graphics and colours, the sample then becomes the exact replica of the product. As there is today, a trend towards specific single use products, we position ourselves as a leader in the development of this type of pack, such as creams sold in single doses, travel products, pre-moistened masks, gels patches or even flavoured or scented ice cubes. From the original flexographic reproduction process to raw material stock management, we also offer the best guarantees of safety and pharmaceutical quality. Premium Beauty News - Environment and quality are also two of your main concerns! Aude de Livonnière - Absolutely! We are an eco-responsible company and we have grown a concern for the protection of the environment for many years. Already an Imprim'Vert [1] company, we are constantly seeking to make improvements on materials, inks, and waste management. And we give preference to partners who work in the same perspective we do, be they printers, manufacturers of plastic laminates or other subcontractors. Since 2000, the company has engaged in a quality management system that is straightforward, effective and continually evolving, just like our company. This approach was recognized by AFAQ as of 2001 when we were granted the ISO 9002 certification. Then in 2004, we logically moved to the ISO 9001:2000 certification (and then to ISO 9001:2008 in 2009 whose philosophy fits perfectly with our corporate ethos: Continuous improvement aimed primarily at satisfying our customers. Our environmental policy is based on the following points: – Comply with the legal and applicable requirements and with the other requirements, to which we have subscribed, – Reduce the impact or nuisances on the environment of our industrial activity, – Prevent the risk of pollution and of hazardous situations, – Continuously improve all our environmental performances, – Manage waste treatment, – Shift from toxic products to less hazardous products. We also obtained our ECOCERT manufacturing certification in January 2009. This enables the company to package already ECOCERT-certified biological products and thereby satisfy the needs of customers in a more comprehensive manner. We also received the ISO 14001 environmental standard. Finally, our quality system is regularly audited by our customers, as well as during outsourced internal audits and certification audits. The commitment and efficiency of our staff are consistently praised during these audits. We have undertaken a GMP certification since 2010 which resulted in 2012 in the two following standards: – ISO 15378, for the printing activity (GMP applied to primary packaging for pharmaceuticals). – ISO 22716, for the packaging of thermoformed cosmetics. This certification enables us to attest the application of good manufacturing practices, as stipulated in the EC Regulation 1223/2009 on cosmetic products, the application of which is mandatory from July 11, 2013. Premium Beauty News - You talk of ""cosmetic requirement""! Aude de Livonnière - Beauty treatments, make-up, personal hygiene or even well-being products are all a number of innovations and events that we are fully dedicated in protecting. This is why this part of our business complies with very high standards of safety, hygiene and confidentiality. The products are packaged in thermoformed single doses, in special filling units and under a controlled atmosphere, by a highly qualified personnel who makes sure to maintain the best possible preservation conditions of the products chemical and biological quality. The quality of the products we deliver to our customers has to be impeccable. Integrated into our quality management system, quality control is performed at three levels: A unit control at the machine outfeed, a statistical control on semi-finished products and finished products. Premium Beauty News - You are also expanding abroad? Aude de Livonnière - Absolutely! Especially in the United States for the past two years."
Mega Airless increases by 50% its production capacity in Europe and plans to do the same across the Atlantic!,"Premium Beauty News - The least we can say is that airless systems have the wind in their sails! Lucyna Silberstein - It's true! We are definitely in a growth market. Its growth rate is estimated at about 5% per year in Europe against 7% in the United States. For our part, we already produce about 130 million units per year, with 30 million alone in the United States. Premium Beauty News - The investment you have planed this year is consistent! Lucyna Silberstein - In any case, this shows our confidence in this market. In fact, we are giving ourselves the means to produce nearly 50% more airless containers in the next twelve months or so. The new 15,000 sqm site (161,500 sq ft) will complement the 5,000 sqm site (53,800 sq ft) we already have in the area but will eventually replace the second one of 6,500 m2 that we currently have. We plan adding nearly fifty more injection presses to the 120 already on site. We design and manufacture high-performance airless packaging solutions for an increasing number of brands. To cope with this demand, we needed this new, larger, high performance plant that will allow us in addition to improve the required logistics efficiency and provide an optimum level of quality and service. Premium Beauty News - Your ""customer"" market is mainly ""cosmetic""? Lucyna Silberstein - Yes, it's that's right! The cosmetic sector represents about 85% of our business followed by dermatology. Number one across all categories, face care. Make-up only represents 9% of our business for the time being, but it's increasing. Premium Beauty News - In fact, you only operate in the segment of piston airless systems. Is it not a handicap compared to the evolution of the market of airless systems? Is it still possible to innovate in airless? Lucyna Silberstein - Certainly not! We have a comprehensive and recognized expertise in piston systems. This doesn't stop us from working with other partners on other systems. Like for example the Gaplast Company specializing in systems with a soft pouch or the Louvrette Company with whom we develop interesting models. Not to mention the Neopac Company a tube specialist. As for innovations, they occur in small steps. Thus we will be presenting next September two new models of all-plastic pumps in 5, 10 and 15 millilitres sizes. To assist our clients in their efforts towards ""premiumisation"" we also invest and innovate in decoration techniques. The full height hot stamping process, we recently launched is a huge success."
"HCT, sales have doubled in three years","Quite an outstanding performance too, for this Group, which employs more than 2,200 people across Europe, the U.S., South America and Asia, owns five plants in total, including in Asia, (two for plastic injection, one for coatings and the manufacture of metal closures, one for make-up formulation and one for the manufacture of brushes. ""Our progression on this niche of brushes alone is a model of its kind, emphasised James Thorpe, since in the U.S. it represents no less than 30 million dollars in sales!"" Key elements of this ""HCT New Look"" built during the past few years: Diversification, defined as a business model, a maximum integration of services to offer its customers a complete offer both industrially speaking and in terms of services, the desire to build a comprehensive full-service offer and a marketing strategy consistently geared towards brand owners operating in mass distribution and, icing on the cake, innovation as the growth engine. ""Actually, explains James Thorpe, we are capable of offering a truly comprehensive quality service which is highly appreciated by decision makers in this circuit, including our marketing model with which we propose to support their launches."" Latest key accounts to date, Intermarché (France), Eroski (Spain), Kicks (Sweden), without forgetting the Spanish department store El Corte Ingles. Spearhead of the group in recent years, innovation. ""Innovation that we develop ourselves, said James Thorpe, but for which we do not hesitate to enter into partnerships"". This is the case, for example with the recent series of airless applicators combining HCT's patented zamac applicators, allowing for a smooth application with a sensation of freshness on the skin, and the vertical airless pumps in the Spot Series proposed by the Korean manufacturer, Pump-Tech, which enable a precise product dosage. This series is particularly suitable for complex and delicate skincare formulas applied to the eye area. It avoids in particular having to apply the product with fingertips, which is always difficult in this particularly sensitive area. Several designs are available with 12 months of exclusivity for each."
