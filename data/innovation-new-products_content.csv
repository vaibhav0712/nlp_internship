How did L’Occitane revive fragrances from forgotten flowers?,"It is not uncommon for innovation to find its roots in the past! Regarding the Forgotten Flowers collection by L’Occitane en Provence, the whole adventure began with a dive into the archives – notably those of the Villa Saint-Hilaire and the International Perfume Museum, in Grasse, the cradle of French perfumery – to find the flowers formerly used in old perfume recipes. This titanic work led to the creation of a database gathering more than 800 perfume plants, some of which had been completely forgotten. From these 800 plants, three were selected to form the new collection: melilot [1], woodland hawthorn (known as noble épine, in French) [2], and common tansy (known as barbotine, in French) [3]. It all started in 2015, when the brand committed to supporting a thesis on “Forgotten perfume plants” by researcher Anne-Sophie Bouville. ""The project was to liberate knowledge about these flowers, forgotten in perfumery, but sometimes known in other fields. There was also a philanthropic dimension of opening up and sharing knowledge with the general public,” said Anne-Sophie Bouville, PhD student at the Institut de Chimie de Nice (Université Côte d’Azur, CNRS), then Active Fragrance Project Manager, L’Occitane. Indeed, certain plants, such as rose, jasmine and iris, have been used in perfumery since Antiquity and throughout the ages. Others were used at certain periods and are no longer used today. Sometimes, this disinterest is easily explained by substitution by a synthetic ingredient or by regulatory constraints. But in other cases, the reason may remain unknown. To identify these forgotten perfume plants and develop innovative cosmetic raw materials, several hundred books were studied, some dating back to antiquity, and numerous experts (anthropologists, archaeologists, botanists, historians, linguists, perfumers, theologians, etc.) were interviewed. Information was gathered on the identity, history, symbolism, uses, smell, medicinal properties and hypotheses on why plants were forgotten. Beyond their properties and olfactory potential, the eight hundred perfume plants and more that form a unique database were subjected to strict specifications and studied in the light of L’Occitane’s industrial and agricultural criteria to assess their interest in perfumery and cosmetics. This impressive research work resulted in a patent and three scientific publications, and in the launch in fall 2023 of a collection of cosmetic perfumes packed with purpose and steeped in history. ""It’s very rare in research to see the concrete outcome of one’s work. The strength of this collaboration between the world of research and L’Occitane is that it makes academic knowledge tangible and comprehensible to the general public,” highlighted Xavier Fernandez, University Professor in Chemistry and Vice-President Innovation, the Université Côte d’Azur in Nice, France. For the creation of these unique perfumes, L’Occitane worked with renowned perfumers who were asked to highlight the history and personality of each of the three selected flowers. For the Melilot line, Julie Massé and Véronique Nyberg, perfumers at Mane, turned away from the absolute of the flower to prefer the infusion technique. The use of this flower, neglected by modern perfumery in favour of coumarin, a more accessible synthetic molecule, was “really fascinating”, according to Julie Massé. For Noble Épine, the choice of fresh flower absolute appeared as the most logical and Shyamala Maisondieu, Givaudan perfumer, translated it in a tender and delicate fragrance. Finally, for Barbotine, the essential oil of the plant was transformed into perfume by Fabrice Pellegrin and Ilias Ermenidis, from Firmenich. The perfume’s olfactory notes present a floral sophistication alongside revealing a fresh aromatic scent. “Bringing forgotten flowers back to the heart of olfactory creation was a unique adventure, a challenge,” concluded Fabrice Pellegrin."
"Aloha, an innovative micro-encapsulation system to perfume any materials","The 15-1 Diffusion company wanted to develop “smart” materials as part of its eyewear business. A few years ago, it approached French and international research laboratories and embarked on an R&D programme opening up new functionalities for its products. After three years of development, a few months ago, it launched its first anti-lice, anti-mosquito, or simply scented glasses, thanks to an innovative and inspiring new technology called Aloha Matériaux Augmentés. “We asked ourselves whether we could use chemistry to give eyewear another function. We created anti-lice glasses by incorporating microcapsules into the frame material to diffuse actives, in this case lavender effluents, around children’s heads, and create an effective barrier. The same principle applies to perfumes: we can now integrate either juices or compositions into the microcapsules, and then diffuse them”, explains Didier Janot, co-founder of 15-1 Diffusion. On the surface, the technology can be applied to all materials: leather, plastic, paper, metal, glass, etc. In the mass, Aloha works with injectable materials, preferably biobased polymers. “Our starting point is ecoresponsibility. We aim to work with biosourced materials and natural actives. The name Aloha, which means ‘hello’ in Polynesian, also refers to the philosophy that links Man to the Earth”, says the director. These microcapsules are oxygen-tight, which means they preserve the integrity of the actives used (juices, essential oils, etc.). The effluents are diffused thanks to the low porosity of the walls. The technology also makes it possible to decide on the mode of diffusion, which can either be continuous, involve friction, or depend on a defined temperature at which the diffuser starts to work. “We can decide on permanent diffusion, with acceleration by touch or temperature”, adds Didier Janot. He describes other experiments based on this concept applied in different industries, such as wines and spirits, where the aromas of a rum or whisky are captured in the cork or label. “We can reproduce this approach in all industries, play on the power of olfactory marketing, and trigger the desire to consume”, he says. In perfumery, the technology can be used to integrate fragrances into the bottle caps, the labels, or the packaging, which simply needs to be rubbed to release the scent, or to integrate customized aromas into materials, leather, or textiles, or on jewellery, ephemeral tattoos, or lipsticks. According to Didier Janot, while this approach is not intended to replace traditional perfume, it does allow users to enjoy a sensory experience through a highly precise olfactory performance when it comes to note reproduction. “Many major brands, particularly in the luxury sector, have been considering applications suited to their own needs or issues. All projects need time to be validated. It is more complicated than applying a brush. There is a whole process involved in finding the right molecule, looking at its ability to be microencapsulated, studying the way it reacts on the material, etc. All these elements together give an idea of the effectiveness of the outcome and the duration of the experiment. It can last from several months to several years, depending on the concentration”, he explains. For the time being, the company aims to focus its applications on the product environment and packaging, rather than on formulation. “Formulation is not our business, but anything is possible”, concludes the director."
Kao’s Curél to launch second skin set to combat severe skin dryness,"Curèl, a Japanese line of facial moisturizers and cleansers designed specifically for dry and sensitive skin, is launching a pair of products that work in tandem to combat severe skin dryness. Available in Japan from April 4, 2024, the new set comprises the Curél Outfit-for-Skin Potion [1], a lotion that diffuses onto the skin as an ultra-thin veil, and the Veil Creator [2], a special diffuser used to apply the ultra-thin veil and create an artificial second skin. As the veil wraps the skin, it releases moisturizing ingredients that seep deep into the stratum corneum to keep the skin hydrated and relieve concerns about severe skin dryness. The ultra-thin membrane technology applied in the new potion and diffuser is based on Kao’s “Fine Fiber Technology,” a technique that allows to diffuse ultra-fine fibers directly onto the skin as a laminated, ultra-thin veil. Kao Corporation first launched skincare applications based on the Fine Fiber Technology back in 2019, but Curél is now using it to introduce a new skincare method for intensive moisture care. Actually, the earlier renditions of the technology required a two-step care regime starting with the application of a dedicated nourishing essence before diffusing the veil. To simplify the application Kao scientists developed a hydrating beauty essence as the vital ingredient forming the veil. Curél Outfit-for-Skin Potion is the first product to apply this new solution dubbed “bleed-out technology,” a process for filling the spaces between the ultra-fine fibers of the veil with moisturizing ingredients to nourish the skin. The ultra-thin veil stays in place snugly like a second skin as the moisturizing ingredients seep deeply into the stratum corneum. “When applied at the end of the nightly skincare routine, the veil keeps the skin hydrated for hours during sleep, resulting in firm, supple, and smooth skin by morning,” Kao claims. Kao has collaborated with Panasonic Corporation to develop an advanced version of the Veil Creator diffuser. Once loaded with the Curél Outfit-for-Skin Potion in a dedicated cartridge, the new Veil Creator Diffuser can apply an ultra-thin veil on a targeted area in a matter of seconds. The device is compact and freestanding, for easy handling. The pair of products will be available for purchase from the official Kao online store (My Kao Mall). A subscription service will also be launched on Rentio to help customers easily start and maintain the new care regimen. Two subscription tiers are planned: a basic kit that includes Curél Outfit-for-Skin Potion and Curél Veil Creator, and a premium kit with an add-on Curél product delivered every month."
Tsuno Group creates a new generation sunscreen based on ferulic acid,"Well known for its anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, as well as an inhibitor of melanin production by blocking tyrosinase activity, ferulic acid is already used in wide array of cosmetic applications. More recently, several studies have explored the possibility of using it in the fight against photo-induced aging, in particular as a plant-based UV absorber. A study published in 2018 demonstrated its ability to boost the sun protection factor (SPF) of several anti-UV formulations [1]. Toutefois, selon Tsuno Group, a pioneer in large-scale production of ferulic acid, the stability and solubility of this substance have proven to be complex at high concentrations. To overcome these hurdles, Tsuno Group has partnered with cosmetic ingredients producer Matsumoto Trading to pioneer an innovative technology utilizing a high concentration of ferulic acid in a solid stick formulation. According to the two companies, the new technology has made it possible to develop a sunscreen with SPF 50+ and PA++ (tested in vitro), using ferulic acid extracted from rice bran by Tsuno Group as the sole UV filter. “This unique formulation eliminates the need for other commonly used UV protective ingredients, while maintaining high sun protection effectiveness. Patent pending,” said Tsuno Group in a statement. A patent application has been filed for this new formulation solution which could make it possible to use ferulic acid as a natural alternative to various UV filters. According to Tsuno Group, ferulic acid can absorb UV rays in a similar range of the spectrum as octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC). This characteristic makes it a potential eco-friendly alternative to various filters of petrochemical origin, including ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC). Indeed, recent studies have shown the negative impact of EHMC (also known as octyl methoxycinnamate or octinoxate) on the aquatic environment, and its role in coral bleaching [2]. Amidst growing global concerns about environmental sustainability, ferulic acid has the potential to gain increased recognition as a natural and effective sunscreen ingredient. It holds significant potential for application in a wide range of cosmetic products. “We, as a leading company in rice & bran chemistry in the world, have been developing a number of functional products with tremendous efforts through accumulating technologies, have also researched their safe levels and effects to be well accepted in pharma, food, feed and cosmetic industries. Now we have launched a technology of using ferulic acid from rice bran as a natural antioxidant and UV absorber, which is the first innovation ever in the world. We are confident that you shall discover this product as unique and impactful to contribute not only to the human health and beauty but the circular economy for the world,” said Fumi Tsuno, President of Tsuno Group Co., Ltd. Established in 1947, Tsuno Rice Fine Chemicals manufactures various ingredients from by-products generated in the process of refining rice bran oil, which can be used for pharmaceutical, cosmetic, functional foods, food additives, feedstock, and industrial chemicals. In addition, they are also engaged in the manufacture of cosmetics under their own brand that incorporate these ingredients. ** ""Toxicological effects of two organic ultraviolet filters and a related commercial sunscreen product in adult corals"", Tangtian He, Mirabelle Mei Po Tsui, Chih Jui Tan, Chui Ying Ma, Sam King Fung Yiu, Li Hsueh Wan, Te Hao Chen, Tung Yung Fan, Paul Kwan Sing Lam, Margaret Burkhardt Murphy, in Environmental Pollution Volume 245, February 2019, Pages 462-471 (doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2018.11.029)"
"Microcaps, Luzi, and Kajal partner to launch innovative ethanol-free perfume","Lamar Caviar Perfume d’Eau by Kajal Perfumes Paris is the result of a collaboration between Microcaps, a Zurich-based start-up offering the patented microfluidic perfume pearls technology, Swiss fine fragrance house Luzi and niche fragrance brand Kajal Perfume Paris.

"Tech helps beauty ’dreams’ come true, says L’Oréal’s Guive Balooch","How is L’Oréal embracing tech? Guive Balooch - Our CEO being the CES keynote is such a proud moment for us, and even more for the beauty industry. It’s the first time a beauty company CEO is speaking at the largest tech stage in the world. It signals the essentiality of beauty in society today, and the critical role tech plays in elevating products and experiences. We strive to build beauty products that are powered by tech, not tech products powered by beauty. We don’t look at the latest tech trend; we look at what people need and where the consumer tensions lie, and then create the tech to solve it. We’ve had consumer tensions for so long — like the fact that 50 percent of women can’t find the right shade match of foundation — and those tensions are now being solved more easily, faster and with more delight. We are meeting people’s dreams and expectations more effectively, thanks to the marriage of tech and beauty. Does artificial intelligence (AI) have a role to play? Guive Balooch - In many of our innovations, the common denominator is artificial intelligence – which we have been using for years, guided by our sense of purpose. We have growing experience of deploying AI across our brands and divisions. In 2018, L’Oréal acquired (augmented reality company) ModiFace, enabling us to create services like Virtual Try-On for hair, nail color and makeup try-ons. A great product example is Rouge Sur Mesure by Yves Saint Laurent Beauté. It’s an AI-powered, connected personalized lipstick device with augmented reality capabilities to virtually try-on and recommend lipstick shades from a selection of 4,000 shade options with a touch of a button and within seconds. What do you expect from tech? Guive Balooch - Tech isn’t about tech. It’s about guiding people to the right choices, and it’s about understanding your individual beauty based on data that will be powered by tech. We want to offer everyone the best of cosmetics innovation in terms of quality, efficacy and safety; and meeting the infinite diversity of beauty needs and desires all over the world. It is through technology that we can meet these needs. For our newest innovation, AirLight Pro, we’re launching with hairstylist professionals first... With other tech products, we launch to consumers first. It varies project to project and brand to brand. How do you decide on tech products? Guive Balooch - Our end goal is to build great products for our consumers. Starting with tech trends can lead to gimmicky results, especially in such a saturated market. While we need technology, we also need deep consumer insights into how we can make beauty lives better... Our approach is to first start with the consumer need, then use the technology that’s been clinically tested for 100 percent accuracy, and through that, build products that are enhanced and augmented to bring experiences to a new level. This process helps us constantly challenge ourselves to build on technology and develop great products and experiences that are completely unique. We also say no to projects that don’t deliver experiences that go above and beyond what’s already existing in the marketplace."
When beauty products pamper with AI: seven innovations spotted at CES 2024,"At CES 2024, the trend in beauty was clear: the time has come for artificial intelligence (AI), with technological innovations intended to get the application of beauty products ever simpler, precise and personalized! At home manicure salon This is the case, for instance, of the Nimble manicure salon, which calls itself the world’s first device to combine AI and complex robotics to paint nails flawlessly at home — without the hassle of making an appointment. Resembling a heavyset printer, the eight-kilo white box can varnish all ten fingernails and dry them in just twenty-five minutes. According to its creators, the device uses high-resolution micro-cameras and 3-D imaging to determine nail shape, size and curvature. Then a small robotic arm, guided by AI algorithms, applies the requisite three coats, with a blow dry after each applied layer. When it goes on sale in March, more than thirty colors will be available in capsules costing USD 10 each, enough for two complete manicures. The device costs USD 599. A virtual beauty advisor AI, a term often deployed as the latest catchphrase for anything tech, has also infiltrated beauty industry giants, as exemplified by the free Beauty Genius app, presented by L’Oréal. The innovation is intended to be an AI-supported ""virtual personal advisor."" It recommends skincare and make-up products according to skin type, gives tips on techniques and answers questions about problems such as acne and hair loss. Users can also try out the products virtually. Virtual tryouts This is also the aim of the program Beautiful AI, created by Perfect Corp, which combines generative AI and virtual reality to perform live skin analyses, 3-D hairstyle or jewelry trials and make recommendations. According to Perfect Corp CEO and Founder, Alice Chang, the ultimate goal is to create a ""more fulfilled customer journey"" by helping consumers to identify products and services that align seamlessly with their individual preferences. Custom printed makeup Korea’s Prinker, a specialist in ephemeral, customizable tattoos for skin and hair, is unveiling a similar product that will apply make-up this year. The device will also put AI to work with a biometric 3-D scanner to map facial features and then recommend the right contours, ""printing"" the corresponding powders to the face. Infrared hair blower No doubt that beauty personalization tech was a key feature of this year’s CES. And companies also brought it to hair care! L’Oréal presented their new connected hairdryer that can be customized via an app, taking hair type into account and automatically adapting power and heat distribution. Dubbed Airlight Pro, the device uses infrared light to dry the hair, allowing it to preserve the hair’s moisture, explains Adrien Chrétien, head of augmented beauty development at L’Oréal. Due to go on sale in April, it also offers energy savings of 31 percent compared with a conventional appliance, he added. ""AirLight Pro, with over 150 patents filed, perfectly embodies this breakthrough in beauty by, for the first time, bringing a solution for drying while caring for the hair as well as the planet,"" says Barbara Lavernos, deputy CEO in charge of research, innovation and technology at L’Oréal. Lip diagnosis, care and makeup capabilities in one pocket device After presenting at last year’s CES, a device named Cosmechip capable of concocting bespoke skincare at home, the South Korean giant AmorePacific is back with a new innovation focusing on lip care. The Lipcure Beam incorporates sensors that can diagnose the condition of the lips, including moisture levels, simply by swiping it over the mouth. Once this first step has been completed, simply remove the cap from the container to reveal an applicator tool. This applicator emits a customized light beam according to the diagnosis made, which interacts with a light-responsive material to reinforce collagen fibers and form a moisturizing barrier. Not only does this innovation help slow down the lip-aging process, but it also has the potential for color capabilities, based on a universal color system suitable for all skin tones. And best of all, it’s portable, making it easy to use any time, any place. The high-tech leggings that stimulate muscles Finally, let’s mention the leggings unveiled by biotechnology company Barun Bio, which feature patented WE-Stim (for ""Wearing Electrical Stimulation"") technology. Available in a range of colors, these workout pants feature conductive materials that use the energy produced by the body in motion (during exercise) to generate micro-currents to stimulate muscles and thus enhance performance. A new demonstration of the convergence of beauty and fitness!"
Clean Reserve builds on micro-emulsion for long-lasting water-based fragrances,"Clean Beauty Collective is betting on ethanol-free fragrances with a collection of eight water-based perfumes - Clean Reserve H2Eau [1]. The new collection builds on a micro-emulsion technology developed in partnership Japanese fragrance house Takasago. Dubbed Hydro-Tec, the technology enables the stable mixing of fragrance oil and water resulting in a fragrance that is long-lasting. Designed with sensitive skin in mind, the formulation was extensively tested in the lab and in the field. According to Clean Beauty Collective, consumer research results show a positive user experience with 88% of consumers calling it “game changing”. Thanks to this technology, the collection avoids the usual flaws of water-based fragrances that, historically, have been tacky on the skin and have lacked longevity. “Clean Reserve H2Eau’s formulation approach is not only long-lasting, but also gentle enough for sensitive skin, absorbing quickly, and leaving skin smooth and hydrated without irritation,” claims Clean Beauty Collective, which has the exclusive on Takasago’s Hydro-Tec for two years. According to the company, the line is packaged in sustainable, recyclable materials and is manufactured in solar powered facilities. The cap is made in Spain from sustainable wood, the glass bottle is fully recyclable and the fragrances are derived from responsibly sourced sustainable ingredients through selected partners that “give back to the local farmers and their communities.” “Clean Reserve H2Eau is a testament to our commitment to innovation and sustainability. It represents a leap forward in clean fragrance technology, demonstrating that luxury and environmental responsibility can coexist harmoniously,"" said Clean Beauty Collective’s CEO, Greg Black. Available exclusively at Sephora.com and cleanbeauty.com the line will roll out in more than 250 Sephora U.S. doors on December 26."
HeiQ unveils a 100% biobased probiotics-infused textile technology,"Designed for next-to-skin apparel and home textiles, the HeiQ Skin Care technology harnesses the power of active probiotics and selected prebiotics to enhance the cutaneous microbiome for glowing skin. According to HeiQ, this textile finish helps to provide a balanced microbiome, even after repeated use and washing of textiles. Unlike conventional products, HeiQ Skin Care utilizes slow-release prebiotics and probiotics seamlessly integrated into a biobased textile matrix, enriching the skin’s microbiome diversity, and offering long-lasting cosmetic benefits. The proprietary technology was designed to deliver a soothing cosmetic skin treatment in every situation, whether the user is relaxing, working or sleeping. It is based on a synergistic combination of prebiotics and probiotics, known as synbiotics. According to HeiQ, synbiotics promote skin renewal, rebalancing, and improved appearance, reducing the signs of aging and establishing a favorable environment for the skin’s natural repair mechanisms. HeiQ Skin Care is suitable for all textile fibres, both natural and synthetic, and can be applied to all textile items that come in direct contact with the skin. Thanks to this versatility the technology can be used in a variety of daily use textiles - at work, during sports, leisure activities, or as bedding items like bed sheets and pillows. Intensive wear trials conducted during the development stage have proven the consistent release of synbiotics (prebiotics and probiotics) onto the skin, creating conditions to foster a well-balanced microbiome. “HeiQ Skin Care represents a leap forward in textile innovation, combining the power of probiotics and prebiotics to enhance skin microbiome and overall skin appearance. It is another way of delivering our promise of improving the lives of billions, which is at the core of everything we do at HeiQ,"" says Mike Abbott, Head of HeiQ Textiles & Flooring Business Unit.

Schwan Cosmetics unveils new refillable lip liner,"Schwan Cosmetics has showcased its newly launched eco-friendly mechanical lip liner at the Cosmoprof Asia 2023 trade show in Hong Kong. The new product combines a maximum-performance formula and active care ingredients with sustainability and eco-conscious design. Dubbed “Power Up Your Pout”, the new refillable mechanical lip liner features exchangeable cartridges filled in with a peptide and jojoba oil-infused formulation and a unique, drop-shaped tip for an easy application. The drop-shaped tip mimics the natural shape of the lips and is designed to never lose its shape, ensuring easy, precise application until the last use. The jojoba oil in the formulation provides moisture and cell regeneration, while the peptides, one of 2023’s most trending active ingredients, promote plumpness and fuller-looking lips, in line with today’s most in-style looks and consumer demands. The new lip liner also has a unique refill system that allows consumers to replace the product without discarding the packaging, thus reducing the product’s environmental footprint. The refill systems offers a sustainable beauty alternative to single-use and disposable liquid liners, thus significantly contributing the reduction of plastic waste. “We understand the needs and preferences of the Asian cosmetics market, which are characterized by fast innovation, product performance with high-quality standards, and most recently, an increased demand for sustainable product offers,” says Sandra Schäfer, Manager of Sustainable Business Innovation at Schwan Cosmetics. “We offer a wide range of products that cater to these demands, from natural and clean formulations to trendy, functional, and sustainable packaging solutions. With ‘Power Up Your Pout’, we demonstrate that high-quality beauty products can be sustainable - without compromise.

Launched at MakeUp in New York last year, TheBetterBarrel line has been nominated for the Cosmopack Asia Awards in the sustainability category."
Bastille Parfums strengthens transparency promise with RFID technology,"Launched in 2020, and then purchased by Sophie Maisant in 2022, the Bastille brand was initially based on the concept of more natural perfumes and more transparency and traceability. To go even further, it has just become the first perfume brand to affix an RFID label on its products, together with a QR Code that provides access to all the product and manufacturing information. “When we met Avery Dennison, it felt obvious the RFID technology was essential to go even further. Not only does it help us achieve our transparency ambitions towards our consumers, but it also involves operational excellence, which adds to our promise”, explains Sophie Maisant. Avery Dennison provides smart labels based on radiofrequency identification. The data collected with this technology is stored, harmonized, and made readable to Bastille via atma.io, Avery Dennison’s connected product cloud. A unique digital identity is attributed to each product, so they can be followed up every step of the supply chain, from sourcing to distribution, with an order tracking function in real time. In addition, the brand has access to the analysis of interactions with consumers. If the RFID technology makes it possible to store product data, once scanned, the QR Code directly leads to an application containing the whole brand’s world: list of ingredients, origin identified on a map, packaging suppliers, and date of manufacturing. “I think we are the only brand to have chosen to communicate the date when our products were made and bottled, only by scanning a QR Code. And it is just the first step; we will soon cover the whole logistics chain. I would love to be able to track products up to the flower, with our partner, IFF. This technology offers endless possibilities. We can add as much content as we want,” adds the President. If the beauty industry has only just discovered this technology, major companies like Zara and Decathlon have already embraced it. “There are so many possibilities regarding stock management, consumer experience and authentication”, says Sophie Maisant. “It is true it is a significant investment for a company, but that is the price to pay for the transparency and operational excellence offered by this technology,” she concludes. The transformation of the perfume brands to meet the new demands from consumers will be one of the key topics of the next Fragrance Innovation Summit on November 30 in Paris."
Ormaie innovates with mini refills made of 100% glass,"With “The Small Bottles” range, Ormaie now offers its collection of nine fragrances in a refillable 20ml format designed to be used at home or taken anywhere else. For a refill that is both elegant and eco-responsible, Ormaie has developed an original alternative to usual systems: glass ampoules of the same size that are filled with perfumes. According to the brand, the new patent-pending refill-solution, which required 24 months of development, introduces a new way of filling an empty bottle of perfume using an eco-responsible container. “With this glass ampoule, Ormaie offers a real and previously non-existent solution to sustainability issues, which is also a considerable technical advance for the industry,” explains the brand in a statement. Each small bottle bears the colour of the fragrance it contains with the characteristic shape of the original cap stamped in gold. The transformation of the perfume industry in a context of ecological transition will be one of the key topics of the next Fragrance Innovation Summit on November 30 in Paris."
Innovation: Who are the winners of the MakeUp in NewYork IT Awards 2023?,"28 new skincare and make-up products, out of a total of over 100 applications, were nominated for this year’s MakeUp in NewYork Innovation & Trends (IT) Awards. The 12 jury members met in July to test and assess the short-listed products and select to the most innovative and trend-setting solutions across four categories: accessories, formulations, full service and packaging products. The IT Award in the “Accessories” category was scooped by Italian manufacturer Pennelli Faro for their pocket-sized make-up brush Segno. Designed to be wearable on the wrist, like a bracelet, the precision brush is mounted on a flexible lace that is available in various materials. In the same category, the Coup de Coeur du Jury (jury’s favorite) award went to China’s Beauty Yaurient Cosmetics Accessories for Iron Series, a line of massage tools with natural jade stones. The three sizes are suitable for the face, back, shoulders and neck. ACT Beauty with their line of Bio-Based Blenders, and HNB Corporation for their black and white Zen Makeup Brush Collection were among the finalists. French manufacturer MS BeautiLab won the IT Award in the formulation category for Roll & Remove Beauty Spheres, a range of translucent makeup removing spheres, formulated with over 93% ingredients from natural origin, without PEGs, silicone or preservatives. “At skin temperature, the spheres will transform into a soft, fluid oil that will effectively remove all traces of makeup and impurities,” the company explains. Ancorotti Cosmetics won over the jury in the “full sevice product” category, with Multilayer a compact offering a hypnotic decoration combining color, patterns and varying relief effects. Based on pure pigments, its multi-layer pressable formula contains moisturizing, emollient and anti-redness agents. Eventually, South Korea’s Taeyang Renew scooped the award in the packaging category with their Airtight Slider Mascara: a tube contains a sealed formula and a retractable applicator. In addition to the winners of the IT Awards, Ewelina Aiossa, ambassador of MakeUp in NewYork 2023 and member of the IT Award jury, has awarded ""The Ambassador’s Favorite"" prize to her favorite product, selected and tested from among the 10 new skincare products entered in the competition. The prize went to Coreana Bio for its Lavida Vital Recovery BB Cream Pact IRF35, a hybrid antiaging formulation combining UV filters, oils, moisturizers and various active ingredients. The “MakeUp in” show will return to the West Coast on February 14-15, 2024 at the Los Angeles Convention Center, then again in New York on September 18-19, 2024, again at the Javits Center."
Chanel 31 Le Rouge: A refillable lipstick housed in a glass case,"For 31 Le Rouge, the French luxury house has chosen to replace the materials usually used for tubes (plastic and metal) with glass. Made by a Japanese glassmaker, the tube houses an aluminium refill with the lipstick formula. The gleam of the metal interior reflects off the glass sides, which are set with a golden-hued ring. “Inspired by the mirrors that line the legendary Art Deco staircase in Gabrielle Chanel’s Paris apartment at 31 rue Cambon, 31 Le Rouge unlocks a fusion of sophistication, technical mastery and design fluidity with an intimate, aesthetic experience,” said the brand. According to Chanel, four years were needed to overcome the challenges associated with creating a glass lipstick case that is thin and durable enough for a product of its kind. “I didn’t want an ounce of plastic in this object. I wanted to look to the future. To create a glass lipstick was a dream. I worked with one of our manufacturers in Japan. Nobody else was capable of making it like that, neither in France nor in Italy. It took a long time,” told Sylvie Legastelois, Chanel’s Director of Packaging Creation and Graphic Identity, in an interview with the online magazine All I.C. The refills are interchangeable and can be removed and replaced without any limit, and there is no need to use the product completely before changing the refill. The product inside the refill is protected by a cover. The 31 Le Rouge range features 12 shades ranging from soft beige to deep garnet. Finely micronized pigments combine with sheer mother-of-pearl to deliver intense, purely radiant colour. Composed of 75% naturally derived ingredients, the longwearing formula is enriched with Gardenia Oil, and maracuja oil, both of which provide skincare benefits. Clinical evaluations showed a 70% improvement in lip hydration, 44% in smoothness and 55% in firmness, after one month of use."
Officine Universelle Buly works vegetables into perfumes,"Inspired by the Parisian company founded by perfumer Jean-Vincent Bully, in 1803, the entrepreneur couple composed of Ramdane Touhami and Victoire de Taillac awakened this old gem to create Officine Universelle Buly, a new experience of enchantments of the past. “We were lucky enough to uncover an appealing beauty catalogue created by this 19th century brand. The product names and bottles were engaging, so we opened our first store on Rue Bonaparte, in Paris. This move was in line with our desire to have an outstanding beauty store, which we thought Paris did not offer back then. We mixed the company’s iconic products, based on the original catalogue, for example Eau Triple or Huile Antique, and on a selection of 20 to 30 plant oils and botanical powder clays, to revive the original system of beauty stores, with a selection of beauty accessories”, explains Victoire de Taillac. Boosted by an identity focused on the Golden Age and an experience customized with calligraphy, the Buly stores and products soon conquered global markets. And with a dozen more stores opened in 2022, Officine Universelle Buly now counts four points of sale in Paris and about 40 around the world, in particular in Japan (Tokyo, Sapporo, and Osaka), as well as in South Korea. In Europe, the brand is already present in Paris, London, and Munich, and it also recently settled in Milan. Victoire de Taillac, manager of the brand image since LVMH purchased the company in October 2021, believes this success is due to a “typically French aura” and a very unique store experience. “When a customer makes a purchase, we personalize the box with the product name and theirs, written in hand calligraphy. We also offer many customization options, including engraving and embossing. So, to me, we embody a very specific vision of beauty and elegance à la française, both abroad and in Paris”, she claims. In addition to this profoundly anchored identity, the brand does not hesitate to innovate: it launched a new collection of water-based perfumes last spring, putting vegetable garden ingredients in the spotlight, although they are rarely used in perfumes. Inspired by old seeds, the Les Jardins Français collection features fragrances with Indian cucumber, mint from Syria, watercress of the East, parsley from Sardinia, and even beetroot from Iraq or rhubarb from Egypt... The six olfactory compositions let Nature express itself with fresh, light notes instantaneously revealed by the water-based emulsions. This new collection completes the 12 perfumed combinations with a water base, i.e. the Eau Triple fragrances by Officine Universelle Buly, like Eau Triple Al Kassir, which features sandalwood, cardamom, and patchouli chords, or Eau Triple Miel d’Angleterre, composed of honey, amber, and cedar wood chords. Available in 75-ml bottles, the collection can also be purchased as a set containing six travel-size fragrances."
Florence by Mills targets Gen Z with first fragrance Wildly Me,"Florence by Mills describes their first-ever fragrance launch as being inspired by a botanical garden “where bergamot and soothing sage intertwine with purple iris, blooming wisteria, violet flowers, and fresh lavender.”  The fragrance was created in collaboration with Givaudan and combines periwinkle floral notes with sandalwood and upcycled cedarwood base scents. Within Givaudan’s palette, the brand made a selection of Orpur classified ingredients, a label awarded by the fragrance house to its finest qualities of natural raw materials. With this debut fragrance offering a frosted glass bottle and a pricing ranging that will range from USD24 to USD 65, depending on sizing, the brand continues innovate in the Gen Z beauty space, its core demographic target. Florence by Mills ranks among the most Googled celebrity brands, in addition to being one of the most followed beauty accounts on social media. ""I launched florence by mills beauty in 2019 due to the lack of clean, high-quality products available for myself and my friends,"" said Millie Bobby Brown. ""As the brand has evolved with me, I really wanted to find a fragrance that represented my journey to adulthood. Over two years in the making, Wildly Me tells my story of what it means to choose your own path, and being unapologetically, wildly yourself. I’m thrilled to finally be able to share this part of my passion project with the flo family."" In a close segment, Luxe Brands recently announced the launch of Cloud Pink, the latest addition to their Ariana Grande fragrance collection."
Prada enters the beauty arena with refillable skincare and makeup lines,"Available since August 1st on the luxury brand’s website, as well as at selected retailers, such as Selfridges and Harrods, in the U.K., the two Prada Skin and Prada Color lines have been designed from the outset to be refillable. The Prada Beauty line is developed by the L’Oréal group, under a license agreement that came into effect in January 2021. Simultaneously, the premium label is also launching a virtual makeup try-on service (Prada Color Explorer) and a skin diagnosis device for advanced analysis of consumers’ skin (Prada Skin Decoder). “Realized in tandem, the respective skincare and makeup collections reconcile minimalism and maximalism; sophistication and playfulness; simplicity and versatility, drawing from both heritage and technology for formulas and packaging that bring luxury and responsibility into harmonious conversation,” said Prada Beauty in a statement. The new beauty line is positioned at the top-end, with cream and serum costing up to EUR 370 (about GBP 315 or USD 400). It takes 60 euros for the “Reveal” foundation (and 50 euros for the refill). The new collection includes: 33 shades of ""Reveal"" foundation; 26 ""Monochrome"" matte lipsticks; six ""Dimensions"" eyeshadows quads inspired by classic Prada prints; three ""Augmented Skin"" skincare products; and ten brushes and tools."
Schwan Cosmetics launches BFF hybrid brow liner with highly natural formulas,"Schwan Cosmetics new hybrid formulation contains no less than 91% Natural Origin Content (NOC) as well as skincare ingredients enriched with nourishing vitamins E and C. Designed to provide a soft and gliding application, the Brow Friends Forever (BFF) brow liner is “easy to blend and correct”. According to Schwan Cosmetics, it allows users to effortlessly achieve flawless, natural-looking brows. Its waterproof and sweat-proof clean and vegan formula promises long-lasting results throughout the day. “The mechanical pencil design offers an easy-to-use, precise application, while the formula combines natural oils, pure pigments, and powder fillers for easy blending and a buildable brow finish. A selection of structuring waxes and smart fillers ensure precise strokes,” said Schwan Cosmetics. BFF was premiered at the latest edition of MakeUp in Paris, last June, with six standard shades currently available to cover the entire brow spectrum and cater to different preferences, including a universal brown shade that accommodates all tones. However, Schwan Cosmetics will develop any specific custom colours upon request. Inspired by the Y2K aesthetic, the packaging design combines vibrant colours, shiny materials, and pearlescent shades for a playful and nostalgic vibe. Of course, all the packaging decorations can be customised to perfectly match with the brand’s identity. In a panel test conducted prior to the launch, 100% of participants were satisfied with the product properties of BFF, and 97% confirmed that it provided long-lasting brow results. [1] ""BFF addresses the growing consumer demand for clean beauty products,"" said Elza Davida, Product Manager Brow at Schwan Cosmetics. “We noticed the limited availability of mechanical brow liners with high Natural Origin Content (NOC) that meet these criteria. With BFF, we wanted to fill this gap by offering a sustainable, high-performance brow liner with a focus on clean ingredients. This is another step forward in our liner leader-ship journey as we refuse to compromise on performance.” At MakeUp in Paris, Schwan Cosmetics also presented an upgraded version of their makeup pencils made from Sulapac’s sustainable and biodegradable biomaterials."
Pibiplast: A series of eyelash and lip make-up innovations,"At MakeUp in Paris – which took place on June 14-15, 2023 at the Carrousel du Louvre – Pibiplast presented the output of PibiLab, the company’s in-house innovation laboratory, including the second opus of their Make Up Your Mood full service collection created in partnership with formulators for a reduced time-to-market. Hot on the heels of a first opus which was fully dedicated to mascara, the second release of the Make Up Your Mood collection features solutions for eyelashes and lips: – Daring, a volume mascara with an innovative mixed fiber brush. The combination of different fibers results in immediate volume and a fanned-out effect on the lashes. The brush is paired with Pibiplast Porto Cervo mono-material PP package, embellished with a shiny “nacre” finish. – Daring Waterproof, a water resistant version presented in a mono rPET packaging, with degradé finish decoration in shades of blue. – Flexy, a lip&cheek make-up solution with an innovative geometric shaped flocked applicator: a versatile solution to accurately apply lip and face products. – Glam & Shiny, a duo product combining a matte liquid lipstick and transparent topcoat for a long-lasting effect. The collection highlights Pibiplast’s existing synergies with formulators, thus allowing brands to significantly reduce development and launch times of new cosmetic products. Freshly coming out from PibiLab, Duality is a mascara packaging made up of one single bottle, with two different caps and applicators. With only one formula, two different performances are ensured by the different applicators. The company also displayed its new Smooth Lashes collection, a selection of the most recent launches of plastic mascara brushes. The collection features innovative shapes for increased performance and buildable volume on the lashes, paired with a mono material bottle. At MakeUp in Paris, Pibiplast also showcased Due, an innovative mascara solution, which was launched at Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna in March. Selected among the finalists of the IT Awards in the packaging category, this smart proposal is made only of two pieces, instead of the usual five, to minimize the impact on the environment. The monomaterial pack in PP consists of a bottle with embedded wiper and a one-piece cap with rod and brush (bio-based fibres are also available)."
Who are the winners of the MakeUp in Paris Innovation & Trends Awards 2023?,"MakeUp in Paris’ Innovation & Trends (IT) Awards are open to all exhibitors at the show. They are allowed to submit up to three skincare and makeup innovations. This year, 31 new skincare and makeup products and packaging, among more than 117 products in the competition, were nominated to participate to the final step. Eventually, the jury awarded four innovations and two “special mention” prizes, in the following categories: Accessory, Formulation, Full Service and Packaging. The IT Award in the “Accessories” category was scooped by Texen for their Multi-Intensity Brush with an innovative rotating mechanism that allows to adjust the length and density of the tuft to create a complete face make-up look with a single brush. In addition to this single-material (PBT) mechanism, the brush’s tuft, handle and ferrule can be customized in terms of shape and material. In the formulation category, MS BeautiLab took home the Award thanks to their Supernova Green injectable powders formulated with 99% ingredients of natural origin, and exclusively certified natural cosmos raw materials. While eliminating microplastics, talc, silicones and my synthetic film-forming agents, they have an ultra-sensorial, creamy texture that offers high-performance rendering and a high level of shine. Also in the same category, Aircos (Anjac Health & Beauty Group) won the special mention “Wow Effect” prize for their Hypnotic Very Noir compact eyeshadow with a creamy-powdery texture and an intense, golden-black metallic effect. In the “Formulation” category, the award went to Italy’s Trendcolor for coCOOLmelon, a blush with a hybrid formula between skincare and make-up, based on watermelon pulp and seed oil. Designed by Belotti, the case evokes the freshly picked fruit and when you open it, the pigments and active ingredients float inside the base like watermelon seeds. In the same category, the special mention for “Technical Innovation” went to Chromavis Fareva for Maya, a new technology enabling multi-colour heat-cast visuals with high relief and definition down to 1 centimetre. It was presented in a cast texture formulated with 94% natural ingredients, extra slippery, creamy and enveloping, contrasting with the vibrant, deep colours and 3D relief. Eventually, the Packaging award went to Taiwanese company Libo Cosmetics for its Venus Refillable Aluminium Lipstick. The packaging is made exclusively from 100% aluminium, including the cap and shell, without creating plastic waste. Its refillable mechanism further enhances the ecological aspect of the design. The lipstick case is customizable with a wide range of finishes, including matte, satin and gloss metallic finishes. The next edition of MakeUp in Paris will be held on May 29 and 30, 2024."
Using deepfake technology to make virtual makeup testing more realistic,"The pandemic has clearly accelerated online sales in the beauty industry. While consumers have by no means deserted stores, they can now enjoy a hybrid and customised experience, both online and in person. Available from a number of makeup and hair colours brands, virtual testing allows users to test all kinds of products online, including foundation, lipstick and eyeshadow. Apparently, the technology holds great appeal, although some consumers are complaining about a certain lack of precision, potentially linked to poor lighting or an average-quality camera. This observation prompted three students from ESSEC business school  in Cergy, France, to push back the limits of technology to enable as many people as possible to enjoy an online shopping experience combining personalization, inclusivity and realism. All this is based on artificial intelligence, through a combination of augmented reality and the art of the deepfake. Sometimes seen as a threat when misused, sometimes viewed as an incredible innovation, in the case of virtual makeup testing, this kind of hyper realistic imagery turns the consumer into a virtual model, literally becoming the face of their own beauty needs and preferences. More concretely, the URMODEL project, by French students Inès Flammant, Marie Landrevie and Sophie Martinez, involves using the two aforementioned technologies to enable anyone with a mobile phone to see themselves as the model on e-commerce websites, so that their face becomes that of the models they are used to seeing when purchasing a makeup product, all with the most realistic representation. Thanks to this technique, all skin tones and skin issues or characteristics can be taken into account during an online testing session, without the fear of buying the wrong shade or product range. Although not yet accessible to consumers, this project won the three young women the international L’Oréal Brandstorm competition, the results of which were announced at the Viva Technology trade show in Paris. No fewer than 30,000 teams from over 70 countries competed, with just 10 teams remaining in the running for the final. The prize provides the three students with the opportunity to benefit from three months’ support from L’Oréal to develop their project at the Group’s headquarters. The three winners have already thought of improving their concept via machine learning, so that eventually, users will be recommended beauty products according to the characteristics and needs of their previously scanned face."
L’Oréal presents its latest Beauty Tech solutions at VivaTech,"Beauty Tech is now inseparable from the cosmetics giant’s core business: it has grown to more than 5,900 dedicated employees, more than 800 online services with 40 million service sessions in 2022. The novelties presented by L’Oréal this year at VivaTech include: inclusive beauty tech solutions such as Hapta from Lancôme, designed to enable people with physical limitations to apply makeup, initially displayed at CES in Las Vegas earlier this year; diagnostic and coaching tools, such as La Roche-Posay Spotscan, Meta Profiler by Giorgio Armani and Kérastase K-Scan; personalized beauty tech solutions such as 3D shu:brow by shu uemura for a professional eyebrow look at home, L’Oréal Paris Colorsonic for a mess-free even at-home hair colour and the Maybelline Beauty App virtual makeover; and sustainable beauty tech solutions with Water Saver from L’Oréal Professionnel, which was launched in 2021 and has saved over 42 million litres of water to date. Focus on four novelties Four innovations particularly got our attention: Shu Uemura, Phygital Stickers
Inspired by Japanese calligraphy, Shu Uemura’s phygital stickers are driving a bridge between physical and digital beauty experiences thanks to the latest NFC technology. Each Shu Uemura sticker is a ‘wearable accessory’. Upon scanning them, the users are directed to Snapchat, then the app uses face recognition technology to unlock an associated augmented reality experience – through A/R lenses, that enhances the user’s looks, based on Shu Uemura’s Japanese themes. Kérastase, K-Scan
This handheld AI-powered scalp and hair smart camera can scan, diagnose and track scalp and hair health-related conditions. K-SCAN uses three kinds of light (white, cross- polarized and UV) to analyse all types of hair and scalps and give stylists the insights they need to address the needs of their clients. Giorgio Armani, Meta Profiler
Giorgio Armani’s Meta Profiler service is an in-store, 10-minute diagnostic consultation that analyses the consumer’s skin in high precision, to then deliver a tailor-made Crema Nera routine and a personalized Armani beauty “Meta Sculpt” boosting protocol. La Roche-Posay, Spotscan
Developed with leading dermatologists, this free diagnostic tool for acne sufferers has been validated by a clinical study. From just three selfies, Spotscan analyses and scores imperfections to recommend a personalized La Roche-Posay routine. Targeting teenagers and young adults, Spotscan doesn’t replace an appointment with a dermatologist, but provides a vital first step in understanding their skin condition in a simple way. In addition, L’Oréal also gave details on its partnership with Impact+ to measure the impact of its digital media activities and on its three-year partnership with Alibaba to reduce the impact of its e-commerce activities in China. “This level of innovation would not be possible without the growing complementary expertise of Beauty Tech teams, as well as, our open innovation program via partnerships with some of the world’s most exciting startups and tech leaders,” said Barbara Lavernos, Deputy Chief Executive Officer in charge of Research, Innovation, and Technology, L’Oréal Groupe. “Technology and science enable us today not only to offer unmet services to our consumers, but also to transform ourselves from research to human resources to manufacturing or retail to invent the future of beauty.”"
"""Eco-responsibility is a real challenge for sun care products"", Alpol","In a context of growing concern about climate change and global pollution, consumers are looking for products that help them reduce their environmental footprint. In the case of solar products, eco-innovation is coupled with an unavoidable requirement for product efficiency. “As far as sun care products are concerned, the criteria that consumers are increasingly seeking are: respect for the skin and the environment, as well as advanced sensorial qualities. They want efficient products, together with a pleasant and sensory application. Sun protection products are transforming into real skin care products. Transparency on the composition and the consequences on the environment are additional challenges,” explains Alpol Cosmétique, a French contract manufacturer specializing in skin care products. In 2015, Alpol created a working group dedicated to sunscreen products with the mission of finding the best formulations combining product efficiency, sensorial qualities and environmental friendliness. ""The poor reputation of certain organic filters, as well as regulatory changes around the world have forced our experts in sun care products to test new formulations,"" highlights the company. As a result of this extensive research, Alpol Cosmétique is launching a new range of six eco-friendly sun care products that are free from PEG, “controversial filters” and silicones. – Soft Care Water Resistant Spray SPF 50+, a water resistant spray with a UVA/UVB ratio higher than the regulatory 1/3 and a fluid texture that allows a quick penetration as well as a silky finish.
– Anti Pollution Shield SPF50+ PA++++, a two-in-one sun care cream that efficiently protected from sun and pollution, with an moisturizing and easy to apply fluid texture.
– The Ideal Care Cream SPF50+ that combines hydration and sun protection with a melting and gliding texture offering a powdery finish that leaves the skin soft and non-shiny.
– Velvet Emulsion Protection SPF50+, combines four UV filters for a really high protection against UV rays. Its melting and gliding feeling leaves the skin soft, silky and with no greasy finish.
– Protecting Milk SPF50+, a semi fluid milk glides with a UVA/UVB ratio higher than the regulatory 1/3.
– Cream To Powder SPF50+, a hydrating and softening skin an sun care product, with a compact texture that allows a cream application and a powdered finish. For an optimal reduction of the environmental footprint, Alpol Cosmétique has formulated the products with ingredients of natural origin in the highest possible concentrations and has tested the compatibility of certain formulas with packaging mixing plastic and cardboard. “However, beyond environmental-friendliness, consumer awareness of skin cancer risks and premature aging due to exposure to UV rays, leads them to favour a high sun protection factor. This is why we have developed all our sunscreens with an SPF50+”, adds Alpol. For the development of these new formulas, Alpol’s R&D team relied on state-of-the-art equipment, in particular a high-performance optical microscope with a high definition camera, a filter solubilization calculation tool (developed by in-house) and in vitro SPF tests conducted internally to save time and improve performance. For all new projects of sun protection product, three support and customization options are possible depending on the needs and priorities of brand: ready-to-use tested products that are immediately available; products with specific tests adapted to brand needs; or products with extensive customization."
Yves Rocher strengthens its solid offering with new cosmetics and perfumes,"As many other beauty giants, Yves Rocher is tapping into the solid cosmetics segment, which seems to be gradually taking root in consumer routines. ""Our collection of solid cosmetics has been developed with eco-design in mind and the ambition of offering more responsible beauty products, free from plastic waste, in order to reduce our environmental footprint,"" explains Philippe Msika, Research Director Innovation & Development at Yves Rocher. To complete its range of solid cosmetics launched in 2021, the brand is debuting two new beauty items in June: a first Solid Face Scrub, and a Conditioner Bar for all hair types. Formulated without sulphated surfactants and without soap, the new Solid Face Scrub is infused with organic peppermint grown close to the brand’s historic in Brittany, France. 100% plant-based grains allow a gentle scrub while the 60% recycled cardboard packaging is fully recyclable, with zero plastic waste. For its part, the new Conditioner Bar promises to nourish the hair for 72 hours, to detangle it and facilitate styling, with a formula that restores softness and shine without weighing it down. Easy to rinse, it is formulated without silicone, it is vegan, and infused with organic flower oils grown in Brittany. From August 21, 2023, four fragrances (Sur la Lande, Cuir de Nuit, Sel d’Azur, Plein Soleil) from the Pleines Natures fragrance collection will be available in solid versions. This new range is alcohol-free and is made of wax and vegetable oils. These solid fragrances, intended for intimate perfuming, can be combined with the corresponding Eau de Parfum, for a more intense sillage. These new fragrances (13 g - EUR 17.90) are presented in a fully recyclable lightweight tin box, free from plastic."
Industry 4.0: How artificial intelligence could transform factories?,"There has been an explosion of interest in uses of AI across many sectors since the launch last year of chatbot ChatGPT from US start-up OpenAI. And at last week’s Hanover Fair on industrial technology in Germany, the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) in the manufacturing sector was firmly in focus. An illustration of the potential of AI was given by American IT services provider HPE. Via a tablet in his hands, a young employee of the company was able to chat with an AI-equipped virtual assistant, asking it to operate the arm of a robot. In order to solve a technical problem, ""factory workers no longer need to get a qualified expert on site: the artificial intelligence takes charge"" of guiding the repairs, said Thomas Meier, a data analyst from HPE who was presenting the prototype. The US firm, which has some 60,000 employees, has been working for the past year with Aleph Alpha, a German start-up with some 50 staff, seen as one of OpenAI’s leading European rivals. The innovation communicates with factory workers who can, for example, send a photo of a machine for the programme to detect any problems or check that it is correctly installed. Aleph Alpha’s resources are modest compared to those available to OpenAI, which has received major financing from Microsoft. But the German start-up believes it has at least one major advantage — it will keep customer data in Europe. But Aleph Alpha CEO Jonas Andrulis told AFP that Europe’s contribution to the AI revolution must go ""beyond regulation"". At another stand at the Hanover fair, Siemens was also exhibiting an application aimed at improving factory performance. In partnership with Microsoft, the German industrial conglomerate is this year planning to bring out a new version of the Teams messaging platform. It will feature ChatGPT and be specifically designed to help workers and spot defaults in products. Microsoft and Siemens, who say they are working with a number of clients in the automotive and aerospace industries, rejected accusation that AI will lead to job losses. Anthony Hemmelgarn, CEO of Siemens Digital Industries Software, said that 70 percent of issues were not being recorded and that AI was ""not replacing anybody"", as certain tasks were not getting done. ""It’s all about increasing efficiency"", he added. Another advantage that AI could bring is ""alleviating the shortage of skilled workers"", particularly in Germany, said Jochen Koeckler, head of the Hanover fair organisers. In Europe’s biggest economy, almost 58 percent of manufacturers complain of workforce shortages, according to a study by the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training published in December. For Andrulis, AI will undoubtedly lead to huge upheavals in the world of work. But he also sought to offer assurances. ""It’s not like AI will take your job. But the company who will use AI will take the market share of the company who doesn’t."""
Schwan Cosmetics strengthens their face portfolio with hybrid concealers,"Launched globally on at the occasion of Cosmopack Bologna, the Pure On-The-Glow Concealer (a liquid concealer with a sheer light-diffusing finish and instant moisturizing effect) and Pure Easy-Peasy-Glow Concealer (a lightweight formulation offering an instant moisturizing effect with a light, diffused finish, and medium coverage to create a natural look) are the latest additions to Schwan Cosmetics’ face portfolio. Inspired by skinimalism and with the aim to streamline the daily beauty routine of consumers, the new products combine colours and skin care benefits. “Our team of experts worked diligently to achieve the perfect formula balance, which contains Hyaluronic Acid and Erythritol, a moisturizing derivative of fermented sugar. That way, the skin feels fresh and hydrated. Looking forward, we are excited to continue exploring the inter-section of colour and care in our future R&D efforts. This new concealer concept is just the beginning of our commitment to creating innovative face products that seamlessly blend the benefits of skincare ingredients with the power of colour cosmetics,” said Katrin Hollmann-Raabe, Director Formula Development, at Schwan Cosmetics. Clinical studies have proven the skin benefits delivered by the new concealers. “Our efficacy study [1] confirmed that more than 90% of volunteers had a significant reduction in under-eye bags and increased skin tightness, smoothness, and moisture,” highlighted Leonardo Luce, Head of Competence Unit Color & Care, at Schwan Cosmetics. Furthermore, 91% of consumers reported smoother skin at the crow‘s feet, and 100% noted a moisturizing effect on their skin after applying the concealers. Alongside the new concealers, Schwan Cosmetics also showcased a wider collective of highlighters, blushers, and primers to celebrate a comfort-first mindset and no-size-fits-all-approach to skincare-colour-cosmetic-hybrids. In addition, Schwan Cosmetics unveiled the first felt tip pencil liquid eyeliner and also showcased their colour cosmetic pencils made with Sulapac sustainable and biodegradable biomaterials."
Faber-Castell Cosmetics unveils a rechargeable mechanical cosmetics pencil,"Faber-Castell Cosmetics’ latest innovation in the field of responsible packaging -– a rechargeable mechanical cosmetics pencil — took the stage at the latest Cosmopack fair, which was held in Bologna in March. Still in the process of being industrialized this new solution has been developed with the aim to reduce waste and add more value to the product. “While wooden pencils are an important segment that is highly appreciated by professional make-up artist, mechanical plastic pencils are our key category. Consumers appreciate them because they more convenient to use and facilitate make-up application. Therefore, it is of the highest importance to decrease their environmental footprint,” Dagmar Chlosta, President, told Premium Beauty News. Consumers just have to switch out the cartridge when it’s empty or when they want to change colours, or simply change the application area. The rechargeable pencil was presented featuring two different vegan and clean textures for lips, eyes and brows. At Cosmopack 2023, Faber-Castell Cosmetics also showcased a new line of high-performing wooden cosmetics pencils for eyeliners, lipliners and browliners. “On the heels of the launch of our PEFC-certified airtight wood pencils, we wanted to create a line with strong colour payoff and high smoothness. Additives like upcycled olive stone powder and upcycled organic avocado oil allow the formula a creamy and soft-gliding application suitable for all application areas,” explained Claudia Heinig, Head Of Marketing. In addition, the pencils are now available in different lengths and with different ferrules. Both the rechargeable mechanical cosmetics pencil and the high-performing wooden cosmetics pencils line are part of Faber-Castell Cosmetics’ new Protopia collection. Forged by US editor/publisher Kevin Kelly, the Protapia concept is based on the belief that “it is possible to make the world a little better - step by step.” With regard to cosmetics this can include, according to Faber-Castell, choosing products designed to reduce waste and consciously use nature‘s resources."
I.D. Swiss Botanicals harnesses the potential of plant-based neurocosmetics,"Founded in 2021 by Cédric Rimella and wife Aude, a doctor and dermatologist in Lausanne, after three years working hard on R&D, I.D. Swiss Botanicals combines science and nature to connect wellness and beauty. “We have been trying to understand the link between our skin and our brain. It is widely acknowledged that mental wellness has a direct impact on the skin. We use neuroactive ingredients, including the CBD molecule, and we have also been working on the endocannabinoid system skin receptors to trigger communication by applying a product on the skin”, explains Cédric Rimella. The laboratory owns several active complexes, including CBDVectorS, which can be integrated to formulas as liposomes or double encapsulations. These actives are combined to make up the base of the range products, which contain at least 99.4% of ingredients of natural origin: a moisturizing serum rich in hyaluronic acid, a skin-brightening moisturizing cream, and a (neuro)cosmetic mask. Performance is focused on prevention rather than repair, by strengthening the skin and helping it regulate its response to daily aggressors, like UV rays, pollution, etc. “We have measured an antioxidant effect of over 56% (vs vitamin E), reduced skin sensitivity up to 67%, and enhanced cell renewal up to 30%. We aim to provide skin cells with energy (+300%), so they can protect themselves from aggressors,” says Rimella. The brand has also released Skin Stress Balancer, a powder-based serum to be mixed with a day cream and recently received a Product Innovation award by The Beauty Short List for it. “It is a simple gesture: users just have to mix a bit of cream and a bit of powder in their hands and gently massage the skin to complete their skincare product without modifying the texture and smell. We provide additional efficacy without imposing a routine change”, adds Rimella. With this flagship product with an atypical form, I.D. Swiss Botanicals firmly positions itself as a Made-in-Switzerland brand with natural, technical, efficient, and relatively affordable products: 69 euros for the serum for 160 applications. Other than on its e-shop, the brand is present in Switzerland, the EU, and the UK, and is now making its debut in the US. The products are distributed through specialized, consulting-oriented channels (beauty salons, spas, chemists’, or concept stores), although a few major companies, including Nocibé in France, Druni in Spain, Sephora in the UK, and Manor in Switzerland (starting from 2023) have already taken hold of the project. The new reference to be launched this year is also focused on plant-based ingredients with neuroactive properties and on the powder solution. “We deeply believe in this type of formula, because it is pleasant to only sell efficacy, but our customers are not used to that yet. We actually aim to boost the efficacy of their routines by targeting the root causes of skin ageing. As part of our research, for example, we have been working on cell/neuronal regeneration or cell energy and mitochondria. We convey this fundamental research in cosmetic products, thanks to I.D. Swiss Botanicals,” concludes Rimella."
"La Bouche Rouge launches upcycled, natural and refillable fragrances","Known for its luxurious plastic-free makeup products, the brand created by Nicolas Gerlier is launching its very first collection of perfumes with a major challenge: to show that luxury can be resource efficient. With 30% upcycled ingredients and 90% natural ingredients, La Bouche Rouge bets on formulations that are “respectful of the environment and our skin,” and from which all ingredients that do not meet the criteria of zero impact on nature have been discarded. In the same vein, the brand has chosen to use 100% organic alcohol. The result is a collection of five perfumes, identified by five colours illustrating their personality: Rouge, by Dora Baghriche, Nude, by Alexandra Monet, Bleu, by Alexis Grugeon, Ambre, by Coralie Spicher and Rose by Nicolas Bonneville. As far as packaging is concerned, La Bouche Rouge has designed a perfume bottle inspired by its other iconic objects. The result is a 100ml refillable bottle topped with a twist off spray, housed in an entirely hand-crafted leather case, coming in the five colours of the fragrances in the range. The leather, as for the makeup line, comes from the prestigious Tanneries du Puy, and is certified by the label ‘entreprise du patrimoine vivant’ (living heritage company). The leather protect the glass bottle and allowed La Bouche Rouge to ask the glassmaker to aim a zero waste target in its production. “In traditional production, a third of all bottles are rejected for small imperfections in the outer glass or shape of the inner drop. La Bouche Rouge is putting a stop to this wasteful madness for the 21st century,” claims the brand. To reduce pressure on resources, the brand has developed a single material, plastic-free refill made of 100% upcycled aluminium and 100% recyclable. To completely eliminate plastic, the brand had to invent a breakable pouring spout. “If a perfume refill is just a second glass bottle with a plastic tip, how much unnecessary waste does that produce ?” questions La Bouche Rouge. To really encourage changing habits, the brand has also chosen to allow real savings when buying the refill. Thus, the perfume extract in the 100 ml glass bottle is sold for 195 euros, and the 100 ml refill is offered at 95 euros. “In the world of beauty, the revolution is played out in the search for balance between aesthetics, performance and sustainability,” concluded Nicolas Gerlier, the brand’s President and Founder."
Trade shows : Six innovative formulas spotted at MakeUp in Los Angeles,"In keeping with current major beauty trends, exhibitors at MakeUp in LosAngeles pushed inventiveness to the highest level in order to showcase natural formulas as well as packaging solutions with a reduced environmental footprint. New York headquartered Mana Products, for instance, presented an amazing lotion for sensitive skin offering SPF 50 and broad spectrum UVA and UVB sun protection with a formula composed only of non-nano mineral filters. Composed of 86% ingredients of natural origin, the formula called Skin Barrier Lotion SPF 50 can be used as a primer or as a moisturizing and soothing lotion. It transforms upon application into a powder that blends from transparent to clear with a matte finish without a white streaking or flaking. Skin Barrier Lotion SPF 50 won the Innovation Award from MakeUp in LosAngeles in the formulation category. Italy’s Chromavis Fareva introduced Inception, a powder made from a new thermosetting technology offering a solid-fluid consistency similar to the feel of porcelain when applied to the skin. Its formula is based on a blend of low melting point waxes. Chromavis Fareva was also distinguished with Snowglobe, a lip product in stick format with a novel patented rigid structure that combines liquid and solid textures in a single transparent ball that can incorporate three different types of liquid core: a fluid hybrid core infused with water-soluble actives, a liquid gloss or an anhydrous liquid lipstick. Snowglobe received the ""Coup de Coeur"" award from the MakeUp in LosAngeles Innovation Awards in the formulation category. Focusing on naturalness, Pascual Cosmétiques (Anjac Health & Beauty Group) showcased a universal primer dubbed Skin Refiner with a 99.7% natural formula that blurs small imperfections and evens out skin tone. Its light, non- greasy texture melts on contact with the skin. For its part, MS BeautiLab presented Skin Fusion, a ""care veil"" based on dermofusion a dermofusion technology that allows an optimal concentration of active ingredients and merges the advantages of anhydrous and aqueous cosmetics. The product is contained in a 100% biodegradable packaging. Under the effect of massage, the texture changes from solid to liquid to fuse with the skin. Skin Fusion won the Innovation Award from MakeUp in LosAngeles in the Full Service category. Honored with a ""Coup de Coeur"" award in the Full Service category, ITIT Cosmetics’ MakeUp Snacks come in the form of single dose products with different colors and for different types of use (eyeshadows, lipsticks, eyeliners, kohl, lip contours, lip balms, glosses, highlighters). According to the company, the format is ideal for air travel as well as for creating make-up testers at points of sale."
Eclo adds semi-solid foundation to its regenerative beauty range,"For the new, Cosmos-Organic-certified range, Eclo has taken up the challenge of formulating makeup with 100% organic ingredients or ingredients of natural origin, and eco-designed packaging. The main active, rye, is combined with vegetable waxes – castor, coconut or sunflower – for a melting texture with nourishing properties. “It’s a sensory, long-lasting balm that’s easy to apply, with adjustable coverage, and a natural finish”, says Priscille Charton, the co-creator of the brand. All formulas contain an active derived from regenerative agriculture. Here, the organic rye extract was selected for its action on skin tonicity, but also because its numerous roots help restore the habitat of living organisms in the soil, and therefore biodiversity. “This plant also withstands climatic hazards”, says Priscille Charton. “We aim to source raw materials from regenerative agriculture and to build bridges between producers, who thus leave the full power to nature, and the cosmetics industry, which most of them do not supply”, she adds. Ten shades are presented in the range packed with the iconic compostable solution developed by Sulapac. “It was a technical challenge to cover as many skin tones as possible, from the lightest, pinkish porcelain, to the darkest, chocolate. Very light shades are generally not well represented in foundation ranges, so we worked a lot on these ones. As for white, the formulas contain non-nano titanium dioxide”, she explains. Launched eight months ago after a fundraising campaign on Ulule, Eclo is available in an increasing number of concept stores in France, in addition to its e-shop. “We have received a lot of incoming applications. Outlets feel that we have a value proposition and that we are actually meeting customer needs with healthy, travel-size, easy-to-use makeup products that beautify, without seeking to transform”, says Priscille Charton. This enthusiastic reception has enabled her to consider extending the existing lipstick and blush ranges in 2023, with shades chosen in collaboration with her community, and a mascara. “Our biggest task is to encourage the use of regenerative agriculture in cosmetics, at all value stages,"" she concludes."
The beauty innovations spotted at CES 2023,"Skincare has been booming since the start of the pandemic, with a focus on personalization and accessibility. The goal? To allow as many people as possible to pamper their skin at home by responding to specific, individual needs. This is increasingly made possible by artificial intelligence, which has been reshaping the beauty industry for several months. The Cosmechip device from the South Korean group Amorepacific, for example, lets home users concoct entirely personalized treatments thanks to a little water and various Active-Chips, containing ingredients tailored to specific skin issues. And this all happens in a single step, since all you have to do is insert the chip into the device and the ingredients will mix with water to form a treatment product ready to be applied to the skin. In addition to personalization, the device allows you to obtain fresh – and therefore effective –  skincare products without having to worry about shelf-life. For its part, also with the help of artificial intelligence, L’Oréal presented Brow Magic, an applicator allowing personalized eyebrow makeup, in a few seconds, at home. Amorepacific also introduced Tonework, a science-led bespoke makeup brand that empathizes individuality and allows customers to find their ideal makeup colour through the Authentic Color Master algorithm. This AI driven algorithm performs precise colour analysis in 3,448 areas of the face, with emotion recognition. The service collaborates with the Tonework Alchemist, a fully automated multicategory cosmetic manufacturing device, to rapidly produce various personalized products. After the personalized 3D printed sheet masks launched in 2019, and a skin analysis app launched in 2020, Neutrogena  continues to explore the potential of personalization in cosmetics. This year, the Johnson & Johnson group brand thus introduced, in partnership with personalized supplements specialist, Nourished, a range of 3D printed gummies tailored to the nutrient needs of each individual’s skin. L’Oréal also presented an applicator that can mimic the movements of a makeup routine to help those who cannot apply lipstick or mascara.  Dubbed HAPTA, this smart, portable applicator is intended for people with limited arm or hand mobility. Featuring a 360-degree swivel magnetic attachment with 180-degree flexibility, the device stands out for its ability to mimic the different actions of a beauty routine via customizable accessories. This can range from handling packaging to the precise application of a product such as mascara or lipstick, for example, L’Oréal says. Currently, in development, the applicator will be launched by Lancôme, one of the group’s brands, sometime in 2023. After skin shade analysis, L’Oréal has introduced its Hair Reader, a hair colour evaluator, which analyses the client’s hair, measuring factors that influence the effectiveness of hair dyes, including hair colour, grey percentage, length, and density."
CES 2023: Neutrogena introduces 3D printed personalized beauty gummies,"Skin diagnostics, virtual try-ons or customized skincare solutions have been among the essentials of the Consumer Electronic Show (CES) in Las Vegas for several years, which opened its 2023 edition to the public today. Riding on the trend, Neutrogena is launching a new-generation range of gummies. A novel offering that is the result of a collaboration between the cosmetics brand and personalized supplements specialist, Nourished. The two organizations have worked hand in hand to develop gummies tailored to the nutrient needs of each individual’s skin, and all of which are 3D printed. To achieve this, Neutrogena invites consumers to use Skin360, its skin diagnosis mobile app, which was presented a few years ago at CES. However, the gummies can alternatively be prepared and purchased online via a dedicated platform called SkinStacks, which is also the name of these new supplements. The idea is quite simple, and relies on artificial intelligence, and more specifically on skin diagnosis through a scan and a questionnaire. These allow users to obtain a one-month course of gummies containing the necessary ingredients to pamper their skin. In detail, all you have to do is visit the website or the mobile application, and then start the diagnosis with a 360-degree scan of your previously cleansed skin. An initial assessment provides information on the current state of the skin, whether in terms of wrinkles or radiance. Then consumers are asked to fill out a questionnaire about their goals, their beauty routine, the problems they encounter on a daily basis, or the level of pollution where they live. Once these two steps are completed, the algorithm creates the gummies that best match the user’s skin, with no less than seven layers of ingredients specifically selected according to its specific needs: vitamins, zinc, selenium, and other nutrients designed to enhance the skin. It’s a sort of tailor-made beauty prescription! All that’s left is to do is buy the gummies that will then be 3D printed by Nourished."
Serge Lutens opens its olfactory universe with its At Home collection,"Premium Beauty News - How does At Home fit into the Serge Lutens universe? Olivier Tholliez & Marion Doré-Fabius - With At Home, Serge Lutens the architect meets the perfumer through five novel olfactory journeys transcribed in three gestures. A storyteller, an immobile traveller, an eternal dreamer, he invites us on an olfactory world tour of the Houses he chose and whose character has always seduced him: from the meditative Japanese residence to the rocky Scottish house, from the luxuriant Moroccan night garden to the lavish woodwork of an Arabian palace, and finally to the familiar, clean and comforting welcome of a linen closet. Premium Beauty News - What is the link between a Home Fragrance collection and fine fragrances? Olivier Tholliez & Marion Doré-Fabius - This new collection is the next logical and legitimate step in the well-thought-out diversification of the brand. After perfumes and make-up, home fragrances prolong and intensify the link between our customers and the brand. This collection stands as an obvious option for our extremely loyal customers. Premium Beauty News - Were the inspirations different? Olivier Tholliez & Marion Doré-Fabius - The desire to create home fragrances grew out of the unprecedented situation we all experienced during the first lockdown measures. Feeling comfortable at home appeared to us all as a need and for Mr Lutens as a new creative opportunity. Just like the desire to travel while staying at home. Mr Lutens likes to place himself in the lineage of immobile travellers, a theme often discussed in the literature. His inspirations are the meeting of his experience, his history, but also his imagination and his desires. Premium Beauty News - What was his creative approach? Olivier Tholliez & Marion Doré-Fabius - As an artist, Mr Lutens always follows the same creative processes, whether it is in the creation of perfumes or the stories associated with them. However, for this collection, he adjusted his approach because a room fragrance recreates an atmosphere that will be shared collectively unlike a skin fragrance which will rather highlight a personality or intimate facets. A particularity of the creation process for this range was the need to adapt the olfactory rendering to different media. The aim was to fully respect the fragrance on the three media: incense, cartridges for the electric diffuser and sprays. We worked with Scentys on the electric diffuser technology with perfume capsules. This partner has undeniable expertise in this field. Premium Beauty News - Why did you choose different media ranging from the traditional candle to the electric diffuser, which is quite new in the Home Scent universe? Olivier Tholliez & Marion Doré-Fabius - For Mr Lutens, a traditional candle is a beeswax candle that conveys the fragrance nobly. ""Commercial"" candles made of paraffin totally detract from the nobility of the essences. The spray solution, therefore, appeared obvious to us as it faithfully conveys the expertise and olfactory richness expected by our customers. Incense is an invitation to Japanese tradition, to a spiritual experience dear to the brand. For this launch, we collaborated with Nippon Kodo, a Japanese company with over 400 years of expertise in this field, guaranteeing exceptional quality. The electric diffuser takes the shape of a lantern, an object that is part of both Japanese and Moroccan traditions. The diffusion system was chosen for the perfection of its olfactory rendering. Premium Beauty News - What is your take on this home fragrance market? Olivier Tholliez & Marion Doré-Fabius - Successive lockdowns have fundamentally changed the way we live, work and travel. We have taken a closer look at our living spaces, which now take on multiple facets. We enhance them with a variety of means, including home fragrances, to recreate places of well-being and living well. We are recreating a new art of living suiting our present times. For instance, home fragrances can also be used to enhance and give a special touch to the different moments of the day: work, relaxation, or conviviality. We want to make our mark on this market by offering home fragrances in line with our values and our strong identity. Premium Beauty News - Where does this collection stand within the Lutens House? Olivier Tholliez & Marion Doré-Fabius - The pre-launch in boutiques shows us how much this new collection was anticipated by our customers. It clearly meets a need to experience the Serge Lutens brand throughout the day and in all spaces. The At Home spray will now be one of the most affordable products in our range. It will therefore play a recruitment role. The home fragrance will be the first step to entering the Serge Lutens universe. Of course, the collection will be regularly expanded through new media and new fragrances. We are very confident about the future of this range, which will allow a greater number of people to join the Serge Lutens experience."
UK start-up behind algae-based packaging bids for Earthshot glory,"Notpla — whose mantra is ""we make packaging disappear"" — is competing with 14 other firms for five prestigious awards, to be dished out by the prince and a star-studded cast at a ceremony in US city Boston on Friday. In its second year, the initiative to reward innovative efforts to combat climate change will then be broadcast on UK and US television on Sunday and Monday, respectively, as well as online. The five winners will each receive a £1 million ($1.2 million) grant. The co-creator of Notpla, which rather than using environmentally damaging plastics makes various naturally degrading — and even edible — packaging from seaweed and other marine plants, says they have already felt the competition’s benefits. ""Just being there is a massive boost to our visibility,"" French co-founder Pierre Paslier, 35, told AFP. ""So that’s already a huge asset to be part of the finalists and I think that if we win, it’s just going to be that on a much larger scale."" Together with fellow former Royal College of Art student and co-founder Rodrigo Garcia Gonzalez, 38, the duo began their eco-business adventure in a small London kitchen. They were intent on finding natural alternatives to petrochemicals-based packaging, sampling a variety of materials from tapioca seeds to other starches. ""Eventually, we found seaweed,"" explained Paslier, a former packaging engineer at French cosmetics giant L’Oréal who created Notpla with Gonzalez in 2014. ""Now we have a flexible film, we make seaweed paper, we have rigid materials. So it’s really the beginning of a family of seaweed-based technologies that hopefully can help us stop using so much plastic."" He said their early kitchen exploits had eventually led to the secretly-formulated ""Ooho"" creation. An edible bubble membrane made from seaweed — holding water, sports drinks or other flavoured liquids including cocktails and sauces — it is marketed as a replacement for single-use plastic cups, bottles and sachets. Tasting like a gelatinous candy, it can be consumed whole — like a cherry tomato — or from a larger sachet, making it ideal at sporting events and festivals. It has been widely used at marathons across the UK, including the 2019 London run. Viral online interest has helped attract the attention of investors, with Notpla expanding rapidly to boast more than 60 employees and finding itself on the verge of manufacturing its products on an industrial scale. Production of ""Ooho"" takes place at the firm’s offices in a large warehouse, a stone’s throw from the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east London. Notpla’s growing young team also has laboratories there as it continues to develop new algae-based products. Among the more recent results: a naturally biodegradable coating protecting takeaway food boxes from grease and liquids. The company now supplies industry giant Just Eat in Britain and five other European countries. It also provided the packaging for all the food sold during the final of the women’s European football championships at London’s Wembley Stadium in July. Another of its new innovations is a transparent package for dry goods, such as pasta. Paslier noted that although his products may currently cost more than plastic alternatives, the latter’s sales price fails to account for ""the impact on societal ecosystems, health for humans or for marine life"". ""This is basically going to be paid for [by] the next generations and that doesn’t come into the price of plastic that you buy on the market today,"" he added. ""So what we want is to be the most affordable, sustainable packaging solution that takes into account its whole lifetime costs."" Paslier believes seaweed can become the most affordable packaging option, in large part due to its fast growth rate which can top one metre (3.3 feet) a day in the lab. ""It’s a very, very renewable resource,"" he added, noting it doesn’t require any fresh water or fertilisers. Its emergence is undoubtedly timely. A recent OECD report found, at the current rate, worldwide plastic waste will triple by 2060 to one billion tonnes per year, much of which will pollute the oceans and threaten many species."
C16 Biosciences’ bio-manufactured palm oil enters commercialization stage,"Since 2018, C16 Biosciences has been developing a fermentation process based on food waste to produce a palm oil alternative. A precise selection of a yeast strain drives the natural fermentation process to produce a kind of synthetic palm oil that contains as many fatty acids as its plant-derived model. In 2020, this innovative company founded by a Harvard business graduate, a biological engineer and a doctor of physics was producing only ten kilos of its palm oil alternative per week. In the meantime, twenty million dollars have been invested to support the project, in particular by the Breakthrough Energy fund, founded by Bill Gates in 2015. And the results are up to expectations as C16 Biosciences has just announced that its palm oil alternative is headed to market early next year, under the Palmless™ brand name. The company was able to commit to this timeframe after achieving industrial production estimated at 50,000 liters. While the new oil is suitable for use in a whole range of products, from food to household goods, the start-up has said that it may first come to store shelves within beauty products. “The launch of Palmless™ is a big step forward in making a palm oil alternative a reality. Consumer brands have been seeking a palm alternative for years, but have lacked a real solution - until now,” said Shara Ticku, co-founder and CEO of C16 Biosciences. “Brands using Palmless™ in their products demonstrate they are making every effort to reduce their impact on climate change.” Its use is so diverse that palm oil holds the title of most consumed oil in the world, far ahead of soybean oil, rapeseed oil and sunflower oil. It can be found in nut butter spreads, chips, in instant stock cube, and a wide array of personal care products, including shampoos and lipstick. According to C16 Biosciences, palm oil is found in nearly 50% of products on supermarket shelves in the US. In order to meet this demand, the country’s imports of palm oil have increased by nearly 30% since 2014. Indonesia and Malaysia lead in terms of volume, providing 85% of the world’s production, according to the WWF. The agricultural areas devoted to palm groves continue to expand: in 2020, in Malaysia, there were 5.3 million hectares compared to 3.3 million in 2000. In addition to deforestation and soil pollution, this form of agriculture also takes away space from certain species such as orangutans and elephants. Palm oil widespread use can be explained through its lower cost compared to other vegetable oils. This will be a determining factor for the success of the alternative solution proposed by C16 Biosciences."
Cosmetic 360: Beauty manufacturers innovate to offer more frugal products,"Cosmetic 360, the trade show dedicated to cosmetic innovation, brought together around 4,000 visitors and more than 200 exhibitors on October 12 and 13, 2022 at the Carrousel du Louvre in Paris, France. Reduction of the global carbon footprint, shorter supply chain circuits, innovative supply chains, improved waste management, reduction of transport and packaging pollution: this year, cosmetic makers were the best supporters of more responsible models. At a time when the impact of water consumption linked to cosmetic products is a major issue for our industry, with global warming heaping added pressure on freshwater resources, anhydrous formulations were ubiquitous, coming in several formats, such as powders, sticks, and tablets. ABC Texture, for instance, showcased a reinvented cushion wby remonving the applicator thanks to a memory shape anhydrous texture free from silicone. With a natural origin index of at least 97%, the formula offers a soft focus powder effect. Global Beauty Consulting, which had presented at Luxe Pack Monaco, an anti-aging serum in a stick, in partnership with Superga Beauty and Cosmogen, this time explored the potential of powders for the formulation of anhydrous make-up products. Inavive Lab launched an eco-designed solid sunscreen free from water and chemical filters. The formula protects the marine environment and is suitable for the whole family from the age of three. The format is less bulky than liquid sunscreens and avoids generating plastic waste. Marie Pratt Cosmetics highlighted their solid sunscreen stick (SPF30) free from chemical filters. The 100% natural formula is non-greasy and streak-free upon application and is suitable for cardboard packaging. As for Laboratoires Paris Dôme, a new complete range of solid cosmetics was in the spotlight: wet powder, dry powder, cold saponification, hot pouring, soluble micellar water or shower gel, a shampoo stick, soluble skin cream, etc. Lyophitech presented its freeze-drying solution designed to support manufacturers. The technology transforms plant extracts and formulations into tablets that are easy to handle and dose. Nuwen put the spotlight the focus was on a new format of cleansing gel: a soluble tablet allowing to reduce packaging without impacting the sensory qualities of the product. Its minimalistic and highly nature-based formula contains only essential ingredients and sulfate-free surfactants for an excellent foaming effect. The must-see product at Technature was a hand cleanser formulation in the form of solid beads that melt when they come into contact with water and transform into a cleansing foam. Two of them are enough to clean one’s hands. Technature also presents a hydrogel stick formulated with red algae. Its ultra-fresh film-forming effect allows quick and targeted application to the eye contour area. Upcycling confirmed to be a fast-growing trend in cosmetics,. For instance, Alpol Cosmétique has shown with its new Upcycl’Care range, that it is possible to formulate skincare products with upcycled ingredients that are not limited to active ingredients. Portugal’s HPRD (Health Products Research and Development) showcased an exfoliant using the cherry pits upcycled from by-products of the food industry. For its part, JRS Rettenmaier showcased a series of minimalist formulas, free from surfactants and fragrances, and very pleasing to the senses, based on apple by-products for highly recycled natural cosmetics. Eventually, Sarbec Cosmetics debuted a 100% natural cream enriched with upcycled “hyperactive” pomegranate with a soft and melting texture for day-to-day skincare."
Superga Beauty creates natural fragrances with innovative galenics,"Superga Beauty is continuing to roll out its full-service offering across all areas of the fragrance category. During this must-visit event for luxury brands, the French manufacturer presented a series of innovations focusing on natural ingredients and sensoriality. As fundamental products in promotional perfume box sets, scented derivatives (body lotion, shower gel, aftershave, etc.) have not escaped the trend of natural products and brand specifications must now be sure to integrate this natural dimension into product formulations. Created in partnership with GBC laboratory, an expert in natural product formulations, Superga Beauty’s new range of natural scented derivatives named EcoScent+ offers natural formulations that please all five senses, with a controlled cost, and the ability to integrate the specific ingredients of fine fragrances. “Our experts have successfully mastered the development of effective natural galenic formulations, which are extremely stable, and able to use existing scents, without any change being needed to the formula”, stated Leslie Bréau Méniger, CEO of Superga Beauty. This all-new range of natural products — featuring a shower gel, body lotion, after-shave balm and hand cream all made with a minimum of 95% natural ingredients — is aimed at perfume brands and Indie Brands who wish to create multi-product box sets promoting their fragrances. “Thanks to our Superga EcoScent+ range, we are able to offer a 360-degree service for brans or, even further up the ladder, project funders. We welcome them with an idea to be implemented, and then are able to make a proposed style guide, design, fragrances and then create the products – formulation and packaging – matching the ideas on which we have agreed. We handle everything, all the way up to joint packaging of the box set”, continued Leslie Bréau Méniger. “Cost management continues to be a fundamental element in the development of scented derivatives, but not the only one. With Ecoscent+, we support brands in their new focus on eco-responsibility which is now so key to the perfume sector, and fulfilling our role as industrial partner with our clients”, adds Leslie Bréau Méniger. In partnership with Grasse-headquartered perfume maker Expressions Parfumées, Superga Beauty introduced Parfum en Eau, a brand-new range of eight scents based the Aquaco patented technology, which allows to concentrate the most powerful scented essences, in water, without the need alcohol. The result is a transparent liquid, with a non-sticky texture which lasts and has an intensity comparable to that of any alcohol-based fragrance. These alcohol-free perfume formulations boast the advantage of being allergy-free and non-milky. They are packaged in transparent non-lacquered packaging and tint-free bottles. The technology can indeed be used for fine perfume making, and is also available in a Cosmos (natural) version. This new approach to formulation can also be used to create children and baby products, fresh water products, scented hair mists and home fragrances."
L’Oréal creates more inclusive sun care products for Brazilian skins,"L’Oréal Brasil is expanding its sun care portfolio to better address the huge diversity of skin phenotypes in the country. Last year, the company’s research and innovation centre developed 11 new coloured sunscreen formulas, increasing its range from 32 to 43 shades dedicated to Brazilian skins. Another change implemented by the company with the aim to provide Brazil’s diversity with more inclusive sunscreens: a new nomenclature to classify sun care shades based on a simple numerical scale ranging from 1.0 to 6.0, from the lightest to darker. This evolution was designed by L’Oréal’s Consumer & Market Insights team, in partnership with Estúdio Nina, a Brazilian agency specializing in the expectations of colour consumer. A large survey was launched among dermatologists, make-up artists, Black consumers and members of L’Oréal Brasil’s AfrouSOU network. The goal was to understand how the coloured consumers perceived the previous names given to the various sunscreen shades and to collect proposals for establishing a new nomenclature. This graduated scale will first be introduced in the Anthelios Ultra Cover and Anthelios Airlicium+ ranges, by La Roche-Posay, Capital Soleil UV-Age Daily, by Vichy, and Solar Expertise Anti Oil, by L’Oréal Paris. By 2024, the entire coloured sun care portfolio of L’Oréal Brasil will have transitioned to the new nomenclature. Due to its geographical and climatic characteristics, Brazil enjoys strong sunshine across most of its territory throughout the year. As a manufacturer of sun protection products, L’Oréal Brasil aims to raise awareness among the Brazilian population about the importance of photoprotection for all skin types, including darker ones, due to the risk of cancer caused by excessive sun exposure. “The sun’s UV rays affect all skin types, regardless of their colour. For lighter skin types, which blush immediately, the impact of UV is more easily visible, hence the myth that darker skin types don’t need as much protection. We want to remind consumers that sun protection is important for everyone, because it protects against premature aging, hyperpigmentation and above all against the appearance of skin tumours"", emphasizes Humberto Martins, director of cosmetic research and innovation for L’Oréal Latin America."
Deardot: Anhydrous skin care products in water-soluble sachets,"Straight from South Korea, the brand known for its anhydrous single-dose sheet-type products that transform into a light foam upon contact with water is taking another step towards zero waste with 100% water-soluble and plastic free sachets. On the occasion of the Cosmetic 360 trade show, which was held on October 12 and 13 at the Carrousel du Louvre in Paris, Deardot presented two new versions of its nomadic and ultra-practical anhydrous skincare products, this time packaged in sachets which dissolve in water in seconds, with “no pollutant residue”. For its new Dangyuja Face Cleanser Sheets and Dangyuja Body Cleanser Sheets, packaged in individual sachets, Deadot is therefore shifting from biodegradable paper used in the packaging of its previous products to a brand new solution. After using the cleanser, the sachet dissolves in the sink and can be flushed down the drain “with no worries about the environment,” claims the brand. Easy to Easy to carry and use, Deardot’s anhydrous sheets are lightweight and hygienic. They combine a low carbon footprint and a sustainable packaging. Deardot’s solution was rewarded by the jury of the Cosmetic 360 Awards in the packaging category."
Superga Beauty introduces a solid and eco-responsible anti-age serum,"Surfing on the wave of popularity of stick products, which are increasingly being used in the facial care universe, boosted by start-ups such as Maison Dakōta, or more established brands in search of naturalness and sustainability, Hyalustick is an anti-aging serum in a solid, refillable stick format for direct use on the skin. Thanks to its high concentration of natural hyaluronic acid, combined with a natural addition of three active anti-age ingredients it perfectly combines an immediate smoothing action with deep-acting effect on wrinkles and ageing. “Effective, natural and strong on the senses,” the Hyalustick also saves 56% of plastic thanks to its refill system, according to Superga Beauty. This innovation is proposed in Cosmogen’s Stick ReUse, a recyclable, watertight and reloadable mono-material (PP) patented packaging. The tube can be filled from the top or from the bottom and can therefore be adapted to different industrial tools. The formula was developed by Global Beauty Consulting (GBC), the creative laboratory partnering with Superga Beauty. “Hyalustick meets a dual objective and is on-point with trends. Unique for a serum, it reinvents easy-use facial care, which can be applied directly, with a gentle hand massage. It meets the current challenges of eco-responsibility, with a 99% natural formulation, combined with recyclable packaging and refillable, saving on raw materials”, explains Leslie Bréau Méniger, CEO of Superga Beauty. Hyalustick can be customized and adapted to the specific needs of beauty brands through Superga Beauty’s full-service offer. At the Luxe Pack Monaco tradeshow, the Superga Beauty group also highlighted its full-service Upcycling offer, also in partnership with GBC, in addition to its full range of expertise - across perfumes, cosmetic and joint packaging - with an offer ranging from the manufacture of a single accessory to complete development of a finished product."
Anhydrous and nomadic: Maison Dakōta reinvents the shape of skincare products,"""We wanted to completely rethink the consumer experience for luxury skincare products. So we decided to divert the lipstick from its original form and adapt it to totally innovative, solid, water-free, yet highly sensorial skincare formulas that can be taken everywhere in a handbag,"" explains Piergil Fourquié, a Parisian designer and co-founder of the brand. Maison Dakōta proposes a never-before-seen product line: premium solid and nomadic skincare products. ""If more and more hygiene and toiletry products can be found in a solid format, skincare products are still rare in this galenical form and almost non-existent when you go upmarket,"" underlines Eva Jouët, co-founder of the brand and also Sales Director of Premium Beauty News. Anhydrous solid formats indeed have the advantage of making saving on the weight of water in the products. In addition to its environmental benefits, this solution allowed adapting it to people on the go. ""We wanted to extend the use of skincare products beyond the bathroom to allow women to protect their skin, anywhere, anytime,"" adds the founder. ""As a starting point, we took the real needs of consumers to come up with a solution matching their expectations"". Maison Dakōta takes its name from Native American hunter-gatherer peoples of North America’s plains and forests. ""We wanted to pay tribute to these peoples who, in their traditional way of life, only took from nature what they strictly needed, who were aware of being part of a whole, alongside animals to which they paid homage through totems,"" explains Piergil Fourquié. With this in mind, Maison Dakōta devised a refill system that would limit the consumption of resources and reduce packaging waste. In a similar vein, the formulas were designed to combine ease of use and efficiency in an ultra-compact format. ""The ideal of sobriety has influenced the entire development process,"" admit the two co-founders. ""This led us to do less, but better, to get to the essence thanks to concentrated actives, sometimes even obtained through upcycling."" Free of water, natural formulas can also do without preservatives while maintaining maximum shelf life. These are all choices that involved taking up many technical challenges. ""The project was an ambitious and difficult to implement. The natural and anhydrous formulas made the filling of the stick particularly difficult,"" explains Eva Jouët. In particular, it was necessary to find a company capable of carrying out the project within the budgetary constraints of a start-up. This was quite a challenge, as Maison Dakōta was keen to have products that were 100% made in France. ""Fortunately, the market is changing and suppliers are aware that a large part of the activity is moving towards young emerging brands. The project was technically difficult, but supporting young innovative start-ups is one area where manufacturers really have the opportunity to differentiate themselves,"" she points out. The French brand is now starting its meetings with its customers, through a pre-sales campaign on the Ulule platform from 22 September 2022. ""This is the culmination of many months of research and development. We recently presented our range, with four innovative products. The first feedback is positive. We now have to bring it all to fruition,"" conclude the two founders. The range consists of an Eye Contour, made up of 98% natural ingredients, including a moisturising upcycled coffee oil rich in antioxidants; a Face Care (98% natural) to apply on blemishes for an absorbing and mattifying effect and an immediate corrective effect, made up of upcycled avocado to regulate sebum secretion, volcanic perlite and Candelilla wax; a nourishing and protective Lip Balm, 100% natural thanks to a blend of natural waxes, vegetable oils and shea butter, and finally a solid Pink Pepper Perfume (90% natural), alcohol-free and rich in plant-based emollients. And to match the container with the content, the packaging of each product displays the totem animal to whose protection it is entrusted: the eagle for the eye contour, the bear for the face care, the owl for the perfume and the wolf for the lip balm."
Marionnaud partners with Revieve to debut AI sun care advisor in Italy,"The European retailer of prestige fragrances and beauty products has partnered with digital brand experience creator Revieve to develop a digital sun care advisor for its customers in Italy. Dubbed “AI Suncare Advisor”, the tool has been designed to provide consumers a hyper-personalized brand experience that helps them discover the most suitable sun care routine based on their skin, their environment, and their lifestyle preferences. ""Suncare products have historically had a bad reputation. Most people think they are sticky, messy, and only suited to one skin type. That reputation plus lack of sun prevention education makes some people shy away from sun protection,"" says Sampo Parkkinen, CEO of Revieve. “At the same time, consumers are more than ever vocal about their concerns for proper sun care and the need for personalized options to protect their skin from the harmful effects of sun exposure.” This gap inspired Revieve and Marionnaud to develop a new way to enlighten consumers about the importance of sun protection, and help them better understand their skin concerns and conditions, while guiding them on their personal sun care journey. ""The challenge was to provide all that within one seamless online experience,"" emphasizes Parkkinen. Available on the retailer’s website the experience consists of three easy steps. At first, consumers input their concerns and expectations out of a sun care routine. Next, they take a selfie that’s analysed with patented mobile selfie diagnostics based on advanced selfie skin metrics to detect essential sun exposure concerns, such as hyperpigmentation, melasma, freckles, and wrinkles. Finally, the user is provided with an optimal sun care routine proposal consisting in a curated list of Marionnaud sun care products. ""The AI Suncare Advisor makes it easier for customers to find suitable sun care products tailored to their desired sun care goals. Accounting for each individual user’s lifestyle, the AI Suncare Advisor empowers Marionnaud shoppers to educate themselves about their skin health and needs by taking into consideration skin tone, skin type, personal skin health concerns, current lifestyle and environmental factors that may affect their skin,"" concludes Parkkinen."
Who are the winners of the MakeUp in NewYork IT Awards 2022?,"MakeUp in NewYork’s Innovation & Trends (IT) Awards are open free of charge to all exhibitors at the show. They are allowed to submit up to three skincare and makeup innovations. This year, 22 new skincare and makeup products and packaging, among more than 100 products in the competition, were nominated to participate to the second step. Eventually, the jury [1] awarded four innovations and a “jury’s favorite”, in the following categories: Accessory, Formulation, Full Service and Packaging. The IT Award in the “Accessories” category was attributed to “The Ocean Brush” by Raphaël Make-Up Brushes: the handle is made of 50% shell and 50% bioplastic derived from the castor plant, and the head is made of 65% recycled fiber from PET bottle waste and 35% raw fiber. In the “Formulation” category, the award went to OPAC for their Beauty Pills, based on a “Fast Disgregation System"" formulation technology (patent pending), which makes it possible to obtain a 0.14 g solid tablet that, when in contact with water or a serum, transforms into a 2.2 ml cream-gel with a light and velvety texture. This technology, which is fully customizable in terms of active ingredients and performance, introduces whole new prospects in the beauty industry which is precisely seeking innovative and sustainable dosage forms. In the same category, Regi’s Cherry Smack was voted “Jury’s favorite”. The innovation consists in an emulsion transformed into a lipstick in stick form, which retains all the benefits of a cream or serum, and provides a lasting sensation of freshness. Its formula, based on organic cherry extract (48%), glycerin and phytosterols, benefits from a process that allows the use of a very low pigment load (3%) while obtaining a high coverage. The Full Service IT Award went to R&D Color for their A316 Royal Balm, a lip balm in a stick pen made of bio-based materials with a sensory formula that glides on the lips while providing a pulpy effect. Although completely transparent, its texture gives a unique pinkish tint to the lips that varies according to the skin’s pH. In the “Packaging” category, the jury awarded Taesung for their 100% PP Mono Material Airless. This 100% Polypopropylene mono airless has passed the leakage test with the same standard as a normal airless, i.e. 600 mmHg for 10 minutes. With a minimalist design, it also distinguishes itself from existing mono airless by its 0.5cc dosage, ideal for creamy cosmetic formulas. The next edition of MakeUp in NewYork will be held on September 21 and 21, 2023."
"""Inclusive make-up is still a long way off,"" Aïmara Coupet, Be+Radiance","Premium Beauty News - When you speak of Be+Radiance, you prefer using the term healthy make-up rather than clean make-up. Aïmara Coupet -  Clean to me doesn’t mean much. It’s simply about choosing ingredients that are healthy for the environment and people. The same goes for organic and natural, many things in naturalness can harm the skin. We also hear a lot about skincare make-up, but what is it really? Silicone-based products, a petrochemical mineral oil, to which a few drops of hyaluronic acid and a couple of good ingredients have been added. It doesn’t respect the skin and provides no benefits, on the contrary. It’s only marketing, and it misleads consumers. Healthy make-up means that it is really good for the skin and does not offset the effects of our beauty routine. It should be part of it and not just a cosmetic cover-up. This is tomorrow’s make-up and this is the process Be+Radiance is part of. Premium Beauty News - More and more probiotic-based skincare products are appearing on store shelves. You have integrated them into your make-up formulas. How did you become aware of their potential? Aïmara Coupet - In 2018, during a Premium Beauty News Day, I met a doctor in biology who was presenting his work on probiotic encapsulations and their benefits to the skin. His goal was to maintain the probiotic bacteria alive. These encapsulations were very complicated to integrate into cosmetics, but not impossible in make-up products. My foundation was not on the market yet but I was already thinking of developing powder blushes and illuminators. This is how we ended up formulating them with probiotic encapsulations. Our face oil also contains them and users are delighted with them. Studying microbiota is fascinating. We realise how important it is to not impair its balance. However, we do this daily by using active ingredients such as retinol, for example, which are ultra-aggressive and have a disturbing effect rather than a healing effect. Premium Beauty News - You are particularly committed to inclusive beauty. Why is that? Aïmara Coupet - My mother is from Martinique and has black skin. Throughout my childhood, she never managed to find lipsticks or foundations suited to her skin tone on the stands of leading luxury brands. So I was faced with this issue from an early age, but it was only when I came to Black Up that I realised how much of a problem to women it was. Darker skins have completely different skincare and make-up needs, but this difference is not acknowledged and the market wants to stick to a one size fits all approach. Let’s take the example of silicone: if lighter skins may benefit from the occlusion effect they provide, this is less true for melanin-rich skins. I also have in mind sunscreens and nacres that tend to make darker skins look grey. Shadows and highlights are not worked in the same way because curves and reliefs are different. The same is true for the lips. Premium Beauty News - With Fenty or Huda Beauty, it seems that progress has been made on the subject of inclusion? Aïmara Coupet - In my opinion, there is clearly a before and after Fenty. There were already a lot of foundation shades available from MAC, Estée Lauder, Clinique or Lancôme. But Rihanna has really revolutionised things by thinking equitably about the needs of all women. This is the first time that a launch was done with a range built in a rainbow and not shade extension. The same goes for textures, which were also designed for both matte and dark skins. Rihanna adopted an inclusive approach from the start and that is what makes her brand so successful. Huda Kattan undertook a similar process with Middle Eastern women. Premium Beauty News - Today, a lot of brands advertise ranges of 30, 40 or 50 foundation shades. Is this the inclusion you’ve been hoping for? Aïmara Coupet - In the wake of Fenty, all the brands wanted to offer ranges of 50 shades or more. But that’s not the point. Today, we need to have a real understanding of the differences in the structure and needs of the skin. That’s inclusion and that’s my vision for the future. The day when we will come up with ranges that are thought through to the end to take into account the specificities of all skins, then we will be inclusive. It’s complicated to get people’s attention on the topics surrounding diversity and inclusivity. In all development teams, non-Caucasian skins are under-represented. We are far too Caucasian-centred. Very little has been invested in understanding the needs of melanin-rich skins. Dark skin is an extraordinary medium, you can do magnificent things... as long as you have the knowledge and the will to do so. Premium Beauty News - Your cucumber water foundation only comes in 17 shades? Aïmara Coupet - What is important to me is equity. My rainbow is quite proportionate. There are ranges with more shades than mine, but less choice for coloured skins. It’s not logical. Besides, finding one’s shade is a debatable notion in make-up. You don’t look for a product that matches your skin tone, but rather the right shade to correct your flaws and make your skin look even without it looking too flashy. We don’t want to conceal our skin, we want something that will unify, correct, give radiance and blend well. Premium Beauty News - What are the prospects for Be+Radiance? Aïmara Coupet - A seed fundraising in 2020 allowed us to launch the powders and the probiotic oil, and also to beef up our teams, especially in R&D. After two years, our concept has been validated but we need the means to go further. We have been working for a few months on a new seed survey to expand our range and distribution, particularly to enter the North American market."
Prince Charles is launching a Highgrove-scented perfume with Penhaligon’s,"Soak up the scent of the gardens of Prince Charles’ estate at Highgrove in Gloucestershire. This is what Penhaligon’s is proposing with its first fragrance inspired and created by the Prince of Wales. And while the perfume house is used to taking a humorous approach with its olfactory characters that poke gentle fun at the British aristocracy, here it pays tribute to ""the magnificent fragrance of Highgrove gardens in summer, when the odour of blossoming, weeping silver lime fills the air."" Named Highgrove Bouquet, this fragrance is indeed an ode to the gardens of Highgrove House, the residence of the royal family member now nicknamed ""Grandpa Wales."" A real floral explosion, the fragrance is characterized by scents of silver lime, geranium and lavender and seems to be already a hit on social networks. In line with the Prince’s environmental vision, the project has been developed with the aim to replace all plastic from the secondary packaging, using 100% recycled and recyclable paper and sugar cane eco-foam, and printing with all organic ink, free of mineral oils. Exclusively available in the United Kingdom, the perfume ""Highgrove Bouquet"" is sold at a price of 155 pounds (around 180 US dollars or Euros) per 100 ml. Part of the proceeds from the sale will go to Prince Charles’ charity, The Prince’s Foundation. The foundation offers education and training programmes across a broad range of disciplines, from artisanal and heritage craft skills to horticulture and engineering. These are available for all ages and backgrounds, with many programmes taking place at Highgrove itself. This isn’t the first time Prince Charles has gone off the beaten path with unexpected product launches. Like Queen Elizabeth II, in 2020 he unveiled his own organic gin, also inspired and created from the plants of the Highgrove garden. A year earlier, it was a collection of ethical clothing that had been launched by a duo of designers with nettles harvested from Highgrove estate."
TiL and Francis Kurkdjian create fragrance with objectified soothing effects,"The virtues of linden go far beyond evening herbal tea. After a fulfilling experience in the beauty industry, Sylvie Polette and her sister Odile revived their childhood memories bathed in the smell of linden at their Dordogne family estate to develop a comprehensive self-care range that pays tribute to this age-old tree. “We felt like exploring the physiological and holistic properties of this tree, because it is so evocative of happiness. We found out that this plant was in the Pharmacopoeia for its anti-spasmodic and liver- and kidney-detoxifying virtues. Together with the Greentech laboratory team, which carried out the chemical and biochemical analyses, we discovered that linden was also very rich in moisturizing, soothing, and antioxidant molecules, which makes it a very complete anti-ageing ingredient. And then, there is this smell, whose facets are closely related to the popular emotional unconscious. But it is hardly used by perfumers. This tree is good for the skin, body and mind,” says the brand’s co-founder. Based on these new data, the brand’s development was driven by a global approach which included cosmetics, food supplements, and an eau de toilette. The Eau qui Enlace fragrance is a wrapping, white floral smell close to orange blossom, with musky and honey notes. “Linden is a silent flower. Francis Kurkdjian did an extraordinary olfactory job. We told him the story of our estate in Dordogne, of our childhood memories, the wellness we felt, and the whole product environment we wanted to create. He felt like creating a contemporary, luminous, very bright linden – a writing style that would be as delicate and authentic as possible and evoke a picnic under the trees on a summer Sunday,” explains the co-founder.
The perfumer also worked on each cosmetic galenic form based on this storyline, with different facets for each product. Just like they had objectified their skincare formulas, the founders wanted to scientifically assess the emotional impact of their perfume, moved as they were by the public’s enthusiasm. A real action was demonstrated based on a measuring protocol developed and executed by neuroscientists Francis Vial and Arnaud Aubert, of the Emospin company specialized in the study of emotions. The protocol was based on the analysis of various components of emotions through verbalization, the emotional charge created by the voice, the words used, the tone, but also the respiration rate… “We cross-reference the verbal and non-verbal methods which, combined by an algorithm, help quantify the hedonic potential of the experience, by characterizing the emotion felt by the subjects when they discover the perfume,” explains Francis Vial. Three keywords were expressed by the 22 women consulted as part of the study: joy, appeasement and comfort. “Comfort had never been related to a perfume in a study,” says Sylvie Polette. “What was very interesting about this fragrance was that the results did not really vary from one individual to another, it is the lowest variability ever observed. With perfumes, there is always someone that says ‘I don’t like it’. Indeed, depending on the many memory, but also sensorial, psychological, or genetic dimensions, there are things to which we are hardly responsive, and we will even be on the defensive. Here, on the contrary, this perfume actually gets optimum acceptance, there is even a sort of craze for it,” adds the neuroscientist. L’Eau qui Enlace is gentle; there is something intimate about it: it gets top scores in terms of pleasure and relaxation, which confirms the power of olfaction on the emotional state – if proof were needed. Launched in September 2021, TiL is available on the brand’s e-shop, til-time.com, as well as through the Beauty Success network. It should open to the European market in 2023."

Naturality is at the core of Schwan Cosmetics’ new eyeliner and kajal,"Presented at the latest edition of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna, Schwan Cosmetics’ Core eyeliner and kajal combines 90% Natural Origin Content (NOC) with clean and vegan ingredients.

UVMune 400: L’Oréal’s new sun care technology against ultra-long UVA rays,"Available in pharmacies since March 2022 in several markets, including Europe, South America, South-East Asia and South Africa, La Roche-Posay’s Anthelios UVMune 400 is L’Oréal ‘s first range of products to benefit from this technology based on Mexoryl 400 [1], a new generation of UV filters. According to L’Oréal, it is the first that is able to block efficiently ultra-long UVA rays from 380 nm, which alone accounts for 30% of UV sun rays [2]. “These long UVA rays penetrate the epidermis the most and are among the main causes of skin aging. They also contribute to the development of skin cancer, along with other UVA and UVB rays,” said the French group in a statement. ""Our L’Oréal R&I teams have successfully risen to the real scientific challenge of inventing a sun filtering technology to cover the UVA zone that was so far less covered. This allows us to provide our broadest filtration and protect the skin from the damaging effects of the sun, even the most insidious. This discovery is fully in line with the Group’s approach of providing answers to public health issues, such as the risks linked to skin exposure to UV radiation,"" explains Barbara Lavernos, Deputy CEO in charge of Research, Innovation and Technology at L’Oréal. This launch follows on from several decades of innovation by the L’Oréal group’s R&I in terms of protection against UV radiation. The group obtained its first patent for a sun protection oil in the 1930s. In 1982, L’Oréal launched Mexoryl SX, a filter that was effective against short UVA rays and was photostable and hydrophilic. In 1985, it obtained the first photostabilization patent of the Parsol 1789, which made it possible to filter UVA rays up to 360 nm. In 1989, L’Oréal debuted Mexoryl XL, a soluble lipophilic molecule capable of absorbing UVB and short UVA rays and increasing the effectiveness of other filters. With UVMune 400, the solar filtration range is increased by 20 nm. According to L’Oréal, it took 10 years of research to design the new technology, which also benefits from an improved environmental profile. Tested on all skin types and phototypes, La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 is available as either Invisible Fluid SPF50+ or Hydrating Cream SPF50+."
Mono Skincare puts luxury skincare in tablets and offers own technology,"Powders are gaining ground on the segment of anhydrous solutions that help get rid of single-use packaging. Laurie Mias, the founder of the Mono Skincare brand, preferred an even more compact version unique on the skincare market. “I wanted a convenient solution. Powder can absorb moisture, and it is always hard to get the right quantity of product, so I started from the idea of pills, which did not exist in the cosmetics industry,” she explains. It took her two years to develop this project focused on an actually unexplored galenic form with a laboratory located in Belgium. Now, the patents she registered make it possible to share her private brand solution with other market players. “It is a revolution in skincare. No one has done that before, even on the global level. I hope others will follow us,” says the founder. The Mono Skincare range is composed of 14 references – makeup remover, face cleanser, toner, day cream, serum, deodorant, body mist – with 100% natural formulas and renewable, traceable ingredients sourced in Europe. They are suitable for pregnant women, children, and hypersensitive skins. One tablet can produce 50 ml of solution. Once water has been added, the product is reconstituted in 30 minutes and can be used for six months. Undiluted, a tablet can be stored for 12 months (tests are being carried out to validate the 24-month storage). “We have designed each product with a very specific promise, focusing on efficacy: results are visible after four days, by acting on the microbiome, integrating prebiotics to nourish the flora. And we took great care to use at least the minimum concentration levels required for ingredients to really have an effect,” explains Laurie Mias. Packaging is made of recyclable and/or recycled materials: glass, wood, aluminium. All bottles can be refilled over and over. On the e-shop launched last January in French, the brand mainly received encouraging feedback on this new form of beauty. “More than 40% of our customers have already recommended their tablets. The comments are extremely positive,” says the founder. “We wanted to create a very inclusive range; there are many men among our customers, as well as people of all ages. The younger ones like the innovation, while the sophisticated, efficient assets, in particular anti-ageing formulas, help us reach customers aged 50+. As for the price, our products are affordable, about EUR 30, so we offer a high quantity/quality ratio. Then, customers only need to buy the refill,” she adds. The brand had already confirmed its presence at Sephora Hong Kong and Singapore within the next six months, and it should sign with several major companies in the US, the UK, Australia, and of course, France."
"“LED light therapy helps minimize wrinkles,” Dr. Jason Wersland, Therabody","At first glance, the TheraFace Pro looks like some kind of futuristic space gun. What is it exactly? Dr. Jason WerslanD - TheraFace PRO is the ultimate all-in-one device for facial health, bringing together science-backed treatments and innovative technology with eight treatments in a single, handheld device. This device utilizes the proprietary percussive therapy technology we use in Theragun but optimized for the face — the result is reduced tension, relaxed facial muscles and a deeper level of care for the face. There are already devices on the market that focus on massage and LED light. How does the TheraFace Pro differ from these beauty tech products? Dr. Jason WerslanD - The TheraFace PRO is unique compared to other massage and LED light therapy devices because it combines both of those treatments and more, all into one. Not only does TheraFace PRO include three different light therapies — red, blue, and red + infrared — but it also gives you cleansing, percussive therapy, microcurrent, and cryothermal treatments. We believe in creating products and solutions that will help people reimagine the way they think about whole-body wellness; when it came to TheraFace PRO, we didn’t want to create a beauty device like every other one on the market that works primarily on the surface of the skin. Instead, we created an innovative device and introduced an entirely new category to the market, facial health, which targets much more than that surface layer of the skin - it allows you to care for the deeper layers of the skin and the 40+ muscles in the face, which are often overlooked. Did you work with skin and health experts to develop the device? Dr. Jason WerslanD - Everything we do at Therabody is backed by science, and TheraFace PRO is no different. We went through rigorous research and development to create an effective, all-in-one facial device and worked extensively with dermatologists, scientists, medical doctors and skin health experts through the product development process to carefully perfect each modality and understand its benefits for the face. The device is designed to get rid of wrinkles, fine lines and acne, to massage, to improve skin’s radiance and tone, and even to cleanse it... Does this mean we can throw out all our creams, serums and other anti-wrinkle products? Dr. Jason WerslanD - TheraFace PRO is not a replacement for other products but can be used to enhance the effects of creams, serums, and other products. The way LED light therapy helps minimize fine lines and wrinkles, for example, will work in a different way than the chemical makeup of a serum works — but together, they should create an even longer-lasting effect. Similarly, the hot ring for TheraFace PRO is great to use alongside creams or moisturizers — heat therapy helps those solutions to absorb into the skin faster and deeper. The cosmetics industry is increasingly interested in LED light. What makes it a go-to for skincare today? Dr. Jason WerslanD - LED light has become progressively more popular among consumers because of its versatility and recent increase in accessibility. We recognized the major benefits LED light therapy can have on facial health, so we decided to incorporate that into TheraFace PRO. Red LED light is intended to reduce wrinkles, fine lines, and mild acne scars. Red + infrared light takes those benefits to the next level and adds a therapeutic warming effect that goes deeper into the muscles to temporarily reduce pain and discomfort. Blue LED light can be described as a disinfecting light therapy for the face — it helps treat mild to moderate acne and breakouts. The TheraFace Pro is about beauty, health and wellbeing, drawing on the very concept of holistic beauty, which is often associated more with nature than with technology. Can the two be compatible? Dr. Jason WerslanD - Absolutely! Therabody’s entire ecosystem of products and services are at that intersection of nature and technology, and help people work toward achieving holistic wellness. Holistic wellness is more about connecting the wellness of your body and mind than anything else — and this is a construct we keep as a north star through every product we develop. The pandemic has accelerated the arrival of professional-style care at home, but can a device really be as effective as expert treatment? Dr. Jason WerslanD - TheraFace PRO does not replace seeing your dermatologist or esthetician if you are working with them on a specific condition, but it is important to keep up with home care in between treatments. For tips and tricks to get the most out of your TheraFace PRO at home, we have carefully curated a series of ‘how-to’ videos on each attachment, as well as facial routines using a mix of treatments, which are available on our website or by scanning the QR code on your device. Is the device suitable for all skin types? Dr. Jason WerslanD - TheraFace PRO is suitable for all skin types. Since every face is different, our versatile eight-in-one device can meet the needs of everybody, no matter your facial health goals. Prior to launching our latest innovation, we conducted a 12-week clinical study with participants ranging from ages 25-61, presenting all skin types. The study yielded amazing results, with 97% showing a reduction in wrinkles around the eyes and increased firmness. The TheraFace Pro is priced at €399, so it is not necessarily accessible to most people. What makes it is a sound and cost-effective investment? Dr. Jason WerslanD - TheraFace PRO is the first facial health product to offer such a wide range of personalized treatments. Gone are the days of spending hundreds of euros on multiple products and devices; this one, easy-to-use, versatile and customizable device helps you simplify your life and your facial routine based on your current and future needs."
Pink Frogs introduces the first eco-label compliant SPF 50+ sun oil,"With the EU Ecolabel no longer limited to “rinse off cosmetic products”, new development opportunities arose within the cosmetic industry to provide more products in line with the expectations of consumers. To provide brands the possibility of green claims with an official seal, Pink Frogs Cosmetics has developed the first SPF 50+ sunscreen ready to get the European Union eco-label stamp. The Italian contract manufacturer describes its new Smart Rolling Sun Oil as “the first sunscreen product designed according to the criteria required from Ecolabel, the European Union’s ecological quality label for cosmetics with a reduced environmental impact throughout their entire life cycle.” The product was evaluated for its biodegradability and a low aquatic toxicity. According to Pink Frogs, the vegan formula is free from nanomaterials and allergens, and ocean and coral reef friendly, while offering safe protection against UV rays. Beyond the formula, the product also benefits from a refillable recycled plastic packaging allowing a 60% reduction in plastic consumption. Last but not least, “dispensing the product via a roll-on helps to reduce product wastage by facilitating the application of the desired dose,” explains Eleonora Tauriello, marketing manager, Pink Frogs Cosmetics."
Start-ups: AI-powered Proven Skincare launches personalized eye cream duo,"Since its launch, Proven Skincare has achieved impressive growth. The company’s sales rose from less than USD 100,000 in 2019 to USD 10 million in 2020 and to more than USD 20 million during 2021. Co-founded by strategy consultant Ming Zhao and data scientist and an engineer Dr. Amy Yuan, Proven Skincare utilizes a three-minute quiz to create an individual profile based upon more than 45 categories, including skincare goals, geography, genetics, lifestyle, and more. The promise of this data crushing is a personalized combination of ingredients matching the customer’s specific skincare needs initially delivered in a set of three different products: a day moisturizer, a cleanser and a night cream. To create the individual profiles, the algorithm created by Proven is capable of interrogating the ""Skin Genome Project"", an in-house database of built over 28 million consumer reviews and 4,000 skin-related research papers. According to the creators, it is “the largest beauty database on earth”. The same technology was used to create Proven Skincare’s two new products: Personalized Day Eye Cream and Personalized Night Eye Cream. The creation of the duo comes after Proven surveyed its community about its skincare needs. Findings include: – 70% worry about wrinkles on their face.
– 43% of those worry about eye wrinkles and crow’s feet.
– 58% are concerned about undereye bags.
– 82% are at least a little concerned about dark circles under the eyes. Like all of Proven’s products, the two formulations are tailor-made to work for an individual’s unique skin and in harmony with its specific lifestyle and environmental factors. “We considered the smallest details such as stress levels, hours of sleep, local pollution levels, and water hardness to create a unique solution that brightens users’ eyes and combats signs of aging like crow’s feet or dark circles,” said Proven co-founder and CEO Ming S. Zhao. As for Proven’s initial range, customers have the option of taking out a subscription, then receiving regular shipments, or buying products as and when they need them. The Duo’s subscription price is USD 129.99 while the one-time purchase price is USD 179.99. On October 2021, Proven Skincare launched a USD 60 million fund-raising round under the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulation A regime. At that time, the company said its aim was to use the funds to invest in further AI innovation and talent, to expand domestic and global marketing efforts for its existing products, and to invest in further research and development of new product lines and categories."
Le Jardin Retrouvé uses the blockchain to guarantee perfume authenticity,"The blockchain technology, which combines authentication, security, transparency, eco-design, and customer relationship assets, has seduced niche perfume brand Le Jardin Retrouvé. Founded by master-perfumer Yuri Gutsatz in 1975, and then relaunched in 2017 by his son Michel Gutsatz and Clara Feder, the brand successfully banked on a strong presence on the Chinese market, which forecasts predict will soon be the second perfume market in the world. “We chose the right strategy. Sales are definitely as high as expected, and we should multiply our global turnover by three or four this year, with China as a driver,” says Michel Gutsatz. Driven by a new brand identity and a definite clean perfumery positioning, Le Jardin Retrouvé is now riding the Asian wave. “As things were going faster, we realized there was a huge problem with counterfeiting and grey markets in China. It is also a problem in France, actually,” explains Clara Feder. “All around the world, our approved distributors struggled with convincing their final customers that their products were authentic. So, this fear is everywhere. Brands and distributors all deal with the same issue on many key markets: how can we authenticate our products?” adds Michel Gutsatz. To reassure both customers and distributors and guarantee the authenticity of the products delivered, the company turned to the blockchain technology brought by Sorga. “There are only winners with this technology: the final customer fearful of buying a counterfeit, the distributor who provides evidence of his approval, and the brand which reassures customers,” says Michel Gutsatz. Beyond the guarantee of authenticity, the brand’s founders were soon convinced by the advantages of the blockchain technology as regards traceability and customer relationship. By scanning the QR Codes printed on the packaging, consumers get access to a large number of inviolable pieces of information tracing the origin and manufacturing of products. Then, once they have bought a product, they can subscribe with a code printed inside the pack to receive a certificate of ownership and be identified by the brand as the sole owner of the product. They can also get additional information about suppliers, ISO and IFRA certificates, plant locations, etc. “When a customer subscribes to the Sorga platform after buying a product, we directly receive an email to make them enter an automation flow. Then we can start a live conversation with them. It is wonderful for a brand, especially when you sell your products on the other side of the world,” explains Michel Gutsatz. “Today’s brands do not have access to their consumers across the world: now, thanks to the blockchain, they can, and it is a real step ahead,” adds Clara Feder. The platform is available in four languages, English, French, Chinese, and Spanish, but direct exchanges are automatically translated, so it can be used in any country. Le Jardin Retrouvé adopted the blockchain technology last January. The Sorga “diamond”, the QR Code, seals the secondary packaging, and the owner code is printed inside. Given the advantages it offers to the luxury product category, the blockchain technology is set to boom. Three giants of the luxury industry, Cartier (Rochemont Group), LVMH, and Prada, launched Aura a year ago: this common blockchain platform offers transparency, a guarantee of authenticity, and traceability. “In the cosmetics industry, brands mainly choose this technology for the sake of traceability. Then comes transparency: it is a strong demand, so we need to find a way to certify information. An increasing number of details will be required to reassure consumers about products’ origins, so we are going to have to make any evidence available. Countries themselves, Europe, China… they all demand that for certification and quality purposes. So, the blockchain is really likely to develop on the luxury and perfume markets,” explain the creators of Le Jardin Retrouvé."
Neurotechnologies will soon help you choose your perfume at Yves Saint Laurent,"The L’Oréal group continues to explore cutting-edge technologies for creating new beauty experiences. On the occasion of International Fragrance Day, L’Oréal, French cosmetics and fragrances giant, has announced a strategic partnership with Emotiv, the leading neurotechnology company, in order to help consumers make accurate and personalised choices around their fragrance desires. “The intersection of neurotech, AI, and science is an exciting next step. The science of choosing a fragrance is very complex. This partnership promises innovation for the entire beauty industry as this is truly the first time that consumers will have access to a state-of-the-art, in-store experience that uses neuroscience to provide personalized, precise fragrance advice,” says Guive Balooch, Head of L’Oréal’s Technology Incubator. L’Oréal hopes to renew the experience of choosing perfume in stores, through a multi-sensor headset based on electroencephalography (EEG) that connects neuro responses to fragrance preferences. The headset uses machine learning algorithms that interpret EEG, while consumers experience proprietary scent families, to provide the ability to accurately sense and monitor behavior, preferences, stress, and attention in real-world contexts. The aim is to help consumers determine their perfect scent suited to their emotions. Indeed, according to L’Oréal, people connect various emotions, including happiness and relaxation, to their scent preference. Indeed, according to L’Oréal, many consumers want their fragrance to bring them emotional benefits (77 percent) or choose a fragrance based on their mood (more than half of consumers ages 12-34). “There are thousands of fragrance options, and we know it can be challenging for consumers to navigate the vast number of scents and make a choice that’s right for them,” says Stephan Bezy, International General Manager at Yves Saint Laurent Beauté. “Through this immersive system, we were able to get 95% of people the right fragrance personalized to their needs and desires, which is enormously higher than without this technology. It’s a huge first step in this category. Once we know which scents make people feel happy, energized, or other emotions, we can customize fragrances even more - the potential is boundless.” The experience will be available worldwide in Yves Saint Laurent flagship stores in multiple countries later this year and through 2023."
Transparency & communication: beauty is adopting the blockchain,"As many industries have already done, the cosmetics sector cannot but meet the rising demand for transparency on products and manufacturing. Following the example of LVMH, the luxury world has embraced the issue with the launch of the Aura Blockchain consortium designed to help create a secure computing protocol to provide customers with a digital certificate that gives direct access to the history of the product they bought, from design to distribution, and to its authenticity certificates. The blockchain is the perfect tool for consumers to have easy access to safe information on products (formula composition, packaging, brand commitments, etc.). “Consumers no longer want declarations, they need evidence”, says Philippe Guguen, Director of the MAP Emulsion company that developed Sorga, a French blockchain technology already adopted by several cosmetics brands. For each product, Sorga creates a unique passport with a broad range of information. The main advantage of the blockchain is that, thanks to its decentralized nature, it guarantees the information is accessible to all, anytime, anywhere, but cannot be modified. “There is no central platform. It is all divided into dozens of thousands of servers. The information just cannot be deleted. When you enter a piece of information, it is signed and dated, so the cosmetics industry can guarantee the authenticity of products and fight counterfeiting,” explains Philippe Guguen. “We need to substitute storytelling marketing for evidence marketing,” confirms Maxime Finaz de Villaine, CEO of Bloomup Energie Fruit. This natural and organic skincare and hygiene product brand has launched the B-Heart application which, thanks to the blockchain technology, offers total transparency and traceability on products, the origin of ingredients, packaging, and manufacturing. The objective is to provide access to a platform secured by the blockchain technology simply by scanning a QR Code. Once the product batch number has been entered, the user can access all the information provided by the various players involved in the value chain. “The blockchain helps go back upstream, from sourcing to the product, but above all, since the information is provided by each of our suppliers, not us, it is given in an independent, safe, immutable way: it is true. It empowers consumers who want evidence and facts,” explains Maxime Finaz de Villaine. For her Clever Beauty nail polish brand, Maéva Bentitallah was seduced by the Sorga technology whose digital identification is unique to each reference. “Every passport is unique and has its own code. Each nail polish bottle can carry with it totally personalized information, which also creates a unique experience with customers,” she explains. By purchasing a product, consumers also get this unique passport for themselves. They get access to it by scanning the tag with four key types of information:
– Who: who is behind the product - the team, manufacturers and different suppliers;
– Where: manufacturing site;
– What: description of all aspects of the product (colours, how long it lasts, INCI formula…);
– Why: brand’s history and commitments. “I can also add certificates, like that of the laboratory which certifies our innovative no-waste cap helps gain 20% more product, or the test results that demonstrate our nail polish is safe for pregnant women, or my vegan label. It is inviolable. It helps communicate and provide total transparency with proven information,” adds the founder. As far as experience is concerned, personalized messages or videos can be added to the passport to create a direct relationship with consumers. Lastly, this approach is also said to minimize the environmental impact, and even free brands from secondary packs. “This way, brands can also replace the instructions in several languages. The information is more easily understood, in all languages, and tutorials can be added… Plus, all this is updated in real time,” says Philippe Guguen. “Sorga helps provide verifiable, original evidence, and offers anyone interested access to all the information, at any time, while minimizing the environmental impact with a low-energy process. Also, it is a digitally sovereign solution, so it is 100% safe from American GAFAM software,” he sums up. As consumers have become familiar with scanning, they might think of this approach as a new way to be reassured about cosmetics products and brands. “70% of consumers hardly believe brands’ statements about their sustainability, 94% think they should be more transparent, and 71% would even be willing to spend more money in brands that provide product traceability. It is a crucial issue. If the blockchain becomes democratic, I think it is the future,” concludes Maxime Finaz de Villaine."
Color cosmetics: The best 2022 innovations awarded at MakeUp in Los Angeles,"The winners of the 2022 edition of the MakeUp in LosAngeles IT Awards were revealed on the first day of the beauty trade show, during a ceremony hosted by Sandra Maguarian and Aurélie de Boisvilliers, the show organizers, and beauty expert and jury member Luisa Oliva. The competition involves two steps. First, exhibitors submit the products with a video pitch and an in-depth description of their added value compared to similar existing products. In a second step, the short listed products are evaluated and tested by a jury of 12 international experts [1] who will reward the winners in four categories: Formulation, Full service, Packaging and Accessory. 22 skincare and make-up innovations were shortlisted this year, among 87 submissions across the four categories. In the Accessory category, the paper handle applicators submitted by HNB Corporation were declared winners. The jury appreciated the “great leap forward” in sustainability allowed by these in-store product testing applicators featuring a handle made of recycled paper. According to HNB Corporation, 65% of the brush can be fully recycled and can be biodegrade in soil. The other nominees in the Accessory category were ACT Beauty France’s Full PCR Makeup Brush Set (a makeup brush kit entirely made from recycled materials), and Cosmogen’s Paper Brush Set (a set of makeup brushes with customizable paper handles and vegan bristles). In the Formulation category, the MakeUp in LosAngeles IT Award went to B.Kolormakeup & Skincare for their Lip Legend No-Transfer Liquid Lipstick, which offers a “soft as cashmere matte, moisturizing and long-lasting texture.” The formula is free from d4/d5/d6 BHT, phenoxyethanol, parabens, silicone and PEG.

In the Full Service category, the IT Award was attributed to Chromavis Fareva’s Evoke, a playful lipstick with an amazing optical effect thanks to an innovative optical embossing designed to reflect light when the product is held at different angles. Other nominees in the category included: Anjac Health & Beauty’s OK Compost Home Certifiable and Paper Sachet Sheet Mask (a 100% natural and biodegradable mask sheet packaged in an eco-friendly paper bag); Anjac Health & Beauty’s Dryly Impregnated Make Up Remover Pads (100% biodegradable cleaning pads designed to be rehydrated with water before use); Chromavis Fareva’s Materia (a new makeup concept where the product itself made with clay becomes its own cup and container thus reducing the industrial steps and materials used); Seacliff Beauty’s Soshe Beauty Refillable Clean Mascara  (a refillable mascara, for the Soshe Refill Program that delivers refills to the customer’s door, all while cutting down on single-use plastic waste per refill). In the Packaging category, the winner is APR Beauty Group Inc. for their mono-material airless powder pump allowing a precise and directional diffusion of the powder. Other nominees in the packaging category were: Cosmei’s paper pencils (pencils with a customizable 100% paper barrel for long-lasting eye, eyebrow, and lip formulations); DTS Wista Packaging’s Aquamarine Mono- Material Airless System (a 100% recyclable mono material airless for micro-encapsulated formulas); the mono material pure drop stick packaging by J.Cop Korea (Jeong Hun), Somater’s CTA Eco Mascara,  Somater’s  Hybrid Container (a light container made with more than 52% bio-sourced cardboard and less than 48% plastic); Toly’s Powder Queen. All the selected products were exhibited on the show floor and the winners were rewarded with a trophy during the award ceremony."
Simplicity: Vegan makeup pencils for all skin shades by Faber-Castell Cosmetics,"Faber-Castell Cosmetics new “Simplicity” collection was made keeping the diversity of people in mind, as well as the environmental challenges humankind is facing. With this new range, the company’s aim was to create a collection of vegan formulations made of sustainable ingredients that would match all different skin tones, with no compromise of performance, and meet current consumer’s expectations for more individualized and clean beauty products. For the lips, the new collection features an impeccable-to-wear lipstick that combines the latest colour trends like ruby red or garnet with a new clean and minimalistic texture to provide a lightweight application and a soft-gloss effect. The matching lipliners contain a smart combination of different waxes to draw accurate, soft-gliding outlines. The wooden concealer, is made with 99% ingredients of natural origin. It is available for different skin tones to complement users with a light, fair, medium or dark complexion. As far as the eyes are concerned, the aim is to maximise the impact with a minimum effort and a maximum of natural ingredients. Faber-Castell Cosmetics therefore designed an eyeshadow stick with a skin-caring and protecting new formulation based on marula oil and rice bran wax. The eyeliner offers a new extremely resilient texture that lasts even up to 20 hours. Finally, a liquid eyeliner completes the concept featuring a natural new formula and a sustainable packaging using a PCR cap to contribute to an eco-friendly product. For the collection, Faber-Castell Cosmetics has selected eye-catching and trendy colours including Rose Sapphire, Taupe Agate, Smoky Quartz, Rose Quartz, Ruby Red and Gartnet and combined them with a selection of natural ingredients chosen for their skin care benefits: sunflower seeds, candellila and carnauba wax, marula oil and bran wax, etc. When possible, the use of PCR materials also helps to upgrade the sustainability credentials of the packaging."
"At CES 2022, the Beauty industry gets in on the Metaverse","Originally expecting more than 2,200 exhibitors, this year’s Consumer Electronics Show has been muted by pandemic-driven cancelations. Despite these challenging conditions, the event has been once again home to much that is cutting-edge in the cosmetic industry. This year, global beauty giant L’Oréal revealed an at-home hair dye device dubbed Colorsonic and an AI-connected system for salon stylists called Coloright, while Slovenian start-up Ninu introduced a handheld device that can create a personalised fragrance when connected to a smartphone app. After teasing the concept last year, Ninu showcased the final version of its app-controlled “smart perfume” that features 100 fragrances in one bottle. The device connects via Bluetooth to an Android or iOS smartphone. Using an app, the user can choose from a set of pre-defined scents created by master perfumers, or can enlist the help of the AI to select a fragrance based on time of day, mood, and weather. For their part, IFF and SleepScore Labs introduced a new scent-based solution to improve sleep quality. But above all, it was the expansion of virtual beauty that stood out this year, especially when linked with the much-hyped idea of the metaverse. Procter and Gamble, for instance, opted for fully virtual experience. The company hosted a virtual booth dubbed LifeLab, allowing attendees to virtually walk up to representatives from brands such as Gillette and Oral-B to chat with them. Furthermore, P&G Beauty launched its BeautySPHERE metaverse experience in partnership with London’s Royal Botanic Gardens. A first step into the metaverse, it allowed visitors to virtually interact with the group’s portfolio of brands through live and simulated content. Easily accessed from home or anywhere with a desktop computer at: BeautySPHERE.com, the immersive 3D interactive experience doesn’t end with CES but is the group’s first step in offering education and engaging brand experiences. Similarly, Taiwan’s provider of AI- and AR-powered digital experiences Perfect Corp. has scaled back its presence at the Las Vegas show and has chosen to offer access to its most innovative technologies through a metaverse virtual experience on their website. The aim was to provide a first look at the beauty and fashion tech innovations that are set to enrich customer experiences and prepare brands for the forthcoming metaverse. Perfect Corp’s new virtual try-on tools highlighted include a new foundation-matching tool, video chat AR makeup application and jewellery try-on. In addition, Perfect Corp. also aims to democratize access to beauty and fashion virtual assets by bringing digital products from the metaverse world to all camera-enabled devices, as well as creating beauty and fashion NFTs and enabling fully immersive eCommerce virtual try-on experiences in the metaverse. A much quieter CES than usual, but one which allowed us to take a fascinating look at the new horizons of beauty tech!"
CES 2022: L’Oréal aims to reinvent hair colouring,"L’Oréal is hoping to change the game regarding hair colouring with two high-tech innovations showcased at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas: Colorsonic, for at home colouring, and Coloright, for the salon experience. As far as at home hair colouring is concerned, the Colorsonic brush concept is simple. Once in possession of the new brush, all that consumers have to do is to pick the colour of their choice from among 40 shades available on the Colorsonic website, then wait for their kit to be delivered at home. Instead of the traditional pouches and bottles, consumers will receive a cartridge that loads directly into the device. Then all that’s left to do is turn on the brush, wait for it to mix the colour and the developer, and then brush the hair from root to tip with no fear of leaks, drips, patchiness or potentially excessive saturation. Wait for 30 minutes, rinse, style, and it’s done. Finally, remove the cartridge and keep it for any future touch-ups. “When the COVID-19 pandemic caused the temporary closure of many salons, the at-home hair colour business grew by 6%. During this time, consumers experienced the challenges of an at-home haircolouring process that has remained virtually unchanged for decades, namely the messiness of hair dye and the difficulty of applying hair colour to hard-to-reach places,” said the company. In addition, L’Oréal has made sure that this new concept is also as sustainable as possible, thanks to recyclable cartridges and reusable gloves. However, anyone eager to give this gadget a try will have to be patient. Colorsonic isn’t slated for release before early in 2023 in the United States. In addition to transforming the at-home haircolouring experience, L’Oréal is also focused on the next evolution of the salon hair colour experience. The French group therefore seized the opportunity of CES 2022 to unveil Coloright, an AI-connected hair colour system for salon stylists that creates on-demand, customized hair colour. The machine features a reader, which analyses the client’s hair, measuring factors that influence colour’s effectiveness, including hair colour, grey percentage, length, and density and a dispenser that contains dry beads consisting of hair dye, accompanied by cartridges of base creams, developers and diluters. Thanks to a patented algorithm, these dispensed components create a personalized hair colour recipe. “The ultra-precise machine dispenses all the components of the formula and, in total, Coloright can provide more than 1,500 custom possibilities,” adds L’Oréal."
Makeup brands are (cautiously) tapping into the metaverse potential,"Many players in the fashion and luxury industries have already been seduced by this new world where, for the moment, anything seems possible. Nike, adidas and Balenciaga have already launched, or are working on, their own iterations of the metaverse, with plans to present collections or even stage fashion shows, to sell NFTs, and, more broadly, to showcase their worlds, their DNA, and better interact with customers. And in these parallel universes, user avatars are generally seen wearing clothes. So if you’re going to dress your avatar, you might as well do it with style. But the same logic seems more difficult to apply to cosmetic brands hoping to carve out a place, since makeup is not — or is much less — something everyone uses or wants to use. But this hasn’t stopped some brands from making remarkable breakthroughs, showing the potential that these new worlds can offer. When the pandemic caused retail stores to close, cosmetic brands had to accelerate their transition to the virtual world, doubling down on initiatives to ensure that their customers did not give up on their beauty routines. As a result, apps offering virtual makeup testing — essentially based on augmented reality — started springing up during lockdown, giving everyone the opportunity to experiment with different shades of foundation, lipstick and nail polish before buying them directly online. It’s precisely this technology, along with the now ubiquitous filters found on many social networks, that is, or will be, echoed in these virtual worlds. The South Korean metaverse Zepeto, launched by Naver Z Corp, has already partnered with several beauty brands, such as Nars, which offers several makeup looks, and Dior Beauté, which presents looks created exclusively by Peter Philips, creative and image director of the luxury brand. That alone could be enough to entice more than one beauty addict into these new worlds. Especially since they also open up a field of endless possibilities to budding creatives, who can test a host of beauty looks without ever having to show them off in the real world. As well as promoting their products in the metaverse, brands can also offer NFTs, which are on the rise. Nars plus Givenchy Parfums and Clinique are among the companies that have already unveiled non-fungible tokens. And these could multiply at great speed in this brave new world, whether to offer exclusive and rare products, or to show cosmetics through the eyes of different artists. In a bid to get ever-closer to their customers and to offer them interactive and immersive experiences, brands could also rely on their own metaverses to run livestream shopping sessions. These online events are booming all over the world, especially in China. And it’s a phenomenon that could take a new direction thanks to the metaverse and its world of possibilities."
Fragrance Innovation Summit: A perfume sector in search of a sense,"Setting the tone for the day, Philippe Ughetto, representing Fragrance Foundation France, stressed in his opening speech that innovation should from now on make sense for consumers as well as for the planet. Mathilde Lion, Director, Global Client Development of the NPD Group, then drew up a rather positive economic assessment, highlighting perfumery - not skincare - as the sector leading the recovery in selective cosmetics. She even wondered if perfume had not become the new ""lipstick effect"" in North America. In fact, the main drivers of this recovery, the Z Generations and Millennials purchase perfumes to fulfil their desire to take care of themselves and treat themselves and are influencing growth levers towards higher concentrations, online sales, and sets, testers and mini-products. Sampling as a means of discovery in the post-pandemic era was discussed several times during the day. And in particular regarding its evolution towards sustainability. Céline Boix from Sampling Innovations Europe presented Ticket Scent, a dispensing system of individual scented labels that can be opened and closed several times with 100% olfactory restitution. For his part, Maxime Caffon presented ID Scent’s Scent Touch technology, which allows using the sample a hundred times, thus extending its life span. This innovation was developed in particular for Givenchy, in the form of a cut-out card taking the shape of a mini hanger to perfume one’s wardrobe. When it comes to sustainability, for Karine Torrent, the founder of the Floratropia brand, it was a ""duty of utopia"", questioning each pillar of the chain to achieve perfumes with the strongest possible impact and smallest possible environmental footprint. Result: 100% natural perfumes sold in doypack formats, the container becoming an accessory. Elisabeth Salom l’Ancien also proposed to adapt the perfuming gesture to the juice, and presented Aptar’s collection of Inune sprays. In particular, Silk, which can be either precise or enveloping, allowing to reveal more perfume facets than a classic spray. Facets that evolve in all olfactory families, as Isabelle Ferrand of Cinquième Sens explained, by relying on new channels or over cycling, particularly of vegetables. This is what Symrise offers, with Symtrap™ technology, in its Garden Lab range. Hence, Pierre Guéros described the creamy and velvety notes of artichoke, the nutty and cereal facets of asparagus, or how cauliflower brings to mind ambergris. In terms of more sustainable sourcing, Rémi Pulvérail introduced the Eden Ecosystem joint venture, which was born out of a concern to integrate farmers’ issues into the value chain, and in particular the sustainability of purchases. The joint venture provides tailor-made solutions, from plant cultivation to industrialisation, and combines extraction methods to offer more complete aromatic spectrums. For the Master Perfumer Antoine Lie, these ’full spectrum’ extracts reveal new facets, closer to the scent coming from the fields than traditional essences and absolutes. To rethink our resources more responsibly, Jérémy Pessiot, the founder of Afyren, developed a solution for the over cycling of the lignocellulosic biomass of beetroot, allowing the production on French soils of synthetic perfumery molecules, which today come from the international petrochemical industry. The 7 platform molecules forming these molecules are manufactured using a unique, low carbon, Cosmos, Ecocert and ISO 16128 certified process, which results in 100% natural biosourced synthetics, with preserved analytical and olfactory performances. In her analysis of free expressions on social networks, Michelle Algazi from Dynvibe pointed out that lock-downs had given rise to a new hobby: the discovery of perfumes. And for many, they were the opportunity to dare more audacious perfumes. Post-confinement, these notes remain a source of empowerment and allow attracting the attention of other people. The approach of the ajnalogy movement (from the Sanskrit Ajna, the chakra of intuition) is in line with this spirit: Agathe Jacquinet and Éléonore de Staël develop 100% natural fragrances offering a better connection to one’s emotions and self-acceptance. Experience is also at the heart of the DTC concept of Maison21G: to compose, online or in-store (in Singapore for the moment), one’s tailor-made perfume resulting from a personality test. The founder, Johanna Monange, has worked with IFF to make sure that each juice could be incorporated up to 21% while still complying with toxicological requirements. Integrating all the trends discussed at the Summit, she also presented a collection of candles and diffusers to personalise one’s home fragrance, as well as in-store workshops and an olfactory discovery box. The discovery of perfume is one of the innovation levers as recalled by the consultant Laure Braive, who proposed a world tour of phygital innovations: from virtual shops to synesthetic polysensory tours, including all the edutainment options facilitated by NFTs. She also suggested putting exclusivity, craftsmanship and human values back at the heart of the customer journey. A journey that intends to facilitate Frédéric Besson, who has developed, with Perfumist, a set of mobile applications to help everyone, anywhere (online and in-store/duty-free), to find the ideal fragrance for themselves or as a gift. An ability to inspire the customer, mentioned by Mathilde Girardon and Sylvain Eyraud, from Takasago, is one of the keys to success on the Chinese market. A market of incarnation, they believe, that one should try to understand from the inside, with its rituals and legends, to shift from ’made in China’ to ’crafted in China’. Betty Touzaud from Panda Meetings, recalled the importance of e-commerce in China, where almost all sales of perfumes come from live-shopping platforms. And therefore the need to adopt the codes of retailnment and gamification, with impactful, fun visuals and lots of movement."
"Lumson awarded for XPaper, their innovative paper airless dispenser","The airless dispenser with a paper bottle was judged one of the most innovative products by the Italian Association for Design (ADI, Associazione per il Designo Industriale). The new packaging solution was added to the 2021 ADI Design Index and won the ADI Design Index Award for Innovation. The ADI Design Index gathers the best Italian designs put into production during the year. In 2021, the 233 finalists were selected among over 1,000 candidatures by ADI Design’s permanent Observatory. “I’d like to thank all those who worked on developing XPaper, and who believed in this project, which sprang from careful market analysis, deep knowledge of the industry, and from great enthusiasm,” said Matteo Moretti, Lumson’s Chairman at the award ceremony, which was held in Rome on 18 November 2021. “The innovation that XPaper brings is even more significant, because at its core is sustainability - a value that has become an integral part of Italian culture and design,” he continued. XPaper’s main innovation lays in the use of cardboard as a lighter and greener alternative to plastic, glass or aluminium for the dispenser’s bottle.  According to Lumson, this was made possible thanks to R&D’s major strides that allowed to increase the performance and aesthetic appeal of paper. “Thanks to fine printing techniques, it is possible to create sophisticated paper products,” said the Italian supplier of primary packaging solutions, in a statement. “I feel that XPaper has what it takes to become an iconic product: it is sustainable, functional, safe, and sophisticated,” said Moretti. “Once the product has run out, you can separate the dispenser from the bottle in paper and send it down the right recycling chain. It’s practical and safe to use, because, like all of our airless dispensers with a pouch, it was developed to optimally protect the product from the risk of contamination from the air or other outside agents that could alter the formula. And then there’s its look. The packaging is customizable with conventional and digital printing technologies, to become a unique product with strong personality.” The new paper airless dispenser is part of Lumson’s Touchless family, which gathers dispensers with hermetic pouches. All the airless systems (jars and bottles) in this range are based on four key pillars: – The use of a patented hermetic closure system (the HSCS -Hermetic Snap Closure System - is positioned between the dispensing system and the bottle in order to protect the formula); 
– A mono or multi-layer pouch depending on the characteristics of the product; 
– The use of sustainable materials, including glass, plastic, aluminium and now cardboard; 
– The possibility to separate the various components in order to facilitate their disposal in the correct recycling chain."
"Made By Me, combinable solid fragrances to personalise one’s perfume","Solid formulas, layering, eco-design, new gestures... the new Made By Me brand concept combines several of the major trends of the moment, in particular, the personalisation of one’s perfume, the intimacy and practicality of the gesture. ""After 20 years spent in the cosmetics sector. I witnessed the progression of the ability to take ownership of one’s make-up or skincare, in particular through tutorials and influencers. I thought it was a pity not to apply this for perfume and thus bring out one’s personality, one’s inner emotions, but also to be able to break away from it so as not to be confined to the same register,"" explains the creator. Layering or the superposition of several juices or single florals already introduced by some brands does not suit her. Because the volume and the liquid format of traditional perfumes entail too many constraints, Nathalie Duran explored the solid perfume avenue with formulas that she wanted to be soft and non-greasy, but also coloured to accentuate the ""tutorial dimension"". ""We went looking for make-up formulas and worked on solutions that contain colours that fade on the skin. These formulas also had to adapt to a high perfume concentration because our fragrances are 11% concentrated,"" adds the creator. Five perfumes were created by the Perfumers Domitille Michalon Bertier, Caroline Dumur and Fanny Bal from IFF on the theme of Nude, to project a true olfactory identity, alone or combined. Like a palette designed by a make-up artist, these fragrances are designed to live together. At the centre of the palette is All Over U Musk, a full-featured fragrance that serves as a base for the compositions. Revolving around it, Candide Blossom and its orange blossom notes, Orange Fever, Blitz Fig and finally Musk Crush with its sensual notes. ""We recommend making one’s recipe with 1 to 3 fragrances maximum, possibly adding a few hints of the other fragrances depending on the moment or the mood. The most important thing is to explore one’s desires, to make it a fun moment of creation,"" assures Nathalie Duran. To achieve the right balance, which is essential for a good release, the brand recommends dosing light colours more than dark colours, which have stronger and more persistent notes. ""In terms of staying power and persistence, the user will be fully satisfied as long as he or she puts enough on. In terms of sillage, we have developed a whole ritual for the wrists and hair,"" says Nathalie Duran. The formulas are free of parabens, phthalates and alcohol. The packaging - a palette of five or two fragrances - is made of 100% recyclable or reusable cardboard, and covered with a bioplastic coating. The brand has been available online since 8 March and plans to open a retail site in South Korea by the end of the year, as well as developing a new palette of five fragrances in 2022."
"After shampoos, Everist launches waterless body wash concentrate","With this thoughtful line extension, Everist aims to deliver to its consumers the perfect trio of shower essentials. Similar to the hair care and conditioner concentrates, which were launched in February, the body wash is water-activated by water with a simple paste-to-lather gesture. Consumers just need to lather the paste between their hands to start cleansing and moisturizing their skin. The plant-based, vegan and cruelty-free formula, includes Everist’s signature blend of essential oils in lieu of synthetic fragrance. With notes of orange peel, bergamot, peppermint, rosemary and clary sage, the body wash is both refreshing and uplifting. The choice of a creamy paste texture aims to keep the experience of the new body wash concentrate as close to traditional shower products as possible, with a creamy lather that “stands out in the clean beauty space”. As a partner accessory, the brand is also launching a 100% biodegradable and home compostable Konjac Sponge made of natural konjac plant fibre. The body wash is priced at $24 USD / $28 CAD per tube and the sponge at $12 USD / $16 CAD. ""Reducing the carbon and plastic-waste impact of traditional, water-filled beauty products is the premise Everist was built on. Just like hair care, traditional body washes are primarily water and packaged in single-use plastic and so we were inspired to do better. With this addition to our product lineup, we combine the benefits of skincare ingredients with gentle cleansing properties to encourage customers to eco-upgrade their routine. For us, it always comes back to performance first,"" said Jayme Jenkins, Chief Brand Officer at Everist. Everist claims to have recorded rapid growth since the brand was launched in February 2021, with a both a loyal customer base and a promising retail expansion strategy. Most recently, the eCommerce-first company secured distribution deals with Credo Beauty, an American clean beauty retailer, the Allure Store, an online and IRL beauty destination in Manhattan, New York, Well.ca, a Canadian wellness online shop, and Verishop, an eCommerce platform for shopping today’s hottest brands. ""The launch of our body wash is set to revolutionize the category, and it marks an important milestone for Everist,"" expressed Jessica Stevenson, CEO of Everist."
"Phantom, Paco Rabanne’s latest men’s fragrance, taps into techno-digital trend","“When I think of Paco Rabanne, I don’t think retro - I think revolution, rebellion and renaissance,” said Julien Dossena, Paco Rabanne’s Artistic Director about its work for the fashion house since 2013. In line with this vision, the brand has chosen robot-shaped design by Pierre Dinand (glass bottle by Pochet du Courval and Heinz Glas) for its latest men’s fragrance that was launched this summer. The bottle is topped with a spray cap by VPI, which can be connected to a smartphone thanks to an NFC chip (by STMicroelectronics). Four perfumers from IFF participated in the fragrance creation. Loc Dong came up with the lavender and green citrus idea. Juliette Karagueuzoglou contributed with her knowledge of natural-ingredients, and Master Perfurmers Dominique Ropion and Anne Filipo fine-tuned the formula. IFF perfumers have also relied on artificial intelligence-propelled ""augmented creativity"" tools that have been developed by the perfume house. From the first formulas designed by the perfumers, the algorithm suggests new combinations or dosages to amplify the desired emotional effects. A complex creative process which also relied on the Science of Wellness platform recently launched by IFF. Imagined by the Pierre Dinand design agency, under the direction of Vincent Thilloy, the robot-shaped glass bottle was produced by Pochet du Courval and Heinz Glas. “We are very proud of this achievement. This was a real technical challenge, with its flat shoulders, the need to control of glass distribution to avoid brittleness in the most sensitive areas and the quality of the glass surface required for perfect tension after metallization. This was a real technical challenge due to the shape of the bottle,” said Mélina Weinmann, Business Development Director for Glass Bottles, at Pochet du Courval. The metallization of the glass and the laser etching revealing the logo were entrusted to Solev. The bottle is topped with a metallic finish spray cap in galvanized ABS made by VPI Faiveley Plast and SAF. An NFC (“Near-field communication"", for a contactless communication) electronic chip is integrated into the spray-cap (i.e. the robot’s head) to allow smartphone connections and full immersion in Phantom’s universe (games, playlists, etc.). With sustainability in mind, the 150 ml bottle can be refilled, thanks to the unscrewable spray cap and Techniplast’s RT-Twist technology."
Make-up: Global Bioenergies’ naturally sourced isododecane is gaining strength,"An essential ingredient in long-lasting make-up, isododecane was historically derived from petrochemicals. However, French biotech company Global Bioenergies has successfully developed an innovative technology for converting plant resources (sugar and starch residues, agricultural and forestry waste), into isobutene, one of the main petroleum derivatives, and then to transform it into isododecane. Six months after releasing its first batch of naturally sourced isododecane, Global Bioenergies has finished producing and released a second batch of the innovative ingredient to be marketed from 2022 under the name Isonaturane® 12. Part of the batch will be used to produce lips range of the LAST brand, which was recently launched by the company to illustrate the potentialities of its ingredient. Scheduled to be launched this autumn in addition, the new range will complement the eyes range launched last spring and available at www.colors-that-last.com. Thanks to the naturally sourced isododecane, LAST’s lips range will offer fourteen shades of a long-wear liquid lipstick comprising over 90% natural ingredients and delivering the same performance as the top products on the market. Production of the new range has just started in the Lyon factory of MS BeautiLab, one of the largest cosmetics manufacturers in Europe, whom Global Bioenergies had already entrusted with the industrialisation and production of the eyes line last spring. ""We plan to launch other products in 2022, with the same intention of using our innovative ingredient to bring naturalness to product categories where it is not yet present,” explains Marc Delcourt, co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies. Beyond the making of the lips range by MS BeautiLab, the second batch of naturally sourced isododecane will also be used to serve the numerous cosmetic industry players who have requested sampling. “Since the beginning of the year, we have received more than 40 unsolicited requests from cosmetic companies (brands, manufacturers and distributors). Further to discussions now well underway, we will provide samples to interested parties before we start delivering commercial volumes from 2022 onwards. This innovative ingredient will radically increase the level of naturalness in long-wear make-up, without compromising on performance. It will also be used in dermo-cosmetics and hair care,” said Florence Thueux, Global Bioenergies Chief Business Officer. To meet the demand, Global Bioenergies is reorganising its production to allow rapid scale-up of Isonaturane 12 deliveries over the next years. In particular, an industrial production unit is currently under construction at the Pomacle-Bazancourt site and will combine with upstream and downstream industrial subcontractors. This new unit will produce enough Isonaturane® 12 to manufacture around 10 million units of longwear, natural make-up by 2022, the first year of operation."
Virtual makeup try-ons are now possible for Instagram Shopping,"To adapt to the new reality of shopping during the pandemic, cosmetic brands found themselves having to reinvent their approach in order to allow customers to enjoy an online shopping experience that was similar to that in physical stores. Testing makeup, textures and shades in particular, is becoming a must to ensure that customers end up with products that suit them. Virtual try-ons have, therefore, become essential for beauty industry players who now want to focus on digital, whether on their own e-commerce platforms or on social networks. With this in mind, L’Oreal and Facebook have joined forces, and brought their respective expertise in the field to an initiative that allows Instagram shoppers to virtually test makeup products before they buy. This service is offered through ModiFace, L’Oréal’s augmented reality and artificial intelligence company. ""AR Try-On is an exciting new foray within Facebook that’s already helping people shop online with more confidence. Through this new integration with L’Oréal, shoppers can expect a more personal shopping experience from even more of the brands they love, right where they’re already finding beauty inspiration: on Instagram,"" outlined Sue Young, Head of Spark AR at Facebook. For now, Instagram shoppers can experience virtual try-ons for NYX Professional Makeup, Urban Decay, Maybelline New York, and Lancôme lipsticks. They will soon be able to use it for other brands, and other product categories. Facebook will also integrate ModiFace AR try-on into new advertising formats on Facebook app."
France’s Bioseptyl launches a toothpaste stick,"Bioseptyl, which has already completed its ranges of made in France toothbrushes with a series of oral care products for adults (toothpastes, oral baths and sprays), juniors (Dentifrance) and children (Dentifraise), is launching the Stick Dentifrice, an ""economical and travel-friendly"" solid toothpaste. COSMOS ORGANIC certified and mint flavoured, the Stick Dentifrice [1], contains only 100% natural ingredients and offers an innovative texture, both solid and creamy, that helps to reduce water consumption. Before application, the brush does not need to be wet. After application, rinsing is quick and easy because the toothpaste has been designed not to produce foam. According to the brand, a 12 gram stick allows about 250 brushings, which corresponds to a period of use of four months, significantly higher than that of conventional toothpastes. Available since June 15 on bioseptyl.fr as well as in various points of sale, including the Biocoop network in France, at a price of 6.95 euros, the Stick Dentifrice fits easily into a travel kit. For even more durability, the product is sold in a refillable packaging. The set of two refills is available at a price of 9.20 euros in a PEFC cardboard outer pack printed with vegetable inks, each refill being wrapped in a bio-based cellulosic bag certified to be compostable at home."
Upcycling: Rose Pirate wants to give a new lease of life to abandoned lipstick tubes,"The principle is simple: Rose Pirate collects the lipstick cases that consumers do not want to throw away simply because the grape inside it, has become unusable. The start-up will empty it, sterilise it and refill it with its unique 100% natural lip balm formula. As long as the tube is in good condition, the process can be repeated over and over again. To make her project a reality, Audrey Ducardonnet, the founder, has just launched a crowdfunding campaign to reach 200 pre-sales by 7 June. The aim was to check that consumers were interested in the project and that they were ready to make an effort, ""to send back their lipstick tube for me to refill it"". After a career at the Chanel laboratory and as Project and make-up innovation Manager, the young woman created her own structure as an innovation consultant to ""transform a designer’s brief into a concrete product."" She is the link between the creative process and the manufacture of a product, ensuring that it is feasible and that ""it is up to expectations"". The Rose Pirate project is part of this reflection on the future of the cosmetics industry. To replace the grapes in the lipsticks, several sizing operations must be carried out manually, along with a chemical-free cleaning. The tube can then be sterilised and refilled with the balm. Audrey Ducardonnet developed her formula with Michèle Mousset, a formulation expert who worked for brands such as Chanel and Dior. Most round tubes with a ""standard"" diameter can be refilled. A check on the arrival of the tube allows verifying that it still works properly. If this is not the case or if its shape is too complex, the tube is returned to its owner. On the crowdfunding pre-sales, the first 40 pieces are at 12 euros, the rest at 15 euros. The project is aimed at environmentally conscious consumers who wish to adopt an upcycling approach ""with the desire to consume less but better"". The lip balm is of natural origin and 100% vegan. It is made of cherry pit oil and sweet potatoes, ingredients with antioxidant properties. An ideal balm for women ""who don’t want to get rid of their favourite lipstick tube and/or who want to take care of their lips by combining quality and naturalness""!"
Juni draws inspiration from the past to create 100% recyclable lipstick tube,"When she created Juni, makeup artist Madeleine White aimed to combine luxury, high performance, and green beauty in a sustainable line. For example, she endeavoured to pack her formulas with packs as ecodesigned as possible. “I have grown aware of the huge problem of plastic in the beauty industry. Over 142 billion pack units are produced every year around the world in the beauty sector, 95% of beauty packs are thrown away after only one use, and only 14% are transported to a recycling centre. ‘Good plastic’ does not exist,” Madeleine White tells Premium Beauty News. Following this logic, she aims to develop a lipstick line completely free from plastic. “About 900 million lipsticks, mainly in the form of single-use plastic tubes, are sold in the world every year. We were determined not to contribute to this plastic pandemic, but to produce an innovative alternative,” she adds. Dissatisfied with the packaging solutions currently available on the market, she chose tailor-made design with a local designer team. The final choice is an infinitely recyclable single material: aluminium. Free from the usual twisting mechanism that requires plastic machinery, it features a push-button system inspired from a 1930s tube. “Our lipstick tubes are fully made of aluminium. By using only one material, we avoided the tricky, costly separation which often hinders or prevents packaging from being recycled. Aluminium is infinitely recyclable,” explains the founder. This initiative mirrors that of turnkey cosmetic solution supplier Meiyume, inspired from the tube patented in 1915 by American inventor Maurice Levy, or the one made of machined aluminium recently unveiled by packaging creation agency Cinqpats, also inspired from vintage tubes. By design, the Juni tubes are fully recyclable by the users, who can also return them empty to the customer service, so they can be reused or recycled. Madeleine White deliberately chose not to offer a refillable version. “Although refillable cosmetic products are gaining ground, we do not believe they are the best solution for all products. Our products are not refillable right now, because it is extremely difficult to transport delicate makeup like lipstick without secured primary packaging. Refills require extra packaging or plastic components that cannot be recycled. We will make no compromise,” she concludes."
"Izzy launches a reusable, recyclable zero-waste and locally sourced mascara","""As a Millennial mom, I wanted to provide my daughter with truly sustainable beauty options, ones that would go beyond the standards of the current clean movement,"" explains Izzy Zero Waste founder and industry veteran Shannon Goldberg. ""By 2050, the oceans are projected to contain more plastic than fish. If we want to give our children a fighting chance tomorrow, then we need to do something radical about reversing this cycle today."" The start-up’s debut product is a vegan, clean, reusable, recyclable, locally sourced and CarbonNeutral certified mascara. A real technical challenge, given the specificities of this type of product, composed of multiple components associated with formulas that are often difficult to clean. Evidently, the packaging plays a big part in this cosmetics innovation. The Zero Waste Mascara comes in a US-made medical-grade stainless steel tube designed to be refilled again and again, and with no plastic components. While Izzy’s Zero Waste Mascara is made with 94% less plastic than the majority of global mascara brands, it was not possible to use another kind of material for the applicators and wipers. However, these plastic components are rendered 100% zero waste by regrinding them and melting them down to make new ones. Izzy Zero Waste Beauty also promises low carbon emissions linked to transportation, since the brand’s supply chain is located within a 400-mile radius (approx. 640 km). To reach its sustainability goals, the brand has created a direct-to-consumer subscription model. By becoming a Zero Waste Member, customers can receive a sterilized refilled mascara tube that’s ready to use, every three months, accompanied by a prepaid returns envelope to send back the mascara tube when it runs out. Membership starts at US$35 (about EUR29) for the starter kit plus US$19 (about EUR16) per quarter for quarterly refills, but it’s also possible to test the mascara without subscribing for US$39 (about EUR32). The mascara ships without secondary packaging in reusable envelopes made using recycled materials. Designed to be cleaned and refilled over 10,000 times, once returned the mascara tubes are sterilized and refilled. “Even the water from the patent-pending triple cleaning process is reused, rather than dumped in the ocean,” claims the brand. Other, similar initiatives have been cropping up around the world. The US company Ace of Air, for example, recently launched a moisturizer, a serum and supplements according to a similar model based on the return and refill of long-lasting packaging."
"Blockchain fragrance: Look Labs mixes perfumery, technology and art","The creative studio has partnered with Montréal artist Sean Caruso to launch the world’s first digital fragrance encoded into NFT artwork. They created ten exclusive digital artworks that are auctioned online on the Rarible marketplace. The digital artwork is inspired from Cyber, a physical unisex eau de parfum  designed by Look Labs. Created by a master perfurmer in Grasse, France, the fragrance evokes sci-fi movies and high-tech universes. The fragrance comes in a glass bottle with an LED label. The artwork consists in a photorealistic representation of the bottle with its illuminated label together with a digital representation of the fragrance in the form of NIRS data. The first owners of the NFT artwork will receive the collector’s edition of the physical fragrance signed by the creators and additional hi-resolution versions of the artwork. Each future corresponding NFT owner will be able to redeem the physical version of the fragrance for an additional fee. “I was curious about the merging of the physical and digital worlds through blockchain and NFT artwork,” said Sean Caruso. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) - units of data stored on a blockchain - are increasingly used to certify a digital asset to be unique and therefore not interchangeable. Look Labs imagined this combination of digital artwork and physical fragrance to capture the emerging trend of NFTs and how luxury products will appeal in the future to the new generation of consumers. The aim was to create “the ultimate luxury fragrance that combines traditional craftsmanship with the latest disruptive technology. Choosing the highest quality ingredients and materials was an imperative step in the process of designing and crafting a product that is unique and the first of its kind on the market,” said Look Labs founder, Jordan Katzarov."
Scentys transforms the ritual of home fragrance with a connected diffuser,"An expert in the diffusion of fragrance in the air since 2004, Scentys now launches a new B2B2C fragrance diffusion concept designed to fit into our daily lives. A voice command option makes it as easy to use as possible. The platform is compatible with Amazon’s Alexa voice service. In addition, all the fragrance diffusion devices are equipped with bluetooth and wifi.
Get slot machine tips, discover slots myths, and don’t forget to check out our listings of free slots comps currently being offered by our favorite casinos. “You can ask the voice assistant to start one or more diffusers, to select your favorite fragrance, or to choose where you want to launch the diffusion. For instance, if you want to relax in your living room, you can tell the diffuser to switch on and create a soothing atmosphere. Wellbeing begins immediately,” says Scentys. A dedicated smartphone application allows to control and program fragrance diffusion in a single step, either on-site or remotely. Compatible with Apple and Android devices, it can be used to start or stop diffusion in a specific room, or to diffuse a specific fragrance to create the desired atmosphere. In order to ensure that diffusion is always perfectly safe, exposure rates (based on the quantity of fragrance, the size of the room and many other parameters) are calculated in real time. Intended for brands, this new diffuser is fully customizable. Scentys develops the technical specifications and manages the project every step of the way, from the creativity/design phase through to the prototype and manufacturing. Fragrances are provided by the client, and Scentys uses its exclusive technology to ensure:
– high-quality fragrance diffusion;
– optimal safety;
– eco-design and recyclability of capsules. This connected and smart platform allows brands to create a dialogue in real time with their clients. Gathering data about their habits and usage will help marketers get to know them better so they can offer personalized content and recommendations. For example: suggest a new fragrance, let them know their capsule is almost empty and propose buying a new one, or offer advice on optimizing their olfactory comfort. The concept for this custom fragrance diffuser is the result of more than three years of research and development, in partnership with Amazon Web Services. It is based on Scentys’ exclusive, patented fragrance capsule technology that allows a cold-air and completely dry diffusion process. Small beads packed with solid fragrance concentrate, but no alcohol or solvents, are stored in the capsules. When air blows through them, they release the fragrance in a subtle, light and even way. This process guarantees that fragrances are reproduced accurately and that users can create a comfortable olfactory environment in total safety. Diffusion leaves no after-scent, so only the new fragrance is present once the capsule is changed. The capsules are easy and safe to use. They are made in France, in Scentys’ factory near Paris, and are 100% recyclable. As the home has never been more of a refuge, Scentys is introducing a new ritual for enjoying fragrances and creating wellbeing, and meeting the quest for wellbeing, healthy products, simplicity and immediacy in homes that are ever more connected and have become the ultimate refuge."
"Chanel launches Lipscanner, their first-ever try-on lipstick app","Dubbed Lipscanner, the app allows users to get colour inspiration from their everyday life, or from social media, magazines or items of clothing, to imagine and create their future beauty looks. All consumers have to do is to scan a colour on an image from a magazine, from social networks, or on the face of a friend, or a piece of clothing or accessory, and the application will instantly offer the product with the closest shade from the Chanel’s range of lipsticks. Lipscanner’s recognition engine compares the scanned colour with the entire Chanel lip range in real time to find the desired product. The app is the result of collaboration over several months between Chanel’s Connected Experience Lab (CX Lab) and the brand’s Makeup Creation Studio. It took several months to design an exclusive algorithm and to train it to develop its analytical capacity from tens of thousands of facial images. This machine learning ongoing process will be progressively integrated in future releases of the brand’s lipstick products. Once the desired colour and texture have been identified, the app’s “Virtual Try On” feature allows consumers to test the Chanel make-up product that was recommended by the app. Of course, Lipscanner offers to go beyond the virtual make-up experience, with the possibility of transforming the test into reality thanks to a link to the desired shade on chanel.com. The app is available for free from 22 February 2021 in France, the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Korea and 15 other countries on the Apple App Store."
Ace of Air enters the beauty market with a “return the empty packaging” model,"The packaging waste issue is becoming crucial in the beauty industry in 2021. In such a context, both heritage and emerging brands are testing new ways to reduce the environmental footprint of their products. In this context, Ace of Air enters the beauty and wellness market with an entirely circular business model. Indeed, after using up their Ace of Air moisturizer, serum or supplements, consumers can ship the packaging back to the company to be cleaned, refilled, and re-used. Made of stainless steel, food-grade ceramic, using fair-trade rubber for the seals and other packaging elements that are normally made of plastic or silicone, the packaging of each product has been designed to last for 100 cycles of use at least. Ace of Air defines itself as a “Buy the Product & Borrow the Package” brand, taking responsibility for the full life of its packaging. ""We created this business, not because we thought the world needs another beauty and wellness brand. It doesn’t. We did this because our planet needs a beauty and wellness brand that fundamentally changes what and how we consume,"" explained Stephanie Stahl, CEO & Co-Founder of Ace of Air. A former CMO at Revlon, she cofounded the brand with supermodel Petra Nemcova and founder of merchant banking firm, Three Ocean Partners, David Knowlton Ace of Air debut collection features eight skincare - including moisturizers and serums - and supplement products.

"A plant-based isododecane for greener, long-lasting makeup products","Isododecane is a key ingredient in the cosmetics market. The substance is used for its emollient properties in a large number of skin care and hair treatment products. It is also a major ingredient in long-lasting makeup products, such as waterproof mascaras or long-lasting liquid lipsticks. It provides the long-lasting performance, no transfer and waterproof effects, while maintaining optimal comfort. According to Global Bioenergies, isododecane can represent up to 50% of the formulations belonging to these categories. While the long-lasting make-up segment already weights around 25% of the global makeup market, this ingredient was only sourced from petrochemicals. Until now! Thanks to this technological breakthrough, the entire long-lasting make-up segment might get rid from petroleum resources. For producing this renewable isododecane, Global Bioenergies relied on their proprietary innovative technology for converting plant resources (sugar and starch residues,  agricultural and forestry waste), into isobutene, one of the main petroleum derivatives. Then, after several steps respecting the naturalness criteria specific to the cosmetics market, isobutene was converted into isododecane. “This first batch of cosmetic-grade isododecane undergone about fifteen analyses, carried out by specialized and independent experts. All the tests confirmed the high level of purity of the product as well as its compliance with technical specifications defined during toxicological studies conducted by the company in 2020. These analyses led to the release of the batch for commercial use,” the company explains in a statement. This important step could allow long-lasting make-up to reach levels of naturalness above 90%. ""Without any compromise on performance"", according to Marc Delcourt, co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies. To demonstrate the value of this innovation, Global Bioenergies plans to create their own beauty brand. To carry out this project, the company created an ad hoc committee inspired by Romain Desfresnes, an ex-Coty and ex-Dior executive, who brought together experts from the various field of expertise required for new project development in the cosmetics field. “We have put performance at the heart of our offer: we have succeeded in combining the ultra-sensorial textures and colour intensity with a high rate of naturalness (between 90 and 99%), in 2.0 make-up products with a high long-lasting, no transfer and comfort performances, matching with the best market standards. Our unique approach ‘from biotech to beauty’ will enable us to respond to consumers, who are always more eco-conscious when making their purchases,"" underlines Romain Desfresnes. Around 300,000 product units can be produced using this first batch of isododecane."
CES 2021: L’Oréal rolls out its innovations,"L’Oréal has unveiled Yves Saint Laurent Beauté Rouge Sur Mesure Powered by Perso, an at-home system that represents the ultimate in lip colour personalization. Based on the technology originally developed by the L’Oréal Technology Incubator and presented at CES 2020. The device allows the user to create thousands of shades of the YSL Beauty Velvet Cream Matte Finish at home. Using the Perso technology, consumers can create new lip shades within the corresponding app. They can, for instance, design a lipstick shade to match their outfit or opt for a colour that is trending on social media. ""There are four colour universes with three set of cartridges each, thus allowing to produce virtually almost all shades in each universe,"" Guive Balooch, Head of the L’Oréal Technology Incubator, told Premium Beauty News. A limited pre-sale of the Yves Saint Laurent Beauté Rouge Sur Mesure device, priced at USD 299, is available on registration for early Spring 2021 U.S. delivery. The at-home system includes two colour cartridge sets from one of YSL’s iconic universes of red, nude, orange or fuchsia. YSL Beauty Rouge Sur Mesure Powered by Perso will be available to consumers widely September 2021. The Perso technology can also create custom formulas for skincare and foundation. These capabilities will launch later in 2021. Along with personalization, L’Oréal has also put technological innovation at the service of the environment. With its Water Saver, a technology developed with Swiss start-up Gjosa, the beauty giant wants to help consumers to reduce water consumption during hairwashing while enhancing the effectiveness of hair care. First unveiled in 2018, this innovation has already been used in select hair salons in the US. Presented in its final version at the CES, it will soon head to France, followed by a global rollout. The technology promises to not only make it possible to considerably reduce water consumption - by up to 80% - but also to reinvent the application of hair care products. The ""high-powered water-optimizing technology"" was directly combined with specially designed L’Oréal Professionnel and Kérastase products that flow directly into the water stream. This would allow, among other things, to use only two litres of water per minute, compared to an average of eight litres per minute for a home shampoo at present. Already available in a selection of salons in New York, L’Oréal Water Saver will arrive in some Parisian salons next February, before being deployed internationally between 2021 and 2022. Professionals should also benefit from a dashboard providing data on savings in water and energy consumption, and a history of the treatments used. Individuals won’t be left out since L’Oréal has announced that an at-home shower device ""will be launched at a later date."" ""Within the L’Oréal Technology Incubator, we investigate market gaps focusing on personalization and on enhanced product performance and sustainability,"" concludes Guive Balooch."
Zero-waste beauty start up Everist launches waterless haircare concentrates,"""Coming from big beauty, we understand what goes into making great products,"" said Jayme Jenkins, Chief Brand Officer at Everist. ""We also know and care about the impact that the beauty industry is having on the planet. To make eco for the masses we had to do things differently. Our approach is not to solely focus on the ’desire’ to be conscious, but to have formulas that are best in class and maintain sustainability throughout their entire product lifecycle. Our haircare concentrates will change the way people look at eco beauty."" The Toronto-based brand business model is to create new products that are modern and sustainable in performance and design. Driving the concept for their first launch in haircare was the insight that most shampoos and conditioners on the market are more than 70% water and packaged in single-use plastic. “So basically, it’s about shipping plastic bottles of water around the world. This didn’t make sense to us”, added Jenkins. Everist therefore invented a new concept: shampoo and conditioner concentrates. “We found shampoo bars to be messy, powders clumpy and performance has always been our No1,” she said. The brand’s debut line of haircare products features a Waterless Shampoo Concentrate and a Waterless Conditioner Concentrate, both of them being packed in a 100ml travel-friendly aluminum tube. As the products are three times concentrated, this is the equivalent of 300-ml sizes of traditional shampoo and conditioner. “A first of its kind in the industry,” according to the brand. The products are formulated with coconut-derived cleansers, aloe vera and peppermint, amla, and rosemary oils among other ingredients. Developed to be ’super clean’, these plant-based formulas are free-from parabens, sulfates, silicones, dyes, synthetic fragrances, as well as being vegan and cruelty-free.  Completely waterless, the products are free from preservatives and offer a  creamy paste texture that is ‘activated’ with the water in the shower. The brand said the goal was to keep the experience of the new haircare concentrates as close to traditional shampoo as possible. To use the products, consumers simply need to wet hair and hands, and squeeze a 1-inch strip of product onto palm (for medium length hair), rub wet hands to activate and build up lather in the hair as normal. In order to avoid generating non-recyclable packaging waste, Everist has opted for infinitely-recyclable aluminum tube. For optimal use, the products are sold with a key enabling customers to squeeze out all the formula from the tube. As far as the plastic caps are concerned, Everist will run the so-called ‘CapBack’ closed-loop program to collect them. Made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the caps will be recycled or upcycled. In addition, Everist has committed to 1% for the Planet and Climate Neutral certification. Everist was built by two women with a collective 25 years of experience working in the beauty industry. Jayme Jenkins started her career at Procter & Gamble before spending nearly a decade at L’Oréal and The Body Shop where she worked in Europe launching global beauty innovations across multiple categories. Co-Founder Jessica Stevenson began her career at General Mills before leading marketing for Revlon’s professional division, and ultimately serving as General Manager for Australian clean beauty brand Nude by Nature. The brand has received financial support from several investors, including Wonderment Ventures, social impact firm Good & Well, and the female-founders of Canadian brands Knix and SMYTHE among others. However, the amount of this pre-seed funding round has not been disclosed. ""We were fortunate early on to have people who saw the potential of our big ideas,"" said Jessica Stevenson, CEO of Everist. ""In a world of misinformation and greenwashing, zero-waste and clean beauty requires a great amount of thoughtfulness to ensure it is done right. We are committed to discovering new ways of doing things across the entire supply chain and creating better, higher performing products as the result. We are lucky to have partners that believe in us and understand the rigor that it takes to bring this to life."" Everist is taking pre-orders now and will begin shipping their patent-pending shampoo and conditioner haircare concentrates in early 2021 across the United States and Canada. Products are priced at USD 24/ CAD 28 per tube."
Orlandi unveils new connected tool for in-store perfume testing,"Users just need to connect to the dedicated application on their smartphones or tablets and scan the QR codes on the back of the diffuser, which is the size of a tablet, to have access to the 20-fragrance catalogue it contains. This way, they can get informed about the products and trigger the olfactory tests of those they want to discover. The dry diffusion faithfully reproduces all fragrances’ notes. It is also possible to discover several fragrances in a row without saturating the atmosphere or mixing smells. Then, the diffuser can be cleaned and sanitized with an antiseptic solution. The recyclable cartridges made available by Orlandi need to be replaced after 100 shots. “For now, the tablet can contain up to 20 cartridges, but we may offer even more in the future. We are considering developing a second generation tablet fitted with a touch screen,” explains Philippe Ughetto, Senior VP of Orlandi, the exclusive global distributor of the digital device. Convenience, hygiene, proximity… This new testing tool available in physical points of sale, travel retail stores, or through direct selling, offers multiple advantages. Brazilian giant Natura &Co has already chosen this technology to replace the standard test catalogues used by their beauty advisors, both for direct selling and in physical stores, in Brazil and Latin America. The MultiScent 20 diffuser is already a star in the brand new phygital concept store opened by Natura on Oscar Freire street, in São Paulo. The application offers a quiz which analyses customers’ preferences and suggests a personalized perfume selection. As for brands, the digitalization of perfume discovery paves the way for shot personalization, content sharing and data collection regarding the user path. “With MultiScent 20™, olfactory testing takes on a new dimension: it is now possible to perfectly reproduce and miniaturize smells, while connecting consumers with our brand,” adds Philippe Ughetto."
TwinSet airless duo: Aptar’s solution for hand hygiene and care,"Inspired by pieces of a puzzle that snap together, Aptar’s TwinSet airless duo package consists of two 15ml airless pumps that snap together or apart in one simple movement. One of the pump can be filled in with a hand sanitiser and the other with a hand care cream, thus offering a solution to the problem of dry hands caused by frequent washing and sanitizing. The individual pumps stand upright alone and can be used together or separately. According to Aptar Beauty + Home, the TwinSet’s airless pumps are fully customisable and interchangeable and can be easily modified to accommodate various types of skincare creams or sanitizers according to the combination preference. The petite, portable format of TwinSet duo offers the added convenience of being easily slipped into a purse or thrown into the car’s glove compartment, ensuring the product is on hand at a moment’s notice. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of hand sanitizing products became an entrenched part of everyday life. While hand washing and sanitising have always played a large role in the daily hygiene habits for most consumers, these habits have been magnified in 2020. According to Euromonitor, nearly all consumers (93%) now wash their hands at least twice a day and over half of them do so five or more times. “For all their benefits in preventing transmission of the virus and other germs, repeated use of hydroalcoholic gels may damage the skin’s natural protective layer of sebum, sometimes leading to skin dryness and the need to moisturize more often,” explains the packaging manufacturer. With TwinSet, Aptar intends to provide an easy remedy to the problem: a two-in-one packaging solution that enables consumers to sanitize and moisturize immediately afterwards. Aptar’s TwinSet offers the usual benefits of airless pumps, for instance, it ensures formula protection, even when the product is subjected to the rigorous demands of on-the-go portability. Furthermore, the airless pumps deliver a precise and progressive dose each time. “Made from ultra light, 100% plastic, TwinSet duos are easily recycled,” adds Aptar."
"Ozmi, a platform that makes cosmetic product development easier","Launched last October on the European market by German startup Chemster, Ozmi is positioned as a partner of beauty professionals throughout all phases of product development. The platform consists of an ecosystem which simplifies searches as regards formulas, ingredients and packaging specialists, and provides services for easier, safe exchanges every step of the way. “It is very hard for brands to coordinate all aspects of product design, due to the huge market fragmentation per business segment. And it is hard for suppliers to be visible for young brands and to provide them with the main information. Our concept is easy to use and time-saving,” says Udo Eberlein, CEO of Chemster. According to him, in certain cases, the system can half reduce time-to-market, which is pretty significant for young brands, the platform’s main target. In addition, users can choose to search a specific design aspect. Suppliers’ information and data are available, so they can contact any company to exchange and get a quote. Project management tools provide advice from the brief to the formula creation. “The platform is mainly aimed to offer tools to create any beauty-hygiene product, including perfumes, in the long run,” adds Udo Eberlein. The functionalities are designed to evolve day after day, depending on users’ demand. Right now, Ozmi counts 200 open accounts, but it should quickly develop as regards service providers. About 20 French partners are referenced, “but we sign new entries every day,” explains the CEO. Based on a collaborative system, the platform provides free access to most functionalities and a complementary offering of paid services."
"O My Note, the perfume app focused on emotions","By launching this app, Dr Sameh Megrhi, founder of OMИ, aims to both make it easier for non-specialists to choose a perfume and encourage those who gave up on this category to come back. Sameh Megrhi, PhD in computer vision, has worked in the field of AI for 12 years. She registered a patent for this solution out of her own resources. “Although it was created by humans, AI enhances creativity on unexpected levels,” she explains. She is now helped by seven people, and OMИ is part of Willa, an incubator which promotes women, who are still underrepresented in the data science industry. To offer a different perfume experience that meets ill-informed consumers’ needs, OMИ decided to focus on the origins of perfumery: emotions. “There is a semantic gap between what consumers express and the perfumes launched,” says Sameh Megrhi. As a result, the application makes it possible to record your own story (with a video, an audio recording, or a text) and explain your current cravings through your emotions and olfactory memories. The algorithm turns in real time the emotions you express into olfactory notes to suggest the smell you are looking for. OMИ selects key ingredients, which you can combine to others, to better identify your tastes. Based on the results, the application makes several perfume recommendations using a database of 40,000 products. In other words, a new language emerges, which consists in communicating your feelings to express your needs when purchasing a perfume. OMИ’s second level consists in meeting the rising demand for personalization. Buying a unique product is a recurring demand from Millennials and the Generation Z. These two generations have given up on this category which, in the long run, represents 30% of the purchasing capacity on the perfume segment. This second solution will be available on networking platform DeepNoze. The service will only be accessible with the Premium subscription. The application will encourage customers to use this means with perfumers, so as to implement a real co-creation process for which both parties will be responsible. For this service, Sameh Meghri selected perfumers Joëlle Lerioux in Grasse, Rawya Catto in Dubai, and Shahzad Haider, in Los Angeles, California. Currently in its beta version, OMИ is now ready to be taken to another level. A fundraising will soon be on the agenda."
ABBI customizes skincare based on a selfie,"A new example of the global digital wave in the beauty world, ABBI has just been launched on the market based on a concept combining personalized, connected, and clean beauty. ABBI - French acronym for authenticity, beauty, wellness, and individuality - was created by a couple, Joanna and Frédéric Ifergan, who took three years to develop a new generation of AI that can scan the face and identify the areas of improvement for cosmetics. On the Skan My Skin application, the Apoticare.fr website, or with the connected mirrors installed in pharmacies, users take their pictures to obtain a cream composed of a skincare base and three specific actives that meets their needs. Six skin problems are analysed - wrinkles, sensitivity, pimples, pigment spots, shininess, and radiance - and 40,000 formulas are available to solve them. The mixture is based on one of the six bases, the best-adapted to the skin problem identified (caviar and hyaluronic acid, stem and multiprotection cells, selenium and vitamin C, honey and shea, arnica and niacinamide, and aloe vera balm), enriched with three tailor-made actives. All this is made upon request, and the skincare product is sent 48h later with the customer’s first name engraved on the bottle."
Euro Wipes and Fibroline intend to revolutionize impregnated products,"This is a real revolution announced by Euro Wipes (Anjac Group), the French leader in the manufacture of products impregnated on a support, and Fibroline, the world leader in powder impregnation solutions, for impregnated wipes and masks serving the hygiene, cosmetics and health markets. The two companies signed, on October 7, a collaboration agreement to develop and market impregnated products (wipes, pads, masks) as part of a dry process, i.e. with no water or solvents. Both companies, relying on their respective technological know-how, seek to achieve a real technological breakthrough in the next three years to come. ""With this waterless formulation technology, the fields of possibilities are huge,"" they explained in a joint press release. Indeed, the dry impregnation of fabrics can make it possible to use new actives, which are to date difficult to integrate into a lotion, to increase naturalness in formulas, in particular by doing without preservatives and solvents, to reduce water consumption. Ultimately, these future innovations offer ""enhanced safety for both consumers and the environment."" And, which is more, this paradigm shift could be achieved ""without compromising on the efficiency and performance of products."" Indeed, according to Euro Wipes and Fibroline, the impregnation technique allows releasing the actives in the precise areas where their action is required. Concerning sensoriality, it is expected that it will be very different between wet products and dry products, not necessarily to the detriment of the latter. Everything will depend of the supports used and of the method of application. Using electric fields, Fibroline has developed technologies that allow distributing all types of powders in porous structures such as textiles, nonwoven, foams or papers. ""These patented solutions avoid the use of solvents or water, thus enhancing compliance with environmental standards,"" explains Jérôme Ville, CEO of the Fibroline Company. ""Also, our R&D centre is the ideal tool for our partners who are seeking to assess our solutions and secure their projects before the industrial launch. We have invested heavily over the past two years to offer our customers the latest generation laboratory and pilot units, and this, for all of our technologies."" By joining forces, the two French SMEs aim to change the way these products are manufactured and used, to meet consumer expectations in terms of safety and sustainability. ""Environmental and societal responsibility is at the heart of our corporate strategy"", underlined Guillaume Cantelou, CEO of Euro Wipes. ""We have been investing for years in responsible innovation, we strive to design, develop and manufacture continuously sustainable solutions, to offer products and services suited to the needs of customers and consumers, while encouraging an ecological attitude and responsible consumption."""
Towards an increasing digitization of facial skin care?,"Lockdown measures have generated a great deal of frustration in terms of beauty routines. Both men and women have scoured the internet for ideas, tips or advice to refresh their haircut, do a hair color, or treat themselves to a moment of well-being through treatments to be performed from their bathroom. While many beauty professionals have eventually reopened the doors of their salons, with sometimes drastic health and safety measures, they are struggling to regain lost ground. In France, according to a study carried out by consulting firm Asterès for the French beauty federation (FEBEA), beauty salons should see their annual sales fall by 25% in 2020. However, some brands are anticipating a potential second wave lockdown - or simply looking ahead to the future of the beauty sector - by digitalizing their skincare offer. That’s the case of Optiphi, a brand from South Africa, which has launched digital facials. To take advantage of these new-generation facials, all customers have to do is order one of the three kits offered on the brand’s website, which will be delivered to their home, and wait for a beautician to contact them to set up a virtual appointment. During the session, the professional will guide the client step by step to mix the products if necessary and perform the treatment with the appropriate gestures, provide advices you in relation to the client’s skin type, and monitor whether its skin reacts well to the application of the different products. While this new approach to skincare treatments sounds tempting, a few questions arise. Is it really possible to reproduce the - often highly technical - gestures of beauty professionals? And what about the relaxation aspect, inherently implied by an appointment in an institute? ""Due to covid-19, many concepts such as this one are bound to emerge, but they take it from being a moment of advice and relaxation to something virtual, devoid of any pleasure. It ends up being something quite different,"" said Dr. Isabelle Rousseaux, aesthetic dermatologist and board member of the French Union of Dermatologists. Lockdown measures have shown that men and women are ready to switch to the digital realm for many services in many areas. However, patterns of consumption remain very different from one country to another with specificities for each one. ""In France, people are rather attached to beauty treatments in salons. I don’t think that this concept would function here, unless people can’t leave their homes. However, in 10 years, I may say the exact opposite, who knows? But not at the present,"" stressed Rousseaux, who nevertheless believes that this type of digital concept could be developed in the future. Periods of lockdown have helped shake things up quite a bit all around. While beauty professionals have not had time to develop these types of at-home products and care, many have begun to offer online diagnostics, whether for skin or hair, so that everyone can buy the most suitable products or carry out hair coloring at home. Solutions that should sooner or later become more widely available. Actually, digitalization, online skin care and brick-and-mortar salons can be complementary. In any case, this is what Jean-Michel Karam is banking on: the creator of the IOMA brand has just bought France’s Atelier du Sourcil salon network. The clients will be offered the possibility to subscribe to an at-home skin care service guided by a smartphone app. “We will develop synergies between the two subsidiaries, our digital beauty solution IEVA and the Atelier du Sourcil network. Moreover, the technology provided for L’Atelier will also be massive. There are many innovative solutions to enhance services and solutions as regards personalization according to the face’s morphology,” Jean-Michel Karam told Premium Beauty News in a recent interview."
"Wikiparfum, an olfactory discovery tool for the general public","In line with the recent purchase of The Alchemist Atelier, a physical concept which makes it possible to create your own perfume during personalized workshops, Puig has just made an additional discovery tool available to the general public. In just a few clicks, this perfume Wikipedia offers a beautiful illustrated presentation to learn about the ingredients, notes and olfactory families of most perfumes on the market. The search can be done by perfume name or raw material. Wikiparfum also makes it possible to discover perfumes with ingredients similar and alternative to what you searched. “With The Alchemist Atelier, we found out that people need to understand perfume to compose it. It is a major obstacle to know how to explain bases and accords. So, we worked hard on perfume visualization. When people smell something and picture it, they can decipher the main ingredients more easily. Associating another sense makes olfaction much more accurate, so we decided to offer people interested in perfumes a simple tool to develop this knowledge,” explains Camila Tomas, Vice President Innovation Technology of Puig. This free digital tool is mainly intended for fragrance lovers, but it is adapted to any public. It can also be used by advisors in points of sale. “It is an excellent tool for them to exchange with consumers who do not know what they want, but can name their favourite fragrances,” adds Camila Tomas. Thanks to this platform the industry can gain understanding of emerging trends and consumer preferences resulting from consumers’ searches and choices.  In particular, Puig is offering this tool to retail partners. For example, Nocibé has launched a fragrance profiler using this technology. “We already have about a thousand visits a day, without any ads. But for us, what matters is not traffic, but what we learn from traffic. It is a source of knowledge about what people like. As part of one of the pilot projects we will implement with this technology, we will also ask people to evaluate our recommendations, so we see whether they think they are accurate or not,” adds the Director. Regularly updated, the platform should soon become a 10,000-perfume database. Available in French, English, and Spanish, it is only accessible in Europe for now. “Right now, we are working on broadening the platform content to perfumes popular in North America and Latin America, so that we reach these continents, as well as the Middle East. We also want to become a niche perfume showcase,” concludes Camila Tomas."
Geka adapts its offer to the post-Covid era with new beauty & care line,"Observing that the skin care and the colour & care categories are now increasing at a much faster pace than the liquid colour cosmetics segment, Geka is launching ""Take Care"", a range of liquid beauty products and accessories combining beauty and self-care benefits. “In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, people are spending more time at home and changing their behaviours: focusing on wellbeing, body and soul harmony,” explains the full-service provider of liquid cosmetic products and beauty accessories. Focusing on mindful self-care, Geka’s latest beauty collection features: a lash & brow serum, a lip pampering oil, a Gua Sha board, a silicon mask brush and a beauty bag. The collection’s packaging was designed to be strongly evocative of the skincare category and all formulas are vegan and enriched with super food ingredients. According to Geka, the light and transparent lip pampering oil included in the new collection conjures-up a sensuous and soft feeling on the lips. It is enriched with jojoba oil for extra lip hydration. Combined with the brand-new patented pearl shaped softPEARL applicator, the product can be easily and gently applied on the lips. Concerning the lash & brow serum, it’s vegan, paraben-free, transparent and enriched with vitamin E formula has been designed to naturally comb and fortify lashes and brows. The serum is applied with the asymmetrical wonderSTYLIST brush allowing a 2-in-1 application: the longer bristles on one side enable to comb and well-define the lashes by taking them at the root, while the shorter bristles on the other side can be used to define and comb brows easily. In addition to the two cosmetic products, the “Take Care” collection consists of three accessories: – A gua sha board made of white jade. The facial tool is reputed helping to reduce wrinkles, dark circles under the eyes and promote lymph drainage for improved skin elasticity.
– A silicone mask brush designed for an even and smooth application of face masks.
– A make-up bag made of canvas. Earlier this year, Geka presented Reborn, a line of eye make-up products with sustainable packaging solutions, either using recycled materials or bio-based alternatives. Bottles are made of 100% PCR-PET and caps are made of 100% PCR-PP. Flocked applicators are made of minimum 25% recycled flock and brushes are of exclusive EOSgreen and EOSgreendelta fibres (bio-based fibres consisting of 100% renewable raw materials derived from the castor oil plant). The wiper is made of LDPE with a bio-based content of 84%, derived from sugar cane. Eventually, the thread parts are made of 100% bio-based materials also delivered from the renewable castor oil plant. Recently, the company also announced the launch of new product categories available within their 3D online configuration tool. In addition to mascaras, beauty brands can now configurate and style online tailor-made packaging and application solutions for their hair, eye, lip and face make-up product launches. “By combining Geka’s packaging and applicator expertise, along with our digital knowledge, we provide users with an efficient solution to develop their products and transform what is typically a lengthy and costly process,” explains the company. “With over 150 stock components and thousands of combinations, the user can find a perfect match by selecting different criteria: desired make-up result, type of applicator, packaging filling volume or material, to name a few options.” The online configurator is available at: configurator.geka-world.com With this set of new products and services the German supplier once again proves its ability to quickly address new trends and adapt to the ever changing market environment."
N.A.E. tests online sales and zero plastic packaging with Amazon,"In partnership with Amazon, N.A.E. further enhances its commitment to sustainability with an eCommerce pilot project featuring reduced packaging material and optimized supply chain methods. N.A.E.’s new plastic-free Solids Box is available for purchase in Germany, Italy and France and can be ordered exclusively on Amazon. Each box contains a solid face, body and shampoo bar as well as a reusable soap pouch. The solid bars from N.A.E. are vegan, certified organic and contain ingredients with 99% natural origin. The three bars in the Solids Box come without any additional packaging and are thus “naked”. This way, no additional material is used for the wrapping of single items inside the box. The quantity of material has also been reduced for the outer packaging. The box is made from 100% FSC-certified paper and is ready for shipment without using any secondary packaging from Amazon. Only an address label is needed so that the boxes, which fit into any regular mailbox, are ready to be sent to consumers. According to Henkel, the packaging is “frustration-free” meaning that it is easy to handle and - more importantly - that all its materials are 100% recyclable. “The plastic-free packaging and water-reduced formulas of the solids make this project a great example of accelerating sustainability,” said the company in a release. Beyond the reduction of packaging material, Henkel also worked on the simplification of supply chain processes. Since the products are directly supplied in the paper container itself, the boxes are ready for dispatch and do not need to be additionally packed, which again allows to skip certain steps in the supply chain. In 2018, Henkel set up its sustainability targets for 2025, with the aim that 100% of the group’s packaging being recyclable, reusable or compostable."
Meiyume addresses beauty retails’ new normal with touchless testers,"With retail shops around the world beginning to reopen, Meiyume is prototyping a touchless sampling tester to create a safe and hygienic in-store environment for consumers and retail staff. Powered by battery packs or AC power, the new device is motion-activated and can dispense any type of fragrance or liquid skincare product. The mechanism uses existing ‘off-the-shelf’ products so there is no need to design new tester packaging or change the current supply chain. According to the supplier of packaging, product and retail solutions for the beauty industry, the touchless tester display is easily adjustable depending on the size of different tester bottles. However Meiyume is also able to offer bespoke designs for specific projects. The company expects its touchless testers to launch in stores in the next few months, thus allowing shoppers to continue the essential experience of physically and personally testing products in-store, an area facing tremendous disruption as consumers remain cautious about touching potentially contaminated surfaces outside their home. “Retail stores are where customers engage with beauty products, and Meiyume’s touchless fragrance and skincare testers allows them to continue to experience this in a safe and hygienic way,” said Steve Dodd, Senior Vice President of Retail Solutions at Meiyume. “Our touchless testers are motion-activated, and can be retro-fitted on existing displays or added on store countertops.” Taking into consideration the new normal, Meiyume has also developed solutions such as adapting their in-store displays to provide an automated density guide so customers and sales associates maintain social-distancing guidelines to help flatten the curve. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the customer tracking dashboards included in Meiyume’s in-store digital displays help to better understand new consumer behaviours. “During the Covid-19 pandemic, Meiyume has been actively supporting our customers and our communities. We want to be proactive in offering innovative solutions for our customers, especially during these challenging times,” said Gerard Raymond, President of Meiyume. “Our retail solutions team has been working hard to continuously develop new products and solutions that will re-imagine how consumers will interact with beauty products during the pandemic today, and in the future.”"
Kanebo to offer more color and texture flexibility with new makeup lineup,"In a move to offer more inclusive products, Kanebo Cosmetics has announced the launch of a series of new products and limited editions, including base makeup and foundation that can be mixed together. A total of thirty-six items of nine types will debut in Japan on September 04, 2020, at prices ranging from 800 to 6,000 yen (880 and 6,600 yen, including tax). The coming releases will extend Kanebo’s creative focus on expressing hope while highlighting the attractions of individuality. On a functional level, the makeup strategy shifts away from “concealing” skin concerns with foundation on top of makeup base, to widening the range of expression by finishing the skin with a base-and-foundation blend.  “Finer control of skin texture and color reveals the distinct features and beauty of every person,” explains the Japanese brand in a statement. Together with new makeup base, Kanebo will release lip and eye makeup. Kanebo Fusionfit Wear foundation is designed to enhance the beauty of the skin by feeding it with moisture and glow. It forms a thin veil on the skin thanks to hybrid pigments coated with the ingredient containing amino acid derivatives that are similar to natural components of skin ensures beautiful, clear coloring that lasts. Kanebo Performing Drop makeup base comes in a range of textures and finishes and can be used used together with Kanebo Fusionfit Wear to give the skin with a clear, effortless-looking finish by controlling color and texture. Performing Drop opens up possibilities for the creation of distinctive impressions. Three colors will be available: Radiant Black, Vibrant Red, and Misty White. Kanebo Moisture Rouge Neo lipstick combines makeup with care. It colors the lips while moisturizing them. The oil base, with its wrapping effect, comforts the lips with sensations of moisture while protecting them from dryness."
Green chemistry: these new ingredients about to change perfumes,"The companies replacing petrochemistry-derived perfume molecules with their 100% natural counterpart obtained by green chemistry processes still represent a niche. As the molecules are produced in small quantity, their high cost curbs the development of these natural solutions at a large scale. “So far, no established brand producing large volumes has claimed an all-natural offering with ingredients derived from green chemistry. However, some customers impose constraints on their use, but the cost of the formula is multiplied by three or four,” says perfumer Antoine Lie. Much involved in this search for natural perfumes, the creator is now turning to players from new industrial horizons who have been developing natural reactive precursors to be mass-produced – and more affordable. Afyren valorizes plant biomass to create molecules that are usually synthesized with oil. “Our solution consists in valorizing agro-industrial by-products to obtain already-existing synthetic molecules based on oil,” explains Jérémy Pessiot, founder and Director of Afyren. These by-products are derived from the agro-industry, in particular the sugar industry. Afyren retrieves beetroot pulp or treacle at sugar refineries to make them ferment and get organic acids used to produce molecules for different industries, like human and animal food, cosmetics, and of course, aromas and perfumes. This company founded in 2012 is singular in that it is getting ready for the large-scale production of these natural, environmentally-friendly products. In late 2020, they will launch the works to build a plant based in France intended to supply 16,000 tonnes of organic acid per year. This industrial volume will make the molecules derived from this technology much more competitive and help Afyren become the global leader in this field. “We have managed to copy nature through biomimicry and make it a 100% natural, waste-free process at the industrial scale satisfying all circular economy criteria. In addition, we will produce seven carboxylic acids at the same time, whereas seven different plants or processes are required to obtain them from oil. Lastly, our process reduces CO2 emissions by 70% per tonne produced,” adds Jérémy Pessiot. Pending this industrial step, Afyren has already started working with perfume houses to produce solutions in smaller quantity. As far as perfumes are concerned, these molecules are mainly used to get fruity notes and ingredients in the ester family – by combining an alcohol with an acid. “It is a family that can be reproduced as long as the two natural components are available. There are plenty of esters in the perfume sector: they are rather cheap molecules, so they are widely used. Therefore, it is very interesting to be able to find alternatives. My job consists in guaranteeing olfactory equivalence compared to the synthetic version,” explains Antoine Lie. “Players like Afyren use their strike force due to their size to provide perfumers with more and more competitive products as regards the price, but other research programmes focused on new original ingredients are underway,” he adds. The idea is to try and combine existing natural ingredients with reactants derived from green chemistry. This time, the result might offer the market new olfactory materials, both original and in large quantities. “This other aspect of creative research is very exciting. It shows green chemistry has a bright future in the perfume sector. All these initiatives contribute to the transition to an ever-greener perfume industry,” states Antoine Lie."
"In search of sustainability, La Roche-Posay launches first cardboard-based tubes","Available from May in France, Anthelios’ new moisturizing sunscreen body lotion (Anthelios is La Roche-Posay range dedicated to protect the skin against the harmful effects of sunrays), aims to protecting both the skin and the environment, with an eco-designed packaging and an innovative formulation. By incorporating cardboard, this new tube reduces by 45% the quantity of plastic required for its manufacture compared to a conventional tube. Fruit of the international partnership announced last October between L’Oréal and Albéa, the global leading supplier of packaging solutions for beauty products, this new generation of tubes was designed as an alternative to the various solutions currently used for cosmetic products. “We have adapted our manufacturing process to incorporate this new technology, replacing part of the plastic in the tube with cardboard. This is a first,"" commented Barbara de Saint-Aubin, Managing Director at Albéa Tubes Europe. While not recyclable (actually most tubes aren’t), these new packs allow significant environmental gains. In order to assess the impact of the new Anthelios 200 ml tubes, La Roche-Posay and Albéa have conducted an initial life cycle analysis. The results show that the tubes’ carbon footprint is ""the lowest in their category"". ""The launch of these very first Anthelios tubes to incorporate cardboard represents an important step in our quest to reduce the environmental footprint of packaging. We intend to extend this experimental technology to other iconic products of the brand and to offer it in as many countries as possible,"" said Laetitia Toupet, International General Manager of La Roche-Posay. Other eco-responsible cosmetic tube solutions already exist, including mono-material tubes, sometimes recyclable, tubes made from post-consumer recycled plastics (PCR) or from bioplastics. But this new solution allows La Roche-Posay to progress rapidly towards their goal to significantly reducing the use of virgin plastics in their products by replacing them with recycled materials. In 2020, La Roche-Posay will pass the 25% mark of recycled plastic (10 times more than in 2018). The brand’s ambition is to increase this proportion to 70% by 2025, the equivalent of 10,000 tonnes of virgin plastic saved in five years. Since 2012, the brand has also focused on reducing the weight of its tubes to reduce the use of plastic. In 2020, all large format bottles will have their weight reduced by 10%. In addition to these packaging innovations, La Roche-Posay is also committed to ensuring the safety of their formulas for aquatic environments. Anthelios formulas have been tested in fresh and salt water on a representative sample of marine organisms. The laboratory therefore called on experts from the Monaco Scientific Center (CSM) to define new evaluation standards, notably on the impact of sunscreen products on corals. These environmental concerns do not hamper the brand’s efforts to protect the skin. Indeed, the new Anthelios moisturizer is based on the new patented Netlock technology, developed by L’Oréal’s research, thus enhancing protection against UVA rays thanks to an ultra-resistant water, perspiration and sand proof formula. With this new product, La Roche-Posay is therefore continuing their journey towards the drastic reduction of their environmental footprint. The brand, which achieved carbon neutrality for its French factory in 2018, already announced that other initiatives based on the use of paper or cardboard are currently being assessed."
How to develop ecodesigned sun products,"More ecoconscious, more careful with ingredients, more protective of the environment… today’s consumers have quickly changed expectations. And as they are faced with this new equation, i.e. provide more performance with cleaner and cleaner formulas, brands and laboratories constantly look for more innovation, in particular as regards UV filters, key elements in these formulas. “There are two UV filter families: chemical and mineral filters. But they both involve constraints,” explains Ludivine Burlot, R&D Director of Laboratoire Shadeline, specialized in the formulation of dermocosmetics and sun products. Two of the most common chemical filters are controversial. “Brands ask us to develop formulas without using these controversial materials, if possible, i.e. octocrylene and OMC (Ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate or Octyl methoxycinnamate), because they are the most disparaged chemical filters for being endocrine disruptors, although they are authorized by regulations,” confirms Justine Alexandre, Marketing Project Manager of Alpol Cosmétique. To cope with this constraint, formulators have been working on alternatives in line with a protective efficacy objective. “There are other filters available, but they are more expensive, because they are more recent, and we have been studying different combinations mainly focused on efficacy, but also on the naturalness aspect. Sometimes it is preferable to choose a better SPF over naturalness, because protection is the main criterion. Guaranteeing a satisfactory SPF is a priority for us,” adds the Alpol Cosmétique expert. Providing efficient, natural, healthy protection also requires using mineral filters, provided they are free from any nanoparticles, a category consumers are wary about. However, these mineral filters tend to offer less sensoriality. As they are very heavy, the titanium and zinc molecules used create a white colour on the skin, which is difficult to prevent without compromising on naturalness. “Non-nano mineral filters are those that best meet the naturalness, efficacy, and safety demand. White traces are inherent to them, but thanks to our expertise, we can formulate products with pleasant, easy-to-spread textures. And it is also possible to incorporate chemical filters that leave no doubt. They are not all bad,” explains Ludivine Burlot. So, for now, the consensus would involve a combination of non-controversial chemical filters and mineral filters. The will to minimize the impact of products on aquatic environments adds even more difficulty. This recent, but strong consumer expectation is now driving innovation. Given the ever-increasing demand, in 2015, Alpol Cosmétique set up a research and innovation group on sun care, which identified three main ocean-friendly principles: reinforced waterproofness, so that the formula does not flow into the ocean, biodegradable formulas, and fewer endocrine disruptor residues likely to cause fish feminization. Within this context, the brand SeventyOnePercent created ten years ago by two surfers, Raphaël Vannier and Marc Levy, develops environmentally friendly, technical sun products adapted to their sport. “We wanted to go natural, but not to the detriment of sun protection,” explains Raphaël Vannier. Initially, the brand entered the surf market with a small range of water-resistant products free from any controversial filters, based on a very pragmatic principle: products “which stay on the skin instead of ending up in the water”. In 2018, the range was reformulated based on new technical advances and adapted to the general public. “Our definition of clean beauty makes us constantly question ourselves. There is no such thing as a perfect product. If you introduce a foreign body to the ocean, it is hard to say there will be no impact. So, we minimize our products dissolving in water by making them hyper-water-resistant,” adds Raphaël Vannier. New developments combining organic and mineral filters are anhydrous products or oily formulas based on a rational choice of filters. “We endeavour to use as few filters as possible in our formulas, while providing an SPF50+. We aim to offer the best-adapted product at a given time,” says the co-founder. With ten references, reinforced distribution, an online store and a strong presence on Instagram, SeventyOnePercent is pretty successful. The products are 80% to 100% natural and available in three shades: invisible, white (surfers/sportsmen are not bothered at all by this effect) or coloured (more playful for children). “Our success is due to the fact that we deal with this issue in a different way, playing on transparency in our messages. We do not pretend to make the best product, but we try to offer the best-adapted. We also need to adopt less inhibited communication to keep enjoying our time in the sun as a moment of pleasure,” says Raphaël Vannier. As there are no “ideal” alternatives to sun filters, laboratories have been working on reducing their quantity for the same result. For example, in collaboration with the other laboratories of the Anjac Health & Beauty group, which they belong to, Laboratoire Shadeline has been working on a patented natural molecular complex: SPF Boost. This complex of natural ingredients multiplies the power of chemical and mineral filters to reduce the quantity used, without compromising on the efficacy of an SPF50+ formula, while preserving great sensoriality. Laboratoires Shadeline, Sicaf, and Innovi, the ingredient’s inventor, are still in the development phase, but SPF Boost should be marketed this year. “Because it involves a public health issue, sun protection is getting more and more widely used everywhere in our environment, even on a daily basis. So, filters should not be the only answer to protection. We need to adopt new habits. We have also been working on filter-free formulas, which will take more time,” concludes Ludivine Burlot."
Odore responds to Covid-19 with a new device and a vision for beauty retail,"Designed and developed in a very short time, Odore’s new dispensing devices are designed to be deployed to public spaces within the UK, in order to dispense products such as hand sanitisers and masks, whilst showcasing the latest government initiatives and other educational measures and helping combat the spread of the virus. The purpose-built devices have been introduced to reduce human contact, whereby a customer scans a QR code on screen and completes a short questionnaire highlighting key symptoms, and other experiences linked to Covid-19. Following this, the customer would receive an essential hygiene item immediately from the device, for instance a hand sanitizer. With this non-profit initiative, Odore has created a frictionless mechanism to distribute of essential products, whilst also providing a platform to showcase the latest governmental educational measures and advice against the virus. Furthermore, Odore explains they can use their data analytical capabilities to feed the information they have collected during the distribution back to governmental agencies with a goal of getting one stop closer to stop the spread of the virus. “We are proud to support this initiative within the UK and fully cooperating to ensure that these devices can be successfully deployed to fulfill the purpose of combating the spread of the virus,” says Armaan Mehta, who serves as co-founder at Odore. Actually, the new device provides almost the same innovative features than the latest generation of Odore’s dispensers of beauty samples. They allow, to optimise distribution by ensuring products reach more people as they can be placed in multiple key locations across the country,  They can collect data to show who is receiving the products. And they offer a frictionless process through a QR Code scanning. In this evolving and challenging landscape, Odore’s initiative might also pave the way to an alternative to boost online sales. “We are facing an unprecedented crisis, and we are working with our brand partners to revise strategies and priorities. As bricks and mortar stores are closed, and we cannot predict customers’ retail behaviours after the situation improves, we assume that e-commerce will be our brand partners #1 priority,” confirms Mehta. Indeed, with their intelligent dispensers of samples, interacting with social media and collecting data, Odore intends to help brands bridge the gap between the digital and the physical. The company can now create digital sampling campaigns to target the right customers on social media, email and even on the brand’s website and combine them with their sampling devices. “This gives our partners the ability to increase awareness, incorporate appealing offers and provide tailor-made discovery tools, while customers can try their products within the comfort of their own homes. This solution would complement a brand’s marketing efforts by growing online sales in quantitative and irresistible ways,” concludes Mehta."
When artificial intelligence optimises online beauty shopping,"Premium Beauty News - Beauty Matching Engine (BME) is not your first beauty tech entrepreneurial adventure? Nidhima Kohli - Five years ago, I have developed a tool called My Beauty Matches (MBM). It helps consumers find the best products for themselves following a diagnostic quiz. They will then receive personalised product recommendations based on the submitted answers. They can then shop them online through the connected retailers thanks to price comparison. To develop this tool, we had identified key ingredients and product claims to match to any beauty concerns. It’s not only for skincare but for every beauty category from makeup to fragrances and hair. Premium Beauty News - Why develop this new concept? Nidhima Kohli - We wanted to launch a B2B white label plug-in solution for beauty brands and retailers so they can also now offer their customers a digital beauty assistant, but also help them personalise their full customer journey, i.e. their complementary products, upsells, emails, product listing pages and more - using five years competitor data via MBM. Also currently in the market there are many 360 degree personalisation solutions which are great but they are not beauty specific, so they do not give the same 400% uplift in sales like using a beauty specific solution or they take 3-6 months to really show an uplift and are quite manual. Our solution provides effective results from day one. The Beauty Matching Engine (BME) solution helps companies provide their customers a personalised shopping experience with or without a digital beauty assistant. When replying to the online quiz consumers receive a gradation in percentage, to see which products matches their needs the most and it continuously optimises, unlike a general beauty diagnostic.  The AI technology also explains to the customer why the product is being recommended to them. Premium Beauty News - How does this work? Nidhima Kohli - By merging AI with beauty specific intelligence, the BME plug-in applies dynamic machine learning algorithms to identify nuanced patterns within consumer datasets.  In other words, BME identifies preferred beauty products by age, skin concerns for instance. The more consumers visit the online shop, the more information and the more the tool learns (and we already have 5 years of data). The engine then narrows down customer choice, predicting which product the customer is most likely to buy, increasing sales & loyalty. BME personalises product recommendations, complementary products, emails, landing pages. Eventually, it improves sales conversion rates by 30-600%. Beauty websites offer plethora of products and the recommendations are not always accurate in terms of skin tone, lipstick colour or hair thickness for instance. It can result in lower sales conversion due to incorrect product recommendation or choice paralysis (too much choice). Also, without proper targeted data, consumers visits are less frequent or lead to less conversion. Premium Beauty News - Can the solution be implemented on any platform/website. How does it work for the consumer? Nidhima Kohli - It’s completely transparent for the consumer. They can click on “Digital Beauty Assistant” or any other nudge on the website to start the quiz and be recommended products. They need to answer a diagnostic quiz asking for their skin type, skin concerns, hair and body concerns and product or scent preference for instance. The solution can be implemented directly onto a brand website or an online retailer. We just plug it on top of the current website (Javascript/API plugin) without altering the design or the shopping experience. It’s just an additional help to direct the consumer.  We just need the product feed and it takes the brand / retailer just 1-2 hours to set up. The diagnostic quiz can be personalised according the brand category. We have implemented BME in the UK with the The French Pharmacy. They needed a beauty personalisation solution for the website and a digital beauty consultant to match the in-store recommendations as close as possible. The tailor-made technology was super quick and easy to implement, needing only a couple of hours from the founder. They have already seen a 50% increase in AoV (Average Order Value) a 400% increase in conversion rates to sales. The tool also offers companies an analytics dashboard with granular beauty profile consumer insights & metrics so their clients can hyper personalise their social media advertising and e-mailings. It can be implemented online, through email or in-store for every beauty category. Premium Beauty News - You’ve recently joined the L’Oréal beauty tech start-up accelerator at Station F in Paris. How is it helping you? Nidhima Kohli - The program is aimed at innovative Beauty Tech start-ups, from small to big sizes businesses. BME joined the program in February, and it gives us access to resources from L’Oréal but also business mentoring and investor connections for instance. Station F and L’Oréal also host their own events to help us grow and learn more skills. It’s a real luck and advantage in our competitive world, which I’m really thankful for."
Kao launches new sustainable personal care line MyKirei in the USA,"With MyKirei, Kao bets on the clean beauty trend to gain some name recognition with consumers in the USA. Indeed, the Japanese word ‘kirei’ describes something that is clean, well-ordered and beautiful, all at the same time. The word was already used by the Tokyo-headquartered group - whose brand portfolio includes Bioré, Goldwell, Jergens, Laurier, Merries, John Frieda and Molton Brown - to promote its new Environmental, Social, and Governance strategy last year. ""In Japan, Kirei has many meanings. It can describe beauty and cleanliness, as well as simplicity, balance and sustainability,"" explains Karen Frank, President Kao USA. ""The Kirei sensibility has always been unique to and treasured by the Japanese people. With MyKirei, we are bringing this wisdom to the Western consumer with innovation for a gentler, more sustainable way of living."" The new product collection features three products: a Nourishing Shampoo, a Conditioner and a Hand Wash. The products will be available exclusively at amazon.com beginning April 22nd at USD18 each. According to Kao, MyKirei products were developed with global sustainability challenges - including climate change, aging societies, resource scarcity, and plastic waste in the ocean - in mind. As far as ingredients are concerned, MyKirei products offer vegan-friendly, plant-based formulas that are 95% biodegradable with authentic Japanese ingredients, like Yuzu Fruit, Rice Water and Japanese Tsubaki flower. “Each of these treasured ingredients has been trusted for centuries in Japanese folklore for their multiple, legendary benefits. Carefully curated fragrances, ranging from the calming, soothing Rock Garden scent, to the fresh, energizing citrus Yuzu fruit blooms, signal the beauty and tranquility of Japan,” claims the brand. In addition, all products in the range are packed in bottles using up to 50% less plastic compared to traditional bottles. The lightweight bottles gain their rigidity through an air fill, allowing them to stand upright, like a traditional bottle. The water tight design of the delivery system prevents contamination and allows consumers to use nearly every last drop they have paid for. “Competitors leave up to thee times more product in more traditional packaging,” claims Kao. Eventually, to ensure that no waste is left behind, Kao has partnered with TerraCycle to create a program to allow consumers to recycle the package and the pumps post-use."
Netlock: A new technology for L’Oréal’s next generation sunscreens,"In the cosmetic world, the sunscreen category represents a sensitive segment in many respects. From a health point of view, brands need to convince as many people as possible to adopt UV protection gestures, with a range of products that are safe, accessible and suitable for everyday use. Whether light or dark, all skin types are affected. Yet, to date, only two out of five people protect their skin from the sun (Yougov Study - 2019), even though UV exposure is known to be the main cause of skin cancer (2 to 3 million new cases each year according to the WHO). Consumer awareness is however rising steadily with, in particular, a significant 58% increase in the use of SPF 50 and 50+ products in France. The consumption of daily photo-protection products is also evolving in parallel, with  43% increase in 2019 against + 8% for other sunscreen categories, according to L’Oréal. Fully aware of these issues, L’Oréal’s Research & Innovation laboratory has worked on its formulas in order to ultimately achieve the best possible protection, namely to cover the entire spectrum of UVA/UVB rays while ensuring a comfortable application and long wear properties over time. ""Traditionally, sun filters are located in the oil droplets of emulsions, but they won’t be able to do a proper job if these droplets don’t cover the skin areas properly. Our objective was therefore to ensure an optimal distribution, to fit skin reliefs and offer stability over time,"" says Stéphane Douezan, Head of the Photoprotection Development Laboratory at L’Oréal and inventor of the Netlock technology. After three years of research, the laboratory identified an ""ideal"" polymer, co-developed with its active ingredients suppliers. This polymer gels and stabilizes the droplets containing the filters, thus forming an extremely tight and protective structure. The Netlock technology anchors the filters in an ultra-thin film, invisible on the skin, thus giving formulas increased efficiency, but also higher resistance to water, sweat, sand, while preventing product migration in the eyes. The potentially negative impact of sunscreens on coral bleaching, which would eventually lead to their disappearance, is an additional challenge to formulators. To this outstanding issue, L’Oréal replies by confirming that its formula has no impact on ecosystems. ""L’Oréal researchers only use ingredients that do not present foreseeable risks for the environment,"" says Marc Léonard, Director of the Group’s Environmental Research Laboratory. The teams rely on the data provided by their ingredient suppliers, or even on their own ingredient biodegradability tests. According to Marc Léonard, only a small fraction of sunscreen products are found in water in extremely low doses, with no consequences. Finally, backed by supporting studies, the group challenges the idea of a proven effect of sunscreens on corals. ""Coral bleaching mostly results from global warming, the poor purification of urban effluents and industrial waste, but also to the leaching of agricultural land, which during tropical rains, deposit sediments, fertilizers and pesticides inside lagoons,"" says Marc Léonard."
Pujolasos launches a skincare version of their natural and compostable cap,"Recently patented by Pujolasos, the new Woork cap responds to the growing demand for 100% natural, ecological and responsible packaging solutions in the cosmetics perfumery perfumes industry. Two months after the launch of a first item dedicated to the fragrance market, Pujolasos Packaging has showcased a new version of their innovation at ADF&PCD and PLD Paris 2020. The caps can now be adapted on skin care jars, while retaining their original characteristics: they are free from plastic and only use 100% natural materials. Woork caps are only made from natural and compostable materials, such as wood and cork. All plastic inner parts have been removed and there is no glue between the different materials. Wood and cork are a fully renewable natural materials, they are 100% recyclable and fully compostable. “This innovation responds to the current need and demand of the market aimed at offering to 100% organic and sustainable packaging products for the beauty sector. The innovation departments of the main brands in the sector work very intensely on how to obtain more sustainable packaging and offer to consumers the most ecological packaging. Woork, is Pujolasos’ contribution to make a better sustainable world,” said the company in a statement."
"Hermetica, the first brand of molecular fragrances","Hermetica wanted to ride the wave of cleaner perfumes. ""People want to know if what they wear on their skin is safe, for them and for the environment, so we had to challenge conventions in the world of fine perfumery by leveraging on creativity,"" describes the founder. The discovery of Symrise’s Innoscent technology convinced her of the advantages of an alcohol-free formula where olfactory molecules take pride of place in a water-based support, thus revealing an intense and lasting fragrance with hydrating properties for the skin. ""Freed of alcohol which dries up the skin, these perfumes are hydrating, transparent in appearance, easier to market in some countries and above all more powerful than formulas containing alcohol,"" explains Aliénor Massenet, Perfume Creator at Symrise, who collaborated for more than two years with Clara Molloy to develop the range. The Innoscent technology, exclusive to Hermetica, instantly reveals the heart of the fragrance, as the creator points out: ""It has been proven that, six hours later, the olfactory strength of Hermetica perfumes is 56% more powerful than those containing alcohol, more hydrating and with a softer scent. What’s also special about the formula is that top, middle and bottom notes are released simultaneously."" Beyond this unique olfactory specificity, the brand boasts a new mode of creation more consistent with its desire to offer ""clean fragrances"". ""We can stress on the fact that Hermetica perfumes contain up to 50% ingredients of renewable origin. The muguet molecule in Jade888 was created from orange peels originating from the production of orange juice. Several of the molecules present in Megaflower, Rosefire and Spiceair also originate from a renewable source, recovered from paper industry waste. It’s another way of being clean, giving new lease of life to what was considered as waste. The approach also applies to packaging: our bottles are renewable and made from recycled glass and locally sourced sand,"" says Clara Molloy. The range is available in 13 scents, 12 of which make up the 4 collections, Emerald Stairways, Vertical Ambers, The Door and Dry Waters. These are complemented by Source, the mother fragrance, which is self-standing and found in each perfume. In France, the fragrances are available on the Hermetica.com site as well as at the Printemps Haussman department store. “Even if talking about chemistry and waste in the composition of a perfume may still seem a long way from traditional codes, yet, this is the way we must think our work today, as a Fragrance House. We are entering a new era,"" concludes Clara Molloy."
Beauty Tech : The main innovations of the 2020 CES,"Undoubtedly, the two beauty highlights of the 2020 edition of CES in Las Vegas were the devices introduced by L’Oréal and L’Occitane and allowing to make custom cosmetic and skin care products at home. Developed by the L’Oréal Technology Incubator, the Perso smart skincare system is capable of providing personalized skincare solutions via a four-step process taking into account the specificities of the user’s skin, local weather conditions, and the user’s product preferences. According to L’Oréal, the device is also able to make custom formulas for lipstick and foundation. However, the beauty giant plans to roll out those features at a later date. Firstly, the device is scheduled to launch in partnership with one of the group’s leading skincare brands in the year 2021. L’Occitane en Provence is also betting on personalized beauty with Duolab, a machine developed in partnership with Rowenta. The patented innovation comprises a device, a range of capsules - including three moisturising bases and five targeted concentrates - and a skin diagnostic tool. The tool assesses the customer’s skin requirements and generates a personalised care protocol. Different combinations of capsules are recommended for morning and evening, taking into account each customer’s specific needs. A patented emulsification process delivers a freshly blended single-use dose in 90 seconds. Customers can either buy their capsules on the go or have a set delivered to their door monthly through a subscription. Korea’s leading beauty company, Amorepacific, presented a 3D face mask printing system. Dubbed IOPE Tailored 3D Mask and created in collaboration with the 3D printing system developer Lincsolution, Amorepacific’s system uses a smartphone app to instantly measure users’ facial dimensions and print a personalized hydrogel mask that caters to individual facial features and skin conditions. P&G Ventures, the startup studio within Procter & Gamble, returned to CES 2020 to showcase the development of Opte Precision Skincare System. Introduced to the public last year, this personalized handheld inkjet printer can instantly make the appearance of skin’s hyperpigmentation disappear and fade spots over time. Opte’s digital camera scans the skin and instantly analyzes each image using a proprietary algorithm to detect tonal imperfections not visible to the human eye. The device then precisely deposits picolitre droplets of Spot Optimizing Serum on target areas until there is a perfect colour match with the surrounding skin tone. However, smart mirrors have not disappeared from the landscape. New devices designed for at-home use are now available. With its latest innovation, HiMirror thus intends to democratize the use of connected mirrors. Priced US$119, the HiMirror Slide is designed for both at home and on-the-go use. The HiMirror Slide’s 8"" size comes equipped with slideable panels plus a foldable, rotatable stand for easy storage and both portrait and landscape viewing. To ease makeup application, two LED ambient-light strips surround the mirror. The mirror includes smart features such as Amazon-Alexa, music streaming, social media, weather and news updates, as well as Google Assistant conversation actions. An Enterprise Pro version, intended for retailers, dermatologists and physians wishing to better serve their customers and patients, was also showcased at CES 2020. Korean manufacturer INCO.AI also presented a smart mirror intended for use at home. Their brand new Venus model features 7"" touchscreen LCD, Alexa built-in, skin diagnostic/AR makeup function, table mood lamp, LED ring lights for makeup, and artificial intelligence tools. Neutrogena relaunched their Skin360 app, which was initially presented at CES 2018, eliminating the need for a separate skin analysis tool. The selfie analysis is now powered by Perfect Corp.’s YouCam technology, that provides lightning fast analysis for a broad range of skin parameters including wrinkles, fine lines, dark under-eye circles, dark spots and smoothness. Among the multitude of other innovations presented at CES 2020, let’s also mention the Oral-B iO smart toothbrush from Procter & Gamble, and the smart mirror solutions for hair salons by Wella."
"L’Oréal introduces Perso, a smart device that makes beauty personal","Developed by the L’Oréal Technology Incubator, Perso stands at just 6.5 inches high, but offers big solutions: the smart skincare system is capable of providing personalized skincare solutions via a four-step process. First up is a personal skin analysis, performed via the Perso mobile app using L’Oréal-owned ModiFace artificial intelligence (AI) technology to assess the user’s complexion. Then, using Breezometer geo-location data, Perso assesses any local environmental conditions - such as humidity, weather and the UV index - that might influence the state of the user’s skin. The third step sees the user share their personal skincare concerns and product preferences with the app, before the final step, in which the device dispenses a single dose of a personalized blend of product such as moisturizer, serum or under-eye cream. The technology also adjusts for morning and evening application, and the brand claims that with regular use, Perso’s AI platform will be able to alert users to the formulas that are working best for them and automatically adapt its formulas. According to L’Oréal, Perso is also able to make custom formulas for lipstick and foundation, with the beauty giant planning to roll out those features at a later date. In the meantime, the device is scheduled to launch in partnership with one of its leading skincare brands in the year 2021. ""We know that customization relies on information about your unique skin and personal preferences as well as your environment; this technology accounts for that,"" said Guive Balooch, Head of L’Oréal’s Technology Incubator, in a statement. ""Perso uses AI to optimize the formulas and actually gets smarter as you use it."" The new device is the latest in a string of solutions created by L’Oréal in recent years with a view to personalizing the beauty space - last year, the company unveiled Color&Co, a personalized hair coloring experience allowing users to achieve the look they want from home, while its Garnier label launched a ‘Virtual Shade Selector’ hair color tool capable of recommending different shades to consumers in just one minute."
Thin skin: Kao unveils ultra-fine spray-on facemask,"After applying an absorbent lotion, users spray the fibres onto their face and a thin translucent sheet is quickly formed, acting as a ""greenhouse"" for the real skin below to soak up the moisture and still be able to breathe. The ""second skin"" can be worn overnight or peeled off after about a minute. ""This is the world’s first cosmetic product using such technology,"" according to Masayuki Uchiyama, skincare researcher at Kao. Developed in partnership with Panasonic, the hand-held diffuser was 10 years in the making, said Uchiyama, who admitted: ""We struggled to make the device small."" Kao researchers did not initially think of using the technology of ultra-thin fibres to create a layer on the skin, he said, adding that the precise material from which they were made was a secret. “But we learned that the skin can still breathe under the thin fibres for many hours” in an environment akin to a greenhouse. Such cutting-edge tech does not come cheap though, with each diffuser costing 50,000 yen (US$460). Nevertheless, Kao predicts cosmetic sales could reach 100 billion yen if the technology is applied to the medical field. In the future, Uchiyama said it could be used to cover scars or to create an invisible medical patch. Similar technologies already exist, including those using cells or polymer, but Uchiyama said Kao’s technology is different. ""Ours is focused on fibres. They’re more flexible and hard to break even if you move."""
Formula One makes a move on the fragrance industry with innovative 3D-printed bottles,"The racing giant is launching its new five-piece scent collection globally in April 2020, it has announced. But to whet fans’ appetites, it has unveiled three limited-edition, 3D-printed artworks designed by Ross Lovegrove. A total of 100 of the pieces, with the collection of five interchangeable fragrances, was made available to purchase at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on December 1, priced at up to USD 10,000. If we still know little about the fragrances that will be launched in 2020, Designer Parfums - whose portfolio includes brands such as Jennifer Lopez, Naomi Campbell, Ariana Grande, Ghost, Aigner Fragrances, Porsche Design, Scherrer, Cerutti 1881, Playboy - announced a haute parfumerie positioning with a retail price of USD 250 for the premium collection. As for the preview limited edition, the final version should offer glass bottles housed in a resin-based 3D printed exoskeleton. Also, if the name of the five fragrances that will be eventually proposed has not been disclosed yet, nor the ingredients they will contain, we know however that renowned perfumers including Aliénor Massenet and Emilie Coppermann, participated in the creation. ""We are leveraging the sport’s heritage and principles to build a unique fragrance brand that merges a highly legitimate approach to the perfume world with the core values of Formula 1,"" said Dilesh Mehta, Designer Parfums Chairman and CEO in a statement. ""Being the first fragrance brand to utilize 3D printing is a huge achievement, and we look forward to pushing this even further in future years when we will offer consumers the ability to create their own customized designs."""
Forget about their familiar features: Aptar modernizes perfume sprays,"After five years of research and development, Dolce, the new dispensing solution by Aptar, offers an exclusive approach to perfuming gestures. Slower, longer, more silent and wrapping, the Dolce spray has nothing to do with the experience of a standard pump. Aptar had it tested by a panel of consumers: two thirds of them declared they preferred it, and it was found it plays a role in their buying decision, even if it is a bit more expensive. This technological innovation is mainly based on its push button and on a new generation sprinkler composed of a multitude of micro-holes, contrary to standard sprays, which are fitted with only one output part. It is compatible with all Aptar screw or crimp pump ranges. The balance of pressure between the different openings has an impact on the spray duration, which is estimated ten times longer than a standard spray. This way, users can choose both more or less continuous spray duration and the quantity of perfume delivered, depending on the moment of the day: the dose ranges from 70 to 140 microlitres. The panel of testers described the sensation provided by the very fine droplets as a gentle perfumed veil on the skin. From an olfactory standpoint, “the different facets of the perfume are highlighted thanks to micronization, which creates a unique perception of appreciation over time,” said perfumer-creator Antoine Lie at the product presentation. The serial production of Dolce by Aptar will start at the end of the first quarter 2020 in Normandy, France."
The Fragrance Innovation Summit attracts numbers around the future of perfumes ,"Sabine Chabbert, representing the Fragrance Foundation France, an early partner of the event, inaugurated this day structured around 15-minute-long, speed talking presentations. Mathilde Lion, Global Client Development Director of the NPD Group, set the stage with a statistical assessment of selective perfumery around the world. Although perfume still dominates the prestige category, sales tend to remain stable on mature markets. However, she did mention a few growth drivers, in particular travel shoppers, who increasingly buy perfumes in duty free areas and on local markets, e-commerce, which still has a huge growth potential in this category, and naturalness expectations, mainly expressed by young generations. Vincent Gallon, chief editor of Premium Beauty News, took the public on a world tour of the most astonishing perfume innovations in terms of positioning, gestures, or formulations, and put an emphasis on the 2019 trends: sustainable development, customization, reinvented uses, and new experience-oriented concepts. Highly technological, highly data-oriented: a new way to approach creation Claire Viola, Vice President Digital Strategy Fragrance of Symrise, and Muriel Jacquot, founder of Myrissi, gave a presentation about how to integrate the Big Data and Artificial Intelligence to the creation process. “To us, AI can be considered the next perfume revolution,” said Claire Viola. Using the Philyra tool developed in collaboration with IBM, two fragrances were designed for Brazilian brand O Boticario based on formulas with proportions and combinations never tested before in the perfume sector. As for the Myrissi tool, thanks to AI, it helps anticipate the intuitive interpretation of a fragrance in order to optimize its emotional impact. Highly natural, highly ethical, highly authentic: towards committed perfume? However, creation should also adapt to major societal changes. Pascale Brousse, founder of Trendsourcing, deciphered consumer expectations as regards “clean perfumery” – a trend highlighted by Camille Lefeuvre, founder of pH Fragrance. Natural creation might well represent tomorrow’s biggest challenge. Perfumer-creator Irène Farmachidi, of French company Technicoflor, an expert in this field for over 12 years, detailed what creative work consists in when it comes to integrating the constraints of a palette with fewer natural raw materials. Still, the natural, ethical palette can be further enriched, confirmed Behave founder Stéphane Piquart, a perfumer sourcing specialist who has adopted an ecoresponsible and fair approach. He explained his strategy by highlighting the work he has done on three flagship raw materials: sandalwood, myrrh, and ylang-ylang. Then, Marie-Gabrielle Jouan, founder of the BGene laboratory, put an emphasis on the role played by biotechnologies in the production of aromas and molecules based on wood by-products. Convinced that storyproving is gradually replacing storytelling, Sandrine Sommer, Sustainable Development Director of Guerlain, gave an overview of the various actions implemented by the Bee brand in this field, in particular the new traceability platform called Bee Respect. Accessible online, the website provides all types of information, including the origins of the components contained in every single Guerlain product: skincare, makeup, and soon, perfumes. After a whole morning of discussions, Marc Giget, President of the EICSI and of the Paris Club of Innovation Directors, reminded everyone of the need to put innovation back at the core of societal and human expectations. His speech was substantiated with the experience shared by Chantal Roos, guest of honour of the event for her exceptional career in the perfume industry, in particular as the President of Maisons YSL Parfums and BPI, and as the creator of niche brand Roos & Roos. Vanessa Cots, of digital communication agency Dix Sept Paris, focused on the need for luxury brands to approach social media from a different angle, i.e. by getting rid of existing static strategies and banking on quality through richer, more original, even committed communication… Echoing her presentation, Michelle Algazi, Insight Crafter at Dynvibe, warned the audience about an emerging, powerful feeling of overconsumption and weariness towards cosmetics, perfumes included, among young consumers. For his part, Carl Allain talked about how Arcade Beauty offers to test a perfume via Instagram. After an overview of the most striking innovations showcased at Luxe Pack – this year, most of them were environmentally friendly initiatives – leading luxury glass and plastic packaging players, Aptar, Albéa, Pochet, Bormioli Luigi, and Verescence, gathered around the table to detail some of their answers to the environmental challenge they are facing. Perfume can be considered from multiple standpoints. For example, it can meet rising wellness expectations: Greentech’s Scientific Director Edith Filaire explained how her company developed a protocol for analyzing the emotions induced by cosmetic products. And then, why not play with the borders between the different markets, creating multisensory experiences mixing taste and smell? Independent perfumer-creator Cécile Zarokian presented the work she did for various spirits brands to convey the evocation of a gin or old rum in a fragrance, or even create an edible perfume – which all participants tested with great curiosity. Without opposing physical stores and e-commerce, Joël Palix, President of Palix Unlimited, reminded the audience of the increasing influence of online stores to which retail needs to adapt. “Stores need to be reinvented through a new role distribution; they should play on new closeness levers or new practices, like refillable solutions,"" he said. TopNotes founder Nathalie Pichard focused on a well-known tricky challenge, that of training physical store teams in order to stand out, while Nicolas Dewitte, General Manager of the Bogart Group, given his experience as both a perfumer manufacturer and retailer, explained how useful it would be to transpose values between the two activities. “We need to bring olfaction back to the heart of our stores,” he recommended. Given the interest in its dynamic formula and the scope of the themes discussed, a 4th edition of the Fragrance Innovation Summit will be held in November 2020 in a bigger venue, in Paris."
Pujolasos launches 100% natural and compostable cap for fragrance bottles,"“We have placed sustainability at the core of our company’s strategy. One of our goal was to achieve a sustainable cap made with natural materials that could be thrown away to the organic waste. A fully compostable cap that could thus be easily returned to nature,” told Angel Pujolasos, CEO of the company, to Premium Beauty News. It’s all done with the new Woork cap! “The first 100% organic and compostable cap of the market,” claims Pujolasos Packaging. The patented innovation features a wooden external part and a cork insert that insures the junction between the cap and the perfume’s pump. With wood and cork being completely natural and renewable materials, the company thinks the innovation responds perfectly to the current needs and demands of the market. “We had to cope with several technical challenges, such as finding out how to remove the plastic without altering the cap functionality or how to remove the glue while ensuring the grip between the cork and the wood,” explained Angel Pujolasos. “Once we overcame the technical difficulties, another big challenge was how to make large quantities a very competitive price,” he added. With no other material than wood and cork, when the product’s end of life has arrived, the cap can be disposed in the organic waste. “A huge contribution to improve the sustainability of perfumes packaging,” according Pujolasos Packaging. The cap can be customized to adapt to specific projects, and several PEFC or FSC certified wood options are available, including beech and oak. “The concept that we have launched is designed to work with pumps, it is therefore mostly aimed at the fragrance industry, although we are working on similar packaging solutions to fit the needs of cosmetic brands,” concludes Angel Pujolasos. Reducing the environmental impact of packaging has become a key issue in the cosmetics and fragrances industry, as the latest edition of the Luxe Pack Monaco tarde fair has shown. And perfumes are no exception to this global trend, as packaging is getting greener from all standpoints, including glass, pumps and caps. Most recently, Quadpack also responded to the winds of change in the beauty packaging industry with Eco-warrior, a new concept with a minimum number of components where the 100% cork cap can be both composted and recycled."
Will paper bottles soon be available for cosmetic products?,"Driven by Paboco, a joint venture between BillerudKorsnäs and Alpla, the project is designed to create and industrially produce 100% recyclable bottles made of wood cellulose with a bio-material based barrier capable of resisting liquids, CO2 and oxygen, and suitable for liquid goods such as carbonated and still drinks, beauty products and more. To date, the high barrier properties (the ability to withstand gas permeability) required for the bottle are provided by a thin layer of PEF (polyethylene furanoate) by Dutch company Avantium. PEF is a 100% plant-based and recyclable polymer. Thus, it is possible to fully recycle the Paper Bottle by separating the paper and PEF. Building on years of experience, the development journey towards a sustainable paper bottle first met with success in 2015 when Danish company ecoXpac presented a first paper bottle for beer, in collaboration with Carlsberg Group and BillerudKorsnäs. To explore further development and commercial opportunities of such paper bottles and bring sustainable progress to the bottling industry, Paboco wants to bring together leading experts in material, design and technology, and world-leading consumer brands. “It is all about the team! We are collaborating across the value chain, sharing the risks and are united in our vision that the Paper Bottle will become a reality and fundamentally change this industry for good”, says Mrs. Gittan Schiöld, interim CEO of Paboco. Each of the brands pioneering the Paper Bottle project will develop and design their own paper bottle to meet the needs of their category."
"Eponyma, the first safe customized skincare concept in industrial production","Usually formulated in stores or at home, most customized skincare products escape critical focal points related to hygiene, traceability, formula homogeneity, and dosing compliance. “Given how significant the safety issue is for consumers, we decided to create a new business model, a new industrial system that could ensure the safety of customized cosmetics. This system can automatically manufacture products individually, in compliance with the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) in force in the cosmetics industry,” explains Florent Pascal, co-founder and CEO of OTO-Systems. On the Eponyma website, consumers create their own profile to determine the extrinsic and intrinsic factors that can have an impact on their skins. Depending on this profile, a transposition algorithm defines a tailor-made active complex out of over 15,000 possible combinations. Consumers can also choose a texture - rich or light cream, serum… - and the colour of the formula. Plus, they can personalize the packaging with their names. The order is sent to the machine in real time, so the product can be manufactured immediately. Then, it is shipped within 48h. Every product is unique and bears its own formula and batch number to ensure traceability. “We keep a sample of every single product we make to ensure perfect traceability and make it possible to perform a posteriori tests, if need be,” explains Florent Pascal. Since every formula is unique, by definition, to avoid any cross-contamination between the different products, the system is automatically cleaned and sterilized as soon as a product has been manufactured. The concept covers most issues related to consumers aged 20 to 80 – hydration, anti-ageing, radiance, UV protection… – in a way that is adapted to every person and their own environment. The multifunctional product is available for EUR 76 to EUR 99, depending on its composition, in a 50ml airless glass bottle. “The first feedback we got from our consumers is excellent. They like the fact that they use only one product meeting all their personal needs,” rejoices Florent Pascal. The startup has launched a fundraising campaign and now aims to set up a first workshop in France, diversify their offering to other segments than face care, and gain visibility on the French market."
Fragrance Innovation Summit: a day dedicated to major perfume transformations,"About thirty speakers, perfumers, communicators, packaging players, startups, retailers, trainers, analysts, consultants, and others will take turns the whole day to screen the major avenues of investigation offered to brands. Both in Europe and around the world, today, the challenge for the perfume industry lies in seducing, but also surprising specific, less dynamic categories. Mathilde Lion, of NPD Group, will present a world tour to make an update of the industry, talk about prospects, and highlight the most innovative launches. Then, other conferences will discuss the means of intervention offered by new technologies during the various phases in the life of a perfume. Consumer expectations related to good practices, Guerlain’s transparency commitment, the introduction of a new virtuous brand, biotechnologies, the all-natural challenge, ingredient sustainability… many aspects will be described throughout the summit, showing how the perfume industry reinvents itself for more naturalness, similarly to the transformation made on the cosmetics segment. Thanks to endless practical solutions, industrial partners show how committed they are to meeting new challenges related to the circular economy, digitalization, or time-to-market. They will detail their strategies in these different areas. The customer experience, the last consumer approach phase for brands, represents a major challenge driven by communication, the social media, the in-store experience, and cross-channel marketing. Experiences and recommendations will be shared for everyone to take stock of the possibilities available mixing the human and digital aspects.

L’Oréal and Albéa create paper-based cosmetic tube,"""Since 2007 we have been constantly improving the environmental footprint of our packaging,"" said Philippe Thuvien, Vice-President Packaging & Development of L’Oréal, in a statement. ""Today we are going one step further and launching this new technology based on certified paper. By working upstream and closely with Albéa to co-develop this breakthrough innovation, we aim to create a new paper-based tube packaging for our cosmetic packaging.” L’Oréal targets a first market launch for skin care products packaged into the new tube in the second half of 2020. La Roche-Posay should be the first L’Oréal brand to test this paper-based tube for its creams for the face and body. “L’Oréal is committed to improving the environmental or social profile of 100% of its packaging by end 2020. This innovative, alternative solution is an integral part of the Group’s packaging strategy,"" adds Philippe Thuvien. L’Oréal has taken multiple steps towards improving its environmental credentials recently, including taking a minority stake in Carbios, a start-up that focuses on finding bio-industrial solutions to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textile polymers, earlier this year. The group is also a signatory of the Ellen McArthur Foundation’s ‘New Plastics Economy Global Commitment.’ « Our ambition today is to accelerate the development of innovative, responsible solutions, to dare break the codes, to aim for breakthroughs. It is only through collaboration with our customers and partners that we can invent the safe, circular, minimum-impact packaging that the beauty market wants, » said Gilles Swyngedauw, Vice-President CSR, Innovation & Marketing of Albéa. The replacement of plastics by more sustainable alternatives has been a key issue during the 2019 edition of Luxe Pack Monaco and another model of paperboard-based tube for cosmetic products was also presented by the Finnish cardboard producer Stora Enso. The body of the tube is made from a barrier-coated, grease-resistant paperboard by Stora Enso, which makes it suitable for the primary packaging of skin creams. Currently, according to Stora Enso, making the body of the tube from paperboard reduces the use of plastic by 70% compared with a plastic tube. Sustainable packaging has become a major focal point within the beauty industry recently. Back in April, the personal care conglomerate Unilever unveiled a three-part plan to tackle plastic use in the US, while January saw Procter & Gamble partnered with several major companies to co-found the ‘Alliance to End Plastic Waste,’ a non-profit organization designed to tackle plastic waste levels in the ocean."
Asquan partners with Pylote to provide fully hygienic makeup and mascara brushes to cosmetic brands,"“Our strategy here at Asquan Group is to develop fully effective, holistic innovation based on delivering a robust benefit to the end user. By partnering with recognised experts in their field, we can guarantee our clients cutting edge and proven technology on a fast to market time scale,” said Henri Tinchant, President of Asquan. The manufacturer of accessories, applicators and packaging solutions for cosmetics brands, therefore contacted Pylote, a young company headquartered in Toulouse, South of France, specializing in the chemistry of minerals and ceramics. The start-up company has developed a patented technology to prevent the contamination of applicators during their use. The tools therefore remain clean without promoting microbial growth. ""Our goal was to guarantee the hygiene of our applicators. Pylote has developed a unique technology, with a spectrum of activity much wider than any existing solution. Indeed, it protects not only from bacterial contamination but also from viruses,"" highlights Henri Tinchant. Giving makeup brushes and beauty accessories an unprecedented level of safety and hygiene as yet, unseen in the market, the Pylote technology automatically extends the shelf life of the product. Moreover, brushes and other tools would not require typical drastic disinfecting during their entire period of use, which brings tremendous benefit and peace of mind to the consumer while reducing the ecological footprint. To give entire legitimacy to this breakthrough innovation, Pylote has conducted a complete industrial evaluation and qualification of the benefits of prototype “Pylote Added” makeup accessories. “The results of these tests showed that the technology maintains a high level of microbiological hygiene in worst conditions against even the most virulent antibiotic resistant bacteria and viruses such as those responsible for herpes or for conjunctivitis, therefore guaranteeing a safer use of cosmetic accessories and applicators. It is also extremely effective at eliminating the risk of contamination between uses as well as cross contamination between consumers,” said Loïc Marchin, CEO of Pylote. In partnership with Pylote, Asquan has made the prototypes that have been tested and are ready to be marketed. ""We have validated the entire industrial process and the efficiency of the technology for brush and mascaras fibres. We are ready to produce on the basis of tested materials,"" added Henri Tinchant. If the client chooses other materials, qualification process can be quickly carried out. But the technology has the advantage of not changing the existing manufacturing process the industrial process and has no impact on minimum order quantities. Based on the action of mineral particles, without any migration into formulas, Pylote’s technology is in compliance with the FDA, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, food, international regulations and COSMOS approved. Obtained by in-house clean manufacturing process, mineral ceramic microspheres are directly integrated into the fibres of makeup and mascara brushes, offering “a safe and effective way to address growing concerns regarding the risk of microbial contamination and the consumer demand for hygienic, healthy, safe and environmental friendly products.” The two companies will present the new makeup brushes and mascara applicators to the cosmetics and beauty industry on their booth at the MakeUp in NewYork show next week. Stéphane Thiollier, Managing Director Business, Pylote and Henri Tinchant, President, Asquan will also detail the innovation through a presentation on September 11th (12-45pm - 1:20pm)."
Israeli farmer remixes ancient scents near Dead Sea,"With a passion for ancient plants, Guy Erlich set out in 2008 to try to grow them himself to turn into fragrances and other products, on a small hill in the West Bank, near the Israeli settlement of Almog, in occupied Palestinian territory. He now cultivates around 60 biblical plants, from which he creates creams, perfumes, soap and honey, and attracts tourists who come to learn about the rare plants and take in their scents. Erlich, 48, dreams of bringing back into widespread circulation the balm of Gilead, used medicinally during the ancient Roman era and referenced in the Bible. He’s even named his farm after it. The balm is thought to have been used by the ancient Greek physician, Galen, to heal infections and wounds, he says. He mentions Jewish teachings from the Talmud and Christian sources that name it. A farmer before making a job out of his fascination for biblical agriculture - some of which has long disappeared - Erlich says he has read everything he can find on the subject. Elaine Solowey, a desert agriculture specialist at Israel’s Arava Institute for Environmental Studies, helped him to identify some of his plants. Speaking to AFP, she said that she could not say for sure if Erlich’s plants were those found in biblical times since more research was necessary. ""The species produced by Mr Erlich are probably those cultivated in the region during antiquity, but we can’t be certain,"" Solowey said.  ""Many plant species mentioned in the Bible have disappeared and it is vital that we figure out how to study the subject,"" she said, adding that more funding was needed. Erlich makes honey with the flowers of Boswellia trees that yield frankincense — one of the offerings to the baby Jesus in the Bible’s New Testament. The trees grow in places like Somalia, Yemen, Ethiopia and Oman but Erlich has planted them at his Balm of Gilead Farm. For now, the small leafed species takes up only a limited part of his farm, but the honey he produces sells at a premium price: $1,000 (900 euros) per kilogram. The farm is currently quite spartan and he hopes in time to be able to develop his tourist centre, a simple, wooden structure that shields visitors from the sun next to his fields. Wearing boots and a large hat, he explains to visitors the story behind each plant and its name. Erlich is seeking to attract investors but says it is difficult since his farm is in occupied territory. For Palestinians, his work has more than a whiff of controversy, given the location of the farm. Abdallah Abu Rahma, a Palestinian Authority official who monitors Israeli settlements, was unequivocal when asked about the project. ""Everything produced in the settlements is illegal,"" he said. ""That’s why we call for a boycott of such products."" Settlement expansion has accelerated under Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a policy that detractors say reduces the chances of a two-state solution to the Jewish nation’s conflict with the Palestinians. But Erlich is undeterred. Noting the ancient Egyptians’ use of fragrances and the possibility that several of the plants he grows were used at that time, he advertises his perfume as a type used by Cleopatra. ""Offer your wife Cleopatra’s perfume, the fragrances of antiquity, the scents of Rome,"" he tells visitors. Erlich also claims to have re-created fragrances used at the time of the two biblical-era Jewish temples, the first destroyed by the Babylonians in 587 BC and the second by the Romans in 70 AD. ""On your right hand, you have the scent of the first temple, on the left hand the second temple, and if you rub them against each other, you will smell the incense that will be burned in the third temple,"" Erlich said. According to Jewish tradition, the third temple will be built when the Messiah comes. Erlich sells his products from his farm. He has so far sold four kilos (8.8 pounds) of his frankincense honey in 30-gram (one-ounce) bottles and hopes to increase production. Visitors can also buy a five-millilitre (0.2 ounce) bottle of fragrance for 100 shekels ($29, 26 euros). ""These products have a history, a specificity,"" he said. ""They are unique."""
Cosmopolitan makes fragrance debut with smoothie-inspired “Eau de Juice”,"The series, which represents Cosmopolitan’s first foray into the fragrance industry, comprises four playful perfumes  corresponding to different moods. They are ‘Extra Concentrated,’ a fruity mix of apple and champagne accord top notes with a heart of praline, ‘100% Chilled’, a cozy scent made up of red berries and bergamot as top notes and a base of cashmere woods and sandalwood, and ‘Love, Unfiltered,’ which blends top notes of red berries and mandarin with a heart of wild freesia and an amber base. ‘Pure Sugar,’ a flirty combination of wild strawberry, pink grapefruit and plum blossom notes, completes the collection. The scents, which were created in partnership with perfumers at Firmenich, come presented in juice box-inspired packaging with a lip print on the straw, in shades of gold, pink, white and blue. They launch online on August 1st at the cosmetics retailer Ulta Beauty, and will be rolled out in stores from August 5. ""It’s been said, a woman is not fully dressed without her fragrance, so for Eau de Juice we forged the unprecedented collaboration with our talented editors at Cosmopolitan to inspire a range of scents that speak to her every mood and fancy, allowing new opportunities for Cosmo girls of all ages to express their individuality,"" said Steve Ross, global chief licensing officer and head of brand development for Hearst Magazines, in a statement. ""Our vision was to create a brand narrative that is aspirational yet relatable, with a wink of humorous sensibility,"" elaborated Chief Marketing Officer of Luxe Brands, Noreen Dodge. Latest innovation in fragrances will be discussed at the next edition of the Fragrance Innovation Summit in Paris on November 7th, 2019. Program and registration: Fragrance Innovation Summit 2019"
Luxcos takes its make-up innovation to new heights,"Put forward at MakeUp in Paris, the new Nail + Lips Night Balm 2in1: ""It’s a multifunctional vegan nail care and lip care; it acts like a comfort mask for the nails, and forms a protective film on the lips at night, thus preventing them from drying out,"" explained Aurélie Ignaccolo, Product Strategy & Marketing Director at IL Cosmetics. ""It’s a no-gender, versatile, easy to use product, suiting all-ages that also adopts all the codes of clean beauty through its anti-waste side (i.e. a single pack for 2 functions). But for us, it is also an iconic product, because it draws on all our skills: those of International Lacquers for nails, and of Luxcos for make-up"". The formula won over to the jury members of the Innovation Tree at MakeUp in Paris, who selected it in the best full-service innovation category, especially for the audacity of its dual purpose and its adequacy to consumer expectations in terms of ease of use, product benefits and ethics. The strong point of Luxcos is undoubtedly mascara. ""At the Group level, it is the most important category after nail polish and as such is granted important R&D resources,"" underlined Juanita Parra, Marketing Manager, Makeup Division for IL Cosmetics. Once again, Luxcos has put the consumer at the centre of its innovation drive. ""Mascaras follow the same underlying trends as other cosmetic products: the need for more practical formulas that are easy to use and remove. Mascaras users are also looking for both eco-friendly solutions and vegan formulas, a growing trend particularly in the United States and Europe,"" highlighted Juanita Parra. To meet these new expectations, Luxcos has been working on ways of replacing beeswax, an animal-based, key ingredient in many mascara formulas. The challenge being to preserve the make-up performance of the formula using carefully selected vegetable waxes. ""We are able to offer vegan alternatives whatever the texture: cream, waterproof, easy-removal or lash-care while guaranteeing make-up results."" Among the 100% vegan favourites showcased at MakeUp in Paris: – Naughty me - a mascara made from vegetable rice waxes enriched with jojoba oil, sweet almond oil and vitamin E - which offers a buildable volume effect.
– The new Life-Proof technology: an anti-smudge formula that can withstand all sorts of challenges: sports, sweat, rain, tears; the formula dissolves easily with warm water and takes the form of small tubes when removed from lashes. ""Consumers today have become much more demanding and are looking for mascaras suiting their lifestyles and therefore expect brands to propose them products with all the pros and no cons,"" added Juanita Parra. On the clean beauty side, Luxcos is working on formulas with a high concentration of natural ingredients, which will be presented in the second half of 2019 with on top of it, a recycled packaging. Luxcos benefits from the expertise of the IL Cosmetics Group when it comes to studies and consumer panels. ""For mascaras, volume still stands as the most expected and desired parameter and each consumer has a definition of its own. Tastes vary from one market to the other and from one profile to the other. One of the challenges for formulators is to design samples which are representative of this diversity,"" observed Aurélie Ignaccolo. Driven by performances, Inspired by You, also seems to be the path of the winning strategy to follow for Luxcos, by only offering technologies in line with consumer expectations."

"“Make-up is turning green and increasingly efficient,” Luisa Oliva","Premium Beauty News - How the colour cosmetics category is transforming itself? Luisa Oliva - We can see that natural is a key concept in make-up formulations today. As seen at the in-cosmetics Global tradeshow, which was held in Paris last in April, a more sustainable approach is being developed all throughout the ingredients portfolios. Companies are moving into natural products with a focus on efficiency. The innovations allow for extreme results and high performances of the finish product. Premium Beauty News - As far as ingredients are concerned, what were the main innovations showcased at in-cosmetics Global? Luisa Oliva - Some ingredients improve make-up formulations and other make them more sustainable, such as Seppic’s Hydralixir.  The company has extracted cellular water from a collection of algae collected in Brittany, France. The algae are already engaged in an existing industrial exploitation, their water is extracted using a gentle drying and energy-saving technology. This clean water allows to lower the carbon footprint in cosmetics. Stéarinerie Dubois has developed esters that offer a natural alternative to non-volatile silicones (DUB OE HP for D5 et DUB So Green for Dimethicone) under the INCIs: ethyl oleate and ethyl olivate. They offer good spreading and boost formula emolience and also boost hydration with a silicon like feel on the skin. Myoshi Europe has developed a film forming agent from plant origin.

Intercos has also developed a patented lip stick with a 3D effect surface featuring several geometrical effects with a creamy texture. The technology offers an infinite range of possible shapes. As far as lipsticks are concerned, Weckerle has also developed a new technology allowing the insertion of 3D effect inside the lipstick within three different layers. It means you can have up to five different colours or textures in a single lipstick. The lipstick has two concentric layers on the outside and three layers on the inside. The 3D effect appears inside the lipstick while using it. A new jumbo stick for the eyes with metallic effect was also developed by Weckerle. It offers a long lasting and intense effect in a very cream and light formula. Beukay showed a peel-off eyeliner with a nacre topcoat. While the eyeliner has dried, the nacre top-coat can be applied, with more or less intensity depending on the application. IL Cosmetics launched two innovations for make-up removers. A lip-tint remover that helps removing all traces of colour. Indeed, tinting products have a long-lasting and dry effect that can prove hard to remove. The remover which comes with a lip-applicator helps gently dissolve any colour on the lips. The Luxembourg-based company has also launched a waterproof-mascara-remover. It is applied on the lashes with a specific brush and is easily removed with a cotton pad. It gently cares for the eyes while removing sticky formulas. Premium Beauty News - Ethical beauty is also a rising trend, isn’t it? Luisa Oliva - Yes, in particular when we speak about clean, natural and vegan beauty. Pascual Cosmétiques, for instance, has developed a lipstick only featuring so-called “clean ingredients”. It has a smooth texture and easy application and offers great sensorial characteristics. The formula is claimed to be free from silicones and without ingredients derived from petroleum. Ancorotti has launched a lip marker (actually a long-lasting lipstick) with an intense colour in a vegan formula. Faber Castell has launched Pure and Pure2 Beauty its own clean cosmetics seals which guarantee that the textures are formulated without identified controversial ingredients PLUS vegan and natural, and free from D5, silicones, Fragrance, etc. The range of 12 different colour cosmetic pencils, with high performance and rich pigments, is designed for the eyes and the lips."

BODY’minute extends its clean beauty offer with the launch of BABY’minute,"After taking care of the “mums” for now more than two decades, BODY’minute goes further with the development of a range for the next generations: BABY’minute. With this new line, the brand continues its willingness to offer to its clientele a 100% “clean beauty” offer as it has been reformulating entirely - since the second semester 2018 - its skin care range, SKIN’minute, with 0% paraben, phenoxyethanol and filter.

Alkos launches bio-based cellulose-made pencils,"The latest edition of the Cosmopack tradeshow, which was held in Bologna, Italy, on 14-17 March 2019, was strongly shaped by the green revolution which has taken the cosmetics industry by storm over the last few months. In this context, the Alkos Group presented a brand new technological innovation consisting of cellulose pencils made from recycled paper fibres.  “An ecological alternative to plastic of course but also to wood, a natural resource to protect,” explains Alkos. According to the French manufacturer, these pencils made of up to 95% bio-based materials can be sharpened as easily as wood or plastic pencils while being compostable and recyclable. For optimal durability, they can be combined with a biobased or recycled plastic cap. In terms of formulation the main advantage is that these cellulose-made pencils can be filled with either 100% natural formulas or long-lasting waterproof formulas requiring an airtight container. Concretely, Alkos proposes three typologies of different formulas for these pencils: – Natural Beauty, natural and/or organic formulas (Cosmos Organic certification),
– Natural Smooth Intensity, natural formulas with intense pay off,
– Mad Matte, long lasting waterproof formulas. All these formulas are available for the eyes, eyebrows and lips. As far as customization is concerned, two shades of cellulose tubes are available, black or raw. All the possibilities of decoration of the outside of the pencil are available and the cap can also be customized on demand. “It’s a true innovative solution for a sustainable and ecological recycling,” highlights Laura Mariani, Marketing Manager of the Alkos Group."
"With ModiFace, L’Oréal wants to bring digital tools into daily beauty routines","L’Oréal is not the first beauty company to launch a skin diagnostic tool, but with Vichy SkinConsultAI, the new application deployed by the French giant’s dermo-cosmetic brand, no need for dedicated electronic sensors: a mere selfie is enough! And it is well known that where new digital tools are concerned, simplicity, ease of deployment and wide access are key factors of success. Designed for Asian, Caucasian and Afro-American users, the new diagnostic tool is capable of predicting and addressing visual aging signs. The tool functions via a three-step process that involves users provide a selfie before the technology detects aging signs such as under-eye wrinkles, lack of firmness, fine lines, lack of radiance, dark spots, deep wrinkles and pores. These signs are then analysed, before users are given a tailored suggested skincare routine. The development is based on 15 years of L’Oréal scientific research regarding skin aging. It uses a series of ‘skin aging atlases’ and an AI-powered algorithm developed by ModiFace, as well as a photo database of 6000 clinical images. The skin diagnostic is behind the ‘Vichy SkinConsultAI’ that launched in Canada in January and is scheduled to be rolled out on the brand’s websites globally later this year. ""For the first time, this technology allows all women to obtain a personal diagnostic to better understand their skin aging and to find a skincare routine tailor-made for them,"" said Myriam Bekkar-Schneider, Vichy General Manager. Earlier this month, L’Oréal and ModiFace also unveiled a ‘Virtual Shade Selector’ tool that uses personalized technology to recommend different shades to consumers in just one minute and can be used both in-store or online, via smartphone or computer. The launch follows the announcement of a similar tool for L’Oréal Professionel in January. In both cases, the results are calculated by taking into account each user’s current hair colour, level of grey, and desired finished look. The tool is being piloted by Walmart at ten US locations this month, before coming to select Wakefern and Meijer stores in March and heading to ten Walgreens stores in June. Since acquiring ModiFace last year, L’Oréal has also harnessed the technology to test out virtual makeup application via Facebook, offering users the chance to ‘try out’ cosmetics from some of its best-known brands, including Maybelline, L’Oréal Paris, NYX Professional Makeup, Lancôme, Giorgio Armani, Yves Saint Laurent, Urban Decay, and Shu Uemura. “With the acquisition of ModiFace, we have started a second phase of L’Oréal’s digital transformation, focused on reinventing the beauty experience through technologies such as voice, AR and AI,"" said Lubomira Rochet, Chief Digital Officer of L’Oréal. ""We believe that services will be the new gateways for discovering our brands and products."" However, L’Oréal is far from being the only beauty company manipulating AR and AI technologies to improve the consumer’s experience. In January, the Coty-owned brand Wella Professionals unveiled a new AR-enabled ‘Smart Mirror’ at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2019, which allows users to virtually test out different hair colours with live results, incorporating Perfect Corp’s AR and AI technologies. Clairol has also been getting in on the act, launching a Google Assistant tool for Google Home last year that is designed to guide consumers through the at-home colouring process."
Beauty Tech: The latest innovations from CES 2019,"Smart mirrors made a big impression at this show. CareOS, a Baracoda Group Company, announced at Las Vegas the launch of Artemis, a smart mirror integrated with the patent-pending CareOS platform that connects health, beauty and wellness for a holistic view of each user. More than 50 IoT [1] devices, products and services are integrated into the CareOS platform including major brands such as Coty’s Wella Professionals, Group SEB, Legrand, Roca, and IoT leaders like Snips and Terraillon. Also at CES, CareOS and Coty have unveiled the Wella Professionals augmented reality enabled smart mirror, which is powered by Artemis for a revolutionary salon hair colour experience. Powered by the existing CareOS operating system and incorporating Perfect Corp’s YouCamMakeup augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, Wella’s new mirror uses facial recognition technology to retrieve archived looks, and features a 360° video element to let clients view their hair from all angles. Furthermore, the smart mirror lets clients and stylists keep in touch via a connected app in between visits. AR has had an enormous impact on the beauty industry over the past few years, with multiple brands such as ModiFace and YouCam driving the increase in connected solutions and devices. Last November saw Modiface unveil a ‘Virtual Nail Salon’ app that lets users virtually test out 30 different nail polish shades, while YouCam and Eylure teamed up earlier in the year to test out an augmented reality (AR) makeup experience focusing on false eyelashes. At the CES 2019, Perfect Corp, the developer of the YouCam MakeUp app, has unveiled a ""Beauty 3.0"" vision that will allow users to personalize their platforms in real time using artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality (AR) technologies. The update will mean users could soon use the app to get recommended foundation shades that match their skin tones perfectly, for example, or track dermatological concerns over time. Other options include complex live virtual makeup trials (such as ombré hair color makeovers) and on-demand beauty consultations with professionals. Cosmetic giants also went big on connected beauty at the show. For its first participation, Procter & Gamble introduced multiple new connected devices from several of its brands, including an artificial intelligence Skin Advisor platform for Olay. For its part, L’Oréal has unveiled My Skin Track pH for its brand La Roche-Posay. The sensor offers users a personalized measure of their skin pH levels, which can, in some cases, be responsible for conditions such as eczema, dryness or atopic dermatitis. The wearable works by using microfluidic technology to capture trace amounts of sweat from the pores on a patch of skin on the inner arm. Betting on personalisation, Neutrogena has launched the MaskiD app allowing users to get fully customized 3D-printed face masks, by giving them an accurate assessment of their skincare needs and facial measurements via the TrueDepth camera on the iPhone X, XS, and XR. This year again, French start-ups were well represented at CES with many innovations in the beauty sector. Artiris unveiled Compoz, a composer of bespoke home fragrances. The device can charge up to five interchangeable scented capsules and is controlled from a touch screen. Already showcased in Paris at VivaTech, BeautyMix builds on the DIY trend and offers a small mixer and accessories to make natural cosmetics at home. Litica Labs, a wholly-owned subsidiary of France-based Officinea laboratory, has created Beautylitic, an app allowing retailers to analyse the composition of all their entire personal care portfolio. The system is inspired by the beauty apps developed for consumers. The algorithms propose an analysis of the current referencing and suggest improvements taking into account the new expectations of the consumers."
SK-II brings futuristic ’phygital’ beauty store to CES,"P&G’s prestige beauty brand has showcased its ‘Future X Smart Store’ at the Las Vegas show, which opened its doors on 08-11 January.  The retail concept was initially launched in Tokyo, Shanghai and Singapore last year. The store concept relies on ‘phygital’ retail experiences that incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to take shoppers on a digital in-store journey, beginning with a reading of their facial expressions and movements at a large-scale digital wall called ‘The Art of You.’ The wall generates different energy lines and colours with every facial movement or twitch, creating a unique artistic image for each user. Next up is a revamped version of the brand’s signature ‘Magic Ring’ skin analysis, which, unlike regular facial analysis, is carried out digitally and remotely by an interactive screen that scans the face and displays the results. A ‘Smart Beauty Bar’ offers advice and personalized product browsing, while a projection mapping table that tracks hand motions allows shoppers to add goods to their digital carts with a wave. ""Emerging technologies such as AI and facial recognition allow us to challenge existing retail norms and share our brand experience in the way that is the most meaningful to our consumer,"" said Sandeep Seth, Vice President, Global SK-II. ""She can experience our products and learn about her skin at her own pace without being watched, judged or pressured. Our journey with the Future X Smart Store is not about replacing humans with tech, but supplementing to create a better and more meaningful shopping experience for our consumers."" SK-II is one of multiple beauty brands focusing on incorporating innovative technologies into the in-store retail experience. Makeup brand Covergirl’s new flagship store in New York, which opened in November, is one such example: the boutique features a ‘virtual greeter’ powered by artificial intelligence, who directs shoppers to their favourite products, as well as an ‘augmented reality glam station’ that lets consumers virtually try on lipstick and eyeshadow before digitally sharing the result with friends. Meanwhile, August saw the French brand L’Occitane en Provence open the doors to a New York flagship of its own, complete with an in-store ‘rain shower’ sink and an interactive skincare consultation area, aimed at producing user-generated content for social media."
Procter & Gamble goes big on connected beauty for CES 2019,"Connected beauty products are fast becoming the cosmetics and wellness industry’s hottest new trend, and Procter & Gamble is doubling down on the concept.  For its first participation in the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the personal care and lifestyle giant is presenting six innovations across its beauty, health and skincare portfolio. First up is skincare brand Olay’s new ‘Skin Advisor’ platform, which uses artificial intelligence to offer users personal skincare consultations and advice. Prestige skincare brand SK-II also has a new concept up its sleeve, in the form of the ‘Future X Smart Store’ concept, which will offer ""phygital"" experiences for in-store shoppers, via techniques such as facial recognition and digital diagnostics. Another of P&G’s major skincare launches is the ‘Opté Precision Skincare System’ — a single device featuring camera optics, proprietary algorithms and printing technology to scan the complexion and detect hyperpigmentation. It can even be used to apply exact quantities of corrective serum to the face. In the health and hygiene sector, the company is set to unveil an ‘Oral-B Genius X’ artificial intelligence toothbrush that offers personalized feedback on brushing techniques, and a GilletteLabs ‘Heated Razor’ that warms up in under a second for a more comfortable shaving experience. Eventually, P&G is rolling out a new room-freshening device called Airia.  The smart home fragrance system uses ink-jet technology and can be managed with a smartphone app. ""We’re innovating faster than ever, combining more than 180 years of capability with the entrepreneurial spirit of a lean startup,"" said P&G Chief Research, Development and Innovation Officer, Kathy Fish, in a statement. ""As consumers are changing, so are we. What remains the same is our focus on deeply understanding how consumers live, work and play so we know precisely what they want."" The Cincinnati-headquartered group is not the only corporation focusing on connected beauty for CES 2019 — earlier this week, skincare brand Neutrogena unveiled a personalized face mask app that will make its debut at the show, while L’Oréal is introducing La Roche-Posay ‘My Skin Track pH’, the first-ever wearable microfluidic sensor to measure skin pH levels, which complete the brand’s range of wearable devices."
BGene produces wood-based fragrant molecules for the perfume industry,"Initially a micro-organism specialist, the BGene company chose to turn towards wood joint products to launch a new molecule production solution. “We identify in nature itself the bacterium that can transform wood molecules into the molecule the customer expects,” sums up Marie-Gabrielle Jouan, President of BGene. The metabolism of micro-organisms or bacteria helps them assimilate carbon to multiply and/or produce. It is a fermentation process of the bacterium. “Our bacterial system shelters the enzymes that can make wood carbon accessible to it and transform it to multiply, but also to produce molecules of interest, in particular aroma and fragrance precursors,” explains the scientist. This solution is possible for a multitude of different molecules: each molecule has its own solution. Some bacteria can produce several molecules or families of molecules. This almost unique biotechnology associated with wood is aimed at meeting the naturalness expectations of players in the perfume and cosmetics industry. “Today, this naturalness is recognized due to carbon dosage. We actually do biotechnological synthesis: 100% of our carbons are natural, since they are derived from wood,” confirms Marie-Gabrielle Jouan. Above all, this disruptive sourcing innovation offsets the high cost of natural plant extraction and ensures production continuity. “In the perfume sector, you need to grow plants in fields to get an odorous molecule, but these are fields that could be used for cultivating food. Extraction itself is very polluting and little profitable. Besides, production is subject to climatic variations, so resources can fluctuate, and so can prices.” Already in touch with the main industry players seduced by this innovation, BGene, a company that counts 14 employees, 80% of whom are scientists, satisfies customer demand, but they have also been developing their own ingredient family in the field of aromas and perfumes. The 2017 fundraising campaign should help accelerate the new product launch."
Skin microbiome is set to revolutionise dermatology,"As new clinical data transpires to support the role of the skin microbiome in common conditions from acne and eczema to dandruff and skin allergies, Pharmaceutical Researchers and Cosmetic Formulators alike are turning their attention to designing and testing products that contain live bacteria, bacterial extracts or prebiotic and postbiotic ingredients to manipulate the skins microbiota.

Can Artificial Intelligence make more unique fragrances than a human nose?,"Richard Goodwin, along with his research team at IBM and global flavor and fragrance producer, Symrise, ""created an AI system that can learn about formulas, raw materials, historical success data and industry trends"" bringing perfumers intelligent machine-learning apprentices. Globally speaking, this can save master perfumers time to perfect a fragrance rather than searching for new combinations. The project was built upon previously done company research that used artificial intelligence to pair flavors and create recipes combined with the more recent Research AI for Product Composition. As a result, a new system using advanced machine learning algorithms to comb through enormous databases of formulas and materials to recognize patterns and new mixtures was conceived. This system, called Philyra, is used to, ""design entirely new fragrance formulas by exploring the entire landscape of fragrance combinations to discover the whitespaces in the global fragrance market."" Such a method can be applied to various fields of fragrance from fine fragrances, home care, and beauty care. All these categories require very specific scents based on various fragrance families (like floral, fruity, or musky), especially fine fragrances which are considered works of art. The information that the AI analyzes can then be used to develop fragrances for incredibly specific markets like, as Goodwin used as an example, for Brazilian millennials. The algorithms used by Philyra span four main categories: raw material complements and substitutes, raw material dosage, human responses, and novelty level of the composition. With each of these taken into account, Symrise’s Philyra successfully designed two perfumes for O Boticario.  The first fragrances created by an AI are expected to go on sale next year in Brazil. Before committing these fragrances to the market, however, the initial formulas... were tweaked by a master perfumer to emphasize a certain note and improve how long it lasted on the skin. “This effort brings together human expertise with machine intelligence to create novel, fine fragrances. Philyra’s understanding of consumer preferences and knowledge of formulas and ingredients, led to new fragrance combinations, which allowed our perfumers to accelerate the creative design process and focus on perfecting the final products,” said Alexandre Bouza, Marketing Director, O Boticario. “Advances in AI are helping us introduce unique, new fragrances to our customers. We are very excited to be part of this collaboration with Symrise and IBM Research.” Once perfecting the algorithms used for creating fine fragrances, Philyra can be modified to other, less luxurious, fields of fragrances like laundry detergents, shampoos, or basically any other beauty or cleaning product we use. Fragrance is integrated into basically every aspect the human experience. As Goodwin wrote, ""the art and science of designing a winning perfume is something humans have explored for hundreds of years,"" which means perfumers have hundreds of years of fragrances to sift through. With a machine by their side, perfumers can focus on the art and human experience behind a fragrance, rather than trying to find a novel composition."
"Hackathon LVMH: “We want to help new generations emerge,” Marc-Antoine Jamet","Premium Beauty News - This year’s competition was unique in that it imposed a finished product created in 3D. How did it go? Marc-Antoine Jamet - This year was more complex than expected. We had three main difficulties. The first was the theme: the idea was to deliver something concrete with a prototype, which is much more difficult than delivering an idea. As a result, the challenge also involved learning how to use prototyping tools, i.e. the software and the printer. Lastly, we had very high expectations as regards environmental protection. The award went to the team that managed to streamline the process, but generally speaking, once again, I am astonished at the work everyone did in four days: they did not know each other the day before and they teamed up to deliver really great work. Premium Beauty News - How would you sum up the 2018 Hackathon Maker? Marc Antoine Jamet - The strength of Hackathon lies in the youth it puts forward. These young people face a jury of professionals happy to work in a different context. There is this notion of knowledge transmission and preparation for the future, this will to support and create new emerging generations. Premium Beauty News - What about next year? Marc Antoine Jamet - I think we will go back to a blend of nationalities within the teams, just like we did in 2017. We could not do it this year due to the 3D software and printer training: we needed French participants. But global participation creates interesting dynamics. In 2019, I want to open the competition to creative freedom, not restrain it."
Samplicity aims to make beauty samples enter new era,"Since October 11, the samplicity.co platform offers its community cosmetic product samples for free (perfumes, face care products, makeup…). “We target a public interested in beauty and willing to test a perfume, a skincare product, a foundation… before making a quick purchase online,” explains Valérie Jacob, the start-up founder. Samplicity aims to revolutionize the world of websites specialized in product testing. Far from deceptive e-mail pumps, the platform is designed to offer customers an integral medium for them to create a communication and sampling campaign and give value to direct consumer connection in a secure environment that guarantees brand image and preserves personal data. “We know that for brands, the world in which their products are distributed is certainly not a trivial matter. The same should go for samples. So, we mainly aim to offer brands a new digital medium dedicated to beauty, where they can communicate with a community that is qualified in their worlds, tell a story about the product, add a tutorial, a video, and create a real experience when customers discover the sample, i.e. the product. We connect the sample with brands’ communication campaigns, whereas apart from press distribution, which is more massive, but anonymous, it was a bit neglected until now, due to the lack of an adequate solution,” explains Valérie Jacob. Contrary to the solution retailers usually choose, you receive the sample before you make a purchase, so it plays its “testing” role more than its “gift” role. To Valérie Jacob, the idea is to “help brands regain control of sample distribution, as samples do represent a significant cost for them, both in the development and production phases.” If all studies converge in that they highlight the major role samples play as a means to make consumers buy cosmetics, too many brands struggle to control their distribution, not to mention their use. Samplicity offers brands a comprehensive, customizable service, from digital campaign creation and management to sample shipment to the members, and from communication and SEO referencing to, of course, campaign return analyses. But above all, Samplicity is intended to help their partners better understand consumer expectations and motivations. “Samples represent a gateway, a starting point to get to know consumers even better,” emphasizes Valérie Jacob. Based on the data collected through website connections and product feedback from members, the platform’s sophisticated algorithms decipher consumers’ virtual and real-life behaviours and create a new segmentation based on emotions and motivations. One of the objectives is to go beyond generational communication, because it is too often ill-adapted to new consumption patterns. “The power of emotions is being rediscovered in all sectors. We designed Samplicity as a showcase to draw consumers’ emotional attention and make it possible for them to try beauty freely!” concludes Valérie Jacob. Samplicity aims to develop in the UK soon and will offer selected profiles beta tests of new products in the long run. Fragrance Innovation Summit Valérie Jacob will introduce Samplicity at the next Fragrance Innovation Summit next October 25 in Paris. Information and registration: www.fragranceinnovation.com "
Fragrance Innovation Summit: Paris shakes up the perfume category,"With consumers increasingly eager for new experiences, the pace of new launches keeps speeding up and new brands have emerged, supported by distributors trying to stand out. New concepts have been created and distributors themselves are starting to take control, as can be seen with the partnership between H&M and Givaudan. High perfumery needs to remain attractive, but it is increasingly compelled to surprise and penetrate unexpected territories. New ingredients, new notes, new applicators, new textures, new functions: brands, suppliers, and distributors have been methodically exploring these multiple avenues for innovation. In keeping with the event organized last year, the 2018 Fragrance Innovation Summit to be held next October 25 in Paris will provide an overview of the major market trends, the latest innovations, and the emerging technologies, as well as testimonies of professionals. The presentation agenda was deliberately reduced to focus on the essentials. Ultimately, philosopher and essayist Gilles Lipovetsky will put new consumer expectations in perspective in a world marked by hyper-seduction. Discover the whole day’s agenda and join us to imagine the future of perfumery together. Detailed programme and registrations: here A Premium Beauty News event, in partnership with the Fragrance Foundation France and NEZ la revue."
Cosmetic 360 to highlight research & innovation,"Cosmetic 360 is characterized by an approach based on innovation, the key condition for any exhibitor to take part in the event. Just like when it all started, every innovation will be materialized by a totem display on all stands, and expert paths will guide visitors within each area of application. “This event embodies the Cosmetic Valley, as it highlights the importance of Research and Innovation across the whole industry. It also positions France as the place where investors, start-ups, and SMEs from all around the world come and meet each other. I will not reveal any details, but overall, I can say that this year, there will be multiple innovations in connected beauty, naturalness, and fast prototyping. We will talk about bioprinting of skin, plastic, or other materials,” announces Christophe Masson, CEO of the Cosmetic Valley, the organisation behind the event. The zone created in 2017 is an attractive feature of the show. It gathers 30 start-ups and will offer new animations this year: – The Studio, a specific action initiated by the Coty group, will materialize the attending start-ups’ answers to the greatest industrial cosmetics challenges through interviews – a way to provide an immediate perspective on the different technologies showcased focusing on tomorrow’s needs.
– The Start-Up Solution Area designed by Beauty Tech Chartres will act as a transient accelerator for two days. It is intended for all visitors willing to create their own company and will provide support in the form of ten experts, workshops, and conferences to get a more concrete vision of each project. Just like every year, several leading groups will settle in a specific area as prime manufacturers. Johnson & Johnson, Les Laboratoires Pierre Fabre, L’Oréal, LVMH Research, Puig, Rodan + Field, and Yves Rocher will be able to meet project managers that have submitted an application as part of the Open Innovation, so that they can exchange and even set up new partnerships. Over 200 qualified events will take place over the two days of the show. And this year, this feature will be accessible to distribution companies, so that young brands can meet the global QVC network in search of French jewels to distribute. To complete these different paths, the TechCorner animated by CNRS will put forward a new emulsion manufacturing process still under study. “The idea is to show how these processes still in the phase of academic research will impact tomorrow’s plants,” explains Christophe Masson. As for historic partner Greentech, they will put an emphasis on a challenge intended to finance an action for the economic development of Burkina-Faso. The global dimension of the event should also be highlighted: it counts over 30% of foreign exhibitors and hosts the global meeting of the Cosmetic Clusters International Network. Japan Beauty will be in the spotlight this year, in the presence of the Japan Cosmetic Center, which gathers ten Japanese companies as part of an animation programme set up by Shiseido. Sponsored by LVMH, this year, this new challenge intended for young professionals and students will be focused on the design of a “new, sustainable product inspired by nature in the era of experience.” Hackathon Maker, as it is called, will offer participants the possibility to go beyond the formalization of an idea by developing its prototyping. “Launched last year, the Hackathon embodies our will to make this show more than an exhibition: a moment to create innovation. Participants will start working in teams two days before it opens and will print their projects at the show with the 3D printer available to all. The projects will be presented to a jury, but also to the visitors,” adds Christophe Masson. The different LVMH brands will play the role of mentors for the participants, Dassault Systèmes will make their CATIA software available for 3D design, and ID3P will provide the high resolution printer. A €4,000 prize will reward the winning team at the end of the second day."
Schwan Cosmetics launches a ceramic case for luxury pencils with premium textures,"In the wake of the launch of Perfect - the first wooden case pencils that can store premium formulations - the German designer and manufacturer of cosmetic pencils - continues on its drive for innovation with the launch of the Treasure Collection, a range of make-up applicators featuring premium textures in exclusive ceramic designs. “Ceramic combines a unique, cool surface with an elegant appearance and ensures a pleasant feel and maximum break resistance,” explains Schwan Cosmetics. The Treasure Collection is currently available in the colors black and white, in an elegantly shiny or soft matte finish. The decor can be individually adapted, whether as embossing with a seductive feel, laser engraving, or screen printing. With such features, the Treasure Collection could soon become a must-have for brands from the premium sector. But the customization can go even further. As the ceramic cases are based on a so-called platform concept, the design of the ceremaic can be optimally tailored to the customer’s needs and brand DNA.  Indeed, the ceramic design is attached on a plastic master and can therefore take the shape desired by the brand. The successful new product “The InLiner” - the liquid eyeliner with an innovative wheel applicator - was selected for the launch of the Treasure Collection. Other products are already being planned and will also be available in ceramic. “With the Treasure Collection, we are offering cosmetic and even non-industry brands an absolutely high-quality, customized product for their premium segment,” explains Dagmar Chlosta, Chief Market Officer at Schwan Cosmetics. “The customer can work with us to create their very own individual product design, tailored to their brand and needs. The shape of the cosmetic pencil can also be changed as desired.”"
Show review: A broad range of innovations at MakeUp in NewYork,"Just like for the Paris edition last June, MakeUp in NewYork teamed up with trend intelligence group Beautystreams to launch the ColorWave space, providing insight into the shades that we can expect to see influencing the colour palettes of future makeup launches. The show also played host to conferences on hot topics of the moment, such as the growing importance of indie brands in North America, or the blurring border between skin care and make-up products.

Schwan Cosmetics creates airtight wooden pencils,"""As the inventor of the wooden cosmetics pencils, we are extremely excited to create yet another first in the industry. We thereby enlarge our portfolio of eco-friendly products with a new line of high performing formulas in wood pencils – a collection that will undoubtedly resonate with today’s consumers,"" said Dagmar Chlosta, Chief Market Officer at Schwan Cosmetics. Thanks to a new technological process that is kept secret, wooden pencils are made airtight and can thus contain formulas with volatile compounds.  So far, it was impossible to fill these formulas in anything else than plastic containers. According to Schwan Cosmetics, it is a real leap forward for the environment.  High performing ingredients, never used before in a wooden pencil, and enabling long lasting and waterproof formulas, can now be used to produce a brand new and unique product range featuring sustainable pencils made of renewable wood! A good way to reduce the use of plastics and to meet current expectations of consumers. In addition, Schwan Cosmetics’ “Perfect” collection also features high concentration of pure pigments creating an intense colour pay-off. A highlight in itself is also the innovative ""worry-free"" safety-lock cap introduced by Schwan Cosmetics for this collection. Its special design makes it possible to close a wooden pencil airtight for the first time. Thus, the cap will never fall and will keep the formula fresh. “The safety cap also avoids any accidental opening when transporting the pencil in a purse or a make-up bag. A novelty that will be praised by consumers,” explains Sonia Huneau, Public Relation Manager at Schwan Cosmetics. The “Perfect” range includes and eyeliner, that also be used as a kajal (the super soft formula lasts up to 18 hours as eyeliner and up to 15 hours as kajal), a brow liner (with a gel-gliding waterproof formula that can be colourless or highly pigmented and lasts up to 24 hours), a lipliner (with a no feathering formula that lasts up to 12 hours)."
Texen: A new benefit-oriented turnkey mascara offer,"In 50 years, mascara has become the most commonly used makeup product the world over. Consumers are increasingly demanding of a perfect makeup result, and make no concessions. Brands are therefore seizing each opportunity to swiftly launch the most competitive products. Whether their chosen product promise is to boost volume or lash length or for a long-lasting result, such claims are built on a subtle combination of brush, wiper and formula. To address the demand for shorter time to market, Texen has chosen to go beyond packaging production or sourcing to launch a consistent and ready to customize offer. ""This new mascara collection is designed for the needs of a market increasingly looking for speed. We have created a complete offer with specific benefit claims,"" explains Émilie Bleton, Marketing and Innovation Director at Texen. After extensive sourcing work and thorough consumer tests in collaboration with a top network of experts, Texen elaborated its mascara collection to be the most relevant possible for the market. Texen Innovation then selected the most promising makeup results. Based on this turnkey offer, Texen can then add its own packaging solution. ""The idea was to develop mascaras like a brand would have done, with the aim to make products ready to be launched on the market. Offering a turnkey solution is meaningful only when the outcome is a comprehensive product,"" says Aïmara Coupet, marketing and makeup development consultant.  ""As far as mascaras are concerned, there is a very high need for performance because clients are very demanding,"" she adds. Texen offers a total of eight mascaras, two fibre brush mascaras and six injected brush mascaras, with formulas originating from Europe, for benefits such as application accuracy, volume, long-lasting, or curly. With this ""ready-to-wear"" mascara offer with guaranteed product efficacy, Texen wants to offer significant time savings to its customers.  Indeed, product development time can be dedicated entirely to packaging personalization. It’s worth to be noted that to fastly meet beauty to go expectations, 12ml packs have already been designed. “Texen’s teams will put their expertise to work for their customers to develop either 100% standard or fully bespoke projects depending on the constraints of time-to-market and budget,” says the company. With such targeted makeup results, Texen is engaging in a “B2B2C” strategy, in order to offer agile turnkey solutions while reducing costs and time to market.  A revolution for this historical packaging player, which has been able to reinvent itself to meet a changing market!"
Cosmogen and Pylote launch innovative antimicrobial makeup tools,"Cosmogen, a leading European developer and supplier of cosmetic brushes, accessories and packaging is partnering with Pylote, a start-up offering an innovative microbial protection technology. Founded in 2009 by two researchers from the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), Pylote has developed a green process for manufacturing mineral microspheres that can be integrated into many consumer products, without any change of the existing manufacturing process. These microspheres have the particularity of providing products with-specific properties including an increased microbial cleanliness and hygiene throughout their use by the consumer. The microspheres are obtained through an innovative patented and exclusive green manufacturing process (spray pyrolysis) in one single step without any organic solvent or waste. It has won several awards (Pharmapack Award, CPhl Pharma Award, Packaging Award, CSR Solutions Award). It is also COSMOS approved and in compliance with international cosmetic, pharmaceutical and food regulations.  One of its main interest of Pylote’s mineral microspheres is that they do not release any substance in the products’ formulas. After having conducted industrial tests and assessed the effectiveness of this innovation on foams, brush fibres and plastic spatulas, Cosmogen is launching innovative ranges of more hygienic, safer and greener accessories and makeup applicators, made of antibacterial materials. ""This partnership with Pylote fits a key objective for consumers, whose demand for hygienic, safe and healthy products is growing strongly,” said Cosmogen’s CEO, Renaud van den Berg. Most importantly, according to the manager, it is a “realistic, industrial, reliable and value-added solution.” Indeed, cosmetic accessories and applicators are examples of high-risk products in terms of microbial contamination during use. This contamination poses a risk for consumers and is a source of concern to manufacturers in the cosmetics industry. To address this issue, Cosmogen successfully integrated Pylote’s microspheres on the industrial production lines of many accessories and applicators (sponges, brushes, spatulas, etc.). Tests have demonstrated that the microbial population contained in the accessories (lower count than the quantification threshold) was totally eradicated. ""I am delighted that our innovative technology made in France can benefit all players in the cosmetics industry, and primarily consumers. The blend of our expertise with that of Cosmogen is a leap forward in providing solutions that are today fully operational, responsible and safe, while having an immediate impact of safety and comfort for consumers,"" added Pylote’s CEO, Loïc Marchin. The innovative cosmetic accessories developed by Cosmogen with Pylote’s technology were featured last week at the MakeUp in Paris tradeshow."
A generator of scented clouds  that renews the olfactory discovery,"Originally developed for a major French brand, the generator integrates a technology that diffuses an olfactory cloud using only the perfume concentrate (without the alcohol contained in the formula). “Nowadays, this system is one of the most faithful way to transcribe a perfume and it passes the tests of the most advised noses,” says Julie Gesnouin, Byzance’s Associate Founder. “When you test a perfume on a blotter, there are always olfactory interferences.” In practice, the system is based on a mix of pure perfumed concentrate mixed with dipropylene glycol in proportions that vary depending on the fragrance and the desired cloud volatility. ""The cloud thus created may be more or less volatile according to marketing requirements. We can also control the release time and add LEDs to colour the cloud,"" details Julie Gesnouin.  And the cloud does not trigger smoke detectors! The development of the blend is validated with the brand and requires about a month. Byzance has carried out numerous tests to assess the safety of its system for the consumer health especially with regard to the inhalation of the smoke. The generator of scented clouds can be presented in a dedicated support or be duplicated in a display thus allowing the discovery of several fragrances in a raw.  It can be integrated into existing counters or used as a standalone in POS. Olfactory Cloud Experience from BYZANCE on Vimeo. The cost for a brand is about 550 euros per machine. The kit of three 10 ml vials blends (allowing a total of 600 to 700 tests) costs 50 euros, but brands can manufacture them using their own filling lines. The machines can of course be reused for other fragrances. “For the brands this incoming technology is a new alternative of olfactory discovery for their fragrances.  For consumers, it’s a rediscovery of how a perfume is tested. There is a real enthusiasm,” concludes Julie Gesnouin."
Visual fragrance: IFF partners with Amkiri to boost the technology,"Amkiri, an Israeli-based start-up that was founded in 2014, has launched the Visual Fragrance technology last March.  Amkiri’s Visual Fragrance technology is a new ‘ink’ that can be drawn on the skin that also delivers a longlasting fragrance, thus connecting the senses of sight and smell. “This is a significant innovation in the fragrance category, merging strong and deeply personal visuals with the resonance and emotion of fragrance,” said IFF Chairman and CEO Andreas Fibig.  “The Visual Fragrance technology creates a new platform from which IFF can showcase our capabilities, including naturals, molecules, and cosmetic actives. The potential for innovative applications are nearly endless and our teams are truly inspired by the possibilities.” Amkiri’s patented Visual Fragrance is applied to the skin using specially designed applicators, allowing the user to adorn themselves with individual multisensory body art. According to Amkiri, the formula is long-wearing and can work with any fragrance or colour. “Some of the most disruptive innovations come from the start-up community — this is as true in beauty care as it is in technology,” added Nicolas Mirzayantz, IFF Group President, Fragrances. “This extremely emotionally engaging technology brings a very timely category innovation to the market place.” “This partnership with IFF signals Amkiri’s commitment to product excellence and establishing Visual Fragrance as a part of consumers’ daily beauty regimen. The company will continue to develop more ground-breaking technologies that will continue to serve and disrupt the beauty industry,” said David Chissick Amkiri Chairman."
"“Raw materials and ideas are the two keys to innovation in perfumery”, Maurice Roucel, Symrise","Premium Beauty News - What is your definition of your trade as a perfumer? Maurice Roucel - It is an act of creation.  Just like painters mix colours or musicians mix notes, we mix smells. This act leads to a work that results from your own creative skills, inspiration, and technique. Similarly to many fields, you need to learn the technique, but creativity cannot be learnt: you have it or you don’t. Premium Beauty News - Has this trade changed over the past few years, in particular from a technical standpoint? Maurice Roucel - It is a trade that is constantly evolving. Generally speaking, every new raw material, whether it be synthetic or natural, can produce a new form of creation. Technically, there are more and more synthetic molecules that are key to new fragrances. The perfume trade has also changed according to social behaviours. For example, men’s perfumes have been freed: they used to be confined to woody notes, whereas you can find sweet, fruity notes now. We are heading towards an increasingly genderless style, which is also the case for women’s perfumes. What was true at some point in a given country is no longer so 30 years later, in the same country or continent. Social changes impact perfumery, things are not fixed. Premium Beauty News - How can you innovate in perfumery today? Maurice Roucel - There are two ways to innovate: if you have ideas, and if you have the right raw materials to help express them. Historically, France has never been too keen on fruity, sweet notes. The perfume Angel was introduced with a new molecule, and it revolutionized the market. That is innovation. People are also more open-minded, so perfumers can better express themselves, in particular thanks to the niche market. Premium Beauty News - Is that what explains the success of the niche market, following the slowdown of traditional perfumery? Maurice Roucel - To explain this slowdown, you need to have a look at the number of launches per year. When I started, in 1973, there were 20 launches a year. Today, this figure has reached 1,700 to 2,000, with both good and bad products. It is true that perfumery has become democratic, that all the greatest brands took to the streets with a multitude of perfumes. These are not necessarily bad perfumes: the raw materials are often qualitative, but the creative quality is no longer the same. What is paradoxical is that major groups purchase niche brands at high cost, whereas they make dozens of millions with their own brands. I think these big companies encounter difficulties when it comes to developing creation, so they turn to alternative brands. Premium Beauty News - What type of perfumery do you prefer to work for? Maurice Roucel - I prefer to work with creators, people who have this passion for their trade. It is like a tennis match, you have fun when you play with someone who knows how to hit the ball back. The act of creation in perfumery is an exchange. For a perfumer, it is more interesting to work with these people that have such freedom. It is not a specificity of niche perfumery, though. It was like that when I worked with Sylvaine Delacourte for Guerlain. Premium Beauty News - You spent several years in Brazil for Symrise. Is it an interesting country in terms of perfumery raw materials? Maurice Roucel - It is a country that has a bright future due to its strong potential, but it is not a great ingredient producer for perfumery yet. There are many different fruit species, but only few perfume plants. Premium Beauty News - What can you say about the relationship between Brazilians and perfume? Maurice Roucel - Brazil is the biggest perfume consumer in the world, whether in terms of tonnage or value. They are Latins, they like wearing perfume, it is a natural gesture for them. Brazilians love powerful, heady perfumes with a long-lasting trail. They are fond of persistent fragrances."
Could ’visual fragrance’ be the next big perfume trend?,"In the age of highly image-driven social media, perfumes hardly leave their mark in the mind of influencers who are spontaneously more attracted by the fast-visual effects offered by colour cosmetics. To solve the equation of the visibility of perfumes, Israel-based cosmetics company Amkiri has announced that it has developed and successfully patented a scented ’ink’ infused with fragrance. The creme-like product is designed to be applied to the skin using specific applicators, allowing wearers to craft colorful body art while anointing themselves with a perfume that the brand claims lasts for up to 12 hours. According to Amkiri, the patented technology can carry any fragrance or colour and can therefore adapt to any form of skin. The concept is the brainchild of designer Shoval Shavit, entrepreneur David Chissick and chemistry expert Aliza Shavit. ""As a designer, and a very visual and expressive person, I initially came up with the notion of Amkiri for my own personal needs,"" said Shoval Shavit in a statement. ""I asked myself how I could create a fragrance that is visual? I wanted to blend makeup, tattoos and fragrances in one product."" Perfumes brands have been shaking things up in terms of fragrance formats recently - back in February, cult label Glossier put solid perfumes back on the map with the launch of a consolidated version of its ""You"" scent. Last spring saw designer Derek Lam reimagine his ""10 Crosby"" perfume line as a series of twist-up wax fragrance sticks, while Maison Margiela’s portfolio includes a dry body oil. (See our article here). At the latest edition of Luxe Pack Monaco, several suppliers of packaging solutions have put forward applicators allowing to handwrite fragrances on the skin. Another challenge was to make the fragrances visible and compatible with a wide variety of colours, it is apparently what Amkiri achieved. The company is set to launch a selection of products in May, with further releases planned for later in the year."
MakeUp in Paris opens to start-ups,"Premium Beauty News - Fred Ghenassia, you proposed organizers of MakeUp in Paris 2018 to animate an area dedicated to start-ups and revolving around the world of makeup and beauty? Can you tell us more?
 
Fred Ghenassia - Two years ago I created Open Bay a start-ups incubator. This led me to meet dozens of young companies and notice their difficulties, either to meet key players in their market, or to introduce their products or solutions.
 
Knowing the MakeUp in Paris trade show and its organizers since its inception, I proposed them to set up an area within the show dedicated to startups. A project they welcomed with enthusiasm. Indeed, this event has always been both the initiator of very original animations and actively in tune and listening to the market.
 
Premium Beauty News - What will be the special feature of this specific show area?
 
Fred Ghenassia - First, I would like to recall that I have been working in the cosmetics sphere for twenty years. I have a good knowledge of this market and I know the world of startups in France quite well. My goal is twofold: enable start-ups to meet market players in an appropriate setting and conditions and give visitors the opportunity to discover innovations. The originality of my approach is a support to these companies before, during and after the show. All our team members at Open Bay are dedicated to identifying the most innovative projects, help companies introduce themselves at the show, animate the area during the two days and monitor results.   Premium Beauty News - What animations will be organized at the show?
 
Fred Ghenassia - With the organizers, we have two highlights planned on Thursday, June 21st and Friday, June 22nd. There will be a conference that will give each company the opportunity to present its concept in a few minutes. The form of these presentations will be original and fun. But be patient, I will tell you more at the kick-off of the show!
 
Premium Beauty News - What would you be tempted to say to startups managers wishing to test this show area called Start in Make Up Paris?
 
Fred Ghenassia - This is a unique opportunity to meet, at almost no cost, the people and companies that play a part in the make-up and beauty industry. The challenge for these start-ups managers will then be to clearly explain their concept to them, while our role will be to attract them to this area thanks to the quality of the start-ups we selected.

Chanel takes a major step with a 3D-printed mascara brush,"At a time when innovation is all about digital and virtual experiences, Chanel reminds us that industrial excellence can also lead to dramatically disruptive projects. Announcing the development and future industrial production of an innovative 3D-printed mascara brush, the brand has taken a major step in the industrial use of additive manufacturing, which was predicted several years ago to become an effective competitor to traditional production methods such as plastic injection. Chanel says it has understood the potential of 3D-printing no later than in 2001, before filing a first patent in 2007 for the manufacture of cosmetic products applicators, including a 3D-printed mascara brush. This project is about to become a reality soon with the launch of Chanel’s Le Révolution Volume new mascara, whose brush is manufactured with the printing of successive layers of a polyamide powder polymerized with a laser beam. The main advantage of the 3D printing is that the technology eliminates the need to design and manufacture pricey injection moulds. The removal of this time-consuming step brings new flexibility to the whole process. Indeed, 3D printing allows manufacturing inexpensive prototypes to makes as many tests as needed to obtain the best brush-formula pair. According to Chanel, the forthcoming Le Révolution Volume mascara brush went through more than 100 rounds of trials until the final shape was validated. In order to create and industrialize this unique brush, the Packaging Innovation Department of Chanel Parfums Beauté teamed up with Erpro 3D Factory, a company specializing in big scale additive manufacturing [1].  The two companies have jointly designed a production line consisting of six machines capable of producing 50,000 brushes per 24 hours, 250,000 brushes per week, or up to 1 million brushes per month. The production, which is expected to begin in June 2018, follows a stringent process, especially as its concerns products intended to be applied in the sensitive eye area: raw material analysis, powder preparation, polymerization with the laser beam, cooling of the brushes, cleaning, rinsing, quality control and mechanical tests. Allowing a perfect reproducibility and fully mould-free, the process the subject of several patent applications. As far as the mascara’s functionalities are concerned, 3D-printing also allows to produce a unique and innovative product with a specific shape that would have not been possible, according to Chanel, with the traditional production methods. In particular, the brush features: a granular texture, so as to improve how the formula adheres to lashes; micro-cavities at the core of the wand to store enough matter to pre-empt double-dipping; and a bristle-grid separated by millimetres to prevent clumping. The new step forward industrial 3D-printing paves the way for future production processes offering more freedom, more agility, more flexibility and more reactivity as well as an increased freedom to enhance brand’s creativity."
L’Oréal: Another step forward for ultra-personalized skincare,"""At L’Oréal, we are poised to leverage technology to respond to the rising wave of consumer demand for personalized products and services,"" said Guive Balooch, Global Vice President of L’Oréal’s Technology Incubator, in a statement. ""D.O.S.E acts like a mini skincare laboratory, combining lab grade formulation and factory grade manufacturing into a machine that sits on the counter."" Developed by L’Oréal’s Technology Incubator in partnership with the group’s skincare brand SkinCeuticals, D.O.S.E scans and evaluates consumers’ skin needs.  In the wake of this consultation, the results are transmitted to an automatic compounder machine, whose 2,000 plus algorhythms make it capable of offering multiple ingredient combinations to suit up to 250 skin types.  The result is a tailor-made, corrective serum that targets skin aging issues like wrinkles, fine lines, and discoloration. The personalized serum thus produced is then adorned with a custom label that includes an expiration date and a bar code for easy reordering. Each Custom D.O.S.E evaluation takes between 3-5 minutes and the serum takes about 5 minutes to dispense. ""The D.O.S.E technology empowers skincare professionals to co-create personalized formulas that address patients’ unique skincare needs on the spot, in minutes,"" said Christina Fair, General Manager of SkinCeuticals. Custom D.O.S.E is set to launch in select U.S. physician offices nationwide from this summer. The launch of D.O.S.E is a new step forward for the development of ultra-personalized cosmetic solutions in line with what the L’Oréal group already offers through Lancôme’s Le Teint Particulier.

Fiabila announces new hybrid nail polish generation ,"Fiabila is about to unveil a brand-new generation of hybrid nail polish at Cosmopack next March 15-18, 2018 in Bologna, Italy. “This new nail polish can be used like standard polish, at home or in salons, but it provides absolutely breath-taking long wear and shininess results. Just like traditional nail polish, it is featured in transparent glass bottles for every shade to be seen, and is removed with acetone-free solvents,” explains Alexandre Miasnik, Fiabila’s General Manager. Hybrid nail polish was first created a few years ago. These new formulas combine the advantages of gels (or semi-permanent nail polish) and traditional nail polish. To this aim, Fiabila uses a real innovative oligomer for which they registered a patent. This resin creates a physical hardening effect thanks to a 3D molecular structure, while preserving incredible flexibility, even at high concentrations. As a result, hybrid nail polish offers much more long wear and shininess than traditional nail polish. Contrary to gels, these hybrid formulas do not require any UV lamp during the drying phase and are very easy to remove. Hybrid formula pioneer Fiabila has been working for several years on improving these products’ performances to reach almost the same levels as gels, but without the drawbacks. The new generation of formulas that will be showcased in Bologna actually promises exceptional quality results confirmed by now systematic tests on external panels. “Based on a technology we developed, we managed to get unequalled long wear and shininess results. Today, we can make our polish last a whole week with formulas containing safe raw materials, and which dry as fast as traditional nail polish. We are one step ahead and are now competing with permanent nail polish,” emphasizes the young leader. With 40 multi-disciplinary technicians exclusively dedicated to nail polish R&D, Fiabila has made innovation and creativity two of their main strategy pillars. The company owns eleven plants around the world and undertakes to offer their customers the same quality on all markets. After two less dynamic years – although they followed a long boom –, according to the analyses of different market research agencies, including Euromonitor, the global nail polish market should record a significant growth at least until 2021 (+28%), driven by the strong dynamism of regions like South America, in particular Brazil. “The nail polish market is very cyclical, it is stimulated by creativity and the colour and effect offering. That is why we offer two collections of 72 shades every year, and many new products and innovations on a constant basis,” explains Alexandre Miasnik. Just like every year in Bologna, Fiabila will showcase a new collection of exclusive shades available for all their formulas (traditional or hybrid), but also a record number of new effects, many of which are definitely innovative."
ID Scent revives the perfume sample,"By incorporating the perfume into the paper fibres by air compression, the material provides an accurate, stable, homogeneous reproduction of the fragrance over several months, even years. The material remains with the consumer over time, while perpetuating an accurate expression of the perfume. “The contact cost is quite low, since it is easier to share the soaked fragrance for an opinion or a test,” explains Maxime Caffon, ID Scent’s Associate Director. It took ten years for ID Scent, a company specialized in olfactory marketing, to develop this innovation, which combines several advantages and possibilities other than long wear. The perfume may be partially or totally applied on the material, on one or two sides, so it does not come in contact with the decoration. This detail creates multiple finishing options, like hot stamping, without any disturbance. The perfume does not harm the prints, and vice versa. Scentest is available on standard sample cardboards, but also for press samples, press kits, or mailings. All forms are possible, and more creative materials can even be used. ID Scent actually managed to use their unique know-how on other materials.  The Scentwear technology makes it possible to perfume textile and also opens up possibilities with clothes, accessories, or bracelet ribbons. Lastly, at the Paris PCD show, ID Scent unveiled the latest Scentrub technology designed with composite gum for incorporating perfume directly concentrated in the product mass. Durably perfumed, the object becomes an excellent communication medium."
Alternative fragrance formats make a comeback,"Earlier this month, Glossier surprised fans with a solid version of its fragrance ""You,"" offering up the signature scent’s notes of ambrette, ambrox, musk, iris root and pink pepper in a creamy, transportable form. But although the concept of a fragrance that resembles a lip balm is charmingly retro, the product’s millennial pink packaging offers up a thoroughly modern twist. Last spring saw US fashion designer Derek Lam reimagine his ""10 Crosby"" perfume line as a series of twist-up wax fragrance sticks that claim to offer up to six hours of wear. Another example is Le Labo’s famous ""Santal 33"" fragrance comes as an eau de parfum, a solid perfume and a practical ""liquid balm"" - which features an alcohol-free formula and can be easily rolled onto any part of the body. For the ultimate stress-free fragrance application, check out Pinrose’s perfume ‘petals’, or towelettes. Each wipe contains exactly one dose of scent, taking away the anxiety of potentially overdoing things. If spray perfumes and solid scents aren’t your thing, consider a perfumed dry body oil. Maison Margiela’s ‘Replica Beach Walk’ fragrance is available in this format, which allows the product to absorb quickly into both the skin and hair for a natural, grease-free scent. Last but not least, Chanel recently launched the world’s first cushion fragrance, a technology usually used for liquid makeup products, such as liquid foundations.  The Chance Eau Tendre Delicate Fragrance Touch-Up is a limited-edition item that can fit in any handbag."
HPBioTECH relies on high hydrostatic pressure for the safety of cosmetics,"Mastering the microbiology of cosmetic formulations is a key issue to ensure their safety, which is also becoming more and more complex to achieve. On the one hand, regulations tend to limit the list of authorized preservatives and on the other, the wariness of consumers for these substances and the trend towards natural products is prompting manufacturers to look for alternatives. In addition to preservatives, ultra-high temperature (UHT) or ionization technologies (the use of which is forbidden for organic cosmetics), HPBioTECH proposes to use high hydrostatic pressures. Created in 2011 and certified as “Young Innovative Company”, HPBioTECH is headquartered in Léognan, near Bordeaux. “As with ionization, we treat cosmetics in their final packaging. But we only use water, it’s a totally natural process which is less energy consuming than UHT,” explained Adrien Plumecocq, R&D Engineer at HPBioTECH. “In practice, to destroy micro-organisms, we play on several parameters, mainly pressure, temperature and the duration of the pressure applied. Due to the low amount of energy developed, processing must be optimized for each type of formula and packaging to secure the content while preserving its organoleptic properties. Among companies proposing high hydrostatic pressure technology, we are the only ones capable of inactivating bacterial spores and thus obtain a ‘sterilization equivalent’.” To date, this technology is mostly used by the food industry. However, it could be of great interest to the cosmetics industry. As products are processed in their final packaging, implementing a complex and expensive system to ensure the sterility of packaging lines is no longer necessary. Moreover, the array of products that can be treated with this technology is very wide. And because it is possible to work at low temperatures, it is also possible to process fragile formulas containing sensitive ingredients. The current limitations are the ones coming from the stiffness of primary packaging. “For pressure to be efficient it must be able to act on the formula and therefore the container must be relatively flexible. For example, treating products in a glass container is not possible,” detailed Adrien Plumecocq. And because packagings will be subjected to high hydrostatic pressures, they also need to be perfectly sealed to prevent water from entering. Ideally, tubes should be sealed. After developing and patenting sterilization processes by means of high hydrostatic pressure, HPBioTECH wants to enter the segment of service providers specialized in high hydrostatic pressure treatment by acquiring an industrial tool. HPBioTECH will present its technology at the conference “Translating consumption trends in innovative cosmetics”, which will take place next February 15 in Paris. [1]"
Coty launches Amazon Echo virtual beauty experience,"Dubbed ‘Let’s Get Ready,’ the concept has been designed specifically for the Echo Show - Amazon’s first Echo device with a screen - and launched in the UK this week. Using Amazon’s Alexa voice service, ‘Let’s Get Ready’ offers users on-demand beauty tutorials, occasion-based look planning and shopping opportunities.  Coty’s explains the strategic choice of Echo Show and the Alexa voice service by the need to focus on voice-driven beauty services with visuals, which are critical in Beauty. The personalized beauty offering provides curated makeup looks, visual ‘how to’s’ and quick tips, as well as recommended corresponding products from Coty’s beauty portfolio, which includes brands such as Clairol, Rimmel, Max Factor, Bourjois and Sally Hansen. The technology is capable of delivering over 2,000 unique combinations of looks for hair, eye and skin colour, as well as by event type. It can be synced up to Facebook profiles, in order to suggest specific looks for upcoming events, and allows users to add products from each look directly to their Alexa shopping list. According to Coty, the looks and events are based on extensive consumer insight and engagement, social listening and trend scanning to deliver an authentic beauty experience focusing on both classic and trending looks for most any occasion. ""Digital innovation with a focus on voice and virtual assistants is a key part of our digital strategy as we aim to bring consumers frictionless beauty experiences,"" said Jason Forbes, Coty Chief Digital and Media Officer. ""Further, this skill allows us to deliver an authentic and personalized experience for beauty enthusiasts that happens near real time, delivering customized looks in the context of a person’s lifestyle and personal attributes."" Sales of smart speakers are expected to nearly double in the US, to US$3.8 billion, from last year according to Lesley Rohrbaugh and Steve Koenig, researchers with the Consumer Technology Association, which organizes the annual CES trade event, which took place earlier this month in Las Vegas. Being able to order items, select music, get information, and more by speaking to digital assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa, Google Assistant, and Microsoft’s Cortana has been such a hit that pressure will be on for more ways to interact with machines using voice, the researchers predicted."

The Cosmetic Victories - Third edition,"One of the most challenging issues of the Cosmetic Valley is to detect and support the young innovative companies, as well as to promote the research and the cosmetic sciences. This led to the creation of The Cosmetic Victories competition in 2015, sponsored by the Cosmetic Valley-ESSEC endowment fund. The competition, recognized by the profession, aims to reward and promote students, researchers, start-ups and SMEs in charge of innovative projects, related to the perfume and cosmetics industry. – To support and promote projects run by researchers, start-ups and entrepreneurs from the perfume and cosmetics sector.
– To facilitate the prize-winners’ access to the market. This year, the Cosmetic Victories Awards consist in two prizes: – The Academic Prize, for the most relevant project that meets the new technical challenges of the cosmetic industry.
– The Industry Prize, for the best cosmetic innovation of the year. The Cosmetic Victories is open to French and international contestants: – The Academic Prize: for recent graduates, PhD students, post-doctoral fellows and researchers.
– The Industry Prize: for managers of business-creation projects, innovative start-ups and SMEs. All kind of innovation may be presented as a project submission, in any fields of application of the perfume and cosmetics industry: raw materials, formulation, packaging, tests, finished goods, … Note:  The innovations can come from the perfume and cosmetics industry or can be the result of technology transfer from other sectors to the cosmetic field: new technologies, new products, new processes, new services, new concepts or new organisations. – Recognition by the profession. The international jury’s excellence adds value and considerable scope to each prize-winner’s project.
– International exposure. Following the competition, there will be major national and international press coverage. – Technical backing.  Cosmetic Valley is able to support the prize winners in their efforts to develop their business in France, through the Cosmet’Up tool: a national platform for working alongside and supporting French start-ups and SMEs. The prize winners will also be able to benefit from project engineering facilities at Cosmetic Valley, in order to help them obtain government funding. –  Financial backing. To support the competition’s prize-winning projects, and based on the Cosmetic Valley-Essec endowment fund, winners of The Cosmetic Victories award will receive a cash prize of €10,000. The Cosmetic Victories relies on a prestigious jury consisting of members of the major companies and top names in the perfume and cosmetics sector.This year, LVMH, Clarins, Sisley and Shiseido were represented. We have also greeted two honoured guests, with Ms Axelle Tessandier, founder of AXL Agency, and Mr François Demachy, perfumer-designer for Christian Dior. Research and innovation institutions, such as the CNRS [the French National Centre for Scientific Research], the GDR 3711 Cosm’Actifs [French Research Network], the SFC [French Society of Cosmetic]  and Bpifrance will also be present, as well as ESSEC, our endowment fund partner. The Cosmetic Valley-ESSEC endowment fund was set up in 2013 to promote French research and to take part in developing employment in the perfume and cosmetics field, with the aim of showcasing the reputation of French cosmetics and the “Made in France” label. That is why the Endowment Fund authorised the establishment of an annual international competition for young researchers, academics, university students and those from France’s prestigious higher education institutes, as well as people in charge of innovative projects (from start-ups and SMEs) in the perfume and cosmetics field. The first edition of the competition was launched in 2015 with the name “The Cosmetic Victories”."
The beauty brands that shook up the industry in 2017,"It may have only made its (long-awaited) debut in September, but Fenty Beauty by Rihanna was the undisputed makeup victory of 2017. The brand’s initial 91-piece debut won global acclaim for its inclusive approach to beauty, thanks to its 40-strong foundation range, and its lineup was quickly bolstered by the addition of a holiday ‘Galaxy Collection’ and ‘Stunna’ lip paint, with a new lipstick collection set to launch on December 26. The business was recently named one of the ‘Inventions of the Year’ by Time Magazine. Fast fashion retailer Asos pulled a surprising move back in September, with the launch of its first-ever own-brand makeup collection. The 46-piece series was devised to enable everyone to experiment with textures and colors, with the company stating: ""At Asos, we want to empower 20-somethings to confidently be themselves, however they choose to do so."" Another majorly successful celebrity beauty launch came courtesy of reality TV star and social media powerhouse Kim Kardashian, whose KKW Beauty label began operating this June. Its debut ‘Contour and Highlight Kits’ sold out in a matter of hours, and the collection has since been extended to include liquid lipsticks and a range of ’Ultralight Beam’ highlighters. The star also made her first big move on the fragrance industry this year, launching her KKW Fragrance brand and releasing a sell-out trio of scents this November. The iconic makeup mogul Pat McGrath began to build up her cult beauty label, Pat McGrath Labs in 2015, but this year saw her supplement her highly limited-edition launches with a much more accessible permanent collection that is also carried by Sephora. The beauty star also made waves in November, when she teamed up with singer Maggie Lindemann became the first makeup entrepreneur to sell products through the music streaming service Spotify. One of the most unexpected beauty launches of the year came from convenience store 7-Eleven, which dreamed up its debut cosmetics line earlier this fall. The chain store’s 40-piece collection is dubbed ‘Simply Me Beauty,’ and was designed for millennials on the go, prioritizing affordable price points and a fashion-forward vision."
L’Oréal embraces natural beauty with new plant-based hair dyes,"The beauty giant’s professional division has announced the launch of Botanea, its first-ever vegetal hair colour line. The collection eschews the chemicals that are traditionally present in hair dye ingredients for a formula that is 100% plant-based. The line uses botanical dyes sourced from Indian plants such as Henna, Indigo and Pure Cassia, with a natural coco oil coating. The range consists of a trio of products designed for professional use, and is set to be rolled out to salons in Europe in May 2018.  In a first, the range should be made available in about 30% of hair salons working with L’Oréal Professionnel. Furthermore, according to some media reports, the cosmetics group would also prepare the launch of similar natural hair dyes in the mass-market channel. Natural and sustainable beauty has proven itself as a lucrative trend over the past year, with several brands making huge strides towards adopting a more environmentally and ethically conscientious approach towards the industry. The once-niche world of natural beauty brands has grown to include household names such as Lush, Neal’s Yard and Tarte Cosmetics, while there has also been a rise in popularity of vegan and cruelty-free labels that avoid ingredients that come from or are tested on animals, with headline brands such as Kat Von D, Too Faced and Fenty Beauty by Rihanna leading the way. The natural movement looks set to continue to break boundaries in 2018, with research released in November by market intelligence agency Mintel predicting that encompassing local approaches and developments in biotechnology with a more organic approach to ingredients will become a major beauty industry trend over the coming year."
The brands that shook up the male beauty industry in 2017,"While Mintel recently highlighted a general shift in attitudes regarding the topic of male beauty, with consumers moving away from gender stereotypes while embracing gender neutrality, a new market research by Reportlinker has valued the global male grooming product industry at USD 47.582 billion (about EUR 40.412 billion) for the year 2016, with steady growth predicted to push this figure up to USD 61.567 billion by the end of 2026. In this context, some cosmetics brands are waking up to the growing consumer trend for specialist beauty products and treatments for men, resulting in a slew of new and innovative solutions. We take a look at some of the hottest new arrivals on the men’s beauty scene in 2017. Skincare staple Kiehl’s made a big move earlier this year when it expanded its men’s beauty products with the launch of a ‘Grooming Solutions’ line. Described as the ‘essential toolkit’ for perfectly groomed guys, it contains everything from soap to styling gel, but one of the most ingenious products is the ‘Nourishing Shampoo + Conditioner,’ which hydrates the scalp while removing buildup. Hip fragrance brand Le Labo also rolled out a men’s grooming line over the summer, described as ""an ode to old-world, traditional Americana barbershops."" The six-piece collection spans shaving creams, beard oils and balms, but it was the ‘Face Bronzer’ that really stood out. Eventually, streetwear brand of the moment Supreme made a surprise move on the grooming sector back in September, when it teamed up hair accessory company Andis Envy Li on a pair of cordless hair clippers. The tool, which features a high-speed adjustable blade, reportedly sold out in under 10 seconds."
"Neose Pro, a mobile, quick digital nose","Based on the fact that brands increasingly expect digital values less costly and more reliable than human evaluations of smells, Aryballe relied on a combination of technologies (optical, microfluidic, biochemical, electronic, and computer technologies) to develop the first digital nose. The recognition of smells is carried out by about forty biosensors inspired from human olfaction that are directed to a database containing several hundreds of smells that serve as references. The company is constantly working on the classification of these references to go as far as detecting unknown smells. “Both users and perfume houses can also set up their own database of references,” explains Tristan Rousselle, co-founder and Director of Aryballe Technologies. There is a broad range of applications for the perfume and cosmetics industry. During the manufacturing phase, the electronic nose can be used for verifying the quality of the raw materials, compared to reference standards, following up the smell stability at each production phase, or validating the quality of the finished products. During the post-production phase, it can make it easier to monitor the drift in time of the fragrance in the formulas, support the panel of testers during sensorial analyses… The device provides a documented answer extremely close to the human olfactory experience, without the drawbacks of panel tests, which can be undermined by a saturated or affected human nose. Beyond the Perfume & Cosmetics industry, NeOse Pro applications may apply to diverse fields, like the food industry for aromas, or environmental pollution monitoring (waste, public restrooms, etc.). Mobile and quick – it only takes 15 seconds to make a measurement – NeOse Pro will be marketed for an industrial public in January 2018 for EUR 10,000."
Sephora embraces voice control era,"Getting in touch with Sephora while talking to your smartphone or to a connected speaker without even installing the app? That is the service offered by several pioneers now available in Google Assistant, an intelligent personal assistant which is able to held a conversation using Google’s natural language program. To use the service, you need to launch Google Assistant - for instance by saying “OK Google”, if the phone is listening - and say ""Speak with Sephora"" (or another service also available on Google Assistant). Sephora has developed its chat bot in collaboration with VISEO, using artificial intelligence bricks allowing customers to interact with the company via Google Home as well as Android and iOS smartphones via the Google Assistant. ""The use of voice assistants and more recently voice-activated speakers is proving to be much more than a trend but the preparation for a small digital revolution in which Sephora wants to be a forerunner. With these first features and this collaboration with Google, we intend to test the audience and the reactions of our customers with regard to voice assistance,"" said Anne-Véronique Baylac, Chief Digital Officer at Sephora EMEA. A first wave of services has arrived in early November but, according to Sephora, this is just the beginning and new features will be available in 2018 through this new channel: – Beauty services booking such as a complete make-up at the Beauty Bar or at the Benefit’s eyebrow bar.  Thanks to Google Assistant and Google Home, it is now possible to check all availabilities in Sephora stores. Appointments are finalized by email afterwards.
– Beauty quizzes in order to allow the retailer to get information about the client’s level of information.
– Exclusive beauty podcasts with influencers. According to Sephora, with more than 49 million voice assistant users and 10 million voice-activated speakers sold in the United States in 2016 [1], voice assistants are emerging as a key channel.  Sephora explains a retailer must adapt to its customers’ new uses in order to better respond to changing expectations and make their lives easier."
Artificial intelligence & beauty: China pushes back the limits of the possible,"Since 2015, L’Oréal has been developing applications using facial recognition and virtual reality like Make Up Genius, Vice Lipstick (Urban Decay), and Style My Hair (L’Oréal Professionnel), to make it possible for users, via hundreds of functionalities, to view their faces with different makeup, lipstick, or hair styles, and then buy the products they liked the most. “These applications are highly successful around the world, in particular Style My Hair, which puts hairstylist and customer communities in contact and is present in dozens of countries, including China,” Asmita Dubey explains. The application also localizes the nearest hairdressing salons offering the type of treatments the users chose. However, in China, it cannot compete with Meitu ( 美图, “beautiful image”), the popular photo processing application that brightens the skin, conceals blemishes, and widens the eyes in accordance with Chinese standards. “Meitu counts 270 million active users per month. In China, everything is in a larger scale,” Asmita Dubey reiterates. This success has triggered new initiatives by people eager to ride the wave of applications dedicated to virtual makeup, beauty tips, and skin diagnosis, like Tmall, Chinese conglomerate Alibaba’s e-commerce website specialized in lifestyle brands. These applications are supported by the mostly mobile use of digital devices in China, which counted 751 million web users in July 2017. As far as vocal recognition is concerned, Chinese giant Baidu has developed Deep Speech 2, which turns the voice into textual data – an essential tool, “since we know 50% of all searches will be made orally in 2020,” Asmita Dubey says. “For cosmetics brands, the objective is to provide an oral, not written answer, and make the dialogue as fluid as a conversation. Many groups have been working on this and their results will soon be available on the market,” she announces. An additional step towards purchase customization will then be completed, since artificial intelligence makes “recommendation” easier with the user data recorded. At the forefront of this technology, Tmall organized a Singles’ Day last November 11, which the Alibaba group managed to turn into a national shopping day in China – an operation called “1,000 faces, 1,000 pages”. The site provided product recommendations on a web page depending on the buyers’ profiles, tastes, and consumption habits. “This recommendation function is still being enhanced by the xiaohongshu RED site (小红书, “little red book”),” Asmita Dubey continues.  Depending on the type of products sought, this website presents the purchases of influential Chinese bloggers and their recommendations. Launched in 2014 as an application giving Chinese travelers the opportunity to rate and review the products they bought abroad, RED has added an ecommerce functionality - including mainly Asian cosmetics brands - as a result of its strong growth. This huge quantity of collected data does not only concern final buyers, but also the information influencers on blogs and social media provide. “We often work with American company Tribe Dynamics, whose technology makes it possible to relate the content generated by influencers to the brands they talk about. If you take the example of Asian brand Tatcha, the analysis of what influencers say about it around the world can determine in which region and within which chains the brand will grow, to what extent it will grow, etc.” The progress made in artificial intelligence is not only meant to make companies more profitable, Asmita Dubey claims: they can also involve a social commitment, as can be seen with application QQ Alerts, created by Tencent, another Chinese web giant that has been working on this technology. By giving a kid his future adult appearance on a picture, the application offers the possibility to find lost or abducted children. However advanced they may seem, none of these applications has reached the ultimate goal of artificial intelligence yet: combine detection, reasoning, and optimization, as the technologies developed for designing self-driving cars do. “There is still a lot to do, including solving the problem of personal data and privacy protection,” emphasizes Amita Dubey. To her, in China, “the question has more to do with data security than privacy.”"
Handwritten fragrances: Closer to the skin,"In the wake of the launch of Note in 2015, Aptar Beauty + Home continues its innovative exploration of the fragrance gesture towards an ever more understated elegance. At the Luxe Pack tradeshow - which was held in Monaco from 2 to 4 October 2017 - the manufacturer of fragrance and facial skin care packaging delivery systems has launched Fragrance Master, an innovative applicator that aims to renew the perfuming experience through an application that was designed “to appeal to both connoisseurs and millennials in search of fun innovations.” Born from the Skin Master technology, this ""perfume pen"" delivers a dose for instant distribution and traces its fragrance trail on the skin. “The application is quick, controlled and highly sensory, and the object travel-friendly, innovative and precise: perfect for application to pulse points, to which it is recommended to add fragrance to create a lingering trail.” For an optimal customization of this new perfume ritual and its calligraphic sensory feel, Fragrance Master can be adapted with specific applicator options (quill, drop, brush,…) and a wide choice of customised features for the design. Also on the occasion of Luxe Pack, Texen presented its own technical solution for an innovative, intimate and ultra-practical product to use on-the-go. The concept immediately appealed Mugler for its new perfume Aura. This fragrance pen can be refilled by soaking its nylon tip in a perfume bottle. The tip quickly get imbibed by capillarity with approximately 0.2 g of perfume after 60 seconds of immersion. Thus refilled, the pen can be used for seven days with two applications per day. Texen’s standard fragrance pen and the associated bottle can be customized to the brand’s needs. For Mugler, the PP pen has been anodized with silver-coloured aluminium and the brand’s named has been silk-screen printed in black letters. A wide range of decors and printing solutions are available. ""With this fragrance pen, Texen addresses consumers’ demand for an elegant, practical, easy-to-use and easy to refill product,"" said the company. These two high-end solutions complete the already known fragrance pencils and sticks, such as Alkos’ Perfume Touch Up, with a super-light texture designed to ""melt onto the skin"".  Another example is BCM’s Fragrance Stick, available in two formulas, transparent or opaque. Each of these solutions requires a specific formulation (solid, liquid or gel) that shows the extent of variations available in the fragrance category."
Cosmetic 360: Innovation more than ever on the agenda,"“Cosmetic 360 is an event based on qualitative values: all the companies present come to put forward their competitive advantages and what makes them stand out in terms of innovation,” asserts Franckie Béchereau, Show Manager. To do this, the event organizers decided to resume the notion of Expert Routes to identify innovation types according to five themes: Tests & Analyses, Packaging & Conditioning, Raw Materials, Formulation & Manufacturing. “We pride ourselves on offering solutions that have never been presented to the perfume & cosmetics industry. We contacted exhibitors in other business areas like logistics or pharmacy, so our professionals will discover applications for the first time,” Franckie Béchereau promises. The Startup Zone was quite dynamic last year, so this time it will be located in a larger dedicated room in which young companies will also have a few minutes to introduce themselves to a public of investors and partners. “This show is actually in turmoil, it is turned to new products, so it was logical for us to support startups,” she explains. This positioning is confirmed by the new area called Solutions Startup, which makes it possible for people with innovative projects set up within a company or not, but who do not come as exhibitors, to introduce themselves in a few minutes to players essential to young structures, like banks, INPI, or BPI… This way, organizers assert a new positioning as ‘startup creators’ in relation to innovation. There is something else that is new for this edition: the organization of a Hackathon sponsored by LVMH Digital. The event will see teams composed of students from the greatest cosmetics and digital schools compete for the creation of new digital solutions. Fundamental and scientific research will also be put forward in an innovative way. Two animations are scheduled on issues related to cosmetopoeia and plasma, a cutting-edge scientific project aimed for the development of the first plasma device dedicated to cosmetics applications. Now, also with a view to match Research & Industry, this year, all conferences in the Research to Practice programme will be presented by a two-person team including a researcher and a manufacturer, whatever the issue at stake. A various offering, meetings and exchanges, an organization to welcome visitors as best as possible… the qualitative aspect prevails to the organizers, as can be seen in their communication and initiatives. “We almost exclusively work on a profile of global top managers, and the show’s trademark is also to gather major contractors, who are deeply involved in our event,” Franckie Béchereau claims. As a matter of fact, the Chanel, Johnson & Johnson, L’Oréal, LVMH Research, and Shiseido groups have subscribed to Open Innovation this year. This service has always been part of the show: it makes it possible for major brands to select and meet people who have set up innovative global projects and pre-subscribed on a dedicated online platform: 250 projects were submitted this year. The Greentech-sponsored Business Contact Area will provide a privileged place to exchange for enhanced meetings. As the showcase for Made in France products and services, this year again, the show will host the WICCS, the international clusters summit on common cosmetics projects, as well as many international delegations from Taiwan, Japan, China, and, for the first time, companies representing South Korea and the United States. Lastly, the event will be punctuated with the Awards attributed for each Expert Route by a jury of professional press journalists and the Gala dinner organized at the Pavillon Cambon Capucines."
Digital beauty: Schwan Cosmetics forges ahead!,"Premium Beauty News - What happened in Berlin last July? Bernd Preuschoff - Our first ""BeautyThon"" took place from 23 to 24 July 2017 at the Mindspace and Rocket Tower in Berlin. The goal was to reflect on new digital business models in the beauty industry and offer participants their first platform. On the theme ""Beauty on the Run"", several teams consisting of startup experts, fashion and beauty bloggers, technology-savvy and employees of Schwan Cosmetics developed their ideas in different fields, like for example on the theme of mobility. In order to stimulate their pioneering spirit, participants first took part to highly focused workshops and debates. Premium Beauty News - Two intense days! Bernd Preuschoff - On the first day, teams of up to five participants were brought together and introduced to the subject, and they were also given a mission to help them find and develop their ideas. These missions must above all be centred on the user offering him a solution that he will adopt in his daily life. On the second day, with the help of coaches, the teams worked on a business model and an idea, and created their first prototype. They were also trained on the project pitching session. As part of an Open Pitch, the teams then presented their ideas to a jury including Dr. Karas, the CEO of Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics. At the end of the evening, a prize was awarded to the team who had presented the best digital solution. Members of the winning team will have the opportunity to develop their idea with the support of Schwan Cosmetics. Premium Beauty News - With your company now thoroughly involved in these subjects, what will be the next step? Bernd Preuschoff - The cosmetics industry is an exciting field which, compared to other industries, is still in the early stages of its digital development, which therefore leaves room for innovation. As a market leader and a leader in innovation, Schwan Cosmetics is well positioned to play a pioneering role in the sector. We want to make rapid progress in this area with our customers, partners and employees. In 2018, we also intend to broaden the circle of the BeautyThon participants to about a hundred (currently 40)"
Pennelli Faro: How an innovation is born,"What leads to the development of an innovation? Sara Zanafredi - Pennelli Faro has been on the market for almost fifty years. We are among the world’s leading manufacturers of private label brushes and applicators. We started in the field of Fine Arts, where the combination of shape-hair-colour-technique in the brushes has always been very sophisticated and where the variables affecting the result are numerous, at least as many as in the field of cosmetic brushes. That allowed us to develop a sensitivity and technical precision making the difference. The daily direct contact with the production department, located close to the technical offices, allows us to control the production process at every step but, most important, to give wide space for creativity and innovation. We go from the original idea to real-time prototype with all the advantages of testing, modifying and finding the best and most performing solutions. The R&D and Marketing departments, constantly updated on application and technical specifications of cosmetic products, aim at combining technical performance and ease of use to meet the needs of the most advanced formulations. What are the strengths of Pennelli Faro in developing an innovating project? Sara Zanafredi - Shape, materials and the Made in Italy. Each project is designed considering the ease of use and functionality for the end user, not forgetting the aesthetic component: made in Italy is also recognized for this, for style, for detailing. That makes a difference. First of all, the shape. A cosmetic brush developed by Pennelli Faro is an ergonomic and functional tool becoming almost an extension of the hand, an invisible guide to rely on, because we are aware that people using it, whether expert or not, expect to see in the mirror, a perfect result.  That’s why functional design is so important and starts from the study of ergonomics of face, hand and gesture. The shapes have the purpose of making the brush an element in synergy with the formula of the makeup or skincare product it is used with, and allow the user to have an intuitive and immediate application experience. However, the shape and design of the brush are closely connected to the selection of materials. The company’s investments are focused on the research and development of new dermatologically tested avant-garde fibres, perfectly meeting the needs of new consumer trends, with unique textures and finishes. The study of details and the possibilities of personalization, in terms of selection of materials and finishes, are so large that it is possible to make every brush a unique tool created specifically for each cosmetic brand. Last but not least, the production made in Italy. The manufacturing of Pennelli Faro brushes takes place at our headquarters. Proximity makes the passage of information very fast. This allows us to create the right project at the right time and not as standard product. Each brush is personalised and modifiable in the development and production phases, together with the client, in dedicated sessions.  The team constantly innovates the production system and operates on controlled procedures that guarantee the best technical performance. The continuous interaction between R&D, Commercial, Marketing teams and our production department facilitate an exchange of information and feedbacks that the customer provides on every detail of the project, even those that are hardly describable on a technical document. Is it also a way to increase the confidence with the supplier? Sara Zanafredi - Of course it is! Pennelli Faro works with the most important national and multinational brands and remains under the company’s policy behind the scenes of each project. Innovation is almost completely reserved and often patent-protected, and is shared with clients in a dedicated and direct way. What were the latest innovation projects that Pennelli Faro worked on? Sara Zanafredi - An excellent example of the very tight relationship between R&D and Production is one of the latest born lines, origami®, launched at Cosmoprof Bologna 2017. In the development of a brush like the origami® Prisma and Infinito ranges, the design, shape and line of the brush are functional to the ergonomic application of the cosmetic product because they are pre-shaped to perfectly follow the facial features. Thanks to multi-faceted shape, even the less experienced consumer can apply makeup professionally. To date we have focused on applying products to create the makeup base, but the origami® project is still evolving. Another example is Dermocura®, the most innovative synthetic fibre patented by Pennelli Faro. It is a unique fibre, dermatologically tested, constantly evolving and with endless potentialities and combinations. The study and control of the technical features of Dermocura® synthetic fibre allowed us to develop and make available to our clients the perfect imitations of natural hair. Similar in terms of aesthetic appearance and ability to respond well to the products they have to apply, but with significantly better characteristics, performance and durability. Also, I think of Soft & Full® synthetic fibre made with extremely silky and dense tips that guarantees 30% more density than a normal synthetic filament with the same volume. It is the most performing fibre to get extremely natural degradation effects and is very pleasant on the skin. Would you make some anticipations about the innovative projects you are working on? Sara Zanafredi - (She smiles.) No, it is all top secret…"
Vitamin C: Latest beauty trends,"This month, US department store Barneys unveiled its firstever exclusive Korean beauty launch in the form of Vitabrid C12, a hair and skincare line created using a brand-new proprietary Vitamin C complex called Vitabrid CG. The brand claims the new complex is capable of delivering active Vitamin C continuously for over 12 hours. The vitamin is absorbed deep into the skin and scalp to fully exploit its potential. One of the challenges beauty brands face is that pure Vitamin C naturally degrades when exposed to oxygen, rendering it difficult to develop products that deliver skincare benefits over a prolonged period of use.  But earlier this year, Clinique introduced its innovative new ’Fresh Pressed’ skincare system, which tackles the problem by offering individual sachets of Vitamin C cleanser in water-activated powder form to maintain freshness. The line also includes a ’Daily Booster’ serum that comes in seven-day vials to safeguard against degradation. Tatcha’s new ’Violet-C Radiance Mask’ contains not one but two types of Vitamin C for extra impact — a water-soluble
version that absorbs quickly into the skin and an oil-soluble kind that provides more longterm protection from UV damage. Japanese beautyberry, which is a Vitamin C stabilizer, also features on the ingredients list."
A Messenger chatbot well-versed with perfumes,"Now that the most popular social platforms (Facebook Messenger, Skype, Whatsapp, Telegram, WeChat...) have opened their doors to them, conversational robots (chatter robots, or chatbots), able to exchange with a human on a precise matter, are gradually becoming more familiar to the largest possible number of people. Main advantage: they are instantly accessible, from the messaging that most owners of smartphones use every day, without it being necessary to download any additional application. Sommelier du Parfum belongs to this new generation of tools much appreciated by millennials. Its objective: guide its users in the choice of a perfume, for oneself or to offer. ""It is actually the first question asked by the robot,"" explains Samuel Fillon, its creator. The chatbot then uses several other criteria to define the ""olfactory profile"" of the person for whom the perfume is intended: man or woman, other favourite perfumes, types of smells that we like (citrus, woody, etc.). ""The vocabulary used by the chatbot is very accessible, jargon-free. Everyone understands what a citrus note is, while it is not the case when talking about hesperidia notes,"" highlights Samuel Fillon, who started this project during his studies in Machine Learning at the University of Tokyo, as part of his training as a civil engineer (Ponts et Chaussées school). ""Before my departure for Japan, I found myself a bit lost when wanting to offer a perfume to my brother for his birthday. I knew he liked the smells of some of the shower gels he used, but that was of little help in the shop in front of the salesperson for whom my inquiry was obviously too vague."" In fact, the chatbot uses a database of more than 30,000 references of crowdsourced perfumes retrieved from data available on the web. Each of these 30,000 references is indexed according to its female/male positioning, its main olfactory notes, its retail price, its appreciation by perfume critics, its creator, etc. Knowledge definitely out of reach for ordinary human beings! Not to mention that, in the course of its conversation, the chatbot learns to better know the tastes of his interlocutor. Once the olfactory profile and the tastes of the recipient of the perfume are defined, the chatbot proposes a series of recommendations: ""for next summer, winter, for work or in the evening."" Detailed information is available for each proposal, and a store locator enables to spot the closest location to test the suggested products. Perfume experts will probably feel confused by the robot’s proposals, but unquestionably, it brings an element of fun to the relation with the customer, and yet without breaking the human relationship because it facilitates access to the perfume market. A tool, which will appeal to both retailers and brands. It can be adapted to the specific needs of different players and also gives access to many consumption data. To note: The Sommelier du Parfum chatbot will be presented at the Fragrance Innovation Summit organized by Premium Beauty News next July 5th in Paris. Details: here."
Bon Parfumeur outsmarts the codes of perfumery,"“It is an approach for those that are more relaxed about perfumery. For those who, like me, have a lot of them and enjoy changing,” Ludovic Bonneton announces straight away. The concept is based on 15 really varied fragrances classified in 10 olfactory families identifiable with a code. Every perfume is identified with a number composed of three figures and a colour. The first figure – the hundreds column – and the colour indicate the olfactory category. The 000 category is that of colognes, 100 represents floral perfumes, 200, fruity fragrances, and so on. The figures after the hundreds column refer to the order of appearance in each family. For example, the 601 perfume is the first created in the 600 family, that of woody fragrances. Most importantly, the three main notes in every perfume are clearly displayed. Not the top, middle, or back notes, but those the user will obviously recognize. As an example, the 601 fragrance announces ‘pepper, cedar, patchouli.’  “People just love it. These three notes help start a conversation. They search for pepper, cedar, or patchouli, and they do recognize them. It arouses their interest,” Ludovic Bonneton asserts. Now, that is an atypical approach to perfumes and consumers. Here, dreams and mystery are replaced by didactics, by another form of discovery that is direct, simple, and frank. “We endeavour to be part of this wave that awakens things, this interest for a sense that has been forgotten, in a way, but in which everyone is actually interested. It is a bit like what was done with the ‘bistronomy’ or ‘eating well’ movements to which access was opened, and which did correspond to a certain curiosity or interest from people.” That is why Bon Parfumeur fragrances bank on affordability and logically boast an affordable price range: EUR35 for 30ml, for a brand that is still positioned on the niche perfumery segment. Juices are all composed by French perfume creators (Alexandra Monet, Benoît Lapouza, Corinne Cachen, Karine Dubreuil, Nathalie Koobus, and Philippe Romano), who share both sophistication in their compositions and the use of beautiful raw materials. “I do not impose any limits on the perfume creator, I only ask them to search for what is best,” Ludovic Bonneton assures. It seems this new perfume dimension has found an echo. Launched in June 2016, Bon Parfumeur opened their first wholly-owned store in late December, Rue des Francs Bourgeois, in the heart of the Parisian Marais Quarter - a Mecca for alternative perfumery. The brand is also present at the Bon Marché Department Store and in over 70 points of sale similar to concept stores, all around the world (Tokyo, Los Angeles, New York City, London, Dubai…). “We are trying to settle in pretty places, where people already have this sort of curiosity for innovative concepts.” New references are to be launched before summer, including a very sensual amber-based perfume, a solar floral, and a new fragrance in the “special” category. “We are set for a long story,” Ludovic Bonneton promises."
Chanel launches the first cream with camellia micro-droplets,"Following the launch of the Hydra Beauty Micro Serum in 2015, and Hydra Beauty Micro Gel Yeux in 2016, the launch of the Hydra Beauty Micro Crème marks a new step in microfluidics innovation by Chanel Research. ""This development met many formulation and manufacturing challenges. Adapting the micro-doplets technology from a liquid to a creamy texture, proved very difficult. Once again, technological limits have been pushed further back,"" Christian Mahé, General Manager of Chanel Research Beauty and Innovation, told Premium Beauty News. For this new development, Chanel Research teams have partnered with the French start-up Capsum.  Capsum offered its expertise in microfluidics, Chanel its formulation know-how and its industrial expertise The first challenge: producing a microfluidic cream for packaging in jars.  Since the droplets are delicate and evanescent, their resistance has been enhanced in comparison with serums in airless packaging, without losing their unique sensorial profile. The result: droplets do not burst when they are scooped out of the jar but only when the cream is applied to the face.  The joint Chanel and Capsum team has managed to create gel droplets that are both evanescent and high-resistance, but also visible to the naked eye in a cream. The second challenge: producing a smooth texture through the microfluidic process.  Hydra Beauty Micro Crème combines visible and invisible droplets stabilized by ""molecular velcro tapes"" for remarkable application comfort. The joint Chanel and Capsum team has managed to integrate a sensory cascade in this cream, where the fresh feeling of water is followed by the richness of the oil. The third challenge: blending delicate and evanescent droplets into the cream.  To achieve this, a new manufacturing process had to be devised to blend the droplets into the cream without splitting them while ensuring homogenous distribution. Machines and production lines were thus tailor designed to manufacture Hydra Beauty Micro Crème. Microfluidics make it possible to manipulate fluids with high accuracy at a micrometric scale. At this scale, capillary forces prevail over gravity. Thanks to a system where the flow is controlled and high, it is possible to shape droplets one by one and control their size. This accurate calibration produces an emulsion whose structuration is more orderly than with conventional technologies. Droplet stability is secured by a complex coacervation process which combines two polymers interacting together in the manner of ""molecular velcro tapes"" to form an evanescent membrane. The result: droplets in which a new high value-added fat-soluble active ingredient is protected until application. These perfectly calibrated and stable droplets burst instantly upon application with outstanding moisturizing efficiency for the skin. As they burst on the skin without leaving any residue, these droplets create an unparalleled sensory experience unmatched in traditional emulsions, as well as a new aesthetic. ""This is an example of successful co-development between Chanel and a start-up,"" states Christian Mahé. ""This microfluidics innovation platform is capable of broadening the scope of possibilities (new technologies, new visuals, new textures…) to develop tomorrow’s cosmetics"". A new innovation is already expected for 2018."
The best of make-up innovation in 2016,"Premium Beauty News - The sector is truly dynamic! Chantal Riols - We must of course thank all the industry professionals for having played the game so well but also all the jury members for their participation. A huge thanks to Florence Bernardin, Pauline Bonnafous, Serge German, Charles-Emmanuel Gounod, Gérald Martines, Jean-Louis Mathiez Luisa Oliva. And concerning industry professionals, we most really congratulate the Companies who were the most innovative and regularly took part to the contest. I am thinking in particular of Albéa, Alkos, Aircos, Cosmogen, Faber-Castell, Gotha Cosmetics, Intercos, Strand Cosmetics. Premium Beauty News - And among these two hundred new products can some emerging trends be identified? Chantal Riols - Certainly! Thus, pell-mell, we can note the predominance of the metal effect, of highly pigmented formulas for long-lasting colours. Note also sophisticated decorations, on all surfaces, like for example and for the first time around a lipstick tube and a sponge. Note also the development of versatile products for the complexion, the lips and ingenious applicators for lip glosses and liquid formulas. Natural ingredients are also increasingly present. New gestures for conventional packs such as compacts. Fine and very nice new powdery textures and innovative gels for the lips and perfumes also. The jury was impressed by these new brow tattoos and their innovative applicators to tint them and set them. As for packs, we saw the development of 4 in 1 applicators combining several accessories or formulas. Innovative changes were also noticed in baked powder based formulas. Finally, everyone could appreciate the makeup shade with fluorescent formulas for lips that are revealed in the dark. Premium Beauty News - And of course in 2017, you are continuing? Chantal Riols - Absolutely! And I would like to take the opportunity to announce that the first call for products will be launched as of January 15, 2017 for exhibitors to MakeUp in Seoul. Moreover, while competing products are actually tested by our international experts, all IT Products will receive a certificate for their selection."
’Diamond nails’ the new Korean beauty trend made for NYE,"The latest Korean beauty export is an update on its predecessor, the ’shattered glass’ nail, which involves placing individual pieces of cellophane onto the nail to create the illusion of broken glass. The diamond nail is thought to be the result of a similar technique, using glittery holographic ’shards’ for an even more eye-catching, 3D result. Leading the trend is Seoul’s Unistella Salon, owned by manicurist Eunkyung Park, whose Instagram feed offers plenty of inspiration for fans of the look. While Park’s mesmerizing video shows off the concept to its full effect, users such as @son_unni and @hee_unistella have incorporated just one or two ’diamond’ feature nails into black lacquered or pale pink manicures in a nod to the trend. Park has yet to reveal exactly how she created the diamond nail, but back in 2015 she shared her technique for the shattered glass nail with Teen Vogue, explaining that cutting up candy wrappers and setting with a gel polish was the secret to the look. It’s a concept that can be easily adapted with holographic cellophane for a glittery New Year’s Eve beauty look that will ensure all eyes are on you at midnight. Shine bright!"
Aroma Zone launches its own green nail varnish,"Given the growing insistence of its consumers for plant-derived makeup and well-controlled cosmetics compositions, the French brand, a naturalness and DIY standard, has designed a nail varnish range based on bio-sourced, plant-derived solvents and pigments. 100% vegan, the range also excludes all the components deemed problematic by the most uncompromising consumers: toluene, formaldehyde, phthalates, synthetic camphor, rosin, and xylene. Traditional solvents are replaced by a botanical base derived from potatoes, manioc, corn, and wheat. These components are transformed into alcohol by fermentation, and then into solvents with green chemistry processes. It is also the first nail varnish exclusively based on plant-derived pigments. For red and pinkish shades, synthetic and mineral pigments, and pigments derived from mealybugs are replaced by others extracted from red radish, pink sweet potato, and elderberries. Blue shades are obtained thanks to an extract from spirulina, a microscopic alga rich in phycocyanin and endowed with excellent antioxidant properties. Rich in seven ‘standard’ colours from Beige to Plum, and also featuring a base/top coat, the range should soon offer new colours. Entirely made in France, the products will be sold starting from January 2017 for the keen price of EUR 2.90 to EUR 3.50 for a 6ml bottle. Based on this innovation, Aroma Zone also offers the possibility to make our own plant-derived homemade nail varnish, with all the advantages of a personalized creation. As simple as ABC, the formula is made and combined in five minutes only, with the same plant-derived solvent and pigments, or even mineral pigments for sequined, pearly, or iridescent effects. All the elements are sold separately for a cost price of about 1.2 euro for one nail varnish bottle, but you will need a precision balance, a graduated pipette, a tiny whisk, and a bowl as well. Then, everyone needs to get motivated and show enough patience to compose naturally."
Le P’tit Sniff: towards a new approach to blotters?,"As an animation and promotional tool in points of sale or for launching new products, or even a training tool, “Le P’tit Sniff” offers a new olfactory experience and is positioned as an alternative to traditional testers and blotters. “It has many advantages,” explains Valérie Pasmanian, co-founder of the product, with Michel Pozzo, the inventor of the OlfaCom technology. “It is clean and does not saturate the atmosphere, so that it considerably improves the quality of the ambient air in perfume stores. It is very easy to use, and it only takes a few seconds to replace a perfume cartridge, which makes it possible to test plenty of products. Its design and decoration can be personalized, so they can be adapted to any brand’s codes.” The removable cartridges inserted in “Le P’tit Sniff” are developed based on perfume concentrates, so the result is just exemplary. The OlfaCom technology of ventilation on dry material diffuses perfume by only pressing the device’s activating button with the finger. “It is a playful instrument that is interesting for training activities or launching operations,” adds Valérie Pasmanian. The diffuser was actually used by the Van Gogh & Sesame candle brand at the first edition of the Alternative Fragrance show, last June in Paris. “At a show where we cannot light candles, ’Le P’tit Sniff’ was an opportunity for the brand to offer visitors a very rich olfactory experience.” According to its creators, “Le P’tit Sniff” meets many different practical needs, and a lot of application solutions were examined, mainly in the professional field. The first industrial pre-series will be showcased at the Made in France show on November 18-20, 2016, in Paris. “Its design was reviewed and its shape is more regular, so it is even easier to personalize. Other improvements were made: for example, the batteries were replaced by a rechargeable battery with a mere USB socket, which enhances its portability and ease of use,” Valérie Pasmanian concludes."
Connected cosmetics: A manicure that doubles as your subway pass,"Fashion student Lucie Davis, a BA Jewellery Design undergrad at London’s Central Saint Martins school, has come up with a way to do just that. Her ’Oyster Card Acrylic Nails’ project features a stylish manicure that also doubles as an Oyster card - the travel pass used to get around the UK capital. The concept works thanks to an RFID chip taken from an Oyster card and hidden in one of the acrylic nails, allowing the wearer to simply touch their way in and out of the London Underground. The set of falsies, which are painted in the same blue and white pattern as the card, to drive the point home, can also be topped up in the same way as a traditional pass. Davis was inspired to create the nails for her final project about the way we engage with our daily surroundings, and immediately thought of her city commute. ""I was hoping that this idea would make everyone’s next commute a little more thoughtful and enjoyable rather than our usual mindless ones,"" she told WAH Nails. ""I like to think of my work as a 21st century update to the traditional keepsake. It’s about finding a fresh new perspective on things, providing more meaning in a world we may take for granted and (hopefully) changing the way we think in a positive light."" It might be conceptual for the moment, but this is one wearable tech trend we could really get behind."
Procos adapts its packaging offer to the new challenges of online shopping,"""Packaging is a key element of the purchase online experience,"" says Leander Kritokos, president and founder of Procos.  “Putting the packaging and its opening at the centre of the experience is a key factor of success,” he adds. To maximize satisfaction during the online shopping experience, the high-end packaging manufacturer for luxury markets in fashion, perfumery cosmetics, decoration, jewellery, wine and spirits, is extending its highly customized product portfolio into packaging for online distribution.  The moment at which the customer receives and opens a parcel allows a brand to differentiate itself from another and create a unique shopping experience for the customer. “Luxurious companies have a strong relationship with their customers in retails stores. The firms invest in their employees, time and tremendous costs to create their unique brand look: The retail stores share a special atmosphere, in the way they are build, sound, smell, feel and how the shopping experience for their customer is enhanced. This special look makes this brand distinct from another brand.  Shoppers accustomed with these in-store shopping rituals will expect the same high level of care given to their online orders,” says the company. Providing consumers, when they receive the products they ordered online, the same sophistication than during shopping in brick-and-mortar stores is definitely an asset to retain very fickle customers. Every project is handled with special care to identify usage and possibilities in order to support the brands’ corporate identity. Furthermore, in line with the company’s practices, Procos also adapts to the new demanding distribution constraints like weight, carbon foot print, suitable for transportation, etc. In the case of the box developed for ""Ma Beauté Luxe"", the high-end beauty box service of the L’Oréal group, Procos devoted several years to design of a light box, easy to handle and able to contain variable size products and sealed with as adhesive pre-inserted in the packaging."
Manicure pens and fluorescent lipsticks: the latest innovations from MakeUp in Paris,"One of the main highlight of the show was the now famous ""Innovation Tree"", which unveiled 28 new products. These included ""Eyebrow Designer"" by Bomo Trendline, a system that allows users to dye their brows by combing them with a brush. The paraben-free colour lasts up to 24 hours and can be removed with a regular make-up remover. Additional makeup solutions also included ""Moonlight Kiss Fluo Lipsticks"" by Alkos, which provide lips with fluorescent brightness while protecting and moisturizing them with vitamin E, and the ""Spacy Art & French Pen"" by Bomo Trendline, a manicure pen containing more than 18 colours. Also noteworthy are the “Fruity Lip Scrubs” by Strand Cosmetics. These transparent scrub balms are formulated with vitamin E, bisabolol and grape seed oil, to gently exfoliate the lips and visibly embellish them. Again for the lips, the gel texture of the “Jelly Baby Lipgloss” line by Faber Castell Cosmetics offers a pure lips and glossy appearance. The clear and bright balm moisturizes the lips and the pen allows an easy and precise application. Innovative formulas also provided a talking point, with Gotha Cosmetics’ ""Bi-Metallic Eyes & Face Color Veil"", a refreshing gel texture that creates a light veil over the eyes or face, and the intensity is variable like a stroboscope.  The supplier’s ""Color Igloo And Pearly Color Igloo"" product, a series of powders which stimulate the senses upon application and which come in four different shades, also featured on the Innovation Tree. For the nails, Polychromatic - Keystone showcased the “Aphrodite Collection”, a complete beauty treatment formulated with a patented technique featuring lipid microspheres with encapsulated vitamins and biodegradable ingredients (vitamin E, keratin, Arginine and tea tree oil). In terms of packaging, future innovations could include the ""BeautiLock Airlight Compact"" by Eurovetrocap, a compact box with a patented sealing technology that ensures tightness efficient air with less than 1% weight loss for solvent based products and water, and ""Beaded Lipgloss Pack"" by Toly, designed for beaded lipgloss and featuring a pearl grinding pump."
"Attract One Expert, Cosmogen’s new generation skincare applicator","A few months after the launch of Attract One, Cosmogen is presenting a new evolution of its patented applicator. As a matter of fact, Cosmogen has adapted its patented magnet and metal ball system on a tube with a valve.  The new system allows the distribution of the formula and permitting the valve to open by pressure of the tube, while maintaining the attractive power of the magnet on the ball. Once the pressure on the tube is released, the valve resumes its position and ensures sealing, preserving the formula from risk of contamination, whether during application or during cleaning with water. The removable and washable Ø12mm ball-applicator provides a skin contact surface that is three times more than a conventional roll on applicator. A second patent protects this new technological challenge. “Attract One Expert combines the precision of movement, the benefits of massage and the properties of the formula. It is fully customizable and could be like a jewel. It fully caters to the image of prestige care brands,” says the company. Attract One Expert is particularly suitable for skincare application around the eyes or the mouth.  It has been designed for an intuitive use by any kind of consumers.  “The ritual is to distribute the right amount of the formula and then apply it with circular movements on the areas to treat.” Cosmogen suggests that in the morning the applicator is passed under cold water - or kept in the refrigerator - the cold ball-applicator then tightens, tones and de-puffs the skin. “In the evening and when passed under hot water, it facilitates penetration of the formula, contributes to cells oxygenation and regeneration, and relaxes the skin.” Technical features:   – Tube Ø19mm ; Capacity: 7 to 20 ml
– Sleeve: PE Mono or multi-layer, Alu-multifoil
– Cap: PCTA
– Holder PP
– Magnet : Neomydium
 - Ball : Ø12mm, nickel free stainless steel. Patented distribution system.

Lancaster broadens the spectrum of sunscreens,"Born under the sun of the French Riviera in 1946, Lancaster is celebrating its 70th birthday this year.  On this occasion, the brand is raising the bar on sun protection with the introduction of Full Light Technology. In 2012, the brand had already completed the traditional protection against UVA and UVB by a protection against infrared radiation; a key factor of skin’s premature aging.  Lancaster - a brand of the Coty Group - is now addressing the entire solar spectrum. “UV rays represent less than 10% of the sun’s rays, while Infrared rays and visible light represent over 90% of the sun’s radiation and can reach the deepest layers of the skin, accelerating premature aging. Despite this, traditional sunscreen’s only offer UVA and UVB protection,” explains the brand. According to Lancaster, each wavelength in the solar spectrum corresponds to perceptible damage to the skin: UVB rays are responsible for sunburn, UVA rays accelerate skin aging and disrupt proper cell balance, and infrared rays damage dermal collagen and elastin fibres, which in the long-term leads to a reduction in the skin’s firmness and elasticity. As for visible light, for many years scientists thought that it did not have any harmful effect on the skin.  However, Lancaster claims that years of scientific research have allowed lifting the veil on its real impact. “A creator of free radicals, visible light causes cell dysfunction, which contributes to accelerated skin aging,” says the brand. To address this issue, Lancaster’s Full Light Technology targets 100% of the sun’s spectrum by simultaneously absorbing, reflecting and neutralizing the different waves in the light spectrum, thus minimizing their harmful effects on the skin. Lancaster’s Full Light Technology features a patented combination of UV filters to absorb UVB and UVA rays, along with the visible light in the solar spectrum, and a reflective complex, made of ruby powder and Bioactive Glass spheres, that reflects each wavelength and thus forms an invisible shield on the skin’s surface. Eventually, Lancaster has selected powerful antioxidants (including green coffee, bitter orange bark, pongania and green tea extracts and sea buckthorn berries) able to neutralize the free radicals induced by the entire solar spectrum."
"“Data speed up the development process of perfumes”, Guillaume Bourdon - Quinten","If one aspect of perfumes still makes people dream, it is their creation process. Brands are definitely aware of this, so they put their perfumers in the spotlight, like authors in their own right. It is quite hard to imagine what part Big Data can play in this creative process; and yet, they are actually gaining importance, without devaluing the strength of creativity, according to Guillaume Bourdon. Quinten is already working with major cosmetics groups and three great perfumers of the industry. “We contribute to perfumes’ development and R&D by speeding up the development process, helping the perfumer focus on his own creativity and artistic direction,” the Director explains. During the competition phase, the process developed by Quinten makes it possible for the composition house to meet brands’ requirements by capitalizing on the work done by all its creative team over about two years. “We work on a database provided by the company, which gathers data from the two previous years. It corresponds to more than 200 formulas, each of them containing 100 to 150 ingredients at various doses. Analyzing these anonymized, encrypted data enables to identify the two or three common ingredients which, if they are combined, can generate the same sensorial perception and optimum satisfaction,” Guillaume Bourdon specifies. “We just seek the best internal practices.” Thanks to its algorithms, Quinten finds the winning formula to develop products corresponding to market expectations. In addition, the company provides a smart tool to the trade expert in the form of an application to make it easier to exploit the bank of results. This very concrete dimension of the use of data has been gaining widespread acceptance among companies. “Whether it be for various industries, insurance, the media, or cosmetics, our job is to work on an operational issue to generate value, by concretely enhancing the performance of the phenomenon of interest,” Guillaume Bourdon comments. Indeed, three perfumes among the ten best sellers in the world were designed with the help of Quinten. Within the broader Big Data debate, the expert drums out the importance of determining three elements before collecting any data: the issues, the stakes, and the objectives. “The idea is not to make information available at all costs, but to help a company implement the strategic changes induced by the data,” he concludes."
Geka combines emotion and technology with new make-up applicators,"At the Cosmopack 2016 tradeshow, Geka showcased a series of innovative applicators conceived to match with the 2017 spring summer trends identified by the company. The new endlessSPHERE mascara brush promises “impressive volume, fantastic lengthening and silky shine in black.”  Thanks to the patented Hypno cut with three volume zones, plenty of mascara is absorbed and evenly applied to the lashes. The triangular shape of the brand-new EOSdelta fibre separates the hairs perfectly. The brush was presented in a new packaging in rosé-gold with a shiny bottle and a matte cap, thanks to a special additive in the master-batch. The other mascara brush launch is focusing on 3D volume effect.  Thanks to Geka’s patented sandwich technology, and the new lashLADY mascara brush precisely lifts lashes, while the transparent, super-fine bristles reach the finest lashes and encase them with the mascara.  The packaging is gleaming metallic. The new lip gloss applicator softDEFINITION offers the possibility to achieve a sensuous shimmering finish. It allows the lips to gleam in an “exquisitely soft pink.”  The spatula evenly applies the creamy texture with the flattened side. Then the tapered applicator conjures up an ultra precise contour. The cap provides a nostalgic and futuristic look with its brand new individual marble effect master batch. Eventually, the smoothLEAF lip gloss applicator offers to create a shiny wet look. “Super flexible and ergonomically formed, it fits perfectly to all lips. Thanks to the bi-injected 2K wiper with its hard material on the top and flexible material on the base, formulas are perfectly dosed while achieving a secure grip inside the bottle,” explains Geka.  The applicator is presented in a heavy-walled injection blow moulded squared bottle with metallic cap in matte rosé-gold. On the same occasion, Geka Accessories, a wholly owned division of the Geka Group, presented: a cosmetic bag made of polyester, tweezers in stainless steel that help to get eyebrows in shape thanks to their integrated comb, as well as a handy metal mirror with a fluted pattern on the reverse."
Expanscience diversifies its offering with a first slimming active ingredient,"Made from maca, a small plant known for its invigorating properties that grows on the Andean plateaus, Macaline combines three effects: it slims by shedding fat and limiting fibrosis in the fat cells; reduces puffiness by strengthening the blood vessels’ structure and improving microcirculation; and firms the skin by restoring the dermal matrix. Clinical trials have been conducted on 33 women of normal BMI (Body Mass Index) to prove the active’s efficacy.  “After the subjects used a cream formulated with Macaline for 56 days, we observed a 31 cm3 reduction in thigh circumference, a 44% increase in temperature consistency compared to the placebo, and firmer skin tissue,” says Armelle Le Peniec, Director of Cosmetic Active Ingredients at Laboratoires Expanscience. Furthermore, Macaline is an eco-designed active ingredient. To produce it, Laboratoires Expanscience decided to give priority to endemic species by exclusively using maca leaves from the plant’s area of origin - Latin America. As a result, Expanscience sources maca leaves from Peru and encourages respect for traditional farming practices: the land is cultivated for two years then left fallow for the next ten. It also helps producers with their economic and social development in conjunction with its local partner. The maca supply chain is overseen by the commitment standards of Laboratoires Expanscience’s “Responsible plant supply chains.” As part of this and our other supply chains, Expanscience’s sourcing practices are subject to evaluation by the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT), of which Expanscience has been a member since 2011. With the launch of Macaline, Expanscience has rounded out its line of cosmetic active ingredients with a product devoted to body care.  “After developing the segment of active ingredients for the face, we wanted to revitalize the body and hair care segments,” says Armelle Le Peniec. Launched in France during the Cosmetagora exhibition, Macaline has already attracted a number of customers, according to the company. “To help customers make plans for this active ingredient, we also developed a ready-to-use formula made with Macaline that is designed to inspire their creativity,"" adds Armelle Le Peniec."
The big data revolution is well underway in the cosmetics industry,"Will it soon be possible to enhance, with the help of computers, the perfumer’s expertise? Assist his nose to consistently design successful fragrances? In theory, the principle is simple: use huge databases (of raw materials, sensory perceptions, consumer preferences) and combine them, using powerful algorithms. Yet who could seriously imagine that the creator of the next Chanel No. 5 – or, in another area, that the author of the next Guernica - could be an algorithm? We must always be prepared for surprises with Google, who already creates paintings – sold up to 8,000 dollars – with the help of intelligent machines, but then, replacing artists by statisticians is another story... Nevertheless, massive data revolution is already well underway and the perfume-cosmetic sector is not lagging behind. ""The scope of application of big data is very vast, from banking to perfumery and it can address such matters as fraud risk or business growth, like for example the appeal to products,"" explained Patrick Zerbib, a zettafox co-founders, a start-up specialized in knowledge extraction from large amounts of data using machine learning technologies. With a background in management consulting, Patrick Zerbib is convinced that big data is ripe ""to move from being predictive to prescriptive."" The aim being to respond precisely to the strategic issues of companies. The analysis of massive databases has long been used for descriptive purposes (in national statistics, for example). With advances in IT and the over-abundance of data retrieved from new technologies, companies are increasingly seeking to predict consumer behaviour. And once reality has been well described and future scenarios anticipated, it is then very tempting to want to take action. ""Beyond prediction, the prescriptive dimension of big data is all the more interesting that the implementation of tracks identified with predictive analysis can concretely be materialized,"" emphasised Patrick Zerbib. His method consists in collecting large amounts of characterizing data, to best identify all the elements likely to influence consumer behaviour. ""We therefore never limit our analysis to our customers’ internal data, we always integrate external data."" zettafox also conducted analyses in the perfume sector to maximize the sensory perception of a fragrance. ""For example, to maximize the clean smell effect delivered by the fragrance in a soap or a detergent or to optimize the technical impact of a general public fragrance. Our role is complementary to the one of ’noses’ and their subjectivity, by bringing statistical objectivity."" For this, zettafox relies in particular on the data collected by fragrance houses during the consumer tests they have been consistently conducting for years. In such cases, we are far from the huge amount of data, usually associated with big data, we refer to it more as Smart Data - high value data but in small quantities. Algorithms must therefore be able to compensate for the relatively small amount of available data, which includes on top of it, a very large number of variables. ""Our algorithms will select variables in order to set up combinations, formulation scenarios, likely to maximize the desired sensory experience,"" detailed Patrick Zerbib. Scenarios that can also be tested. The algorithms developed by zettafox have also been used to optimize fragrance formulas. ""The aim in particular, is to compact the formula by reducing the number of ingredients used while maintaining the same impact."" Algorithms can target combinations that maximize the olfactory aim and remove ingredients that reduce or have no olfactory impact. With these scenarios we can then work on finding the most effective formulas from an economic point of view, the most cost effective or the easiest to implement. ""In the case of perfume formulas, the additional challenge is that we work blindly,"" added Patrick Zerbib. ""The composition of formulas is kept secret, which means ingredients are coded, we don’t know their names. It is the customer who then decodes our results."" In theory data mining can be used in an unlimited number of areas. For instance, zettafox has applied its techniques to sampling distribution or to the transformation rate in duty free stores. One can very well imagine using specific algorithms to maximize the impact of a packaging, the texture or the sensory accuracy to a product. Provided the necessary data is available! But when companies specialized in this area are called upon it is often because companies have already started collecting data and - overwhelmed by the flows - they need to structure them. Arranging and processing all this amount of data obviously represents the bulk of the task. Especially since the very principle of big data is to integrate data, which at first seems totally unrelated. While, on the one hand, most companies and brands do not have the storage infrastructure nor, a fortiori, the appropriate processing technologies, they can still get help. On the other hand, companies must learn to increase their contacts with customers to collect as much data as possible. For manufacturers, the challenge is clearly not to leave this knowledge in the hands of distributors alone, who will not share it."
"Doe Eyes Brush, Albéa’s new double-sided mascara brush debuts in Los Angeles","Doe Eyes Brush, the latest creation of the Albéa Tips Studio platform, is a plastic double-sided brush with an amazing design, specifically conceived to mimic the makeup artist’s specific touch. The circular grooves on one half of the brush allow to load the lashes and to lock in curl, while the comb side distributes the product for intense volume and perfect design of the lashes The Doe Eyes Brush allows either to apply the mascara formula on top of lashes like a professional, or to opt for a more traditional makeup. Albéa’s Doe Eyes brush acts as a lash tool and will be showcased for the first time on the West Coast during the MakeUp in Action event at the Quixote Studios in Los Angeles on 3-4 February 2016. The Tips Studio is the platform that brings together Albéa’s expertise and experience in makeup applicators, from fibre or plastic mascara brushes to lipgloss, eyeliner and other beauty tips. Thanks to their own innovation and development methodologies, the Tips Studio teams get a perfect knowledge and understanding of women’s needs and expectations as well as of the latest market trends.  Rapid prototyping methods have also been deployed to enable the production of new brushes in reduced time.  Every year, Albéa launches about 20 new applicator designs and prototypes. Albéa offers complete brush and bottles for mascaras and other makeup products through its global production facilities (US, Europe, China and Brazil) and integrated injection, assembly, decoration and surface treatment tools."
FrenchTech breaks the codes of cosmetic innovation,"Presented last October at the Cosmetic 360 show, I-feel Beauty won general approval for the Technological Innovation Award. The principle is based on the “IoT-C”, the Internet of things applied to Cosmetics, which combines both technology and actives in the same box. The latter is composed of a four-product range – face and body care products with premium formulas highly concentrated in 82% natural ingredients – and of the Activ’feel device, which acts in synergy with the products by creating bipolar micro-currents and providing a LED photodynamic treatment. “We wanted to find a safe way to get through the dermis and powerfully enhance our actives’ efficacy,” explains Christophe Bianchi, founder and CEO of parent company Feeligreen. The micro-currents stimulate the synthesis of fibroblasts, collagen, and elastin, and contribute to carrying more of the actives contained in the products into the upper layers of the epidermis. Activ’feel is connected via Bluetooth to the Feeligold application installed on a smartphone to control and supply the current strength depending on the information collected. “This technology helps consumers enhance the efficacy of the treatment, customize it, since each protocol varies according to the skin type or the area covered, and obtain the data collected to develop a tailor-made skincare offering, if they allow for it,” adds Christophe Bianchi. That is actually the point of the connection. After essential data have been collected via the application with each diagnosis, they can be used by consumers to meet their customization needs, or even by brands, which will be able to enhance the innovation process and provide targeted and personalized solutions by getting involved in the system. Stanislas Vandier and Jean-Roch Meunier, the co-founders of Wired Beauty, were also willing to place consumers at the core of the innovation process when they developed MAPO, the first tailor-made connected beauty mask. These unique silicone masks are based on a picture of the user and on the 3D vision of her face. They comprise cutting-edge sensors and mainly fulfil two functions: measuring hydration and the skin temperature – the data are transmitted to the application installed on the smartphone – and boosting the effect of the cream applied, whatever the brand. Again, the data collected belong to the users, who can choose to share them with a brand so as to have access to product references adapted to their profiles. “We are paving the way for a new, completely personalized era in cosmetics routines,” comments Stanislas Vandier. The Figure solution developed by start-up Romy, one of the sector’s pioneers in these UFOs, adds something more to the possibility of establishing diagnoses via the application and customizing products: it shows a high yield of actives. Just like the Nespresso model, the Romy technology consists of a device (Figure) – a real home laboratory – two capsule collections, the bases for obtaining the right textures, and the actives, at a concentration of 0.2ml – and all this without any preservatives. The single-dose form of this technology patented in collaboration with Professor Gérard Redziniak makes it possible to use the ingredients at an exceptionally high concentration. Once the analysis of the personal data has been carried out in real time, the application recommends the most appropriate choice of actives, and Figure immediately takes care of preparing the skincare product. “Romy foreshadows a new approach to the use of most sophisticated ingredients, making them available to consumers,” explains Morgan Acas, who co-developed this innovation launched last September with Thomas Dauxerre, after five years working on R&D. If these innovations became available for presale a few months ago, they have already found their own public on the main French and global markets, despite a high entry-level price point: 350 euros for the I-feel Beauty box, 199 euros and 590 euros for MAPO mask and Figure pre-orders. “We attract a certain profile of consumers, 30-45-year-old women with a high purchasing power who are receptive to technologies and seeking differentiation and personalization,” specifies Morgan Acas. As they are all aware it will be crucial to organize an efficient distribution circuit and a well-adapted communication campaign, they have already been working on improving both technologies and products so they can be quickly available. No doubt this approach will soon become widespread."
Yves Rocher creates a complete range for the iconic Riche Crème,"This absolutely cult product is sold every five seconds in the world, so it deserved particular attention. “We had to change it all, without changing anything. We wanted to preserve this loyalty relationship with our customers, but also make the range evolve to attract new women,” explains Xavier Ormancey, Head of R&D at Yves Rocher. Riche Crème has become a complete range, as it now counts eight products, instead of only two before. The formula has been renewed in accordance with the Botanical Beauty® expertise and the latest Yves Rocher research on assimilation by bio-affinity with plants with the skin. The formula is still based on the complementarity of 30 precious vegetable oils with essential constituent fatty acids, but it now also integrates five new substitutes, including the Anatolian thousand-rose oil, which acts on cell renewal. The flagship anti-aging range promises to nourish, protect, and rejuvenate mature skins. It is composed of the 100% plant-derived Beauty Elixir, the Comforting Anti-Wrinkle Lotion, a Day Anti-Wrinkle cream and another night cream, the Intense Regenerating Care cream, the Regenerating Balm Intense Nutrition, the Comforting Anti-Wrinkle Eye Cream, and the Regenerating Body Milk. The new design preserves the brown colour code brightened up with gold that is specific to the Riche Crème."
Aptar’s Note revives the sensuality of perfume application,"In order to address the slowdown in the fragrance market, especially in mature markets, Aptar Beauty + Home relies on innovation. “We need to entice, surprise and re-inspire through ideas that, above all, are focused on the consumer experience,” explains the company. With Note, Aptar brings us a new way to experience fragrance, blending intimacy, elegance and sensuality.  The dispensing expert has reinvented a timeless technique from an era when fragrance used to be applied to the skin with a delicate, simple finesse using a glass stopper.  It is this delicate touch, which has all but vanished to give way to the spray but still lives on in the collective memory of brands and consumers alike, that Aptar Beauty + Home wants to revive. Note is a transparent applicator. Each time you open the cap, the applicator fills itself automatically, ready to apply the fragrance gradually through capillary action upon contact with the skin. Note offers a gentle and gradual application in all the right places.  “In this respect, it is also in line with modern trends, where the consumer is in control, choosing the dose and where to apply it,” explains Sabine Bouillet Lubot, Strategic Marketing Manager Fragrance at AptarGroup.  “We especially recommend Note for highly concentrated fragrances, such as eaux de parfum, elixirs, absolutes, intense perfumes, and extracts,” she adds. The applicator has been tested with consumers in four countries (France, China, Brazil and China).  According to Aptar, it has always been highly appreciated. ""Including in Brazil, where consumers are used to apply  perfumes very generously, Note is perceived as very suitable for night applications."" In order to ensure consumers can appreciate the full Note experience, Aptar Beauty + Home recommends including some application tips: Use Note to apply fragrance by dabbing it on the pulse points. For varying levels of seduction, apply behind the ears all the way down to the nape of the neck, your wrists, and your neckline. If you want to leave a thrilling scented trail with each and every movement you make, apply to the crook of the elbow and even behind the knee. To illustrate the extent of possible design options beyond the stock product, Aptar Beauty + Home worked with design agency Servaire & Co who studied five possible tracks: vegetal, writing, compact, key. Also illustrating the possibilities of this innovation, Note has already been chosen by Dior, one of the most prestigious French fragrance brands, it for its leading line. “This unparalleled technique makes J’adore Touche de Parfum an absolute technological gem. We were blown away by this new system for applying fragrance and knew right away that it was a perfect fit for the product we were developing. We needed a new application method, something different than that of a traditional fragrance. In other words, a highly feminine and precise touch. On top of that, we were looking to make a bottle for women on the go, for them to carry in their purse and reapply at any time throughout the day,” explained the team behind J’adore by Parfums Christian Dior."
Nails Inc. launches world’s first spray-paint nail polish,"The Paint Can requires users to sweep a quick layer of basecoat over the nails before spraying the colour over the fingertips from a distance of 10-15cm, leaving the pigmentation to adhere to the basecoat. According to the brand, a quick rinse with warm, soapy water should then ensure that any excess colour is washed off from around the fingers and nail bed, leaving an even coating of polish. Nails Inc. is branding the product ""the World’s fastest manicure"". ""After years in the making I am incredibly excited to be launching the Paint Can. Our customers have been screaming out for ways to reduce dry time and for quick, easy ways to apply colour when on the go,"" explains Nails Inc. Founder Thea Green on the brand’s site. The invention is currently available to pre-order at nails.inc.com in two different shades - ""Shoreditch Lane"", a mid-grey hue, and ""Hoxton Market"", a deep pink. The retail price is £10 (approximately US$15 or EUR14)."
Aptar creates a new beauty gesture for facial skincare targeted applications,"""In response to the consumers’ demand for more effective products, there has been a proliferation of smart applicators in recent years,"" said Sandra Martins Reis, Strategic Marketing Manager for Skincare & Make-up at AptarGroup. ""However, we were able to identify a series of recurring problems among the skincare pens currently available on the market: they require a two-stage use (to click or turn to release the product before applying it). Furthermore, they only deliver a standard dose, which cannot be modulated, often too important for an expert skincare,"" she adds. In order to solve these problems, Aptar has entirely revamped the pump’s architecture thus allowing adjustable side actuation and continuous formula dispensing. This innovation is equipped with a soft and smooth membrane delivering a bespoke formula dose in one simple press.  The more you press, the more you get. Skin Master is also equipped with three standard tips for three different types of application and three sensations on the skin. – Velvet touch, an elastomer applicator recreating the massaging effect of the finger.
– Cool touch, made of zamak, for a cold sensation that helps to stimulate microcirculation.
– Icy touch, a ceramic applicator producing a ice-cold sensation that is the ultimate ally of products targeting the eye contour area. All three applicators are flexible, allowing optimal control of the application. Thanks to its piston airless system, Skin Master guarantees a high rate of product delivery while ensuring maximum protection of the formula. Eventually, Skin Master can easily be customized by brands. Aptar offers brands the opportunity to create their own applicator designs in order to guarantee the relevance with their own formulas. Skin Master also provides numerous decorations for bespoke finishes: plastic or metal shell finishes and a range decoration options including anodization, colouration, silk screening and labelling."
Mimesis: Perfumes soon to scent salon ambiences,"In France, there are about 80,000 hair salons, half of which are independent. And although the barber shop trend has shown both a real potential for diversification and need for differentiation, perfumes are not sold on this gigantic network. “Our objective is to manage to do with this channel what a few skincare brands did with pharmacies about thirty years ago: providing a new offering that will not eat into anybody’s market share and will generate additional sales,” Corentin Le Men explains. Within a harsh economic climate that particularly affects the stagnating hair market, it seems a daring challenge. But again, the Mimesis co-founder can see an opportunity here. “To resist against the crisis and withstand the competition of discount brands, many salons are going for premiumization. And our offer is perfectly suited to this trend.” Especially since, from a marketing standpoint, perfumes seem to be an ideal complement to hair care products. If the latter are very technical and need a certain expertise, they are little aspirational. By contrast, perfumes tell stories and make people dream. Even the technique to sell them is different. “A hair care product needs explanations and arguments. A perfume must be tested, and this does not require much talking, actually,” Corentin Le Men adds. “In a hair salon, where one often has to wait, it is very tempting to test a perfume if there is an opportunity to do so.” And what is more natural than encourage hairdressers to perfume their customers when they are over and done with their hair? Theoretically, these are ideal parameters. “In fact, the main obstacle is the price,” Marion Massiot explains. “At a hairdresser’s, one already has to pay for the haircut. So, we need to remain reasonable as far as spending is concerned. That is why we made the choice to present our perfumes in a 30ml format. Thanks to this small size, we can market high-end products for an affordable price: 34 euros.” To this day, the line counts four eaux de parfum (Le Matin du Monde, La Possibilité d’une Fleur, Le Lit à Baldaquin, Le Guépard), which can be applied both on the skin and hair. The four fragrances were created by Karine Dubreuil. They are presented in a standard bottle made by SGD and topped with a tailor-made zamak cap. To this are added two perfumed hair treatments: a Serum de Parfum to nourish, protect the hair, and give it some radiance, and a Brume de Parfum, a mist, to hydrate and protect it from the damages caused by UV rays. Both these products were designed by Catherine Taurin, an expert in hair formulation, who is also a professor at ISIPCA, the French high-profile international school of perfume. The brand was launched in early September in about forty points of sale in France and is due to open its online store at the end of the month. Mimesis aims to inaugurate about a hundred points of sale in autumn 2015, mainly in Paris and large cities across France, and to become a key brand within the next three years. The brand only targets independent salons, in particular those that have created a boudoir atmosphere or a warm, cosy ambience. Conversely, it also intends to become the number one hair brand of niche perfume shops. Outside the French market, Mimesis will mostly develop on English-speaking markets – the United Kingdom and the United States, to start with – where hair care is already very successful, and niche perfumery is booming."
Axilone: A “One Hand” lipstick mechanism based on simplicity and low production costs,"To provide a solution to the requirements of mass market brands generating large volumes and targeting young female consumers, Axilone has imagined a « One Hand » lipstick.  Its originality: made on one piece, the base and the top connected by a hinge. The design has its advantages in terms of production costs. To use it, simply raise the top and turn the mechanism accessible through a window, all with one hand:  a new, innovative and practical gesture. This one handed manipulation reflects a general trend in behaviour: doing several things at the same time! On the telephone, in the car, while walking, women check the way they look, put on make-up, mascara and perfume [1]. Re-doing lipstick is the task repeated most often. Made in Polypropylene (PP), the lipstick can be finished with a chape metal trimming in aluminium to satisfy the needs of more selective markets. « Controlling the feasibility of packaging techniques, finding the industrial solution internally, and remaining in touch with market needs,  » is the credo of Jean-Paul Dénécé, the company’s Head of Innovation. At Axilone, innovation is an essential feature of any industrial solution. An innovation supervisor appointed to each site and department means that approximately ten employees are directly involved.  Each and everyone must submit “astonishment reports”: remarks and notes on a fact, object, technique, wherever from and appealing to the packaging sector. These techniques are implemented in all the fields of expertise of the company specializing in stoppers and lipstick tubes.  An industrial know-how that covers the whole process or plastic injection moulding and aluminium stamping (design, moulding, production, assembly) and all types of finishings and decorations (anodising, metal plating, lacquering, tampography pad printing, hot stamping, engraving...)."
MakeUp in Paris 2015: a colourful and record breaking edition,"The trend at MakeUp in Paris this year was for bold and colourful products.  ""Whereas Seoul was very focused on innovation and technology, Paris is about bright colours and creativity,"" explains Show Manager and Co-Founder Sandra Maguarian. However, that isn’t to say that the show was lacking in cutting-edge ideas - in fact it featured an installation called The Innovation Tree displaying 22 of the industry’s leading products at the forefront of modernity. Highlights included the Cooling Stick Blusher by Thailand’s S&J International, which uses aqua technology to cool the skin as it is applied, and the Petite Boite à Beauté by MKTG Industry - a re-usable 100% cardboard holder for products such as eyeshadows, bronzers or blushers which can be refilled to minimize the waste generated by packaging. Also featuring on the Innovation Tree was Lancôme’s new Triangle Zone Brush, an innovation developed in partnership with French supplier Cosmogen and which allows users to adjust their desired foundation coverage by altering the length of the brush. Cushion Liner by Pascual Cosmetics is the latest version of the ’cushion’ application trend, offering eyeliner in ’foam’ form for a super sharp application. A new generation of ’Permanent eyeliners’ are also on display courtesy of German company Bomo Trendline. As for formulation, ABC Texture highlighted its Matte Lipstick with a second skin and long lasting effect but free from volatile silicone and therefore not requiring a sealed pack. The Color Shine BB Lip Balm showcased by French company Alkos was another interesting innovation in lipstisck as it combined a SPF 20 and a non-sticky texture. Alkos also introduced its latest Jumbo Twist, an eyeshadow with a creamy texture ultra easy to blend, for up to 15h of longwearing, waterproof intense colour. This year’s show featured 126 exhibitors, the largest number to date, and it also significantly outperformed its previous record in terms of visitors.  Actually, more than 3,200 visitors visited the 6th edition of MakeUp in Paris, according to the organizers, compared to 2,804 last year. The various conferences and workshops organized this year on topics as diverse as connected beauty, emerging makeup trends or the particularities of makeup markets in Brazil and the United Kingdom have attracted a total of 1,200 participants. The “MakeUp in” shows will now head to New York on 09-10 September and Sao Paulo later on 08-09 December 2015."
Nocibé customers can now create their own personalized perfume online,"Web users can play perfumer to create wholly personalized feminine or masculine fragrances by first selecting a type of perfume among five categories available (“sporty”, “glamour”, “sensual”, “natural”, and “feminine” for feminine fragrances, or “sporty”, “charismatic”, “wild”, “manly”, and “dynamic”, for masculine fragrances) and a base note (“classic”, “oriental”…), and then finalizing the personalization by adding up to six notes among a selection of 50. Unique Fragrance has developed an online, large scale version of the mix and match trend some brands have already been riding for a while. Unique perfumers have made sure the six notes selected match and create a true olfactory harmony. “Our experts have developed all the ingredients to produce the perfect mixture with base, middle, and top notes. This way, our customers can easily manage to create their own perfume,” the company explains. Once the fragrance has been finalized, web users can also choose among about fifteen different bottles (rectangle, square, or round-shaped, in transparent, black or red-coloured, or even gold glass, or inlaid with Swarovski crystals) that they can personalize with a message, a name, or even a picture. “All in all, more than 150 billion unique compositions are possible,” Nocibé affirms. Each fragrance is created by Unique perfumers in the Berlin or New York City laboratories. The tailor-made perfumes are available as from 69.90 euros for a 50ml eau de parfum. It takes between 5 and 7 working days to create and deliver them, and customers can have a free second try if they are not satisfied with the first fragrance, or they can be reimbursed."
Walgreens targets the multicultural market with exclusive colour cosmetics line,"Walgreens is launching an exclusive masstige colour cosmetics line that will be available in the dugstore chain top-selling beauty doors across all the U.S.A. as well as at walgreens.com and drugstore.com.  Called Circa, the new beauty brand consists of premium makeup artist quality formulas for eyes, face and lips at accessible prices ranging from USD 8 to USD 15. Walgreens, the largest drugstore chain in the U.S.A. [1], said its aim is to “increase accessibility to well-priced, diverse, specialty beauty offerings.”  The Circa line, which includes 133 SKUs in total, has been designed to address the varied needs of the multicultural market.  The various shades have been selected to “work across the lightest and darkest of skin tones, through the use of high-performance formulations, rich pigments and innovative technologies”. In a demographic context where women currently considered as belonging to ethnic minorities will constitute the majority of the U.S. population within the next thirty years, Walgreens intends to offer a go-to brand for women of all ethnicities.  So, it is not a coincidence if Latina actress Eva Mendes was chosen to help craft the new brand.  “As a Latin woman, it was important to me that we create a line of products that work for all women and is accessible without compromising quality,” she said. Shoppers at Walgreens should be able to catch a glimpse of the screen diva as she is scheduled to make some in-store appearances to launch the first Circa collection. Much more than a Latin icon, Eva Mendes is also an incarnation of the timeless Hollywood glamour.  With Circa, Walgreens also intends to celebrates nostalgia, romance and classic elegance and to tap into the professional makeup trend. Circa will thus cater to make-up artists, offering an online shop where they can buy products at a discounted rate. ""Our customers are continually searching for quality products at an affordable price, and we’re thrilled to offer Circa as part of our ever-expanding portfolio,"" said Shannon Curtin, group vice president, Walgreens personal care and beauty.  ""This collaborative cosmetics line is bringing Walgreens shopper the slice of luxury she’s looking for at a price point she values.” The Circa line were developed for Walgreens by Maesa, a company that specializes in private label and exclusive cosmetic brands for retailers as well as packaging and turnkey products for beauty brands. ""Building Circa was incredibly rewarding, the ability to work with Eva Mendes along with our own team to build such amazing formulas and gorgeous packaging was a true privilege. I know that once people start using the products they will be amazed with the quality and become devoted to the brand,"" commented Renee Ryan, vice president of marketing at Maesa."
Sampling: Arcade launches Easylip,"Easylip is Arcade’s new technology for the sampling of lipsticks.  It is based on a Brazilian patent acquired by Arcade. According to Arcade, “Easylip is a smart and economical way to present a product and advertise a brand.”  In particular, the product can be applied without any applicator. Furthermore, Easylip can be printed in four different colours and two sizes: – Small, 55mm x 28mm
– Large 55mm x 56 mm"
bareSkin: bareMinerals goes liquid,"“The powder or compact format is not adapted to all women. According to a usage and attitude study we conducted in the United States, 66% of women who wear foundation are liquid enthusiasts,” explains Sophie Ifrah, Marketing Manager for France. “We had no solution to offer until now, and we wanted to provide an alternative with what makes us strong and legitimate”. Here again, the new liquid formula of bareSkin™ is composed of mineral pigments coated with jojoba, the whole being in suspension in a base derived from coconut. It combines its coverage effect and brightening power in a mixture enriched with vitamin C and lilac stem cells. “We really devoted ourselves to the formula to obtain a serum foundation with skincare and makeup properties available in 20 shades,” Sophie Ifrah continues. BareSkin™ already seems to have convinced American consumers, who discovered the product in the first semester, as the first statistics “clearly highlight the development of the complexion category”, according to the brand. BareSkin™ was launched in Europe in early September. It is sold alongside a patented applicator brush specially developed for this product in collaboration with Anisa International, the American company specialized in makeup brushes. It is fitted with a container which can collect a few drops of foundation for an even application and adjustable coverage. “This way, customers can make this reassuring professional gesture and have the right tool for an optimum application,” Sophie Ifrah confirms. BareMinerals has benefitted from an exclusive European partnership with Sephora since 2006, and intends to reinforce its presence both on the network and via its online store, the brand’s showcase of expression."
Italian fragrance brand Pro Fumum Roma gets happy,"As it often happens in Italy, this is the story of a family. It began in a small southern village, where the Durante family has been passionately creating perfumes for 40 years. In 1996, their fragrances, which were just local and confidential creations, became a true brand, Pro Fumum, and settled to Rome. Then, the brand has been growing up at a small pace, as the family was eager to preserve its authenticity. The three brothers and one sister, Giuseppe Luciano, Felice and Maria, are managing it. In their laboratory, just behind the shop, they jointly create each fragrance, combining their four olfactory styles. They share a common philosophy: to rely each fragrance to life, to the emotions, the sensations and memories that characterize it. ""We like the simplicity that creates emotion, our scents must reach the heart,"" says Felice Durante. The family manufactures the products using a traditional method as well as finely selected ingredients, mostly from Italy. The 32 highly concentrated (43%) fragrances currently available are based on formulas featuring 8 to 10 raw materials; They last as long as an extract.  They are sold into handmade boxes that include a 100 ml bottle along with a rechargeable one roll and a mini funnel, for a price ranging from 190 to 240 euros. Sorriso, (“smile” in Italian), the latest in the range, features bitter chocolate, bitter orange, vanilla and tropical timber notes. A “gourmand’ fragrance that brings up an unexpected creativity. Beyond the brand’s four shops in Rome, Pro Fumum is available in fifty selected perfume shops in Europe."

Makeup Academy will be exclusively available starting August 2014 at all CVS/pharmacy locations nationwide and online at www.cvs.com/muapro. Prices range from US$5.00 to US$26.00."
Yves Saint Laurent intros ink-like foundation,"This summer, Yves Saint Laurent is promising nothing short of a makeup revolution. On August 26, the brand will launch Le Teint Encre de Peau, which it claims is different from any other long-wearing foundation on the market. Inspired by the architecture of ink, the new product combines a weightless texture with serious staying power. In contrast with other long-wearing foundations, which can sometimes feel heavy, Le Teint Encre de Peau claims a weightless liquid consistency. The formula is based on what the brand calls ""sensorial and volatile oils,"" said to quickly evaporate upon contact with the skin and transform from liquid into solid pigments. The product is also rich in active ingredients (both lipophilic and hydrophilic) which work to mattify and moisturize the skin and ensure the makeup stays in place, even when exposed to heat or humidity. Finally, the formula is enriched with tamanu oil, which contributes to its extremely comfortable feel by allowing it to melt into the skin. Known for its moisturizing properties, tamanu oil contains fatty acids that are similar to the skin’s natural moisture and also contribute to the skin’s luminosity. The result is moisturized skin with a matte finish and coverage that, with its ink-like staying power, remains in place all day long. For this new type of foundation, Yves Saint Laurent chose to introduce an unusual application method. In keeping with the ink theme, Le Teint Encre de Peau comes with an applicator inspired by a calligraphy brush. The delicate slanted tip retains the makeup for ultra-precise application: just dab the right amount of foundation on different parts of the face and then work in the makeup by hand or with a brush. Its practical, anti-drip system also prevents waste (and any potential stains on your shirt before heading out the door)."
OBO: a new way to use perfume?,"With OBO, the perfume can be worn, in every meaning of the word. OBO is a pearl, containing 3 ml of fragrance, worn on the wrist or on the chest as part of a bracelet or a necklace. Simply grasped with the fingertips, detached from its magnetized piece of jewellery and pressed across the skin, it slides on the body to release the perfume. It allows perfuming oneself at any time, up to 20-25 applications on the skin, that’s the Fragrance Wear concept invented by the brand. For its launch, OBO is offering three fragrances created by Anne-Sophie Behaghel and Amélie Bourgeois, from the fragrance agency Flair. The three fragrances mark three times of day: Symmetry, Solar Epilogue, 23: 58. The bracelet with three pearls is sold 75 euros, the pendant with three pearls is sold 60 euros, and each pearl is sold 8 euros.  Thanks to the relatively low cost of the pearl, the consumer can change the fragrances to suit its desires. This is a totally new way to use perfumes that could be created by this type of product. OBO is carried by a group of designers, engineers and perfumers, in partnership with EATS, a kind of garden centre for innovators integrated to the Aesthete agency, led by Thierry de Baschmakoff, who aims to support young designers. First challenge the OBO team: finding the necessary funding for the brand’s development.  As a first step, a crowdfunding campaign was launched through Indiegogo."
"Artist by Nocibé, a professional makeup line under a private label","“According to our concept of Beauté Libérée (liberated beauty), we position ourselves between prestige and a private label with Artist. We wanted professional but accessible makeup for all women in terms of understanding and price”, explains Maylis Grand, Private Label Manager at Nocibé. The range is presented on educational furniture, and structured around the three essential steps of professional makeup application: bases, colours and finish. Shades, changing colour effects, 3D effects… anything is possible for those who take pleasure in the art of makeup. “Nocibé launched its own private label in 2012. Two years later, it now offers 1,200 references in bath products, skincare, accessories and makeup. We are turning towards developing more sophisticated products, such as Anti-aging or Artist by Nocibé for makeup, in addition to the essential, initial and more basic range,” Maylis Grand explains.  “This range offers really good value for money, and to achieve this, we chose to work with an Italian supplier: products made in Italy are matchless in terms of makeup formulation,” she adds. Special emphasis has been put on training sales consultants, who now learn about the art of professional makeup. Consulting and awareness-raising of customers will be relayed through tutorials on the website and social networks. Apart from its 465 sales outlets (almost 600 after Douglas’s takeover), Nocibé also banks on Bellista by Nocibé, its future network exclusively dedicated to private labels, two stores of which are currently under test in Leers and Evry. This specific channel should spread out over the year, as the visual identity of Nocibé sales outlets is being redesigned and standardized. With this new professional makeup line, Nocibé intends to increase its store traffic. “Nocibé is a perfume network above all, which means people come to visit us three times a year on average, therefore we still have many people to target”, Maylis Grand explains."
Axilone: From astonishment to innovation,"Under the management of Jean-Paul Dénécé, innovation at Axilone (turnover: 110 million euros in 2013, staff: 1,825) involves more or less everyone.  An innovation supervisor appointed to each site and department means that approximately ten employees are directly involved. Each and everyone must submit “astonishment reports”: remarks and notes on a fact, object, technique, wherever from and appealing to the packaging sector.  “This is the starting point for a project that will need to be investigated further, and which will require its substance to be enhanced. May be there will be no future for the idea, who minds,” the company says. Jean-Paul Dénécé is eager for an open mind and a 360° inquisitiveness: “if you stick to the trend, you will be doing like the others!” However, there are some limits to this open-mindedness. First of all, it is important not to frighten customers away by being too offset from reality.  Moreover, it is crucial to ensure the industrial solution is available. Regarding the latter, the fact that Axilone provides in-house tooling and electroplating facilities is a real asset. Vaposphere, one of the five patents registered by Axilone in 2013, is a perfect illustration of what this method can produce. At the outset of the development, there is an observation: considering packaging, the users in the 21st century are focused on ease of use and handling. With the cell-phone permanently held in one hand, one is always multi-tasking. The “beauty” efforts are typical of that. While phoning, one is adjusting one’s make-up, freshness, or last minute appearance.  Axilone creative teams are convinced that tomorrow’s gesture will be single-handed. The answer? Vaposphere: a single-handed capping system.  One just has to turn the locking ring with two fingers to open the sphere-shaped cap and activate the revealed measuring dispenser or spray. Closing it is as straightforward :  one counter-rotation of the ring, and the container is locked. There is no risk of an accident.  “Vaposhere is suitable for make-up, care, or perfume products,” concludes Axilone, which showcased this innovation at the latest MakeUp in Paris event, on June 12-13 at the Carrousel du Louvre, in Paris."
"TouchUps, Orlandi unveils a biodegradable lipstick sample","The sophisticated, single-use TouchUps® samples sacrifice neither the application, nor the colour. Patented in the United States, the mini format is a lipstick replica, and is wholly made out of biodegradable cellulose. It can be presented as a case available in different colours, also in cellulose, or cardboard. A world first on the sampling segment. Orlandi chose to present this innovation on the occasion of the FCE Cosmetique tradeshow, as a preview on the Brazilian market, where demand is very high. “Up until now, Brazilian cosmetics brands were driven by growth and could develop without difficulty. Now the market has been getting more sophisticated, which implies they need to differentiate themselves and stand out. Therefore sampling is becoming a real strategy for them”, explains Sven Dobler, CEO of Orlandi. TouchUps® will also be showcased at MakeUp in New York next September."
"“Luxury Carrier Box”, the fusion between a box and a shopping bag","The German company, which produces nearly 20 million shopping bags and 5 million boxes every year, has unveiled its newest innovation on the occasion of the latest edition of the Pack & Gift tradeshow, which was held in Paris on 4-5 June 2014.  The ""Luxury Carrier Box "" (patent pending) combines the practicality of a shopping bag with the sturdy protective qualities of a box. “A true tow-in-one system,” highlights Leander Kritokos, Procos’ founder and president. Besides its elegant design, the “Luxury Carrier Box” offers, according to Procos, a wide range of practical advantages with a focus on the environment: – Space-saving: thanks to its folding system,
– Cost reduction: thanks to its dual function - box and bag - allowing a reduction in confection costs compared with a separate production of a box and a bag,
– Sustainability: thanks to a significant reduction of material consumption and wastage,
– Second life : potential domestic storage unit for the consumer. ""We can save up to 50% materials, compared to a box and bag combination, and at a lower cost,"" says Leander Kritikos. The practicality of this coffret-in-a-bag was also carefully studied, both for transport, storage or assembly. Laid flat at delivery, it can be easily built thanks to the stickers or magnets provided for assembling the box. The bag’s handle is fully customizable, including its material (cord or ribbon), its colour and type of fabrics, thus adapting to the customer’s preferences (carried on shoulder or hand)."
Stradivarius enters makeup market,"The border between the fashion and the beauty industries is known to be thin. Stradivarius has decided to be the next to cross it and to launch its first cosmetic line with a collection focusing on makeup but also including some perfumes. Guaranteed paraben free, the new line includes luscious lip balms in different flavors (melon, tutti frutti, cherry, watermelon), lip glosses in vibrant colors (pink, orange and red), and nail polishes in around 20 shades. Spanish model Sheila Marquez was chosen as the face of this new Spring-Summer 2014 cosmetics collection. The new makeup items will be available in Stradivarius stores from June, at prices between 3.95 euros and 4.95 euros (around US$5.40 - US$6.80)."

Algotherm launches ocean-friendly sun care range,"According to Algotherm, almost 25,000 tons of sun cream are estimated to be spread across the Earth’s oceans every year – about 0.8 litre per second. The problem is, some of the UV filters used to protect the skin from the sun’s harmful rays are suspected of having a negative impact on marine biodiversity, and coral in particular. According to some studies, 10 % of the world’s coral reefs may be threatened by the impact of sun creams. In light of this hypothesis, not only the disappearance of these corals is at stake, but the whole related ecosystem is in danger. For the launching of Algosun, its new and first sun care range for several years, Algotherm decided to deal with this problem firmly, and thus developed a non-ecotoxic formula. “As a marine cosmetic brand, we are obviously one of the first concerned,” explains Stéphanie Motier, Communication Manager. The new range is composed of three sun protection products, an SPF 50+ Age Protect Sun Cream, an SPF 30 Age Protect Sun Lotion and an SPF 20 Age Protect Sun Oil, as well as two after-sun care products, a Repair Moisturizing Fluid face & Body and a Repair Sublime Oil Body & Hair. At the core of the formulas lies a patented marine and plant complex which combines karanja vegetable oil derived from the Pongamia tree (pongamia pinnata) – an Indian tree renowned for its skin protecting and antibacterial properties – and red seaweed (porphyra umbilicalis) exhibiting anti-aging properties thanks to its natural protection against the harmful effects of sun rays. The complex also contributes to the anti-UVA and anti-UVB protection of the products. In order to “limit the impacts on the marine ecosystem”, the Algosun range was formulated only with mineral filters – titanium dioxide and zinc oxide –, and no nanoparticles. The brand also chose not to use any parabens or phenoxyethanol. In addition, extensive research work was conducted to assess the safety of the formulations for the marine environment, and in particular for seaweed and coral.  “The products were subjected to a series of tests destined to verify their environmental impact,” underlines Émilie Simon, R&D Manager at Algotherm. “Among others, we followed the OECD assessment methods to evaluate the biodegradability or toxicity on seaweed, for instance, and adapted them to the marine environment,” she adds. Thanks to the help of the Gelyma laboratory, which is specialized in the study of algae and marine environments, a specific test involving the creation of a marine microenvironment in an aquarium was even developed. In order to highlight and support their own efforts in terms of environmental protection, Algotherm has concluded a three-year partnership with French TV magazine Thalassa, which has been broadcast on the France 3 channel since 1975. A cardboard insert has been slipped into all the products destined for sale to raise public awareness of the problems related to sun care product toxicity for the marine environment, and to support the development of exclusive formulations."
Procter & Gamble gives hair care some volume,"Similarly to other hair dye manufacturers, the Wella Professionals R&D department has been working for several years on its formulas to significantly reduce allergy risks. As a result, the brand has just launched Koleston Perfect Innosense, a variant of their hair dye range Koleston Perfect which contains a different molecule, ME+, as a substitute for the PTD (para-toluenediamine) and PPD (para-phenylenediamine) incorporated in most hair dyes. Ammonia is often pointed out as an allergen but, according to P&G, the molecules responsible for most allergenic reactions are PTD and PPD, though they are inherent to the colouring action. By developing ME+, the Wella Professionals laboratory kept the original molecule that is essential for the colour to remain intense and last longer, but modified its shape, so that the T-cell receptors which trigger the allergy cannot attach to it that easily. This technological breakthrough was rewarded by the ECARF (European Centre for Allergy Research Foundation) quality label, and resulted in the creation of twenty shades, from raven black to platinum blond. This time, P&G Beauty has decided to tackle thin and sparse hair problems with the Nioxin range. The brand has thus developed Diaboost, a new no-rinsing hair care product which they affirm can penetrate deep in the heart of the hair fibre to make it thicker. The formula contains a combination of three actives: caffeine, to stimulate hair growth and increase the hydration rate, niacinamide (vitamin B3) and panthenol (provitamin B5), to reinforce the fibre. Diaboost is only available in hairdressing salons. It can be used as such, or as a complement to six Nioxin products: shampoos and conditioners, or additional solutions. Ultimately, Drynamic, the dry shampoo by Sebastian Professional, now doubles its action with an innovative technology. It is both a hair care and styling product, as it combines the Reset Foundation system, which contains starch and helps get rid of impurities and of the excess of sebum, and the Recharge technology, which relies on spherical powder particles to facilitate the spreading of the product, unlike the usual cubic particles. According to the brand, this makes hairdressing easier, gives volume, and enables the colour to last longer. It has been available in large and travel-size versions in registered salons since last January."
PR Service Graphique and PO Groupe print fragrances,"The two French companies and members of the Cosmetic Valley have presented the new process at the last edition of the PCD tradeshow, which was held in Paris on 5- 6 February 2014.  ""This is unprecedented,"" emphasizes Petra Roth, founder and CEO of PR Service Graphique.  ""This technique allows applying a fragrance directly on the CMYK colour printing, with a extremely accurate reproduction quality,"" she adds. This patented innovation now offered by PO Group opens new perspectives to olfactory marketing, including for perfume brands. Indeed, the fragrance can now be integrated directly onto brochures, greeting cards, business cards, printed fragrance blotters, coffrets, paper flowers … together with the printing. Several brands such as Dior and Lancôme, have already tested it in preview. For instance, Lancôme has entrusted PR Service Graphique the design of an embossed, carved, mobile and scented microfiber insert for ""La vie est belle"". Actually, in order to have a perfect compatibility, the fragrance is not mixed with the ink, but applied after printing. Thus, the paper is not impregnated.  ""The technique enable us to limit undesirable odours, without requiring the fragrance micro-encapsulation,"" explains Petra Roth. According to PR Service Graphique, the process works with all types of papers and cardboards commonly used in high-end printing. However, preliminary tests are required for each fragrance to ensure its correct restitution. The fragrance suitable for the printing is made in France, but the printing itself can be localized in China, depending on the project’s requirements."
An antiseptic mascara brush ,"Premium Beauty News - Initially what goal did you have in mind? Dominique Bouvier - In fact, the aim was nothing more and nothing less than to develop an antimicrobial surface treatment on a mascara brush to ensure a better preservation of preparations during their periods of use and storage, to increase the shelf-life of mascara and reduce or eliminate the percentage of preservatives. This project was developed in collaboration with two complementary businesses, the IFTH (French Institute for Textile and Clothing) and a French manufacturer of mascara brushes. Premium Beauty News - What process did you use and what was its principle? Dominique Bouvier - It was of course the subject of a patent and of a registered name, Purcilon®. The development of this product needed to integrate, not only the characteristics of the formula, but also the ones of the formula’s container and/or applicator. We know that the formula and container are inseparable to preserve the intrinsic qualities of a mascara and guarantee the product’s safe use under normal and foreseeable conditions of use. Without going into the nitty-gritty chemical details of the system, let’s say that the principle consists in depositing on the fibres of the mascara brush an insoluble salt composed of a broad spectrum preservative used as a cleaning solution for eye lenses with a good thermal stability and a large size sodium salt. The brush is then dipped in the cation/anion mixture. The brush is rinsed and dried going through a rotary drying system. To obtain a uniform and as homogeneous as possible deposit, several protocols were developed by varying the speed of reaction of reagents, the stirring rate, the drying time. The homogeneity of the deposit was of course monitored through scanning electron microscope (SEM). The nature of the fibres of a mascara brush and their shape has also been screened to identify which quality enabled an optimum adhesion of the treatment and with no release in the formula. The most appropriate fibre was found to be the smooth polyamide fibre (6.12 PA). In the end we observed that the insoluble salt bind to the filaments and that it was stable, did not disintegrate in contact with water, or in contact with the O/W mascara formula. Of course, we defined and objectified, through a series of microbiological studies the ideal quantity of treatment. We developed a specific protocol to demonstrate in a relevant way, the effects of this antiseptic treatment, on the germs usually used in the so-called “challenge test”. Premium Beauty News - Conclusions? Dominique Bouvier - It is clear that this Purcilon® surface treatment opens new opportunities in mascara preservation, not only because it improves the preservation of the product after opening but because it also limits the concentration and the number of preservatives used in mascaras, thus reducing ocular intolerance. Moreover, it enables to offer wider ranges of shades, without increasing the preservative rate in the formula, some rich pigments are impacted by that, being themselves nourishing substrates for microorganisms; or to safely add nourishing actives in eyelash treatments for a use far removed from the first opening date."
Unilever launches first toothpaste for men only,"“Having a beautiful smile guarantees both professional and personal success.” At least this is one of the main arguments Unilever will put forward in campaigns advertising their latest innovation, White Now Men, a whitening toothpaste formula destined for men only. This is a world first which, according to the group, should contribute to the growth of a dynamic market driven by the increased value given to supply. In France, where White Now Men has been marketed by the Signal [1] brand since the beginning of January, the toothpaste market represents about €450 million, and its value grew by 5 % in 2013 (1 % in volume). White Now Men is based on the Blue Light technology developed and patented by Unilever, and offers instant, temporary whiteness. In practice, users just have to drop a blue pigment onto their tooth surface to neutralize the yellow colouring of teeth and make them visibly whiter after brushing, thanks to an optical effect. This technology already proved effective when the first White Now toothpaste was launched in 2008 as a product destined for the whole family. Then in 2013, a Gold version was added to the range, with higher levels of Blue Light pigments, but it was more specifically targeted at young women. 
“We designed it as a real beauty product whose 50 ml travel size made it easy to slip into a handbag”, explains Alice Jactel, Manager of the Signal brand at Unilever. Unilever has thus decided to target men who, according to the group, have very specific needs in this respect: clinical studies conducted in the USA and the UK have shown that, on average, men’s teeth are more stained and yellow than women’s. And there is a particular reason to this, which is their life hygiene: they consume more tobacco, alcohol, especially red wine, and coffee. And Unilever has another argument: men have different, more pronounced tastes. According to Unilever, demand already exists. Indeed, a Harris Interactive omnibus survey conducted on 480 men in May 2013 revealed that more than 50 % of them already use their own toothpaste, while 29 % share it with the rest of the family. The same study showed ¼ of men would be interested in toothpaste whose taste would be adapted to their preferences. The new Signal White Now Men toothpaste is available in two references: Super Pure was specifically designed to fight against nicotine, coffee, wine and tea stains, and Deep Cool offers a very fresh, lasting taste. Unilever added green pigments to the Blue Light technology, so that teeth can get even whiter and less stained. The point is to guarantee an immediate effect on a sensitive issue since, according to a Signal/GMI study conducted on 420 individuals, men and women alike are convinced their smile is a key element in men’s success. A “cute smile” would even be the first attractiveness criterion for 47 % of women, before humour, style, glibness or bank accounts. In addition, 86 % of the people polled think a man with white teeth is more attractive than others. Unilever is definitely ready to cash in on such demand and go on putting the toothpaste market forward, as it is greatly stimulated by innovation. The White Now range already holds 6 % of the whole French market, and 30 % of the whiteness sector. White Now Men should be sold between €3.50 and 3.60, about 5 % more than the other references of the range. “We do think that, just like White Now Gold, it will contribute to driving the market up,” concludes Alice Jactel."
Serum 7 Renew: is anti-ageing more mature?,"According to Boots, when women reach their fifties the anti-wrinkle problematic gradually turns into a global need to express their vitality. After Serum 7, designed for the first signs of ageing, and Serum 7 Lift for 40-year-old women, the four references in the new Renew range - serum, day cream, night cream and eye contour cream - are intended to reset youth genes with a more thorough action. The term is still pretty taboo in cosmetics; however menopause is perfectly well accepted in this campaign. Indeed when presenting the Serum 7 Renew range, Boots explains it targets post-menopausal women and the specific disruption on their skin caused by hormonal change. The decline in the level of oestrogens that follows slows down cell renewal, which increases skin dryness, brown spots and skin slackening. The protective anti-ageing complex of vitamins A and C, blackberry, ginseng, white lupin and lipopeptides is enriched with a restoring complex of brightening actives, amino-acids, hyaluronic acid and ceramides. The Boots Serum 7 Renew range has been tested on 1,000 women, and thus promises a “real revolution for post-menopausal women”. The new product was launched at the same time everywhere in Europe, including 3,000 pharmacies in France, and the brand appears as a pioneer by targeting a category of women that have been awaiting adapted solutions. Let’s not forget that there will be 1.3 billion people over 65 in the world by 2040."
"SGD, Alkos, Bioplan and Technicaps develop an “anti jet-lag” set","The development of travels, whether for leisure or business, means that travel retail is now an indispensable distribution network that offers strong growth and profitability. “In the next year, the number of airline passengers will exceed 3 billion; for international and local brands, this translates into an equal number of potential buyers to conquer on the ground and in the air,” says SGD. To illustrate the potentialities of glass in the market, the ""First Class Beauty Set"" developed by SGD and its partners features premium products whose formulas and glass packaging were designed for travelling. “Small, convenient formats contain radiance and moisturization boosters that will travel with no restrictions.” The set, which was showcased at the latest edition of Luxe Pack Monaco, comprises three products: – “Ready to Take Off”, a micellar water cleanser held in a protective, travel-proof, plastic-coated bottle, designed to be resistant to shock.  In that case, the plastic coating developed with the expertise of SGD Pharmacy, is both a decorative technique and a way to protect the glass. “Every kind of finish is possible: transparent, opaque, shiny, matte, sparkly, pearlescent or frosted. Screen printing can provide a finishing touch to the design,” adds SGD. – “Soft Landing”, a moisturising elixir serum designed for the rescue of tired skin after a long travel. The formula is packed in a travel-friendly roll-on decorated with a faded spraying that always allows seeing how much product is left.  “The 7 ml mini version of this moulded glass bottle lends itself to many applications for skincare, fragrance and make-up products. Paired with a roll-on ball or spray pump, it is perfect for trial kits and travel kits.” – “Brilliance to Declare”, a creamy pearly eye shadow bursting with shimmering particles The pad printing on the base of the glass jar reveals the exact shade of the formula.  “SGD now offers metallic pad printing, so the colour of the make-up product perfectly matches the colour of the decoration,” concludes the French glassmaker. ""The project was made entirely from standard containers. The aim was to highlight the benefit of small glass formats to achieve a more qualitative aspect to products developed for travel. More generally, small glass containers may be of interest to all high-end take away formats or products for beauty boxes,"" said Gaëlle Verjus, Marketing Manager at SGD. A development that could permanently reconcile travel, luxury and glass."
Promens’ Slidissime: The airless jar combining protection and sensuality,"The increasing use of botanical actives that are sensitive to oxidation, combined with the trends pushing brands to limit or to eliminate preservatives in cosmetic products are making formulas more and more fragile. Furthermore, an increasing number of consumers (40% according to Promens) is reluctant with skin cream jars, which perceived as non-hygienic. While all existing standard airless jars currently on the market are equipped with a lateral or central actuator, standard dispenser or pushing membrane, thus requiring a pressure, Slidissime offers a real new experience. This new gesture, “The Slide”, evokes both the traditional gesture of the hand collecting the cream on the surface of a jar, and the modern movement of fingers on the touch screens that surround us today. The airless jar Slidissime launched by Promens allows cosmetic creams to be released by a simple slide and to remain fully protected. The slide of the finger on Slidissime is similar to the natural gesture of a caress. Slidissime combines pleasurable beauty rituals with airless protection.  The cream dose is obtained by a touch and slide movement. By a simple slide on the membrane, a dose is delivered by the system through its thin hole. Located at the extremity of the touch & slide pump, this hole closes after each dosage, avoiding any air-intake and drying of the formula. The formulation inside the jar has contact neither with air nor with fingers. Slidissime combines the airless pouch technology with a flexible touch & slide pump. Slidissime is an airless jar consisting of a collapsible pouch and an ergonomic flexible airless pump made of 4 parts. It is protected by two international patents. “Conceived with materials compliant with Food Contact EC directive, Slidissime perfectly answers the needs of the cosmetic market and is compatible with most of the formulae,” Promens says. Furthermore, Slidissim accepts a large scale of viscosity, from fluid to viscous creams. Slidissime is available in Promens’ standard collection of premium cosmetic jars. Two references are available: Diamond 50 ml, a luxury jar with thick walls adapted for prestige skincare collections, and Quartz 50 ml, a compact jar adapted for more ordinary skin care ranges. The jar can be coloured, lacquered, metallized or decorated in-house with hot stamping, silk-screen or pad-printing. However, Slidissime is also a tailor-made solution. Actually, the airless jar technology (pouch and tactile pump) can be integrated specifically into any existing brand jar range. It can also be adapted to others sizes."
Aptar launches Serumony and breaks the rules of beauty serums,"Two years is the time it took to Aptar beauty + home to develop this airless stylus dedicated primarily for the most delicate and precious skin care formulas such as: beauty elixirs, radiance-boosting and youth serums.  Furthermore, two big scale consumer tests were used to validate the relevance of the concept and development. Initially, there is a simple observation: serums, which require the precise application of very small product quantities, are usually presented in bottles and applied with pipettes that do not receive full consumer support. “Consumers say they sometimes have difficulties for filling the pipette or get the correct dose and they also complain with the two hand gesture required to use these products as well as with a hardly optimal product restitution,” Aptar says. The solution imagined by the manufacturer of dispensing systems takes make-up pens as a starting point and its design evokes the precision of surgical tools. The ergonomics of Serumony is very intuitive since just one press is enough to deliver the exact amount (70 micro litres) of product. Compact and light, it can be easily carried around and can be to place without risk in a handbag or a travel bag. Aptar also conceived Serumony as a genuine protective case serving as a barrier that protects the formula from oxidation and pollution, throughout its use.  In addition to the optimum hygiene, the airless system offers and excellent product delivery and security against spills. Serumony is equipped with Aptar’s alpha70 pump guaranteeing perfect formula/pack compatibility since there are no metal components in contact with the formula. All the industrial tools having been developed Serumony is ready for market launch. Various decoration options are available, for a full product customization."
How innovation drives makeup,"No less than five roundtables and thirty panellists have succeeded on both days of MakeUp in New York on 25 and 26 September 2013. An opportunity to address the issue of innovation in the makeup industry through avenues varied as ""The interaction between fashion and makeup"", ""Innovation and economic realities"", ""The collaboration between customer and supplier on packaging innovation"", ""Fast to market,"" or even ""The Innovation made in Korea."" For Philippe Jourdan, from research and consultancy firm Promise Consulting Associates Inc., understanding the drivers of innovation of different makeup brands first implies to clearly identify their different territories. According to him, three main categories can be clearly separated: fashion brands, beauty brands (coming from the skin care business), and finally pure makeup brands, often derived from the professional world. For each of these categories, consumer expectations diverge as well as the drivers of innovation. In this context, the influence of fashion is not the same for a brand like MAC, coming from the professional makeup world, and for a brand like Clinique, grown in the skincare field. In any cases, innovation has to face the challenges of reality, with costs coming first.  To which, one must add “time and, more and more often, testing” says Marc-Andre Houx, President, Shya Hsin Packaging USA.  According to him, time is the second key constraint after money. However, Anthony Heraud, Vice President Project & Development, Axilone USA, notes that “better processes, better dosing are costly to develop but can also lower the costs in the end.” Another important factor, according to Nicole Masson, Vice President, Global Product Development, MAC, is globalisation, which is both an innovation driver, when brands need to address different needs, tastes or climates, and a constraint, when they have to comply with diverging regulations. So it is very important, during the innovation process, “to focus on the best ideas and concepts and to concentrate investments on them,” explains Thomas Krasser, Vice President Sales, Schwan Cosmetics, “ After having highlighted the many aspects that can take innovation, including the importance for the makeup sector, of application methods and system of formula protection, Stephanie Martins, Vice President Corporate Development & Packaging North America at L’Oreal, explained how the French cosmetics giant seeks to stimulate the creativity of its suppliers, particularly in the context of Cherry Pack, the event held annually in the group headquarters nearby Paris. For the first time this year, U.S. suppliers have been invited to participate in the event. For his part, John Butcher, Senior Vice President, New Product Support & Engineering at Revlon emphasized the important role of full-service providers when it comes to meet specific market needs or to respond quickly to an emerging trend. Speaking on behalf of suppliers, Charles Chang, CEO of Topline Products, nevertheless recalled that given the amount of money required to innovate, suppliers and customers need to cooperate, exchange information on consumer expectations and strive to limit financial risks. Eric Bone, Corporate Research and Innovation Manager at L’Oreal, said meanwhile that the philosophy of the group has always been to develop the brands it had acquired from the country from which they originated. A means, he said, to preserve the historical links with suppliers and also, of course, to maintain the spirit of the brand. All the panellists, whether brands representatives or their suppliers, also stressed that the time-to-market largely lost in importance when a genuine breakthrough innovation is at stake. “The more innovative is a product, the more flexible the customer is with regard to delays,” Thomas Weckerle, CEO of Weckerle Cosmetics, confirms. For Eric Bone, “product safety and consumer satisfaction are the priority.”  Because innovation involves not only a financial risk, it also carries a risk for the brands’ image. Actually, brands cannot afford to disappoint their customers."
Unilever turns to crowdsourcing for shower of the future,"Considering that showering represents a major part of the environmental impact of its toilet products’ life cycle (due to the quantity of water needed and of energy to heat that water), the Unilever group is asking creative individuals all over the world to submit their ideas and solutions for an environmentally friendly shower at eYeka.com.  The winning submissions will be granted a cash prize and a trip to London to develop the idea. “In-home use is responsible for a significant proportion of the carbon footprint of shower products and with water becoming evermore precious there is an identified need to develop the world’s first commercially viable shower of the future,” says the company. According to Phil Giesler, Vice President, New Businesses Unit for Unilever, the move is in line with taking increased responsibility for the way in which Unilever brands are consumed. The initiative comes after the announcement of a partnership between Unilever and co-creation community eYeka in order to further tap into its open creativity platform across Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Russia and South Africa.  Actually, Unilever considers crowdsourcing (the practice of obtaining needed services, ideas, or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people, and especially from an online community) has the potential to help delivering coherent solutions to complex challenges. Through the partnership, eYeka’s online community of over 250,000 creators will help developing ideas for a number of familiar Unilever brands. “eYeka’s mission is to leverage the world’s creativity to enable organizations and people to create a better future together. This initiative is a tremendous opportunity for our community to have an impact on our environment,"" states François Pétavy, CEO, eYeka."
Avon reinvents mascara application,"Feedback from over 2,000 women is at the base of Avon’s new volumizing mascara, which also required a long development period: six years in the making and 5,000 hours of science according to the company. Main change: the standard wand has been replaced with a multi-dimensional brush (the “Wonderbrush”) that lifts top and bottom lashes from root to tip in a whole new way.  The Wonderbrush fits the curve of eyes and can be used at 12 different angles “for a corner to corner lash transformation”.  According to Avon, the Wonderbrush allows to put 40 percent more mascara to lash, compared to the brand’s traditional wire brush. Product application differs greatly from traditional mascaras.  As the brush can be bent to the desired angle, application from root to tip is claimed “super easy”. ""There hasn’t been true innovation in mascara since the 1950s. We realized there was a need for an improved application process and Avon is changing history by introducing a breakthrough with ergonomics in mind that will change the mascara application experience,"" said Lisa Lamberty, Avon Executive Director of Colour Research & Development. The product is available in two shades: black and brown black."
"Korea, a champion in make-up innovation","With a turnover for the cosmetic market of EUR 9.7 billion, an increase of 10% per year, and more than 700 companies active in this area, Korea is THE country for who wishes to focus on this sector.  “The market is highly concentrated, driven by music, Internet sales, TV shopping where it is very easy with the remote control to select the desired product and have it delivered at home on the same day,” said Forence Bernardin.  Everything goes very quickly in this country where, according to Kim Eun-Hee, Global Vice President Sales & Marketing at Hwa Sung Cosmetics “everyone is very busy, even stressed, but must nonetheless have a flawless look and a relaxed appearance.” Looks are essential. And for that, both women and men take great care of their looks. “Young boys want to look gorgeous, look like actors playing in dramas (Korean serials where men appear very neat, even quite feminine),” underlined Lee Eunim, Vice President makeup value division at Amore Pacific. “Having a flawless look is a sign of politeness,” added Damien Dufresne, makeup advisor for Amore Pacific. The recourse to cosmetic surgery is common practice in Korea and radiates to other markets.  “Korea is the 1st market in the world in terms of cosmetic surgery; operations to recover lower baby eyelids for example, the “charming eye line”, are highly prized,” according to Bernardin.  Having a perfect complexion is very important and women do not hesitate to use between 15 and 17 different beauty products every day.  “The beauty routine of Korean women is one of the longest in the world with an average duration of 30 minutes and with 15 to 17 products applied,” testified Bernardin. Colours used are retained, transparency, brightness are preserved. “In Korea, women have a very sophisticated but discreet make-up, no detail is left aside, while in France, some specific areas will be preferred, like the lips or the eye area. Korean women do not associate to make-up the festive side that French women can see in it,” complemented Dufresne. Foundation in sticks, mascaras with an ultra-fine brush, wet and oily textures, vibrating applicators, BB creams, CC creams: innovations abound on the Korean market, whether in terms of concepts, packages, applicators or textures and are exported overseas.  China, Japan and the U.S. are their main partners. For example Air Cushion, the product proposed by Amore Pacific, consisting of a sponge soaked with a foundation that is picked up with another sponge, generates USD 5 million in sales. “It is a phenomenal success both in Korea and abroad, this patent protected product provides a quick make-up with a light finish, a fresh feeling and good results in terms of skin hydration,” explained Lee Eunim. “The creativity of our teams is constant, we discuss and exchange a lot to improve existing products and launch new ones” underlined JK Hwang the CEO of FS Korea. Quality requirements are also high and the service is impeccable.  “We have a great deal of responsiveness,” added Cho Im Rae CEO of Cosmecca. Development times are short and in line with the constant products renewal.  “Korea is a technology-driven country, products are very quickly available and renewed,” detailed Bernardin. In addition, Koreans have a more global vision of their business, which cannot be separated from service. “Orders are delivered at home just a few hours after the order was placed, and if the client is not satisfied, a person is sent at his home to retrieve it, and this, whatever the day of the week,” explained Dufresne. Korea is revealing itself to the cosmetic world as a land of inspiration and innovation where quality is synonymous with service. “This country will turn out as the key supplier of future years, if it is not already of presently times,” concluded Bernardin"
DuPont and Strand Cosmetics Europe looking for the best brush-formula couples kit,"This is the result of a partnership initiated a year ago that DuPont Filaments, inventor and manufacturer of Natrafil, Strand Cosmetics Europe, a French company specialising in the development in skin care and makeup products, and Louise Wittlich, a German born make-up artist and beauty coaching specialist, have presented on the occasion of the latest edition of MakeUp in Paris (June 20-21, 2013). Initially, their goal appeared quite simple: to find a better balance between the applicator and a makeup product for the face.  However, in the end, thirty different textures were tested:  primers and bases, foundations, concealers, blushes and powders.  These tests gave rise to fifty-six different makeup/brush combinations.  These combinations were evaluated based on numerous criteria, such as coverage, luminosity, wear, brush design, rigidity of the fibres, ease of pick-up and application of the makeup product. The project allowed adapting the composition of the fibres in function of the formulation, in order to achieve the desired powder pick-up or a particular makeup effect.  Four top-performing combinations of brush/makeup product were selected to achieve a flawless, totally natural « nude » makeup effect: – Corrective base AQUAPERFECTION
– IDEAL FINISH powder
– MAGICIEN D’OSE CC cream
– VOILE PRECIEUX powderly blush Anisa International, designer and brush producer, thus joined the project team by bringing their expertise in working the fibres to create brushes that respond to the requirements of the makeup artist. “The innovative character of the four matches between brushes and makeup product has been achieved from the synergies between makeup experts who had the inspiration to share their competencies in order to create a unique database and optimize makeup results by creating a distinctive cosmetic tool,” says DuPont."
New brushes and applicators by Cosmogen,"The five new brushes of the Silkness range were designed for specific applications: loose powder, foundation, concealer, eye shadow with a dual “finish”, eyeliner. “The high density tufts are composed of a fine synthetic fibre with a natural appearance and whose exceptional qualities enable it to adapt to any make-up formulas. Soft to the touch, brushes offers an incredible sensoriality and the result upon application is perfect. For a perfect hygiene, this high-quality fibre is also washable,” says the French specialist of cosmetic brushes and applicators. Cosmogen is also launching Firm’Up, an original package designed for formulas that require a dual function applicator: – On the one side, its fine textured or smooth spatula (SEBS or PE) distributes applies and the formula on the area to be treated with ultimate precision.
– On the other side, its 45° inclined zamac surface ensures the effectiveness of its application: It stimulates micro-circulation, tightens and smoothes the skin, lifts, and smoothes fine lines and facial micro-tensions. The dispensing of the formula is excellent and the cooling effect of zamac provides comfort and pleasure. According to Cosmogen, Firm’Up is ideal for skin care treatments in institutes, and suits perfectly to skincare treatments such as: eye contour, lip contour, anti-wrinkles treatment, spot or D-scar treatment, lip balm... The French company also offers a new addition to its Squeeze’N range consisting in a new application solution for hygiene and care products: Squeeze’N Clean. Its bi-injected and ergonomic top consists of a surface that is covered with flexible spikes, made of thermoplastic elastomer (TPE).
It allows for a uniform application of the formula and then exfoliates and cleanses the face or body while respecting the skin, while providing a pleasant sense of well-being. Like for the whole range, Squeeze’N Clean features a patented open/close rotary head to prevent contamination and preserve the skincare or hygiene formula."
Mascaras: 20 years of innovation,"“Mascara is an area of intense innovation,” announces right away Jean-Louis Mathiez, independent consulting engineer, President of Cinqpats, a company specializing in packaging innovation. According to Mathiez, who has been taking an interest in the mascara market since 1983, the number of patents in connection with the designing of mascara is simply stunning. “As far as intellectual property is concerned, this business looks more like a minefield, which makes it quite complex but also very interesting,” confirms Aurélie Émond, Albéa’s creative marketing & innovation manager. In France, the L’Oréal Company with more than 300 patents on this product, with 1/3 of them coming from the inventor Jean-Louis Guéret, is regarded as the main patent filler in this area. But the French cosmetic giant is far from being the only active player in this market, there are actually more than 2,500 patents filled worldwide, be it for packaging, formulas or for new features, each one more innovative than the last, to apply mascara. All ideas have not been translated into a product, at least not yet. “There are some patents on the use of airless packs for mascara, which have to date not been marketed but that meet requirements for maximum protection of fragile formulas,” explains Mathiez. Even companies not directly involved in cosmetics sometimes file a patent on this product. “Moulinex filed a patent in 1976 for a rotating mascara with a spring. Now, leading electronic manufacturers like Samsung or Matsushita have made their debut in the arena, with some patents on vibrating, heating or rotating systems,” he adds. Competition is fierce and innovation windows are narrow but sufficient to continue to see new products emerging on the market. “Patents from competitors are not necessarily a barrier to innovation, ideas can emerge from them too,” says Mathiez. And it is true that researchers never run out of ideas to offer products that are attractive to women. Products launches carried out since the early 2000s enable to identify some major trends on the materials used for brushes. ""In 2000, L’Oréal proposed fibre brushes reworked with special treatments and cuts for the filaments. It was an immediate success and the group took hold of more than 50% of market shares. Coty, in turn, responded by launching a mascara in the form of a pen with a comb applicator under the brand name Rimmel with as a bonus a 16% market share. In 2002-2003, to challenge patents filed by various actors, particularly L’Oréal, on fibre brushes, appeared plastic elastomer injected brushes. In 2005-2006, dual mascaras swept the market with the possibility of achieving two effects with only one product: volume and well separated lashes, care and colour... As of the 2008s, it is the rise of mascara devices, like vibrating mascaras, launched by Lancôme (Oscillation), followed by vibrating mascaras from Bourjois and Dior… Several brands also developed heated mascaras (patents published) but have not marketed them so far... Today, we’re back to the basics, with more product simplicity and a research focusing on consumers’ core values: easy application and volume effect,” recalls Mathiez. Last year, the market was equally divided between mascara brushes and injected fibre brushes. In addition, some patents on fibre brushes have fallen into the public domain, hence the scope of applications in this segment is opening up again. Launches in 2012 put huge emphasis on volume, but also on the active effects of mascaras. A volume multiplied by 8 with maximized claims for the mascara Volume Glamour from Bourjois who offers a maxi brush, a maxi pack, a maxi formula, maxi precision, a maxi black and volume activator actives. Mega Volume Collagène by L’Oréal, enriched in collagen biospheres and equipped with an extra large patented brush promises, too, a disproportionate volume and a 24h efficiency. But they are not the only ones to ride this trend. There is also Rimmel’s Volume Accelerator with a brush equipped with spikes which are inserted in such a way that they sheathe the eyelashes. Volum’Express, The Colossal Cat Eyes by Gemey-maybelline is equipped with a brush shaped like a curved cat’s tail making it possible to apply some product onto the outer corner of the eyelid thus ensuring a complete coverage of eyelashes. The Mascara Volume Curl & Shock by Biguine with its exclusive curved brush promises to “insure a finish that will cut the breath out of the most perplexed women.” “Volume effect unquestionably represents the biggest demand,” testifies Pauline Starck, Make-Up Business Developer at IL Cosmetics. But according to Albéa’s Aurélie Émond “from one country to another, from one brand to another, the desired make-up result and associated with the term volume is not always the same. In the U.S., volume is associated with a very marked make-up result, eyelashes loaded with product while in Europe the volume will be more defined with amplified eyelashes.” All the sub-contractors who are active in the field of mascara are focused on this theme. Geka launched in spring 2012 a collection, King Size Collection for Eyes with three types of brushes: Super LASH™ with a very high density of polyamide fibres and a large diameter, lashSEDUCTION™ featuring wide spacing between each bundle of fibres for a maximum reservoir effect and flirtaciousEYES™ combining special cuts and innovative fibres. As for Albéa, it got itself talked about late 2011 with the launch of two elastomer-based references shorter than conventional brushes Nano Hollow™ et Nano Disco™ and with a tank in the middle to trap even more formula and ensure a generous application.  Since then, this injected empty brush technology has been diversified into three new brushes, Venice™, Corset™ and Dolce Vita™ allowing in addition to the volume, to get either a better definition, more length, or a better curbing effect.  But they are not the only ones and all of them, be they Mascara Plus, Ancorotti, Brivaplast, Luxcos IL Cosmetics agree on the fact that volume is a recurring request and that the synergy between the brush and the formula is essential to achieve the desired effects."
Shiseido’s new washable base eliminates the need for makeup remover,"The new Fullmake Washable Base is the world’s first makeup base [1] that allows makeup applied over the top to be washed off using only warm water, claims Shiseido.  The product can be pre-purchased from Shiseido’s website “watashi+” since December 12.  It will be made available in usual Shiseido’s retail stores in Japan from early March 2013 (1,050 yens, including tax). The Fullmake Washable Base is to be used after basic skincare steps and before applying makeup. When removing the makeup, it is enough to scrub the face with warm water and the makeup, along with the makeup base beneath, detaches and glide off the skin.  No makeup remover is needed.  “Thanks to the total transformation of the makeup routine achieved by this product, users can feel more relaxed about wearing makeup, knowing that their skin can easily be restored to its natural state,” says the company. While Japanese women have one of the longest daily beauty routine, applying many more products on their skin that any others in the world, they also have become more time conscious, desiring to use their time wisely and efficiently.  “This trend is apparent, for example, in increased interest in achieving optimum work-life balance or making effective use of the morning hours by getting up earlier, known as Asakatsu, or morning activities,” Shiseido explains. A recent study has shown that Japanese women felt that removing their makeup at the end of the day was the most cumbersome step in their entire skincare routine. [2]  Notably, more than 60% of female respondents in their 20s to 40s indicated that makeup removal was a step in their skincare routine they wanted to get done as quickly as possible.  Also, more than 41% of female respondents had gone to bed at least once without removing their makeup, with as many as 21% of them doing so at least once a week. The Fullmake Washable Base uses a Shiseido’s proprietary film-forming agent named Veil Action Polymer, a substance that is hydrophobic to cold water but hydrophilic to warm water.  When blended with warm water, Veil Action Polymer works to detach the Fullmake Washable Base from the skin, allowing the foundation, along with eye and lip makeup, to be washed off. Of course, as a makeup base, the Fullmake Washable Base also helps smoothing out unevenness and fine wrinkles, helps foundation, eye colour, and lipstick adhering tightly to the skin and lips. Shiseido also claims the product spreads smoothly and comfortably on the skin, hydrating it and offering protection from dryness, in particular thanks to its hyaluronic acid content."
La Prairie complements its White Caviar Illuminating Système line,"In September 2010, La Prairie ushered in the age of enlightenment with the debut of the White Caviar Illuminating Système, a three-part collection of formulas targeting age spots, discoloration and pigmentation, perfectly consistent with its focus on Asian markets.  As of January 2013, La Prairie expands the collection to include three new complementary items – White Caviar Spot Treatment, White Caviar Illuminating Hand Cream SPF 15 and White Caviar Illuminating Eye Cream – to target very specific discoloration in problem areas by brightening the skin before, during and after pigmentation problems arise. “Before… by limiting and minimizing the trigger enzyme, tyrosinase, which starts pigmentation deep within the skin.  During… through the use of the most innovative technology and approach to decrease and control excess melanin.  After... existing spots fade and future ones are put on hold with our White Caviar Illuminating Système,” claims the brand. These effect are powered by a series of ingredients such as Oligopeptide-68, a skin-lightening peptide encapsulated in a liposome vehicle, Swiss Garden Cress Sprout Extract, to fade existing spots and prevent future excess pigment formation, and Vitamin C and Licorice Root Extract, a combination which blocks tyrosinase thus inhibiting melanin production to help prevent new spots from forming. The formulas are rounded out with Golden Caviar Extracts, the regal “signature” of the White Caviar Illuminating Système, a source of marine DNA which offers firming and moisturizing qualities.  “The extracts, derived from carefully regulated, environmentally-conscious farmed sources, include Omega-3 fatty acids to help boost the anti-oxidant level of defense in the skin while also promoting firming aspects.  Lastly, La Prairie’s exclusive Cellular Complex of Glycoproteins, Horsetail and Ginseng Extracts helps stimulate the skin’s natural renewal process, moisturizing and energizing with nutrients that encourage optimal functioning,” adds the brand. The White Caviar Spot Treatment comes in a white pearlescent plastic pen (4 ml / 0.135 FL OZ) with doe foot-angled applicator and shiny silver caviar-like beads in a band around the top of the pen (suggested retail price: 116 Euro).  The White Caviar Illuminating Hand Cream SPF 15 is designeed to fight discoloration and age spots and is offered in white pearlescent tubal (75 ml / 2.5 FL OZ.) with a white pearlescent cap (suggested retail price: 116 Euro).  Eventually, the White Caviar Illuminating Eye Cream, which focuses on darkness in the eye area, caused by pigmentation and circulation issues under the eye by targeting the accumulation of melanin and cellular debris (also known as lipofuscin), is offered in white pearlescent jar (20 ml / 0.68 FL OZ) and cap with silver caviar-like beads in a band around the cap; also includes accompanying silver spatula with round caviar-design handle (suggested retail price: 278 Euro)."
Lush moves away from traditional make-up codes,"The Emotional Brilliance range consists of 30 products all of them ""vegan"": lipsticks and eyeshadows, two eyeliners, a mascara, a face powder and two primers. What strikes first is the packaging line. Lipsticks, eyeshadows, eyeliners, and even the mascara all come with the same glass vial with an identical black cap. Only the shape of the applicator fitted to the cap will vary depending of the type of product. At Lush we were explained that this choice was made intentionally in order to reduce the packaging’s environmental impact. ""For the Emotional Brilliance collection, a packaging was necessary. However, a considerable effort was made to ensure that this range had a minimal impact on the planet"" Actually, everything is recyclable except the applicator, which can be removed to be discarded or reused by the customer. Aside from the fact that glass is one of the most easily recyclable materials in the world and that it can be washed and reused, Lush also explains this choice for practical reasons. Firstly the transparent glass vials make the choice of colour easier at the time of purchase, and then during the time of use, they enable to check the quantity of product left. Moreover, as these vials contain 8g of product - against usually a capacity of 2g for a liquid eyeliner - Lush underlines the economical aspect of these vials. The caps to which are attached the disposable applicators were designed by Lush. They are manufactured locally at Poole in Dorset (UK), where the company is also headquartered. They are recycled from the black jars used in the Lush skincare ranges. Finally, the list of ingredients appear on a ordinary label, which is maintained to the bottle with a elastic hair rubber band, that the consumer can use to retain her hair during make-up applications. Nothing is lost at Lush! Only the packagings used for the translucent face powder and the two primers differ because they are proposed in 20g jars (glass again), with a black cap. As far as formulas are concerned, both lipsticks and eyeliners come in a liquid form. Main advantage of this uniform presentation, the possibility to have standardized packagings, and for the user to be able to play with textures. But beyond their colour, Lush chose to emphasize on the skincare benefits of its products, all of which contain at least one active ingredient. The lipstick formula, with a pending patent application, uses the super emollient base of the Lush Superbalm, a moisturising balm consisting of a simple mixture of organic jojoba oil, candelilla wax and rose wax. As for the eyeshadow base, it consists of a soothing infusion of rose petals and softening almond and jojoba oils, of glycerin and cupuaçu butter, with emollient properties. Eyeliners are made of the same base used for the eyeshadows, with the exception of the two references Independent and Fantasy, developed to adhere faster and elaborated with an antiseptic and slightly astringent infusion made of eyebright, a plant with recognized virtues for the care of tired eyes. For mascara, the key ingredient is wheat grass, rich in vitamins and minerals. For the translucent powder it is jojoba oil, and for the primers, it is a mix of almond and jojoba oils, of cocoa butter and orange blossom. Finally, Lush is just as off-beat when it comes to marketing! The brand partnered with the hypnotherapist Lady Helen Kennedy, to develop a list of words "" that could affect mood and behaviour"" through their ""power of suggestion"". In practice, each Lush outlet is equipped with a colour wheel, inviting customers to choose three colours matching three words from a list presented to them. This is how, according to Lush, each women will make her choice according to her own state of mind, rather than because of a trend or fad chosen by someone else. For those who are not convinced, the colour wheel trick is not an obligation."
Omum wants to create the skincare segment for mums-to-be in selective retail,"The new brand offers for this, a small range of four products specially devised for pregnant women: le Cajoleur (a protecting and nourishing soap), le Bienfaiteur (a hydrating lotion for the body), la Surdouée (an anti-stretch marks oil) and la Confidente (a massage cream). Each reference, with an evocative name, corresponds to a specific ritual and a specific need of future mothers: the fight against dry skin associated with hormonal changes inherent in pregnancy, the prevention of stretch marks, the massage of the belly. As for the choice of soap, it is a response to the tendency of pregnant mothers-of being suspicious of shower gels, and return to soap. Enriched with shea butter, coconut oils and wheat germ, the soap is produced by cold saponification to preserve its rich glycerin content and remain perfectly gentle to the skin. Originating from a demanding process, all products are organic certified according to the Nature & Progrès standard which has a reputation of being the most stringent on the French market. The formulas do not contain essential oils.  In addition, the three anhydrous products are preservative free. And to better meet the needs of mothers-to-be, the brand is advised by professionals of the maternity and child care. The range should see the addition late 2012-early 2013, of la Délicieuse, a milky infusion for the bath, inspired by the Japanese ritual of nuka. ""I wanted to create a different skincare brand, that would reintroduces emotion in motherhood and meet the needs of modern and vibrant pregnant women. I wanted to offer ourselves some pleasure and opportunities to cultivate a relationship full of tenderness and joy with baby (and dad!), with safe and effective skincare products,"" explained Marie-Pascale Ballet. Omum is already distributed in France, in some fifteen outlets, and in Italy in the perfumeries of the group la Gardenia. The brand will take part to the next edition of the Cosmeeting Beyond Beauty Paris trade show in September to find new partners."
Pascual creates a surprise with a transparent lipstick and a non-sticky gloss,"Pascual, a French subcontractor and private labeller, located in the East of Paris region, is a newcomer in the full service business for makeup products.  However, its cosmetics division, founded in 2010, is already making a buzz. ""After several months of intensive and coordinated work between the R&D, technical department and a raw material supplier, we achieved the industrialization of both a transparent lipstick and a green gloss,"" explains Simon Pascual, owner and manager of the company. The transparent lipstick is available in several colours, can be with or without glitters, and with or without added fragrance.  Pascual claims its product is highly moisturizing and has sun protection factor of 15. The product was showcased for the first time at the third edition of the MakeUp in Paris tradeshow,on June 21 and 22. So far, only a few transparent lipsticks have been marketed already, but Pascual’s product enjoys the advantage of a particularly smooth texture, while being robust and difficult to break. In order to add a playful feature to the product, Pascual has inserted in the packaging a device illuminating the stick when used. ""The many people who tried it during their visit to our booth, including representatives from major brands, were unanimous in their comments. The product is considered as very pleasant, with a beautiful shine and a beautiful look,"" adds Simon Pascual. As a result, negotiations are already underway with several brands to put the product in the market. So, stay tuned! The other innovation presented by Pascual at the MakeUp in Paris show, was a so-called “gloss green” that has been very successful too. The product boasts a wet and moisturizing effect, but more importantly, it does not stick, unlike other glosses on the market.  ""In short, that is the end of the unpleasantness of hair sticking to the lip. Once again, professional visitors who tested it, had the opportunity to get confirmation these claims are fully substantiated."" Icing on the cake: half of the ingredients in the product com from a natural origin. For two years, Pascual has been investing about 1 million euros in its equipment, with an annual capacity of 12 million lipsticks, and 5 million cups of heated and moulded products. The company does not intend to stop now and is launching a new nail polish filling business, which will be operational starting October 2012, with a capacity of 15 million products per year."
"Eisen, at the cutting edge of pencil sharpening!","It was displayed a little ""under the counter"" during the last MakeUp in New York trade show but the new pencil sharpener UpsideDown recently unveiled by its designer and manufacturer Eisen, was already on everyone’s lips. ""It all started from a simple observation"", explained officials of the German firm. ""When a woman sharpens her cosmetic pencil with a conventional pencil sharpener, the only thing she can see is a heap of blackish pencil bits of no interest gradually building up on the blade. In addition, she doesn’t even see the pencil lead she is sharpening."" The trick therefore was to design a pencil sharpener with a hole on the other side of its base, a hole sealed by a kind of small transparent window (which can be used as a ""magnifying glass”) and through which the user can clearly see the pencil lead being sharpened, while all the ""waste bits"" accumulate on the other side of the blade to fall into a specially designed compartment. No more waste then to keep women from seeing the pencil lead being sharpened, on the contrary they have gained excellent visibility and can control the exact size of the lead they have in mind. ""So simple ... but yet so terribly clever! ""  In addition, Eisen engineers have developed a cleaning tongue that fits perfectly in the overall design of the pencil sharpener and which has the advantage of being perfectly prehensible with two fingers."
Boots Laboratories launches the first SPF 50 Dry Oil,"In the area of solar products, oils are now highly valued by users for their spreading, transparency and water resistance properties. Often seen as the product symbolizing the joys of sun, they had however the disadvantage of displaying a moderate protection against UVB radiations and a greasy finish. Launched last year by the laboratories of the Alliance Boots group, the Boots Laboratories Solei range could already boast being the first comprehensive broad-spectrum UVA + UVB and UVA protection range with an advanced UVA protection. It included at the time 15 references for the face and body, with a childcare and after-sun offering, and SPFs ranging from 15 to 50+. The range was already offering two versions of dry oils displaying SPFs of 15 and 30. In this area, it was Vichy, with Capital Solaire, who had managed to renew the offer during the year 2011 by proposing a product with an SPF 40, already offering at the time a high efficiency against UV radiations. But this year, Boots goes further by launching in early March on the French market The Solei dry oil sun spray with a very high SPF (50+), coupled to a five star protection against UVAs, that is to say with the highest achievable ratio to date. The formulation consisting of chemical filters, with an optimized dosing to meet the desired claims, features a blend of emollients coupled with alcohol to provide a non-greasy texture and ensure non-comedogenic properties to the product. A patented antioxidant complex consisting of vitamin C, grape seed extracts and Ginseng also helps strengthen the natural defences of the skin against the sun and reinforces protection against skin damage in the long term. Icing on the cake, the product is paraben free, hypoallergenic, and has a 100% transparent, easily spreadable texture guaranteeing an optimal comfortable application with no white streaks or greasy residue. Marketed in six European continental countries (France, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Norway), Boots Laboratories is reinforcing its positioning as a pioneer brand in the solar market. Alliance Boots markets solar products since 1920. In 1996, the UK based group launched the very first SPF 50 in the world. A revolution for the time! The group also created the UVA five star system, which is now taken up by most brands of solar products in the UK and in many other countries."
Farevacolor offers a range of high tech natural colour cosmetics!,"Premium Beauty News - Which goes to show that you can combine ""naturalness"" with ""high tech""! Natacha Rossi - Quite true! Before I tell you more about this new range, a few words on the global market of natural cosmetics. Although this is still a niche market, this market remains buoyant and is expected to grow by about 50% by 2015. There are several reasons for this growth. Societal reasons first. Consumers concerned about preserving their health, are looking for healthier products. Many brands have understood that which explains the emergence of many new comers in recent years. Hence, distribution has had to adapt to this overwhelming offering. Initially highly specialized, it has expanded a lot allowing consumers an easier access to these products. In the wake of the Smoothie range which was introduced at the end of last year, we chose to add a technical dimension to the natural. With ""Nature ADVANCE++"" Our teams have developed a range of innovative products combining naturalness, sensoriality and high performance. Rich in objectified natural actives and carefully selected for their high-tech properties, each formula features the ""Dual Activ Technology"" that provides an immediate and long lasting dual efficiency. Moreover, during the creation of each product concept, we identified what were the main expectations of women and we targeted those needs. Premium Beauty News - How many products do you offer? Natacha Rossi - Six in all. Essential, must-have products, but also products which were designed outside the box. A multi-action mist first, ""Nature ADVANCE++ Lotion Mist,"" which provides an instant glow, refines the skin texture and sets make-up lastingly. Containing actives from black Russian tea and oil extracts of Asian bamboo, its fresh and light sprayable texture, dries quickly and moisturises the skin continuously.

Panasonic and Kanebo invent the digital make-up snapshot,"That’s the latest innovation from Japan: instant make-up…  without make-up!  An original concept derived from the unique collaboration between Panasonic and Kanebo Cosmetics.  Actually, it is a further evolution of the portrait retouch function already available on latest Panasonic’s Lumix digital cameras.  Once the photo is shot, the new Beauty Retouch Mode enables to add foundation, eye shadow, lipstick, and cheek makeup to the image. The shades are inspired from Kanebo’s Coffret d’Or brand. “By supervising the retouch effects of the new Lumix DMC-FX80 digital camera based on its decades of expertise with makeup, Kanebo Cosmetics has helped create a beautiful yet natural digital makeup finish with a rich gradation of eye shadows and foundation effects that add dimension to the complexion,” says the Japanese cosmetics giant in a release. The new camera allows retouching the skin, eyes, lips and cheeks separately.  In addition, the advanced Beauty Retouch Mode also provides four makeup patterns recommended by Coffret d’Or. By selecting one from the options of ”Sweet”, “Cool”, “Celebrity” and “Happy”, a single press of a button makes it possible to generate a coordinated, fully made-up image with eye shadow, lip rouge, and cheek blush. To mark the release of this new product Kanebo Cosmetics and Panasonic are carrying out a joint promotional campaign between February 16 and March 31 in Japan. Customers purchasing Coffret d’Or products will be offered to enter in a draw to win a Lumix DMC-FX80 camera (100 winners selected), while customers purchasing Lumix DMC-FX80 cameras will be entered in a draw to win the Coffret d’Or Recommended Make-Up Set (200 winners selected).  A joint advertising campaign and a website are also scheduled."
"Lipstick, mascara: Guerlain is confirming its premium strategy","A jewel? A make-up case?   Behind the unpretentious and eye catching Guerlain seal are kept a few ground-breaking secrets. Pull on the case and with a click, the hidden mirror is revealed. A simple twist and the brush appears. Easy to use, you just need to trust your intuition. Black G is a precious object, made mainly of zamak and consisting of no less than seventeen parts. A design signed by Jackel, LF Beauty’s primary packaging division. ""This was a real technical challenge,"" admits Thomas Diezinger, CEO of Jackel France, ""because the design constraints were not that simple to overcome."" Seventeen parts to put together, the desire to achieve a sophisticated and stylish product with high quality parts, a tight closure, a comfortable gesture with the famous ""click"" at the close, a very sophisticated mechanism enabling a smooth opening of the part supporting the mirror... Yes, indeed quite a challenge! It will have taken no less than 18 months to the Jackel teams, supervised by Anne-Cécile Monet and Stéphane Bulle, to develop the object.  The PP body  was made by the German firm Geka, and the brush by the Italian company Ponzini. Icing on the cake, a clever system makes of Noir G a refillable mascara: by simply pulling on the hood the refill appears. You then simply need to trigger a click on the top of the hood to release it... ""Never change a winning team,"" says Daniel Saclier, Packaging Development Director, LVMH.  ""The Lorenz Bäumer and Olivier Echaudemaison tandem has again designed a rare piece of technology with this high-end mascara. Clearly, this is a dream object. Rechargeability was obviously an important criterion, along with, of course, perfect tightness while enabling women to keep the same make-up gesture when using a mascara."""
Scentys pulls out its creator’s cartridges,"Take two high school buddies who became engineers, one graduated in the Ponts & Chaussées and Sciences Po and the other in X-Telecom, philosophy and management. You train them the hard way, in engineering, strategy consulting or at the DGCCRF (General Directorate for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control), and you also let them develop a very natural inclination for oenology, perfume and technology. Then, just let them give free rein to their imagination. And off they go! In 2004, Scentys introduces a flat screen with a fragrance diffuser in tune with the pictures displayed on the screen. Bingo! Perfume brands love it, the wine and spirits industry follows suit. In 2006, the screen is sidelined giving way to the Scentys Box a professional modular diffuser, adaptable to POS advertising, outlets and other premises, which can diffuse up to four fragrances, with a fan blowing on a cartridges filled with polymer beads impregnated with concentrated perfume. It’s clean, simple, and easy to use. Clément Jeanjean and David Suissa further improve their system with a wireless monitoring device, via a downloadable application from the Internet. Ideal for adding fragrant scents to events. In 2010, the project is miniaturized, with Scentys 1, an almost disposable little box concealed in a POS Material. And with always, this guarantee of a perfect restitution of the fragrance or aroma. In 2011, Scentys Pocket a nomadic diffuser, gives hotels, shops, spas and public places the possibility to diffuse a fragrance with a mini box that runs on batteries or mains, ideal for a space of 20m², and truly very efficient. Be it in a pocket size or a standard size, the system works splendidly, and Antoine Lie, a perfume creator (Takasago) and an olfactory consultant to this project has added little notes of its own, creating an exclusive collection of six fragrances, created in single copies (when a customer chooses one of the fragrances or aromas, it is then reserved for him, withdrawn from the offer, and immediately replaced by a different composition). ""With the diffuser, the aim is not to have a too aggressive or too discriminating fragrance, but on the contrary to provide a quality olfactory signature,"" explained Antoine Lie who bears in mind a very qualitative approach when selecting his raw materials: ""it takes very little... there is no price constraint"" His favourite raw materials are here, worked subtly, vetiver, incense, leather, iris, narcissus and rose, genuine compositions giving the place of honour to these various raw materials. You want them for your home. Just for your home."
L’Oréal goes a step further in its relationship with its suppliers,"For the second consecutive year, L’Oréal held on 23 and 24 November in one of its sites in St. Ouen, a sort of small-size in-house exhibition on packaging innovations, called ""Cherry Pack"". A format that matches, according to L’Oréal, an ambition to develop on the long term the group’s relationships with its suppliers. After a pre-selection stage performed by an internal jury, composed of managers coming from such departments as ""Purchasing"", ""Packaging & Development"", ""Research"" and ""Prospective Marketing"", seven suppliers of primary (Jackel, Rexam, RPC, Yonwoo) and secondary packaging (RLC), of samples (Bioplan), or of finishing and decoration services (Pochet-Qualipac-Solev Group), had the opportunity to present their innovations to both the General and Marketing managers representing all the brands of the L’Oréal group. ""Innovation is at the heart of L’Oréal’s strategy and the collaborative work undertaken with our packaging suppliers is an illustration of this. During these two days, the selected suppliers, briefed on our main expectations, presented to Marketing and General Management teams of all our brands, their ideas, particularly focusing on the way to deliver in the most performing way our new formulas, to offer new gestures and new aesthetic designs. Exchanges which have developed during these two days were a unique opportunity to share complementary expertises and imagine together tomorrow’s products,"" explained Christophe Guesnet, General Manager of Procurement for L’Oréal. Indeed unlike the first edition, where participants were left to present the innovations of their choice, L’Oréal, this time, wanted to share more of its brands strategy by providing a clear brief detailing the different expectations expressed not only by the Group’s Research & Innovation, but also by the Marketing teams of each brand.   Participants, however, had free reins to spontaneously propose other types of innovations. Hence this second edition was a mix of both ""ready-to-launch"" packaging solutions responding in a very targeted manner to the needs expressed in the specifications of the project and of solutions of a more ""prospective"" nature. For L’Oréal, Cherry Pack is not only an additional step in building closer partnerships with suppliers, it is also a tool to accelerate the innovation process. A concern shared by world leaders in the field, as was observed with the launch earlier this year by the German firm Beiersdorf, of a web platform designed to offer the group’s external partners a better integration in the innovation process. ""At L’Oréal, innovation is rooted in our DNA. In an increasingly competitive economic environment, we must offer our brands some innovations that meet their needs and the characteristics of their markets in an always more responsive dynamic and the partnerships with our suppliers help speed up packaging innovation,"" emphasised Philippe Thuvien, General Manager of Packaging & Development for L’Oréal. The initiative seems in any case to be a fruitful one, since the group has announced the launch, for the first quarter of 2012, of ""four major innovations"" derived from proposals of suppliers who had participated to the first edition of the Cherry Pack and therefore a direct result of the new co-development approach intended by L’Oréal."
Rexam brings the art of spraying in a new dimension,"This is not just another mere step in the improvement of spray performances that Rexam will be introducing at the next Luxe Pack, from 19 to 21 October 2011 in Monaco, but a real breakthrough. The new Panache spray introduces consumers to a whole new experience placing them in a real mist of perfume, with no feelings of wetness and no stain marks, with less dispersed finer particles, and with a new gesture too, thanks to a prolonged pump action and a longer output spray of 30 cm, with no equivalent on the market. ""Even the sound produced during actuation is different, explains Samira Chmiti, Product Manager at Rexam Beauty, it is more harmonious, more zen"". Rexam has even started collaboration with Mane the perfumer from Grasse, to assess the impact of its new technology on the diffusion of its fragrances. ""The first non-final results, show a top note emerging with much more clarity, more strength and faster"". Panache is the result of five years of research and development, to create a spray compatible with a wide variety of formulas enabling its use for perfumes of course, but also for deodorants or misters. Alcohol or aqueous based formulas, that can also be oil-based, on demand. ""It’s an evolution of our Maximist spray, but at a level that offers entirely new opportunities bringing the spray into new dimensions"", emphasises Chmiti. Compared to other sprays offered by Rexam, Panache features totally new technical characteristics. The homogeneity and the reduction in the size of particles help create a light and airy spray. Panache generates a mist of particles varying in size from 30 to 60 µm, against 30 to 90 µm for Rexam’s Maximist spray and 40 to 150 µm for a standard spray. As for the prolonged action of the pump it was brought to 0.6 seconds, against 0.2 and 0.1 respectively for the Maximist spray and a standard spray. Enough to make of Panache a credible alternative to aerosols for some applications, with the advantages of a simpler assembly process, of being propellant free, and because of the choice of the material used for the bottle. ""Maximist was already one of iconic luxury brands favourite, but now with Panache, we’ve pushed the art of spraying to its maximum"", boasts Christine Guichuki, Marketing and Communications Manager for Rexam. The Panache technology, which has already been launched in the perfume universe as a exclusivity for a French brand, will be available for all of Rexam’s customers as of January 2012. For the fragrance market, Panache is developed on a specific version (with a modified engine and nozzle) of Rexam’s XD11 pump. For other applications, the Panache technology uses a specific version of the SP22 pump. All the decorative elements of the XD11 and SP22 ranges being available for Panache. In the future, Rexam plans to push this technology even further, to meet this time the needs of the pharmaceutical market."
"Phyt’s launches Liberty Cherry, a glamorous red organic lipstick","Like any other product in the Phyt’s organic makeup range, the Liberty Cherry lipstick is composed entirely of natural ingredients. Furthermore, Laboratoires Phyt’s announce for this product a proportion of ingredients from organic farming reaching 80%, i.e. all of the botanical ingredients. An achievement in itself. But the cherry red colour is what distinguishes most Liberty Cherry from the rest of the organically certified makeup line developed by the French company, in contrast with the softer and more ""nature” colours featured in the rest of the range . ""It is likely to add value to the existing range, which was very well received by women yet, despite its very innovative characteristics,"" says Nadine Fabréga. Indeed it is no surprise that the demand is strong for this glamorous and seductive shade. ""It was a recurring demand from consumers, transmitted to us by the beauticians that distribute our line."" However, as far as makeup is concerned, formulating organic products remain a tour de force. On the one hand, the first organic makeup launches are relatively recent, when compared with toiletries or personal care products and, on the other hand, the range of natural colours that are currently available is much smaller that what the chemicals industry can offer. ""Natural makeup is mostly limited by the colours available in the mineral world,"" confirms the Scientific Director of the Jérodia group. In order to obtain a plain red shade, Laboratoires Phyt’s have therefore turned to the red carmine pigment, a natural organic dye from South America, where it was already widely used by the Aztecs, before being imported into Europe at the end of 16th century. Obtained from the carminic acid produced by the female cochineal, it has long been used to dye clothes, before being replaced by synthetic dyes. However it is still widely used in cosmetics (referenced under CI 75470 in Europe, and Natural Red 4 in the U.S.) and in food (E 120 in Europe). While it does not present the same risk of impurities that require a strict control of mineral pigments, because of its organic origin carmine is more likely to trigger allergic reactions.  The Laboratoires Phyt’s were keen to take every precaution at this level. ""The extract we use is very well tolerated in the product where the concentration is limited. We noted no significant effect in the tests we have made,"" says Nadine Fabréga. ""It’s a perfectly legitimate ingredient in organic product, it is authorized both by the Qualité France standard and by the new European-wide Cosmos standard.  We had to find a balance between consumer demand for bright red and a sensitive ingredient to formulate. It was important that the range remains attractive; otherwise the consumers would switch back to conventional makeup. "" Actually, Liberty Cherry does not shine only through its colour. It is also a real lip care. In addition to the glossy effect, the presence of many organic vegetable oils (castor, sunflower, jojoba) helps protect the lips, so does a very large amount of shea butter that, according to Nadine Fabréga, represents a key step forward. ""It’s an ingredient that was absent from previous Phyt’s lipsticks. It provides essential nourishing elements as well as the physical characteristics of smoothness, melting ability, wealth, substantivity, and comfort to the lipstick."" Add to this, the effect of another novelty: the presence of antioxidants in synergy, from the rosemary and vitamin E that fight against free radicals and the effects of ageing on the lips. Not to mention the presence of natural waxes (beeswax, candelilla, and carnauba) that bring a good lasting to the whole product. The Phyt’s Liberty Cherry lipstick will be available on in mid-October, in the beauty salons and department stores that already distribute the brand. Other new products are the pipe since the Laboratoires Phyt’s carry on developing their organic range, including the creation of new product creations. The imminent release of a matifying compact powder is announced."
Grace and glamour for Faber-Castell’s 250th anniversary,"Founded in 1761, Faber-Castell became in the mid-19th century into the world’s premier manufacturer of wood-cased pencils, both graphite and colour. While this year marks its 250th anniversary, Faber-Castell is still a family-owned business. The production of pencils for the cosmetic industry began in 1978.

The retro design of the wooden pencils is a likeness of the ceiling mosaic in the ladies’ bathroom - an Art Nouveau treasure - at the Faber-Castell castle. The formulae are enriched with precious ingredients like black onyx, amber and ruby. “Their micronized particles play with the light, create a natural luminous finish and emphasize the colour,” says the company in a release. The  Grace and Glamour  collection features an eyebrow formulated with fine amber powder, an eyeliner highly pigmented and enriched with vitamin E, and formulated with fine black onyx powder, as well as a lipstick formulated with fine jewel and ruby powder which interacts with the light and creates a deep rich colour with luminous finish. The pencils are decorated with digital transfer providing multi-coloured designs of almost photographic quality. The pencil caps are ennobled with a gold banderole."
The Body Shop boosts innovations with suppliers,"The Body Shop, the ethical and naturally inspired beauty brand, and part of the L’Oréal Group, is carrying on efforts to increase cooperation with its suppliers. Following the motto taken from the Suppliers Day, organised on the 24th February 2011, ""from cost efficiency to value creation through quality, time-to-market, innovations and eco friendly/natural products,"" the brand’s new sourcing strategy is rolling out.  Objective: to boost innovation and actively contribute to business development. The Body Shop has a strong position in the global market with more than 2,600 stores in over 60 markets. An ethical brand with a belief in business as a force for good based on its five core values: Against Animal Testing, Support Community Fair Trade, Activate Self Esteem, Defend Human Rights and Protect the Planet. The brand’s aim through this workshop is to work with suppliers to increase creativity a key driver of the brand’s success, alongside evaluating its suppliers’ performance on quality, supply chain, sustainability and competitiveness. “Innovations should not be seen as something we can only deliver from our laboratories. We also build on relationships with our key suppliers to identify and facilitate ideas for the benefit of our customers,” points out Jason Matthews, Director of R&D at The Body Shop. The workshop held in London, has gathered seven selected suppliers: four from Europe, two from Asia and one from the U.S.A. “Using a detailed brief for each product category, which we sent them a few weeks before the event, all the suppliers have designed their proposals with the aim to perfectly match with The Body Shop expectations,” tells Jerome Courtaigne, Director of International Sourcing The suppliers did not only propose new concepts matching the expectations but also ‘blue sky’ ideas pushing boundaries but staying realistic to fit the brand’s requirements. “We want to build up our suppliers’ relationship based on mutual understanding and strong intimacy to create value together. Innovation is a perfect example because it requires strategic alignment and is the fuel of our growth,” adds Jerome Courtaigne. According to Sandra Weinheimer, Director of Technical Product Development, this event was only the first step to get tangible results. “To innovate successfully, we need not only new ideas of formulas and packaging but also the best process and methods to make new concepts come to reality with quality, speed, and with respect for our values. We are now focussed on launching a few of them in the coming months,” concludes Sandra."
"MakeUp in Paris, novelties, just novelties (Part 2)","On the occasion of MakeUp in Paris, BCM introduced a new encapsulation complex with hydrating properties, the PolyOzOme, combined with a silicone elastomer in a Blush ""Caresse Acidulée"" for a better holding power of the make-up, a velvety feel and a transparent shade. The ""Oh Dace Color"", with strong and flashy colours, with five other complexion products, ""Oscillation"" (a foundation with a gel texture for an improved gliding effect), a sublimating silky foam, and three other blushes, ""Pulpy Vitamin"", ""Cheek Sorbet"" (water formulated) and ""Shaker Blush"".

The company Pennelifaro is launching on the French market its Kubo Beauty line, a concept of professional brushes for make-up artists or consumers who want to buy them by the unit and whose delivery is guaranteed within 24hrs on the whole territory. This line is also intended for distributors for whom a specific POS was developed. It can include from six to over a hundred references.   The company, very much committed towards sustainable development, a humanistic management and a tailor-made service, also unveiled a line of brushes for sensitive skins and a completely flat brush which is intended for applying make-up while virtually retaining no product at all. To note that the specificity of the Pennelifaro brushes lies in their assembly: worked from the base, they are not cut with scissors and the flag part of the bristles remains intact, imparting them with a very soft skin feel and a true density. Traditionally specialized in perfume sampling, Arcade Europe has showcased several novelties specifically developed for the make-up and skincare industry. MakeUp in Paris visitors were able to discover two worldwide launches : – Powdasilk is designed as a portable mini-powder puff, featuring upon opening the - already impregnated - applicator on one side and on the other side, the powder which enables to re-impregnate the applicator as many times as required to achieve a complete make-up. – ClearAdvantage can be positioned directly on the advertising medium and being a transparent clear re-sealable label, it merges with it. It is designed for magazines, direct sell and direct mail.  BeautiPod, intended for skincare or make-up products, is a sachet which is heat-sealed on a paper medium, thus irremovable. The opening is performed by tearing off the upper part of the paper medium, the flow being controlled by a very narrow opening. It can be used in press media or through direct marketing. Two more technologies which were already marketed in the U.S., are now also being launched in France. Beautiseal Stand-Alone for foundations and lipsticks for which was conceived a dispensing sampler to affix within the brand’s POS, Beautiseal multicavity to carry up to 12 different shades (a whole version of a chart for example). The Italian company B. Kolormakeup & Skincare has developed eight beauty and lifestyle themes for 2012. Among which, ""Cycle & Recycle"" that highlights sustainability and bio, ""Liquid and Ice"" that gives added-value to brand’s innovative formulas, new emulsions and suspensions as well as to new pigments and pearls, 3D&HD, to combine the application effects of a product (a matte base with a glowing and shiny surface for example) and highlight both the accuracy of formulas and applicators including packaging which actually is a matter for high definition. Note, in short, the Pascual company who announced new investment and technical developments, including a new machine to produce transparent lipstick. At Vetronaviglio, the Cristal line (the best selling line of the company) has seen the addition of two new 15 and 30ml bottles and new wooden accessories were also launched, in particular for caps and closures. ""For every day and for all the day"" is the promise of Gotha’s ""24/7"" line, a comprehensive range for the complexion (powder and foundation), eyes and lips (lipstick and gloss) with nourishing and long wear properties. All products are formulated without parabens and alcohol."
"MakeUp in Paris, novelties, just novelties (Part 1)","On the occasion of MakeUp in Paris, managers from Jackel have placed a particular emphasis on what they call ""instrumental beauty"" with the presentation of products like tweezers equipped with a built-in light (LED), but also a heated eyelash curler, a light mirror, a electric manicure kit equipped with various adaptors (file, polisher...), a cleaning brush for the face, an electric mister. With its water tank equipped with a piezo mechanism to turn water into nanoparticles, it avoids getting the wet look effect bringing freshness instead, but it can also be used to set make-up. Already marketed in Asia, this mister is being launched in Europe. To note also on their stand: the hinge-free Reverso case, with a 360° opening, equipped with magnetic brushes (which are therefore unlikely to fall) and provides four customizable areas, the Summer Pop collection, inspired by the Color Block trend, for a new soft and smooth, powder texture the surface of which does not flake. New packaging, new gestures and new results are the highlights of the products in Farevacolor’s new Fast & Glam makeup collection: – the All in 1 Face Kit brings together in the same pack all the must-have to unify and sublimate the complexion, a tanning tinted cream, a concealer and corrector blush glow, – presented in a tube with a sponge tip, Blush Jelly is a fresh and frozen gelly that slightly colours cheekbones, with a guaranteed natural result,
– the Velvet Kiss, a lipstick duo and a matching lip powder, allow modulating makeup at will. Its packaging features a lip brush and its cover features a mirror,
– the Soft & Shine Lip Care Balm contains a subtly tinted balm and high-shine gloss to pamper and enhance one’s lips all year round,
– the Plastic Eyebrow, with its vinyl texture, easily and precisely sculpts eyebrows thanks to its wedge-shaped silicone applicator, 
– eventually, a never seen eye makeup kit, the Bling Bling Kit, the epitome of a fun product, which features a unique stencil that allows dressing the lids with glittering stars, and an eyeliner with a flocked and highly flexible applicator highlighting the look of a glamour line. Fun or glamour, there’s also something for everyone, with Alkos’ three 2011 collections. – Fruits’Délices, with an impulse buy positioning, is exclusively focused on lips with three perfumed glosses presented in three vials, five shades of slightly perfumed pencil-gloss with an organic creamy texture and an organic lipstick (three shades).
– Summer Vibe targets teenagers or night-clubers with a look mainly electric blue or outrageously pink, wood or plastic eyeliner pencils, long-lasting cream or eye shadow pencils with a cooling effect, a gloss that changes colour depending of the pH of the mouth, glittering scented oils for the body and ten colours of water based felt markers for a novel French manicure.
– Aloha taps into seduction. With a comprehensive line that includes an eyeliner (blue or saffron), an eyeshadow whose formula (two shades) is hidden in the caps at both ends of the pen, a foam blush with a fresh feel, a lipstick, a lacquered gloss, an all-over pen for the face, the arms and the neckline with a matte powdery texture and a glittering moisturising body oil. In addition to these three collections, Alkos has launched Glide, new textured, water-resistant and long-lasting eyeliners and kohls, in classic or trendy shades, ""So Wond"", lipsticks and lipglosses with a very bright and long lasting texture in two shades and vanilla perfumed, turquoise or brown body tattoos (with a 2 to 3 days hold). Because women never managed to use up all of their make-up products, Livcer has designed ""Color Kit"" a miniaturized pallet for foundations or complexion correctors. The small capacity of   its ultra slim, sealed and resealable case, equipped with a sponge, designs it as an impulse purchase or to be used as a product for people on the go. If it is a smart product, ""Color Kit"" is also a green product because it is fully recyclable. The Italian company GI Picco’s Cosmetics, which was granted in 2011 the ISO 9001 certification, presented the ""Sensitive Line"", formulated with no heavy metals, nickel-free, paraben-free and perfume-free, clinically ophthalmologically tested to minimize reactions on sensitive skins. It is a comprehensive range for the skin, the lips and the eyes. Several novelties and quite a lot of hard work achieved on textures by the French company ABC Texture: an silicone-free all-over the face product, a foundation that also offers a primer effect thanks to a denser, powdery texture, a silicone-free, cream corrector with a powdery finish, a compact foundation presented in a leak proof case because water-formulated, a water resistant, filled eyeliner, a liquid foundation and a blush. Coming in addition, six shades of eyeshadows and four new shades of primer. Taking full advantage of its experience in lipsticks, and in order to meet growing demand on transparent grapes, with nacres or glitters, embedded in a double or triple casting, Weckerle unveiled several novelties in this category: a new generation including three formulas or three colours in a single grape, the ""twin stick"", a two-in-one with a surlyn pump for a liquid formula combined with a pasty formula in a grape (which may also find some applications for complexion products), a nourishing lip butter with a Vinyl surface and very sensory feel with real a flexibility to the touch. Two novelties also for the eyes, a kohl and a retractable kajal enrich Weckerle’s offer. To be continued..."
Innovation: Certified organic nail polishes by So’Bio étic,"The Léa Nature group, a French specialist in natural and organic cosmetic and health products, distributed in mass retail stores and pharmacies, has developed a line of organic nail polishes certified by Ecocert and labelled with the Cosmébio logo. This patented innovation is formulated without nitrocellulose, contrary to conventional nail polishes, but contains a natural gum and a minimum of 40% organic ingredients. A real progress for the environment, according to the brand. Launched at the end of April under the So’Bio étic brand, the range features five colours (rubbish red, raspberry, golden beige, pinkish brown, chocolate) and also boasts a beneficial effect for the health of nails.  Each colour comes in a bi-phasic form that consumers must shake well before each use. The oily phase, based on organic safflower oil (Carthamus tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil) concentrates most of the nail care action to ""strengthen and protect.""  The colour, composed of mineral and natural pearls, is concentrated in the other phase. However, because of their composition, the So’Bio étic nail polishes are more adherent to the nail than classical varnishes and cleansing, possible with any type of solvent, requests more time. Nevertheless, since the launch of the varnishes, many consumers informed the brand about their difficulties for cleansing the product. Therefore, the Léa Nature group has decided to reformulate its product to solve this difficulty and ensure the maximum satisfaction of its customers. The products should be relaunched in September."
Oekabeauty: A whole series of novelties,"Needless to say there has been quite a creative unrest in recent month at Oekametall and its Oekabeauty division.  “We have brought new blood to the teams, and you can feel the difference!” Gerald Oehlhorn, the CEO, said humorously. One after another, the firm based in Bamberg, an hour away from Nuremberg, is offering its customers in the beauty sector, several innovations in all its favourite segments, namely, lipstick, mascara and lip gloss. To start with, the ""Eco pack"" series for which the German company proposes a lip gloss, a mascara and a lipstick tube, using a single plastic material, polypropylene. ""This makes products perfectly and easily recyclable,"" emphasised Frank Bierkandt, Assistant to the general Management.  ""In addition, added Bierkandt, in the case of the lipstick tube for which, in general, three different materials are at least required, the product is, by the very nature of the single material used, totally air-tight."" But it does not stop there... In the field of mascaras, engineers from the firm have come up with several new brushes including the ""Lash Explosion"" model, a very large brush that gives a ""super"" volume to lashes, not to mention a multilayer brush, ""Multilayer Brushes"" where stiffer fibres alternate with more flexible fibres, allowing both to load more mascara on the lashes (the central flexible fibres) and to distribute it efficiently (the rigid fibres located on each top and bottom side). To note also the ""Dual Flex"" pack which comprises both a mascara (on one end) and a lip gloss (at the other end). Actually, lip glosses are not outdone with a series of coloured applicators, ""Smashing color applicators,"" whose colours sparkle with a thousand points once coated with transparent lip gloss. To note, also, the release of a ""Mini Line"" which includes a tiny mascara and a lip gloss that can be used as samples or travel products, not to mention a new line of mascara, the ""Convex Line"" with extremely well-rounded shapes. Finally the company also offers a new decoration technique in the form of graduated shadings of coating to be applied on its packagings. ""There too... it’s also a novelty!"" Frank Bierkandt announces. ""It was time for us to answer the expectations and needs of a number of customers, by offering them a catalogue of standard mascaras and lip glosses. Well, since this year, this is achieved too!”  If it’s clever it also offers a great plus of course, in terms of costs - since the only remaining expense for the customer will concern the mould manufacturing -  not to mention the flexibility offered in manufacturing and delivery processes. In fact, there are actually two catalogues, one for mascara brushes and lip gloss applicators and one for the packaging solutions themselves. With a total of thirty mascara brushes and twelve lip gloss applicators in the first one and forty different packaging solutions in the second one. Eventually, the Bamberg-headquartered firm also announced the creation of a white room and the setting up of a workshop entirely dedicated to diversification in the medical sector."
Quadpack to launch make-up and foam pump innovations,"Quadpack sources and develops customised packs through a strategic network of manufacturing partners.  On the occasion of MakeUp in Paris  (23 and 24 June, 2011), the international cosmetic packaging provider will unveil a new foamer manufactured by Apollo, designed for make-up removal. According to Quadpack, Apollo foam pumps use patented technology to achieve outstanding foam quality. Indeed, the manufacturer’s new foamers avoid metal parts in the product path, thereby greatly reducing product compatibility issues. Exclusively from Yonwoo, Quadpack will also showcase at MakeUp in Paris the very latest airless make-up containers that protect products from external contamination and preserve their integrity. These will include the Dual 2-in-1 packs that marry foundation and concealer in a single tube or bottle; the glass-effect Crystal range; and an airless spot pen with brush applicator, offering clog-free precision dosage and targeted application of foundation. Besides foundation and make-up removal, lip colour will headline among the make-up innovations. Quadpack’s airtight lipstick is designed to prevent the common inconvenience of the product drying out. “The metal lip gloss roll-on gives a great cooling sensation, while a new small brush tube allows professional application of lip colour,” said the company in a release. Quadpack will also display the latest range from lip-gloss and mascara specialist Brivaplast. Branded packs on display will include Beate Johnen’s new face cream contained in an airtight Yonwoo compact, Klorane’s well-pump cleansing water and Dr Schrammek’s foundation and concealer pack.  “Quadpack brings a great deal of technical expertise in skin care packaging to the colour cosmetics market, particularly in terms of product preservation, dispensing innovation and luxury presentation,” said Quadpack CEO Tim Eaves. “Our stand will house a variety of solutions to show how creativity, technology, safety and ease of filling can combine to provide striking make-up packs that help build brands.”"
Setalg to set foot in the retail market,"Setalg, the French specialist of cosmetic powders to serve the market of spas and beauty salons is taking an interested in the retail market and is adapting its offer to address the needs of brands in this channel. The company presented its new patent, Concept Twin Phase, at the last edition of In-Cosmetics, Milan.  Quite a novelty for this third party manufacturer who is holding a leading position in the segment of cosmetic products based on marine ingredients meant for professional distribution channels: the new product is targeting this time the retail market! ""We usually propose powders for rinse off or peel off skin care products, marine muds, clays, scrubs, which are to be used in an aqueous phase in the beauty salon or the spa. It is important of course to know how to dose the mixture appropriately and actually such manipulations were holding back the development of our offer to individuals"", explained Yves Bleunven, in charge of the French Market for Setalg. The solution presented by Setalg allows mixing the powder and the aqueous solution in less than 30 seconds without having to worry about proportions.  The end user just needs to squeeze the package and then knead the product through its packaging to obtain a ready to use the peel-off mask. How does it work? The two phases (20 grams of a powder and 40 grams of an aqueous solution) are packaged in a single package, and kept separated by a weld that only gives way when the user presses on both ends. Afterwards the user will just need to knead the package to mix the product thoroughly who will then ready for use! As usual, Setalg offers brands a customization of its innovation.  Textures, active ingredients, colours and perfumes can be adapted to meet the specific needs of each market."
Make-up: Kosmoda unveils its morphing technology,"The Italian company created in March 2007 and specialised in the production of baked powders, presented a brand new powder at the latest Cosmoprof tradeshow. The production is based on the so-called “Morphing Technology”, a process that allows transforming a selection of raw materials through specific manufacturing technics in order to deliver a product with an unexpected refined touch together with highly performing cosmetic features. Actually, the final product appears and feels like in-between a poured product and a powdered one, while retaining in itself the best features of both of the two forms. According to Kosmoda, the main characteristics are: – an unrivalled creamy and soft touch, 
– an extremely thin and adherent powder that is nevertheless very easy to blend, 
– an extremely long lasting colour effect  without fading or streaking,
– the use of different pearls to obtain high impact final effect ranging from satin to high frost finish,
– a wet and dry use to play with colours and to improve intensity and colour wear. This new product allows high creativity and offers a broad palette of possible customizations ranging from mono to multiple shade products: – high flexibility in special effect combining up to 6 different shades with the use of one single pan (traditional or plastic),
– domed and embossed patterns,
– special technical drawings to suit customers requests."
Intercos pulls out the Prisma Shine card,"For the past two years, the 457 employees dedicated to innovation within the Intercos group have been actively working.  From their work emerged Prisma Shine, a new generation of almost-revolutionary textures that blend pigments and lights for an exceptional colour rendition. A proprietary process that also allows three-dimensional shapes, volumes and drawings with amazing fineness.  From this point of view, it’s true, there is good side to every crisis! To get going again! This is certainly the motto that best characterizes this thirty nine year old Italian group which employs more than 3,000 people the world over, which is capable of producing about 6,800 tons of cosmetic products each year and over 1.6 billion units. A group that produces in the four corners of the globe, from the United States to China including of course, Italy and soon Brazil. ""This new factory with a production area of 8,000 sqm will be located near Sao Paulo, and will be operational in January 2012. With this new factory, we will be able to meet both local demand for product innovation and also demand from our key global clients who are in need locally of an industrial capacity,"" explains Ferrari. An international expansion coupled with a strategic commitment striving to always be ""the best"" not only in its traditional segments like colour, but also in markets where, traditionally, others seem to be more at the sharp end. ""Obviously, we have strong ambitions in the segment of plastic pencils, particularly in the U.S. where we will certainly invest in terms of manufacturing."" Ambitions are the same for the CEO of Intercos in the skin care segment where the Italian company, through its CRB subsidiary, created six months ago Vitalab, a company in joint venture with a biotechnology laboratory in Naples. Finally, high ambitions, too, in the segment of standard products where the company has just launched a collection called Smart Beauty intended to challenge ranges proposed by Asian groups. ""With that additional Italian Touch to it,"" insists Dario Ferrari. But the star attraction of the showroom, organized like every year at the headquarters in Agrate Brianza will have been this year the new textures developed by the Group’s laboratories, Prisma Shine. ""This exclusive process and its unique texture combine to create a truly new generation of visual effects,"" says Ferrari. And it’s true that the effect is startling. Thanks to the proprietary process developed by engineers at Intercos, colours, effects, gradations, and the fineness of motives are truly breath taking."
CEP Industry: a two piece-mascara!,"The project of this quite remarkable new mascara tube was initiated by The Estée Lauder Companies and designed by the French firm CEP Industrie. ""For the time being it consists of a standard sample with a 2 ml capacity,"" explained Stéphane Leonard, the Sales Director, ""but we can of course develop larger sizes."" Main tricks featured by the product, the wiper is embedded in the container and the stem holder is built into the cap. Hence, the whole product only consists of two parts instead of four usually (and therefore two moulds instead of four are required). Moreover, the whole system is supplied fully assembled ready to be filled and sealed from its base like a tube. For its launched, the mini mascara is filled by Socoplan-Flexpaq, a subsidiary of the Ileos group. A for the new ""Minicep"", tube, it is a single material breakable tube fully recyclable which empties completely and effortlessly with its flexible and deformable head. It is resealable. It only weighs 1.3 grams and claims to be as competitive as a sachet. CEP Industrie will present its innovative products during the PCD Congress, which will open its doors in Paris on the 8th and 9th of February 2011."
Innovation to increase one’s market shares!,"Cinqpat’s watchword, ""Beauty Applications"", is there to remind it: we are pragmatic people and we must remain pragmatic about innovation, “this is especially true as innovation is only really useful when it helps to increase your market shares,” insisted Mathiez. The first two years of Cinqpats, to which is associated Jean-Luc Perrier (former Risdon/AMS) have been for the least, tonic, “as one might have imagined them!” Jean-Louis Mathiez insisted.  “Fortunately during this period of time, we received valuable support from many players in the world of cosmetics, such as Jacques Gerbron (former Coty/Lancaster).” However, the initial intuition was confirmed quite soon: the need for innovation was there, but mainly for an innovation conceived with product feasibility always in mind.  ""We don’t sell ideas, we don’t sell products, we just help brands and their suppliers achieve full projects. The feasibility is measured according to such performance criteria as quality, cost, deadlines and intellectual property. Five criteria, like Cinqpats, [1]"" emphasised Mathiez. Medium and large companies will quickly become the core targets of Cinqpats. As he stresses: ""The relevant companies are the ones wanting to increase their market share through innovation.""  These needs do not concern packaging alone, but more product as a whole: ""This is why our offer always includes a part on the content, a part on distribution and a part on the product application."" Among our early customers and partners we can name Coty, LVMH, Selva Oekametall, Coslab, EuroCosmeticAsia, E-Scent, Cosnova ... The Cinqpats team which now comprises five people, including Isabelle Maurouard (former Bourjois and Coty), Sophie Robbe (former Coty) and Mark Lebeau (3D designer), has several hobbyhorses like mascara of course, but also airless and soon to come lipstick, not to mention ... bulb atomizers.  Jean-Louis Mathiez explained: ""It is true that during these early years we have earned our reputation on mascara and airless, but we are also working on other concepts."" On the airless side it may be recalled that Cinqpats offers several innovations based on technological inputs coming from such companies as Gaplast in Germany and Tirrit in China. The design of the pump itself allows the contained formula to be dispensed with little filler waste: thus, it can suck up high-viscosity formulas or tacky textures, or even reasonably heterogeneous products.  The process implemented for the design of the ""co-extruded"" bottle (patented by Gasplast), keeps the inner pouch attached to the top and bottom of the bottle so that the pouch contracts itself avoiding product blockage.  This conception guarantees a evacuation rate close to 100% with constant dosage from beginning to end. Cinqpats latest innovation to date is on the brink of seeing the light of day: a dual-compartment airless that will deliver high-end toothpaste ... An application hiding in fact many others ... in cosmetics. As for mascaras, Jean-Louis Mathiez’s position is clear: ""the product is featuring a lot too many unnecessary gadgets. In addition, all these vibrating or heating electric motors don’t really seem in line with environmental concepts. On the other hand, it is possible to develop new functionalities, but ... without the help of engines!"" Obviously segments concerning lipstick and the distribution of free-powder with bulb atomizers, are of great interest to the market ... and, ""of course we are also very interested!"" admitted Mathiez. But the CEO of Cinqpats also said that ""regarding lipstick, we are working on a turnkey concept, with the help of Oséo Innovation, which should emerge fairly quickly. As for the bulb atomizer, it is meeting a strong demand on the market which can only but intensify itself in the coming months. It is a vector which was abandoned at the start of the 20th century but it is now resurfacing. Powder can be used to convey a skincare treatment, perfumes ... The trick of course, is to manage to control the spray and the dosage at the same time. But we are working on it!"""
Weckerle: unbridled innovation,"Premium Beauty News - You have industrialized the process of filling center core lipsticks – lately even a ‘Triple Core Lipstick’. Thomas Weckerle - Yes, the Triple Core Lipstick is an extremely successful launch for us this year. It features the benefits of a lipbalm, and also a lipstick and lip gloss. The triple injection filling technology now allows us to introduce new products in other categories. Thus we have developed a Smart Triple Core Concealer which has a super soft blendable texture, lightweight and creamy. It is a multi-benefit concealer designed to satisfy consumer needs for convenience and efficiency. Premium Beauty News - And this surprising product combining lipstick and lip gloss a single packaging? Thomas Weckerle - We always look in other areas and industries to get inspiration for new concepts and innovation.  Constantly we challenge ourselves and question conventional products or production processes. By realizing that a regular lipstick and a lipstick with a hole in the middle show the same application on the lips, we had the idea for a new kind of duo packaging - the so called Twinstick. This Twinstick integrates a lipstick with a built-in gloss applicator in the centre. In the case of the Crystal Twinstick which we introduced in our latest trends presentation, we combined a clear lipstick formulation for shine and color and a special gloss to boost color and shine. Products can be used individually or even together. For sure, there will be much more room for product concepts and ideas for this unique packaging. Premium Beauty News - What other interesting products do you have in your latest portfolio ? Thomas Weckerle - From a formulation approach I would like to point out the Powder Sensation Lipstick. It uses a double injection filling technology and has a XL-center core. The center core features a formula with a significantly higher concentration of pigments compared to a regular lipstick and the outer layer is a creamy lipstick base.  The result of this lipstick for pay-off is superb - intense colour with a matt finish. Other developments to meet the customers’ demand for easy application and handling is the Line & Shadow with a special square cut tip and the Pocket Duet - a double ended packaging with a round or tapered mine and a wide range of formulations for customized products."
"Reverso, a hinge-free make-up case by Jackel","Brand new and very clever indeed! Reverso, the new make-up case developed by Jackel, has no hinges. The cover can operate a 360°rotation. The connection between the two parts is achieved with a variable number of interlaced strips of paper, fabric or faux leather, which are used in replacement of hinges, offering at the same time an easily customizable double decoration surface. The case can also be maintained in a stable position and opened by the means of a magnetic system. It is also equipped with a mirror and a 4 pan layout with an applicator recess."
Plasticum launches a one-piece tube with integrated closure,"Plasticum, a Netherlands -headquartered supplier of plastic packaging products specializing in the Personal Care, Food and Home Care markets, is launching a one-piece tube with an integrated closure: the Clube (a contraction for “closure” and “tube”). This innovative packaging is produced by a patented bi-injection moulding process requiring a specific material formulation and innovative tooling techniques.  In contrast with the traditional extrusion process, the production process developed by Plasticum enables to manufacture the complete product, including an in-mould-labelling decoration, in just one single production step. According to Plasticum, the concept offers substantial advantages. Since the tube shoulder has been eliminated, up to 40% material is saved, which is quite positive for the environment. Material and weight reduction also means less waste and less rejects during processing, as well as less energy consumption. In addition to a reduction of the carbon footprint, these improvements hence result in overall cost savings. Furthermore, Plasticum claims that the efficient production process of the Clube guarantees flexibility and short lead times.  “Commercial delivery times can be reduced considerably.  In addition, there is a high level of flexibility thanks to easy changeovers of colours and labels.  Even small custom projects are feasible.” The production of the Clube will be demonstrated for the first time at the K 2010, the international trade fair for plastics and rubber, which will be held in Düsseldorf from October  27 to November 3."
Promens presents an eco-friendly airless,"Ecolution is a 100% plastic-made system (100% Polyolefin) and 100% recyclable. It contains no metal or glass or non-recyclable plastics. The COTREP (French Technical Committee for the Recycling of Plastic Packaging) issued a favourable opinion on the recyclability of the AirFree bottle in the flow of recycled HDPE. The system does not need to be disassembled because all the bottle and pump components are recyclable. The system has also been developed using an Eco-design process: the weight of each part was optimized, materials used are standard materials, and suppliers were all selected in a radius of 200 km from the production site to streamline the movement of equipment and personnel during the system’s development. “With its pump designed with only 4 parts,” explain managers at Promens, “the system helps reduce CO2 emissions by 30% (Results of a Life Cycle Analysis System - a comparison made with an airless piston pump with 12 parts).” Ecolution is also very compact [1]: compared to a piston-operated airless system, according to Promens, it represents a 30% gain in volume of packaging. Finally, the bottle can be produced from recycled plastic, thanks to the AirFree technology. The co-extruded multi-layer bottle can contain up to 85% of recycled material (Post Consumer Recycled HDPE). The exterior of the bottle is therefore composed of recycled material, while the pouch - which is in contact with the formula - is made from virgin material. EVOH [2] contained in the pouch acts as a barrier between the recycled material and the formula to guarantee its preservation. “Women’s needs and more generally, consumer needs,” explain designers of the system, “have evolved during the last decades; now, their choices are shifting to natural, preservative-free and environmentally friendly products. Ecolution addresses these changing needs, because it is eco-friendly and helps reduce preservatives contained in the formula (EVOH contained in the pouch features barrier properties against oxygen, to help increase the content’s shelf life).” Two versions of the actuator are available, with short spouts and long spouts, to meet all market requirements. The range of standard bottles is available in 5 sizes: 50 ml, 100 ml, 200 ml, 400 ml and 500 ml. “Ecolution combines smoothness, ergonomics and usability. The diameter of the bottle has been designed to offer a perfect grip. And with its intuitive locking, Ecolution can be carried safely,” underlines Isabelle Orhan, Innovation and Marketing Director. Ecolution delivers a dose of 1.5 ml, of the most liquid to the most viscous formulas."
"With Floraluxe, organic cosmetics enter in hotels","ADA Cosmetics International, a leading supplier and producer of hotel cosmetics, now features FloraluxeBIO, a new certified natural cosmetics line that complement its “Green Collection” range. Over 98 percent of the ingredients are from natural origin, and half, at least, are plant-based raw materials. Furthermore, a minimum of five percent of all plant ingredients come from organic farming.  All these factors have led to the award of the natural cosmetics seal from EcoCert. The new body care series FloraluxeBIO features a wide variety of products for daily use. In addition to shower gel, shampoo and body lotion the assortment also includes conditioner and creamy soap. All formulations have been enriched with trendy caring ingredients.  The shower gel, for instance, cleanses the skin gently with cotton flower extracts.  The body lotion is rich in almond oil, the shampoo contains vitalizing mint extracts, while the conditioner boasts bamboo extracts, among other ingredients. As far as the soap is concerned, it contains cucumber extracts to clean the skin. All products are free of dyes, parabens, silicones and mineral oils. Additionally, neither genetically modified ingredients, nor animal-based extracts or artificial fragrances are used. The formulations have a neutral pH factor and, the fragrance of the new series also is made from natural essential oils. The dispensers have been designed to look modern and clear. The body care products are available in 30ml and 150ml, and the soap in 15g and 40g sachets. Incidentally, to be fully consistent with its ecological principles, the packing fully recyclable. In addition, liquid soap and shampoo hair + body are available in the press+wash dispensers made of 100 percent recyclable PET. “The demand for purely natural products has been on the rise for years. Nature has become an integral part of a modern lifestyle, a trend also noticeably affecting hotel cosmetics,” explains Claudia Raatz, the ADA’s chief developer."
Pumpart launches a brand new 10 ml airless tube with the technical backup of the Sothys Group,"This patented airless tube developed in 2007 by the young French firm Pumpart System, is undeniably, a clever system!  “The initial idea is in fact quite simple, explains its inventor Jérôme Boumnso. As often in such case, someone just had to think of it!”  The tube comprises the tube itself, which can be purchased from any supplier, a tube in which engineers at Pumpart System from their factory in Limoges, ""placed"" an inserted inner pouch. When the tube is pressed, the inner pouch containing the product is crushed at the same time and when pressure is released a vent hole lets the air enter between the tube and the pouch, which not only allows the tube to take its original shape but also fills in the volume, which was partly cleared, between the pouch and the tube. A second pressure on the tube and the pouch is a little more compressed under the combined effect of the pressure and of the air, which has been introduced between the pouch and the wall of the tube... “Until full retraction, in a ball shape, of the pouch,” underlines Jérôme Boumnso.  “This retraction allows us to obtain an almost complete product release (98%), by far the largest evacuation rate on the market of airless containers!” “Actually, explains Jérôme Boumnso, it’s the pressure on the tube that releases the product. There is no need for any specific mechanical system. I suppose it could also work with a single outlet valve.”  As a result, 25% to 65% less plastic and, consequently, a cost of about 30% lower than that of a conventional airless system. The challenge for Pumpart System, together with the Sothys Group, was to design a small volume container of 10 ml. “The system appeared to be sufficiently innovative and promising, for our group to want to invest time and expertise,” explains Jean-Claude Ducruezet, Industrial Director at Sothys.  “Our teams have worked for several months in close collaboration with those of Pumpart System to manage to develop this new 10 ml airless tube. And we’re all quite proud of the result.” A ""plus"" in the now well-tested range (up to 200 ml) of the young French start-up which is beginning in 2010, to reap the fruits of these last three years development efforts. “Of course the trend on organic products is helping us a lot,” explains Jérôme Boumnso. “Because our Tubairless meets the exact specifications for this kind of product. No pump, less plastic, 100% recyclable, Ecocert and Cosmebio compliant, providing an excellent protection to sensitive formulas, an almost complete restitution, lighter, easily transportable, usable in all positions and ultimately, an eloquent C02 balance!”   The Mass is ended!"
L’Air du Temps by Starck: a technical challenge,"It’s finally for L’Air du Temps, the iconic fragrance by Nina Ricci, that Philippe Starck has signed its first perfume bottle.  Few areas have remained unexplored by this prolific designer who signed furniture, houses, motorcycles, yachts, hotels, restaurants, lights, and of course several useful or decorative daily-use objects. The new bottle of L’Air du Temps created by Starck is emblematic of the uncluttered, intelligible and affordable style of the most well known contemporary French designers. “I am a man in search of the minimum,” he says. Thus reduced to the essential, the bottle concentrates purely on the lovingly entwined doves.  The airy transparency and velvety softness of the frosted glass accentuate the effect, right up to the galvanised white-metal cap, which takes the place of one the wings the two birds. Reduced to this airy concept, the L’Air du Temps bottle takes on another modernity, while remaining surprisingly in the line of the previous ones. It was an audacious bet since the “twin dove” bottle made by Marc Lalique in 1951 had become a hit, and was even voted bottle of the year in 1999. Created in 1948, the “Sun” bottle made by the Catalan sculptor Joan Rebull had a cap engraved with a dove. But the symbol of femininity was missing in the 1968 version of the bottle, which was marketed during the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s, until its successful return in 1986 with a delicate and engraved vision of the “embossed doves”.  The twin doves were so ” are emblematic of L’Air du Temps, that it could have seem impossible to modernise them without disappointing fans. The Verreries Brosse, a subsidiary of the Zignano Vetro group specializing in high-end perfumery vials, were entrusted with the difficult task to give birth to the bottle designed by Starck. According to the French glassmaker, the industrial production of the bottle required to push back the technical frontiers of automatic glassmaking.  The technical feasibility of the vial was not sure and implied a unique mobilization of development teams.  In order to achieve the production of a bottle conformed to the original design, the glassmaker successfully adapted a drilling method.  A meticulous work on the shape of prototypes was also required for the glass to spread as homogeneously as possible. The cap placed was made by Qualipac in moulded, polished and galvanized Zamac. If the bottle of L’Air du Temps was regularly updated, the fragrance, on the contrary, remained surprisingly unchanged.  In spite of fashion variations and regulatory changes, the formula has stayed intact for more than 60 years. That’s probably why Philippe Starck says: “I dislike old perfumes and I dislike new perfumes; what I like are eternal perfumes.”"
Natura to launch a line for men in France,"Building on its success in Latin America, where it took up the challenge and attract many males, Natura will launch Homem, a complete line of skin care products for men on the French market, the only where the brand is represented in Europe. Above all, this short line is intended to be practical. It features five multifunctional products for the skin and the hair: a refreshing gel, a face and body cleanser, a refreshing shampoo and three basics for the shaving and after shaving (shaving gel foam, shaving cream, aftershave gel). Just like all Natura products, the Homem line is rich in ingredients from the Brazilian biodiversity, and features soft textures and fragrances that are like sensual and invigorating dives in the well-being, bem estar bem in Brazilian.  Among the botanical ingredients in which the Homem line draws its benefits: the cupuaçu betain, and essential oils of candeia, mint, sage ...  The Homem aftershave gel, for example, contains 74.4% ingredients of renewable botanical origin. As for the packaging, it is meant to be both sober and practical while remaining faithful to Natura values by being recycled. The Homem line will be available in France from September 7, and be promoted and sold by the 18,000 Natura beauty consultants and at the Maison de Natura Brasil, in Paris.  It may be surprising to sell a men’s line through a network of women consultants. At Natura, they concede that “It is not necessarily an asset, even if the advisors say they need this range that will probably be offered to men.”  Anyway, Natura now seeks to recruit male consultants.  The brand also formed a partnership with the Comptoir de l’Homme, so that the line will be available for 6 months in their shop in the Rue de Tournon."
Mascaras like crazy,"Premium Beauty News -You have developed together a whole series of truly original mascaras which are obviously drawing everyone’s attention. Could you explain what your approach consisted in exactly? Franco Lucá - The motivation to innovate in this direction is that we strongly believe that the segment of celebrities will become more and more important in the future. On top of that we want to demonstrate that with the experience and expertise that Geka has, we are able to manufacture very complex shapes as an example the “Sexy Lady” leg mascara. In addition to that we have introduced a new closing system which we call “Snap-In closure” which leads to cost savings in the filling process. This is a patented and protected system as well as the bended solution for the stem of the mascara leg. For the “Sexy lady” corsage mascara Geka wants to show that we are able to work on an improved return on investment that our customers has done. That exactly means, that with our “click system” of the packaging, designed by Enrica Ancorotti, we are able to use existing moulds and change the appearance and perception of the consumer and the pack. As we emphasized in different interviews we strongly believe that Geka is able to transform creativity into industrial solutions with a high productivity. Enrica Ancorotti - Every woman loves to take care of her beauty and wishes to reinvent it every day according, why not, to her mood. With this collection, I tried to change the classic bottle of mascara we used to have in our make-up bag. We will never leave this classic bottle, but our idea is to accompany it with a new and personal touch, an object that could be a collectible item for our beauty. As a matter of fact, I think that art and beauty are keywords of our woman being. Our eyes are the deepest source of beauty: they express our true self. This is the reason why, when I create collections, I imagine woman as the artist of herself, as she can decorate, embellish, but also mask her own glance. Premium Beauty News -These new mascaras could become collectibles to start with? Franco Lucá - You are right. We are working with different celebrities. The leg mascara as an example will be launched in the near future and shows that we have identified a new trend and niche market. Premium Beauty News - Industrially speaking could these mascaras be produced in large quantities? Franco Lucá - It is mandatory that everything Geka develops is produced in large quantities. According to Franco Lucá, CEO of Geka World, “MakeUp in Paris is an event really worth to visit. Geka will showcase trendy new products which are non-exclusive and offer a great price-performance ratio. The Geka showroom can be described with a single word: Hollywood!” Precisely, Michele Burke, Geka’s make-up artist is flying in from Hollywood to do live make-up demonstrations and product presentations. “Michele is the winner of two Academy Awards and Geka has a very close cooperation with her. She gives us input on tips and tricks that she has developed during her twenty years experience working with top actresses and actors in the film industry,” says Franco Lucá. Franco Lucá considers MakeUp in Paris as an occasion to share Geka´s expertise and Michele Burke’s experience in creating such flawless makeup needed in Hollywood movies. One outstanding product out of the Geka - Michele Burke cooperation is the “Lip Definer Max” applicator, which was presented during the latest Cosmoprof in Bologna. The secret of this applicator is that its shape was inspired by the “pinky finger” of Michele. Now, the tool yields a very tactile quality to the application that feels like touching your own lips. The flexible, soft flocked applicator is a patented creation of Michele Burke, exclusively produced and distributed by Geka. This eye-catching lip applicator will be launched on the market within the next months."
Cosmetic pencil sharpeners become green with Eisen,"First of all, Eisen will highlight the Multi-Purpose Sharpener, a true beauty tool. “Our customers who are the true experts can also tell the difference at the sight of it, because after sharpening the pencil with the Eisen sharpener, in the end, only the mirror was missing to apply the product perfectly… well now, the mirror is built right into the sharpener which makes it the perfect beauty tool right at your fingers”.

Alcan’s make-up strategy focuses on “the three WOWs”,"Premium Beauty News - You put in place a proactive approach in the make-up segment with, since the early 2000s, the active cooperation of make-up artist Michel Limongi. But the process has clearly gained momentum in recent months. At Cosmoprof, your stand was very much looking like a ""make-up workshop"". Olivier de Saignes - Quite true! But what we want is to innovate differently, in other words, focus on the real benefit for consumers. We also want to enhance the dialogue with our direct customers and offer innovations which are really in line with their true brand identity. Finally, innovation is also the result of a real partnership centered on a new concept, with or without exclusivity, for one or more customers. Premium Beauty News - Where does innovation come from and how does it come true? Olivier de Saignes - There isn’t really any special recipe! Our Creative Director, Michel Limongi holds regular meetings to work with consumers in order to understand their problems and needs. He then translates the results into new packaging concepts which become through the work of our innovations and development teams, tomorrow’s products  providing real benefits to end consumers both in terms of  make-up but also care. This is what we call at Alcan Packaging Beauty the third ""WOW effect"". PremiumBeauty News - Precisely, what do you call the third ""WOW effect""? Olivier de Saignes - It’s a wink of course but based on a sound reality. We just wanted to say that ideally we needed to generate three moments of satisfaction (the WOW) from the end-consumer. The first, when she sees the packaged product. The look of it must be attractive.  The second one,  when she opens the package and discovers an interesting formula with an effective applicator. The third one is simply when she has satisfaction using the product.  If we get the three, it means we’ve hit the bull’s-eye! Premium Beauty News - You are in a full service approach? Olivier de Saignes - We can actually offer turnkey solutions to our customers by integrating the pack, the applicator and the customized formula, but it does not stop there. Actually, our offer includes 4 stages: First of all, our core business is truly packaging (stage 1) and if the ""plus"" on this make-up segment is actually the applicator to get the expected result (stage 2), it is clear that we’ll never propose the applicator without the packaging but ""with"" the packaging. Then, the formula is obviously fundamental. And our Beauty Solution Services Department working with suppliers selected for their know-how, is in a position to offer the ""right"" formula, i.e. the appropriate one for the desired make-up effect. That’s the third stage of our offer developed with our suppliers. Of course, our range of propositions doesn’t stop there. We even offer customized promotional products. The fourth stage is our ability to generate new concepts. This is what we achieved with ""Roll On Accord Parfait"". We are, of course, ""a proposal force"" and for example we regularly organize in our premises at Gennevilliers near Paris, presentations of new product concepts. Our approach is undoubtedly to know and understand market trends, to find the right formula, the right applicator and, of course, the appropriate packaging. All this is only conceivable if we also keep in mind concepts related to rapid implementation, globalization of our markets and customer markets as well, and of course, of cost optimization. Premium Beauty News - In terms of innovation, you have been quite busy! In particular regarding mascara.  Olivier de Saignes -  You are right, we have been very active in the mascara segment and we are not stopping there! This was actually one of the strong points of our presence at Cosmoprof Bologna where our visitors were ""welcomed"" at our booth with huge mascaras in the middle of which Michel Limongi was working. It’s impossible to detail them all, but we can single out a few models like the one called ""APB1"" with the crowned teeth at the tip of the applicator allowing lash-by-lash application and providing very good combing. There is also ""Threaded Rod"". This applicator with no teeth allows a good loading of formula, with no combing at all. The results will very much vary depending on the kind of formula used. The main goal of this applicator is the curling effect, perfect to push the lashes up and towards the eyelid, without making stains on the eyelid skin. While ""Dual Comb"" is another range of mascara applicators with short spread teeth for quick loading to optimize volume, longer tight teeth for improved combing, to shape the lashes and flat sides to curl the lashes, pushing the lashes upward with no risk of stain on the eyelid skin. And there are still a lot, under development!"
Oekabeauty: a new series of applicators for lip gloss and mascara,"Premium Beauty News - Is it still possible to innovate with regard to mascara and lip gloss applicators? Frank Bierkandt (Oekametall’s Assistant to the General Management and Sales Manager) - Of course, it still possible to innovate! Obviously, things had to be done wisely. Which is precisely how we operated with ourlip gloss applicators. Because for instance the use of a traditional ""flock"" covering the core remained almost unavoidable for a proper application of lip gloss. We tried everything but doing without it didn’t offer any good results. However, it was necessary, to improve the ""storage"" capacity of gloss on the applicator so that the consumer would not wast her time dipping her applicator ceaselessly in and out of the vial. There were already one or two existing systems but the trick used for our two new applicators Boost-your-lips! and Double-boost-your-lips! lies in their tank-shaped applicator. It was a simple enough idea, somebody just had to think of it. And it works! We also propose Smooth-lips, which is a flocked applicator with a very soft and particularly supple touch. Premium Beauty News - And a new mascara too? Frank Bierkandt - Indeed, we are launching What-a-brush!, a new plastic injected mascara applicator. The shape of the brush is very special with its curved central portion which allows loading greater quantities for an optimum high volume delivery. Premium Beauty News - A series of new products at a time when the activity is strong again? Frank Bierkandt - The activity is much stronger, obviously! And the market is eager to discover new products, which is very exciting. It’s an opportunity for us to continue our international development and I can tell you beforehand that we have reached a trade agreement with the company ABA Packaging in the United States to better penetrate this huge market."
Kosmoda: The latest in make-up powders,"Premium Beauty News - Kosmoda is not really a start-up, is it? Dario Moretti - No, not strictly speaking! It was created in March 2007. It is the result of the acquisition of Planet, a company which already had an experience of over ten years in the production of cosmetics. Of course, Kosmoda has nothing to compare today with what Planet wasin the past. Needless to say that since its takeover, we have heavily invested. Premium Beauty News - What is Kosmoda’s offer? Dario Moretti - In order to offer our customers optimum service and to keep track of requests and constant market requirements, we started by setting up a team with strong experience and invested in product research and development but also in the production tool. Currently, we are able to offer a variety of compact powders, meteorites, loose powders, lipsticks, lipgloss, foundations, mascaras. Actually, almost the entire range of make-up products. In particular, we have gained experience in the manufacture of cooked products. An exclusive and patented process allows us to propose powders with a degree of finish and varieties in shapes never seen before. You will have to excuse me for not telling you more on the subject but on the other hand we will be delighted to welcome our visitors at Cosmoprof Bologna to tell them more.
More generally, and thanks to the significant investments made by Kosmoda in production, we have a production capacity of about 1,500,000 pieces per month. Not to mention other investments carried out in filling and packaging machines, allowing Kosmoda to offer a truly comprehensive service. Premium Beauty News - How far does Kosmoda extend its operations nowadays? Dario Moretti - Currently, our sales are achieved on the Italian, German, Spanish and Middle East markets, but we obviously hope to extend our influence to French and North-European markets."
L’Occitane debuts peony-inspired makeup line,"A legend tells that a beautiful nymph named Peonia was so adored and cherished by the gods that a jealous goddess turned her into a flower with a thousand petals, a peony.  This flower then turned to be a symbol of beauty and femininity in the Mediterranean area. In order to better understand the secrets of this flower and transpose them into the world of make-up, L’Occitane consulted French peony expert and lover Jean-Luc Rivière, who comes from a rich family history of having cultivated and studied the flower for 160 years. “The extraordinary range colour palette of peonies grown by the Rivière family, inspired a make-up line with fresh and natural colours, reflecting the variety of the flowers and bearing their names,” says L’Occitane in a release. For each product, L’Occitane created an original decoration inspired from a specific flower, and the products are sold in a kind of “seed sachet”, with an image of a specific family of peony flower that best captures that product’s shade. For the development of the cardboard primary packaging, L’Occitane called upon HCT’s know-how who had to deal with several challenges: – a textured and laminated paper was proposed to give the cardboard range a specific touch, as specified by L’Occitane’s marketing team,
– the development and harmonisation in a short time of 17 different decorations, each of them highlighting a specific type of peony. In order to reduce the environmental impact of the products, all the sachets and packaging are printed on paper from sustainable forests. For the formulation of this make-up line, L’Occitane has prioritized naturalness without abandoning the rationale for the make-up: the variety of colours, the pleasure during the application and product performance. “All the products in the collection contain an exclusive natural peony extract with softening properties and a mica coated with mimosa from Provence that brings smoothness to the formulations and adds comfort during the application,” the company said. All products are paraben free and L’Occitane claims that the use of synthetic pigments was restricted to 2% of the formula and that of silicone to 5%. The makeup range features eye, cheek and face colours, as well as a bronzer, lip colours and gloss."
Eternelle : perfuming is an art,"“Eternelle introduces an innovative technology that revives the elegance and tradition of a timeless gesture to spray luxury fragrances,” says Aptar. While some perfumery brands are trying to get back to their roots, Aptar beauty+home is bringing “exceptional technology to enhance the art of perfuming”. Indeed, this perfume atomizer, which is apparently very traditional, brings the assurance of a simple and effective locking mechanism. This patented innovation allows for locking the bottle with a simple quarter turn and guarantees with absolutely certainty that it is perfectly leak-proof. Furthermore, the bulb is designed so as it can be mounted directly onto the perfume bottle on the production line. This will allow consumers to discover the object in its entirety when they open the box. Eternelle has been designed with total respect for the fragrance.  It adapts to FEA 15 (Seal Tight) and Europa 4 bottle necks and allows the same bottle to be used for both a classic spray version as well as a bulb spray version
without any adaptation. “Eternelle is an innovative perfume atomiser, the first of its kind on the market demonstraing that the art of perfuming is all about the gesture… the timeless gesture of Eternelle,” says the company in a release. Enhancing this launch, in tune with Eternelle’s ""spirit of luxury"", Solev, the specialist in packaging decoration design for perfumes, cosmetics and spirits, has created a silvery metal veil that descends over the bottle, gradually revealing a deep purple tone. A silk-screen print provides the finishing touch."
Womanity.com: towards a new generation brand?,"Thierry Mugler seized the occasion of the international women’s day, on the 8 of March, to unveil its new concept of virtual community dedicated to women: womanity.com The website is articulated around the word that names it.  It is precisely the name “womanity” which is supposed to enhance the visitors’ creativity. “Members are invited to reveal their own definition of Womanity, and their curiosity is awakened by dynamic, changing content (video, photography, articles, and posts) that is in turn inspiring, entertaining, profound, lighthearted, and even provocative,” says the brand in a release. The site’s content may still evolve and all of its functionalities will be available in June. Womanity.com currently features a mosaic of diversified contents: literary, artistic, journalistic... In the wake of the Blogalaxy, launched in 2007, which offered its members the opportunity to share their ideas and thoughts about the world of Thierry Mugler by creating their own personal blogs, and following the creation of the Island of Dr. Muglerstein on Second Life, and the launch of an on-line boutique in September 2007, Womanity.com continues Thierry Mugler’s  innovative communication initiatives throughout the web. “A brand must seek to break away from the elementary notion of broadcasting a message. Through UGC (User Generated Content), we place customers at the core of our thinking about the brand, sparking interaction through constant exchange,” notes Joël Palix, president of Clarins Fragrance Group and the Thierry Mugler brand. The brand intends to reach 2 million contributors by the end of 2010, and be fully interactive with existing social networks and online communities, Facebook and Twitter coming first. Womanity.com was launched worldwide, in six languages (English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, and Portuguese) and seven different versions. To reach its goal the brand chose to partner with leading experts in their respective fields: – Johannes Leonardo, a full-service creative advertising agency based in New York, which acknowledges consumers as an active medium, not just a destination.
– Microsoft Advertising, to pilot the site’s technical development, both for their expertise in ergonomics and their powerful capacity to generate traffic (more than 500 million MSN and Windows Live users worldwide) to a high quality audience.
– Maxus, a WPP GroupM media agency, provided strategic insight and project management for the development of womanity.com.
– Balistik*Art is a digital design agency based in Paris and specialized in luxury brands, is in charged of the strategic implementation of digital communication. The ulterior motive of Clarins Fragrance Group and the Thierry Mugler brand is that Womanity evolve from its current status of a “content brand” towards a brand in the deepest sense of the word, through the impetus of women themselves: “meaning that products created by the Womanity community become a reality, an inevitable next step for the creative platform - a highly original yet fully logical extension of the extraordinary range of possibility offered by womanity.com.”"
Blue Marble Energy and Sweet Anthem Perfumery partner to launch carbon neutral fragrance,"Named for the Greek goddess of the dawn, the Eos fragrance line contains only biochemical and organic materials. The range, which comprises a feminine scent and a masculine/unisex scent, is said carbon neutral since it does not contain any petroleum derivative.  Actually, Eos scents feature a special selection of Blue Marble Energy’s carbon neutral bioester as the top note, while the heart notes and low notes have been blended with Sweet Anthem’s custom product, which are locally sourced from distributors of organic, sustainable, or wild harvested materials. To make these bioesters, BME utilizes cellulosic biomass - in this case, certified organic spent brewery grain [1] - reclaiming the useful material through a patented conversion technology. The results of this process are refined to produce bioester fragrances that are ready for blending and, according to BME, can replace various petrochemicals already in the market. “The potential outlets for our biochemicals are vast,” says BME’s Chief Science Officer, James Stephens. “Fragrance is just one of many examples in which carbon neutral, renewable biochemicals can directly replace polluting petrochemicals in high value products.”"
Parfums Corolle: design for little emperors,"The launch of Parfums Corolle should represent a new milestone in the development of the still recent segment of selective perfumery for children. For the first time, a renowned designer, Serge Mansau was asked to develop an original and innovative bottle for children. In a few simple ideas, he managed to transpose to the universe of perfumery the identity of a singular brand. Created in 1979, Corolle is currently the leading brand for high end dolls in France. Designed by a French company based in Langeais, near Tours, and incorporated since 1989 to the Mattel Group, Corolle dolls are distributed in 29 countries. ""For thirty years, Corolle dolls have been vanilla perfumed and distinguish themselves with a wide range of clothing. This doll dressing game has been recreated in an original way adding the perfume product"" explains Frédéric Beaulieu, CEO of The Millennium Essence Company, which has a worldwide license for the exploitation of the brand in Perfumery. Ten years after the launch of Kaloo parfumes, which still remains a best-selling product in the segment (nearly 16% market share in France, behind Tartine & Chocolat and Jacadi) and the launch in 2003 of Clayeux Perfumes, Frederic Beaulieu wanted to rely on ""best talents to design an exceptional product."" Serge Mansau’s key idea was to create the shape of a little girl embossed on the bottle, a shape that little users can dress up in different outfits, just like they do with their Corolle dolls. A plain idea, but demanding a technical achievement that proved more difficult than expected, as to comply The Millennium Essence Company to delay the launch. ""The design of the three small thermoformed plastic clothes that come with the bottle was a real challenge"", explains Frederic Beaulieu. ""Manufacturers skilled in the sheet by sheet thermoforming no longer exist in France, and to find one in Europe was not easy, especially with our technical requirements. Eventually, it’s a Spanish company specialized in the manufacturing of relief maps that took up the challenge and managed the blanking of the product as we wanted it"". A patent was even filed for the system implemented to lay plastic parts on relief glass. Corolle perfumes exist in three fragrances: Vanilla, Cherry, Rose et Fleur (Rose and Flower). They are available in bottles or in gift boxes with a Corolle doll, following the concept that made the success of Kaloo perfumes. The design of the 60 ml bottle was entrusted the French glassmaker Pochet. The Surlyn stopper was manufactured by Codiplast, the pump and pump cover by EMSAR.  The fragrances are signed Mane, Robert and Expressions Parfumées. With the launch of Parfums Corolles, The Millennium Essence Company intends pursuing the route leading to the position of market leader for children fragrances. A niche that still represents 1% in market value and 2% in volume, and which is particularly strong in travel retail where The Millennium Essence Company achieves nearly 25% of its turnover. ""These are ideal gifts on a trip return, the guilty gift par excellence,"" explains Frederic Beaulieu. The segment also benefits from the advent of the spoiled child from new family models and the standard of two children per couple. ""A newborn baby, at birth, receives an average of 32 presents and thereafter children continue to be pampered, not just at Christmas or on birthdays."" Many reasons to be optimistic for the future, especially since this family model is globalizing itself."
Qualipac presents an antibacterial polymer for fit its dispensing jar,"The ""dispensing jar"" recently developed and marketed by Qualipac has made further progress in its conception. The dispensing principle associated to the jar was already a clever one. Once the lid of the jar is removed a simple finger push on a piston releases a dose of cream through a dispensing orifice (membrane). This dispensing jar allows simple gestures with no outside contaminants. As far as security is concerned, the jar was already equipped with tamper-evident indicators. ""The elastomeric membrane incorporates a first use indicator"", people at Qualipac explain. But today, the piston is made from anti-bacterial polymers to help protect the cream in contact with it. The capacity is 1,7oz/50 ml, with an evacuation rate above 95% Filling is achieved through the bottom of the jar (bottom base opened), piston being in the up position and lid closed. The packaging operations are reduced to filling and connecting (hook-ups) the bottom base.  All other operations, namely heat sealing of the membrane, screwing of the lid and finishing are carried out upstream by Qualipac."
Samples : 3D sachet with cap,"The French contract packer and sachet spécialist LCE SA has produced new stand-up sachets with resealable cap for Lancaster Sun Sport new product range. The advantage of this 3D sachet, used here as a 10ml sample dose, in addition to the stand-up position on the shelves, is the ability to pack more product in a reduced amount of packaging. Alcan Packaging Montreuil-Bellay, specialised into flexible packaging for pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications, printed and laminated the multilayer structure with an aluminium foil. This laminate brings to the sachet the right combination of flexibility and resistance, and preserves the active ingredients of the sun gel, even in extreme climate conditions. The large surface for communication and high quality sandwich rotogravure printing are key for the promotion of the brand image and the product range colour codes. The 3D sachet with cap can be opened and reclosed any time, and restitute easily the product until the last drop. Handy, resistant, funny, he will follow the consumer everywhere and is perfectly adapted to an active and nomadic lifestyle. Lancaster customers can try and adopt this new product range in real life conditions."
Samples bring innovation,"Premium beauty News - Eventually, the current crisis may have a positive impact on innovation, in particular in the samples and promotional items industry.  Ludovic Anceau [1], you are directly concerned by this evolution, how do you explain it? Ludovic Anceau - As far as promotional items are concerned, it is clear that consumers buying expensive products in a beauty shop are expecting to receive gifts such as unit dose items, for instance, which are increasingly considered as interesting gifts rather than as a cheap imported gadgets. Regarding samples, they perfectly fulfil their function, which is to help people to try a product, before buying it, or to help to recruit new consumers by offering additional opportunities to test a product in good hygienic conditions. Premium beauty News - Actually, your customers are seeking for new and confirmed concepts that are easy to display, with the aim to facilitate the discovery of the most expensive products? Ludovic Anceau - Exactly!  In particular as innovation is easier in the samples industry because of the processes we use and because of the geographic proximity between the various operators.  Furthermore, required tooling investments are not expensive, in particular as we propose a full service that includes the product fill-in. Moreover, this innovation is affordable.  It is possible to seduce or to grant gifts to consumers, and to differentiate one’s products at a very low cost, and that is very welcomed in current times. Premium Beauty News - In such a context Socoplan-Biopack was able to demonstrate its creativity. Ludovic Anceau - That’s true! Our development teams made a good job. Our Mascarapack and our Glosspack can attest that! So far, mascara was the only make-up product that was almost impossible to test at the beauty counter.  Our system is highly hygienic and uses the same brush as the real product and its formula corresponds to the one of on-sale products. Let’s also name the Etuidose.  A very competitive combination of a perfume sample between two small pockets that can contain assorted products. And, of course, the Self-warming Unidose, for warming up formulaes that require heat before being used."
Samples not like the others,"Indigo by Valois and Cofatech have joined their respective know-how to present Cosm’in, a flat sachet with a resealable and customisable cap.  The product is dispensed at the centre of the cap by simply squeezing the sachet.  The base of the cap is transparent and allows to see the colour and the quantity of product left. “Cosm’in is perfectly suitable for cross sampling, mailings or magazine insertion, but also on points of sale. The sachet, which perfectly addresses the needs of travellers, and of those with a lifestyle correlated with a fragmented consumption.  Thanks to its size, quality and solidity, it is also a real portable mini packaging, that can be transported and used several consecutive times,” claim the two companies. As far as its patented dispensing system is concerned, the new MDS could transform the way final consumers are using pumps and products. For the development and the sale of this product of this product in Europe, Sicofor is partnering with the US company Poly-D, who owns the patent. The MDS is engineered with only a few parts. First, there is a button that can be customized for size, push pressure and exact amount dosed per full stroke. Then there is the valve that is designed for your specific viscosity and dose. And last, there is the pouch, made from a plastic film that is designated based on the chemistry of the product. Then, just put the sample in thehand and push. The dose comes out and the package automatically seals up tight. So easy, so neat, so economical."
Prestigious launches for Axilone,"For the new Boss Orange fragrance, Axilone made a U shaped envelope from a single block of anodised with a mirror effect metal. This envelope where the brand name is engraved was sculpted and forcibly moulded to perfectly marry the contours of the bottle. Axilone also designed and produced the cap for the bottle of Lacoste’s new perfume for men, Challenge. The cap and collar are made using an overmoulded bi-injection process. An elastomer polymer was used to provide a soft touch effect, similar to that of a tennis racket grip. Axilone overcame the technical problems of production by using PP and bi-injection. For A Scent, by Issey Miyake, Axilone created a cap, which takes on the aspect of a block of ice. The juxtaposed polished and frosted rectangular faces, punctuate the pure and raw lines of the bottle. As a whole, the artefact looks as if it is frozen. The cap is made from Surlyn and produced in three sizes. Even with the cap off, the bottle loses none of its feel and look of transparency. The spray pump cover is also made from a translucent material so as not to detract from the « pure and infinite beauty » of the crystalline object as a whole. Eventually, for Zen for Men by Shiseido, Axilone designed a cap with a sophisticated combination of refined, pure, angular lines and reflections. “The shade of blue evokes the infinite power of time and space. Silver adds sophistication and confidence. And when brought together, the two colours symbolise spiritual energy”. The cap is made up of a number of parts manufactured from galvanised plastic: an insert in black PP ; an extra element to provide weight and an air of solidity; a metal, mirror effect sheet covered with a piece of polished SAN."
"Strand makes its ""Rev’Olution""","Premium Beauty News - What lead Strand to present this brand new range of eco-friendly products? Dominique Bouvier – A need for authenticity, a need to be reassured, to believe in something, to find one’s roots, to go back to a simpler life, more natural ..., cosmetics, in the same way doesn’t escape from this ground swell.

We drew our inspiration from nature, nature which is so abundant with resources that help us creating different formulas to attract consumers increasingly eager for naturalness.

Laboratoires Avène present D.E.F.I.: a new cap on a new tube ,"The D.E.F.I. system is developed for the first time ever, all industries combined, by Laboratoires Dermatologiques Avène.  D.E.F.I., in French for Dispositif Exclusif Formule Intacte (Exclusive Device for an Intact Formula), offers the possibility to use sterile formulas, with no preservatives in a large tube capacity. A special inner sleeve for the tube was manufactured to adapt to the new ""D.E.F.I"" cap system.  These two parts (sleeve and cap) overlap perfectly and provide total sealing. The ""D.E.F.I"" cap consists of four parts including a flexible membrane that uplifts when pressure is applied on the tube to resume initial position when pressure is released. These are very high precision components, manufactured to the hundredth of a millimetre, to ensure perfect coherency to the whole. Sealing controls are performed at different stages of cap assembling. Finally, the cover fits perfectly on to the cap (no space in between) and is sealed by a inviolability clip which will only be removed by the end customer. The Avène’s Toléance Extrême range, are the first care products to benefit from the D.E.F.I. system.  The range consists in a set of skincare products, free from preservative, fragrance and surfactants, and dedicated to hypersensitive of allergic skins and persons looking for safety."
Roll’ on Accord Parfait by L’Oréal Paris: an innovation from Alcan Packaging Beauty,"No more brush or sponge required to apply the compact foundation but a mini roller of 10 mm in diameter that can just take the right amount of product and apply it in a perfectly uniform way, creating what specialists call a flawless effect with no overloading. An innovation that we owe to Michel Limongi, esthetician, makeup artist, teacher and creative director for Alcan Packaging Beauty. “In fact, he explains, this new concept is really a concentrated approach of what I have always followed since the day I developed a passion for the beauty of women.” According to Michel Limongi, it is essential to create makeup products that are in perfect harmony with the needs of women. And to achieve this, ""we must listen, study, propose, test... , and test again. We must also and above all, teach women how to apply makeup. It is in my training center, that this whole process is set up to give life to our new concepts, centered on the real needs and expectations of consumers.” While brands have now achieved an excellent quality control of their formulas, ""we must now associate the proper applicators to obtain the makeup effect desired by women” And the Roll ‘on Accord Parfait is certainly the best outcome of this theory. It is the symbol of the ideal combination between an efficient applicator tool and a formula, created by L’Oreal Paris, perfectly adapted to this new application technique.  “In this case, you simply roll out the formula. So a new gesture is created, but also and above all a professional result within consumer reach… this is what guides my everyday-work”, explains Michel Limongi, It is easy to guess that for teams working under his leadership at the Research and Development Center for Alcan Packaging Beauty in Gennevilliers, this is a daily… but yet exciting challenge. ""The trio Pack-tool-formula is essential.

The alchemy of nail polish according to Fiabila,"Premium Beauty News - Fiabila has presented its new collection of nail polishes for this winter. Estelle Miasnik – Our collections are always inspired by trends issued from trends offices, fashion and indoor-decoration professionals and various exhibits. The expression of color is nonetheless subjective, intuitive, it springs from our memories, our emotions. A color has always a story to tell, it is timeless in essence but marries to natural or artificial material, simple or sophisticated, to exist, to unveil new concepts, new words. Creating new colors, means to borrow some from the past to reveal the colors of tomorrow, all the better. It is expressing the transparency of water, the freshness of a rose petal, a journey through time, the brightness of a precious stone, the softness of velvet... Premium Beauty News - What is the particular inspiration of the season? Estelle Miasnik - The inspiration of this season is that of a woman who transforms herself each day according to here fantasy. She is a princess or a she-devil one day, fairy or witch one night, she is driven by here impulses and desires sometimes wearing light and subtle shades, some other time wearing more daring tones, deeper glosses or obscure shades with cosmic reflections. Premium Beauty News - What is your approach regarding nail polishes? Estelle Miasnik – To create new colors of nail polish is first to create the perfect symbiosis between a rebellious material, complying pigments, enchanting nacres and wild ideas, it is to put aside inaccurate shades, capricious reflections, incomplete finishes. It is also to ignore holds of poor quality, impossible dryings, uncontrollable stabilities, it is all about providing an innovative and reliable product, complying of course with global cosmetics regulations. It also to offer enchantment... to help live and vibrate some very small parts of ourselves: nails."

Plastics: innovation against the crisis?,"Even in the context of the current economic slowdown, manufacturers of flexible plastic packaging are holding out and are implementing new strategies that enable them to propose innovative solutions to their customers. Most of these innovations aim at combining positive impact on the environment with economic performance.  “Permanent innovation and saving resources seem to be the keys that enable our industry to adapt to the crisis; working as catalyst for the new order to come,” explains Dominqiue Paul Vallée, ELIPSO’s president. “Reduction at source, packaging optimization from the design step, improvement of our technologies, evolution of materials, and consumers safety, contribute to the creation of packaging products that perfectly match with the expectations of all customers that use it throughout the chain, as well as the final consumer,” he adds. The latest issue of Futurs, ELIPSO’s newsletter, showcases new products proposed by French manufacturers of flexible plastic packaging and designed to meet the needs of a wide scope of industries, including the beauty business. Thus, regarding neutral lotions pumps, Rexam’s Nea pump is designed for the most sophisticated bulks. It offers a unique solution that combines a totally neutral dispensing system, peerless user comfort and a modern design. The new dispensing system’s neutrality is guaranteed by a spring located on the outside of the dosing chamber and the use of a glass bearing. At no time is the formula in contact with metal or elastomer. Regarding the cosmetic pumps segment, Valois’ T10 is an innovative tip designed to equip the Evolux pump range, which prevents the cream from drying out in the push-button nozzle, thus avoiding external contamination to ensure the optimum preservation of the product. As it only opens under pressure from the cream, it remains tightly sealed before use and closes again automatically. Total product protection is guaranteed. As far as customized pumps are concerned, enhancing customization and differentiation options for pumps is still possible. That conviction is reflected in the Clikit™ IP pump by MWV Calmar, a high-end, resin-injected version of the company’s market-leading Melodie® Clikit™pump. A wide array of decorative finishes and attractive high-end coatings such as Iridescence, Sparkle, Soft touch, Metalized lacquering and Custom printing (of any pattern or image through Sublimation) is now available. In the jars segment, Promens’ EasyLock is highlighted. In snap-on mode, this jar delivers maximum efficiency for the filler.  In screw/unscrew version, it provides beauty and healthcare professionals with optimum user comfort. Airtight and tamper-proof, it ensures total product protection. Once the tear off band is taken off, EasyLock is to be used like a normal screwing jar. In volumes from 30 to 1250 ml, the jar is suitable for every pharmaceutical form (powder, gel, cream, tablets, etc.). Eventually, in eye shadow applicators, the Banana Maker proposed by Alcan Packaging Beauty is an innovative applicator that lets consumers make up their eyes with an irresistible “banana” shadow effect. Its spherical shape perfectly hugs the hollow around the eyelid and its flocked tip helps applying just the right product quantity at the right place."
Beauty Challenger Awards: The competition is open!,"“It’s a unique competition in the world, which the profession really looks forward to since it has revealed high potential brands.  It provides competitors with an exceptional chance to present themselves in the best conditions to professionals from selective and alternative distribution channels, who are quite inaccessible out of this context, and who themselves appreciate the direct access to the best of what’s new,” explains Valérie Vanier, the competition director. The jury of the Beauty Challenger Awards offers three different prizes: The Emerging Brands Prize, The Niche Brands Prize, the Special Jury Prize. For the first time, this year there will also be the Beauty Organic Awards, recognizing the best organic certified brand.

So we will have very strong international representation notably with Luxasia,an exclusive distributor in Asia; the Italian La Rinascente; the English Space NK store,which is successfully deploying in the United States; the Russian store Soling. Asia is also honored with representatives from leading department stores in Japan, Hong Kong, China and South Korea,” Valérie Vanier highlights. About 40 brands are participating in one or the other of the competitions, and some of them are running the Beauty Challenger Awards and the Organic Beauty Awards at the simultaneously.

Transparent Packaging adds fragrances to packaging graphics,"Transparent Packaging’s scented boxes allow brand owners and consumer product manufacturers “to attract consumers with another of their product’s key attributes, its fragrance, without the addition of a secondary paper scratch and sniff sticker, which can have a denigrating effect on the packaging image,” explains the company in a release. Various product categories from hair and body care to perfume product companies may find this packaging augmentation a great leap in their branding efforts.  According to David Dennison, Transparent Packaging’s President, several application methods already allows for large scale production runs, as well as relatively low volume specialty product applications. “The response from our clients that have seen the product and its shelf impact potential has been terrific,” he added. The use of transparent plastic folding cartons for product visibility with optional opaque, translucent or holographic print, coupled with the ability to encapsulate any fragrance onto the packaging graphics, does indeed invigorate a the concept of “Multi Sensory Packaging.” With its manufacturing plant in Montreal, Quebec, Transparent Packaging Inc. focuses strictly on the specialized non-paper packaging converting business."
"Zèbre Rouge, products on the go!","The brand’s founders, two experienced professionals with a substantial background in the fashion and beauty industries, partnered with Cosmalia, a French cosmetics designer specialised in natural products free from chemical preservatives.  They created an extensive range of products, easy to carry in a moving world. The brand’s motto  ""Travel light in Beauty, It’s our idea"" perfectly describes their offering which features products manufactured in a soft admixture, at room temperature, in order to preserve the original qualities of the ingredients and actives.  Zèbre Rouge’s products are based on two main active ingredients the red clover and the mallow, which are renowned for their astringent and soothing properties as well as emollient and antioxidant effects. Products follow the new customer’s habits, men and women in developed countries living in societies where travelling has become quite common for a large part of the population.

Plastic bottles for nail polishes by EMS-Grivory,"Premium Beauty News - The cosmetic industry is increasingly seeking for high-tech plastics? Richard Courtois - That’s true. For instance, our range of transparent amorphous polyamides, Grivory G21, is now a reference as a packaging material for the perfumery industry. Actually, Grivory G21 fills the gap between glass and traditional plastics.  Glass has better barrier properties, but it can be broken, and is heavier than plastic.  On the other hand, traditional plastic materials, lack the good barrier properties that allows glass to protect formulations from oxygen, aromas, oils, waxes, solvents or UV rays. With Grivory G21, we successfully combined in a single high-quality material the performances of these two substances.  But Grivory 21’s best assets is certainly its barrier property: our new product efficiently protects high-end cosmetics from external contamination, and also prevents the evaporation of volatile ingredients, subsequently improving products’ durability.  Thanks to its very good barrier properties, Grivory G21 is also a good protection for vitamins that are increasingly part of cosmetic formulations. The amorphous polyamide made by EMS-Grivory also complies with designers’ requirements for the making of original shapes.  High brightness, easy to print on and good resistance to scratches add up to the list.  From design to production, our customers can also benefit from the help of Ganahl, a Switzerland-based company that has developed specific tools adapted to Grivory G21. Premium Beauty News - Among the recent developments, there are also bottles for nail polishes. Can you tell more about that? Richard Courtois - All nail polish manufacturers have tested Grivory G21 for the replacing glass as a material for nail polish bottles.  Provided that it can successfully comply with the specifications, I think that a leading French cosmetics maker will propose such a product by the end of 2009. However, the Chinese company Shyahsin moved faster and showcased seven plastic bottles for nail polish using Grivory 21 during the latest edition of Cosmoprof."
Yves Rocher opts for Unicadose,"Designed by Eskiss Packaging, a French SME, the Unicadose phial [1] features several product benefits: – possibility to drink its contents directly,

The phials are entirely made of transparent or coloured polypropylene. Of course, screen printing decoration is also possible. Eskiss Packaging aims at conquering a significant market share of the huge glass phials market, and paving the way for the development single-dose products on export markets. “Several cosmetics makers and pharmaceutical companies are already testing the Unicadose,” comments a spokesperson of the company."
MGS offers plant-based plastic solutions,"MGS is a family-owned company located in Plastics Vallée closed to Lyon and Geneva. MGS is a pioneer in the plastic injection mastery and has been operating in the high-end perfumery and cosmetics markets since 1972, with specific and standard (jars, lids, boxes) products.

However, considering the growing demand for “green” solutions, MGS now proposes a cosmetic jars from 100% GMO-free vegetable materials."
"Ahrt, clothes turn into cosmetics","To take care of one’s skin simply by wearing clothes, that’s what Ahrt Cosmetics is proposing, with the aim to make cosmeto-textiles technologies more accessible.  Contrarily to the companies that pioneered this segment, such as Skin’Up, Cosmetic Wear, or Lytess, Ahrt does not offer cosmetic clothes, but lotions to apply on one’s own textiles: jeans, tee-shirts, stockings, … By the way, no more concerns regarding the durability of the cosmetic properties given to textiles! The range of cosmeto-textiles solutions proposed by Ahrt Cosmetics is the result of a common venture between MicroCapsules Technologies (MCT), a specialist of micro-encapsulation, and Nobex, a manufacturer of perfumed slippers. When Nobex launched its first perfumed slipper in 2003 (the “cavaricci”) Richard Biernack, its manager, decided to invest further in the associated technology, with the conviction it had a huge potential. Micro-encapsulation is a process in which tiny active particles or droplets are surrounded by a coating, in that case a silicone coating, that allow them to spread around when the coating is crushed, during the contact between clothes and the skin, for instance. That’s only in 2008 that the new generation of cosmeto-texile products is available.  Several years of research and development, as well as stringent sensitivity tests have been necessary. There are three lotions in the range, respectively with slimming, moisturizing and refreshing effects. The lotions are to be used during machine or hand washing, as if they were mere fabric conditioners, linen thus becoming soaked with the microcapsules. The lotions also contain hemp oil, caffeine or menthol in order to leave a pleasant contact sensation and a delicate fragrance on clothes. The products are available online, through Ahrt’s website (www.ahrt-cosmetics.com). Products will soon be distributed in mass retail and speciality stores in France."
"Nominoë, when cosmetics act local and think global","As many other young cosmetic brands, Nominoë - named after a historical character who participated in the foundation of the old Duchy of Brittany - offers organic-certified formulations.  However, the brand also wants to demonstrate that “it is possible to make high end products, simultaneously simple and organic, and based on botanicals that have not been imported from the other side of the world,” says Jeremias Martins, Nominoë’s founder. With the aim to protect the environment, Nominoë also tries to limit supply chain induced transports by using a maximum of local ingredients. Products are formulated with actives extracted from plants grown in Brittany and strictly selected. Formulations mix substances as unusual as gorse water, artichoke or buckwheat extracts, or broom, or rock samphire extracts, with more common ingredients such as strawberry akenes, bees-wax or sesame oil are also. Products offer anti-oxidizing, purifying and moisturizing actions. Nominoë products are certified by Ecocert, they are free from parabens and aluminium and only contain natural preservatives. The brand’s commitment to environmental responsibility also covers products’ packaging. All bottles are made of easily recyclable plastics and sold without secondary packaging. Black and White labels are obviously a wink to Brittany’s flag. A round-shaped opening in the label allows to see ermine spots printed on the inner side!  On each label a triskelion underlines the Celtic roots of the brand. Eventually, as nothing was made by chance, a yellow border remains the colour of gorse flowers. For its labels as for its packaging, the brand claims to work only with « French SMEs having a human size », with the aim to provide customers with high added value products only. Initially available in selected points of sale in Brittany, the young brand carries on its extension and can now be found in about twenty shops all over France, in organic retail shops, beauty salons specialised in organic beauty products and in concept stores. This Brittany-rooted brand does not hesitate to target foreign markets. “Britanny ranks second among French regions that tourists visit the most, it is mostly visited by Northern Europeans and Japanese and Americans. It’s a region with a strong identity,” underlines Jérémias Martins. The Nominoë range currently features a shower gel, an exfoliating body scrub, a body oil, and a gentle foam cleanser. Several creams are expected to complete the range."
A new airless dual mixer,"Pulvorex, a French specialist of foaming dispensing systems, presented a new airless mixer during the latest edition of the Pharmapack tradeshow in Paris.  The new device allows consumers to mix together two components, two liquids or a liquid and a powder, just before using the product. Actually, the system is made of two parts fitted together, each part containing either a liquid or a powder.  Before using the product, the consumer turn the upper part through 180° thus letting its content to flow out in the lower part. The main advantage of this technology is that the entire operation is processed in an airless environment, the final mixture remaining “airless”. At the end of the operation, the final user just has to press the pump to dispense the product. The system is currently available in a 15ml format."
Babor targets the young and active,"Specially formulated to remain active for 24 hours, supplying essential substances for the skin around the clock, the philosophy behinds Babor Basic Care aims to fit with modern and active urban life. The new line has been designed to meet the needs of young women with unproblematic skins but constantly on the move, often with insufficient time for sleep and few time to devote to beauty regimes.  “Even this kind of skin likes to be pampered every now and then, particularly when exhaust fumes, air-conditioned offices and changeable weather conditions take their toll,” Babor explains. Babor Basic Care line features a Lipid Balancing Cream (50 ml) for dry skins with aloe vera, panthenol, macadamia nut and sesame seed oils, and a Moisturizing Cream (50 ml) for mixed and oily skin types with panthenol, polysaccharides and rice starch.  Both products are free from mineral oils. Babor’s other January launch is devoted to the skins of teenagers and young adults that sometimes react sensitively to skin care products and are affected by the variations in hormone levels. The Babor Pure line features “natural ingredients that are custom formulated for the needs of problematic skins,” the company claims.  Babor Pure comprises five products to help youngest skins to maintain their natural balance. Both new lines are launched on the German market in January and shortly after in the sixty other counties where Babor is represented."

Chanel seeks to expand the frontiers of innovation through virtual design,"French fashion and cosmetics house Chanel, through its Research and Technology Unit, apparently carries on working on the technological innovations that will continue to set the brand apart. The Paris-based company is partnering with Dassault Systèmes, the world leader in Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) software solutions powered by 3D, and sister company of French aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation, within the Dassault Group. First used to design complex shapes, 3D now makes it possible to design and manufacture products creating digital mockups, it helps companies to digitally define and simulate products, as well as the processes and resources required to manufacture, maintain and recycle those products and improve the environment. “By combining their expertise, in cosmetics for Chanel, and in 3D technologies and virtualization for Dassault Systèmes, the partners aim to develop unique concepts and explore new territories in life sciences,” Dassault Systèmes said in a release. The first joint project, which is based on the analysis of light and already under way, is co-developed by Chanel Research and Technology and the Dassault Systèmes Design Studio. The aim is to validate new hypotheses and concepts in the beauty sector using virtual software solutions. The project will be finalized in 2010. Other opportunities are also being explored, with an emphasis on virtual simulation and modelling that, according to the two companies, will pave the way for innovative breakthroughs in skin biology and cosmetics."
Eden: 100 % recyclable airless packaging by Airlessystems,"An innovative product, Eden, a 50ml piston system (47 mm diameter), represents a new step forward for Airlessystems.

Vacuum filled or atmospherically filled, Eden provides a maximum protection for the most elaborated formulas by preventing air from entering the barrel. Eden also works perfectly with high viscosity formulation, giving the customers great flexibility."
