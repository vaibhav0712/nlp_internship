PSB Industries: New strategic direction,"Focused on three businesses (beauty packaging with Texen, custom packaging with CGL Pack, and specialty chemicals with Baikowski) and four main markets (beauty, pharmaceuticals, food and lighting), the PSB Industries group confirmed its strength in fiscal year 2012, with revenues up 1.2% (to 248.1 million euros), of which 62% were generated through export. As announced, fiscal year 2012 ended with excellent growth momentum, the second half-year posting an overall growth of 4%. The group holds significant shares of each market where it is operating. Thus, PSB Industries is n°1 worldwide in fine mineral products for lighting and n°1 in France in custom thermoformed packaging. As far as plastic packaging for the cosmetics and perfume industry is concerned, the group ranks n°4 worldwide. It is also in this area, mostly in plastic injection, that the group generates, with Texen, the majority (63%) of its turnover, with prestigious customers such as L'Oréal Paris, Lancôme, Chanel, Dior, Guerlain, Coty, Yves Laurent, Clarins, Yves Rocher, Estée Lauder, etc. In this sector, the group achieved record sales in 2012, with 25 new launches (Chanel, Guerlain, Jimmy Choo...) in France and abroad, in particular in the United States, and its first inroads in the spirits market. On fiscal year 2013, the group anticipates sales growth of close to 5%, and an operating profit of approximately 8% of revenues. According to Olivier Salaun, the new President & CEO of PSB Industries since late 2012, these good prospects give the group opportunities for strategic innovation. ""2013 is a new step in building the PSB Industries Group of tomorrow and we can confidently develop our future strategy that will be unveiled at the end of this halfyear. Our ambition and strategic orientations will focus increasingly on our markets,"" he said. Broadly speaking, the group wants to strengthen its position in North America, where Texen made first inroads in 2008 with the acquisition of Mar-Lee Companies, but also in Asia (Indonesia, China, India) where Texen will have to support its customers. As far as South America is concerned, the group, which owns a factory in Mexico, seeks the best way to serve the Brazilian market. ""When it is about perfumes and cosmetics, we also know that we are very close from other sectors. We have already identified interesting development opportunities in the spirits market. We're also considering what is happening in the pharmaciteucals sector. However, these whole issues are still under consideration,"" adds Olivier Salaun. Concerning the scope of the group, the management of PSB Industries says that all options are possible: from acquisition to divestment. In the beauty packaging industry however the trend is clearly to the consolidation of the main operators, in particular as some regionally-sized SMEs could be interested to acquire. Answers will come very soon."
Mega Airless: New production site to address rising demand for airless packs,"The demand for 'added value' skin care products is leading to the development of more advanced and fragile formulations, thus boosting the demand for protective airless packages. The increasing use of sensitive actives and the trend to less, or even no, preservatives in formulas have the same consequence. In order to address this demand, Mega Airless, a leader in the design, manufacture and marketing of airless dispensing solutions, has kicked off the building of a new production site in Villingen, in South Western Germany. Lucyna Silberstein, the company's CEO, has just inaugurated the works that should be completed by the end of 2013. The production should start in the first quarter of 2014. This 15,000 sqm facility will handle production for Mega Airless's cosmetic and pharmaceutical customers, including moulding, assembly, logistics, and decoration (such as silk-screening, labelling and hot-stamping). ""We design and manufacture high-performance airless packaging solutions for a growing group discerning brand owners,"" said Silberstein. ""So it is fitting that our new, larger facility is also 'high-performance' – to further accelerate supply chain efficiencies and deliver the level of quality and service our customers expect and deserve."" According to the company's top manager, the new facility is designed for optimal efficiency and will actually beat Germany's EnEV 2009 energy savings requirements by 22 percent, thanks to intelligent construction and HVAC [1] design. In addition to such features as daylight dependent lighting controls, the building's energy consumption is reduced through capture of waste heat from the injection moulding process and ventilation system and storage of heat in underground sprinkler tanks. Mega Airless offers all-plastic German-engineered neutral airless dispensing systems. The company has more than 25 years of experience with airless technology and holds 30 patents. Engineered for full recyclability, the company's airless systems comply with EcoCert, NaTru, Oko-Test and other international labels increasingly important in many countries throughout the world. All Mega Airless dispensers are equipped with the company's exclusive airless pump that offers unsurpassed neutrality, precise and consistent dosage, optimal product recovery and convenient 360-degree operation. According to the company, they are designed to handle a wide range of viscosities, including the most demanding new formulations used in today's creams, gels, lotions and pastes."
Albéa: a new range of pump + tube solutions,"The latest edition of Cosmopack, which was held in Bologna on the 7-10 March 2013, was the occasion for Albéa to focus on the synergies arising from the acquisition of Rexam's Personal Care division. The first example of this product synergy is a new range of integrated airless tube + pump packs. According to Carole Grassi, Albéa's Lotion Category Manager, these new high-protection systems represent the enhanced capability of today's ""new"" Albéa, which now offers complete pack solutions for industry reference dispensers, such as the Nea and SP343 pumps, along with its heritage of tube production. ""The 'new' Albéa will help customers simplify product development efforts, shorten supply chains and build their brands,"" says Valérie Lebelt, Tube Category Manager. In the past, Rexam had already launched a range of airless tubes in partnership with CTL. Today, Rexam's expertise in distribution systems is combined with Albéa's know-how in the decoration of tubes. ""Albéa's airless tubes offer the industry's widest range of customization, including decoration technologies such as flexography, silkscreen, offset and hot stamping. All visual effects - whether photo-like, metallic-looking, matte and gloss or 3D printing - are available on dispenser tubes to support customer creativity,"" adds Lebelt. The range is proposed with two types of dispensers. The SP343 pump offers a wide range of finishes and actuator designs, and the ability to handle a wide range of viscosities. The Nea's 100 percent neutrality provides additional protection for delicate formulations and its high suction rate and soft actuation handles even the highest viscosities. The range is now available with 25mm and 30mm diameter Nea pumps and 25, 30 and 35mm SP343 pumps, covering filling capacities from 15ml to 125ml. New formats will be launched in coming months for higher capacities."
Quadpack acquires Technotraf and gets its first production tool ever,"""Wooden packaging components are starting to become popular among beauty brands, but we've only just scratched the surface. This category is set to explode,"" said Quadpack CEO Tim Eaves. ""Technotraf is single-handedly responsible for introducing the concept of wood in beauty packaging back in 2001. It knows more about the subject than any other manufacturer. With Quadpack's support, there will be nothing to stop it from conquering the global cosmetics packaging market."" For sure, Technotraf has a wonderful know-how. Its commercial director, Jaume Ordeig, has demonstrated in a conference during the latest Cosmopack tradeshow in Bologna, how wood can bring a pretty added value to a cosmetic packaging and, most importantly, how Technotraf succeeded in mastering and industrializing the most complex production processes. One of the best examples being the wooden bottle made for Issey Miyake. However, the strategic move also provides Quadpack with its first manufacturing capabilities ever. With the acquisition of Technotraf, Quadpack enters the production world and ceases to be a mere trader selling the products made by others. ""It is interesting for us to have industrial facilities and diversification is not excluded,"" says Philippe Lenglart, Director and co-founder of Quadpack. However, ""the initial purpose of the acquisition was not to get a manufacturing facility"" a group's spokesperson told Premium Beauty News. ""The group considered this acquisition as an opportunity to secure the access to high quality innovative products for its customers. For Quadpack it is also the opportunity to diversify its supply sources towards ethical products: made in Europe from sustainable materials."" Established in 1983, Technotraf is located in Torelló, in a region of Catalonia known as Spain's ""cosmetic valley"". The company sources all its raw material from PEFC-certified sustainable forests and processes it at its 10,000m2 production facilities. Fully equipped with woodturning and computer-numerical controlled (CNC) milling machines, the facility manufactures bespoke fragrance caps, jar caps, bottle caps, boxes and powder compacts that complement make-up, perfumery and cosmetics packaging. The aim of Quadpack is to help Technotraf to expand the market category. ""Quadpack gives us the corporate and financial backing to take our business to the next level. There is no doubt that wood is 'hot' in beauty packaging right now, but we see it as more than a trend. The aesthetic, sensory and technical attributes of wood makes it a long-term candidate alongside other materials such as plastic, glass and aluminium. All it needs is a creative force to develop it and a active campaign to promote it. And with Quadpack behind us, that's exactly what we plan to do,"" commented a Technotraf spokesperson."
Cosmogen sets sail for Brazil,"For about four years, Cosmogen has accompanied the rapid development of the Brazilian beauty market, serving its customers directly from Paris. The French company now intends to develop its business from a local base. ""Our goal is to become a real player in the Brazilian market,"" says Denis Richard Orliange, Chief Operating Officer. Cosmogen therefore opened its own sales office in the country, Cosmogen Do Brasil, which will be headed by Flavio Unikowsky, who joined the company as LATAM Manager. Flavio Unikowsky, who previously worked for the Chromavis group, will report to Christian Najjar, Cosmogen's Export Director. Today, Brazil already accounts for 10% of Cosmogen's sales and the opening of a commercial structure in the country should enable the French company to better serve its existing customers - particularly major players such as O'Boticario, Natura and Avon - but also to conquer new market shares with the numerous Brazilian SMEs and emerging brands. ""Considering the current development of the market,"" Denis Richard Orliange aims to double Cosmogen's sales in Brazil within the next two years. Furthermore Cosmogen showcased several innovations at the Cosmopack tradeshow, which was held in Bologna from March 07 to 10, including two newcomers to its ""Squeeze'N"" range: – Micro Squeez'N Tint, a 16 mm diameter version of the tube and brush applicator, – Mini Squeeze'n Tense, a tube with a SEBS [1] tip on one side to apply the product and a zamac head to smooth it on the other side. As far as cosmetic brushes are concerned, Cosmogen proposes a series of new synthetic fibres and will enter into a partnership with a Paris-based makeup school, with the aim to develop its expertise, in particular regarding the adaptation of the way brushes are cut to better suit to the new formulations used by makeup artists. ""Cosmogen's ambition is to become the true expert in cosmetic applicators. And it is how our customers are increasingly perceiving us,"" concludes Denis Richard Orliange."
Folding boxes: Pusterla 1880 is undergoing its industrial transformation,"Premium Beauty News - Not that easy today to be a producer of folding boxes in Europe and, on top of it, to still be a family owned business? What does Pusterla 1880 represent in 2013? Guiseppe Meana - Not so simple, indeed! We must be vigilant on all fronts and, more specifically, on that of our production system. The challenges facing us are not simple. Competition is fierce, we have to keep our prices as low as possible, market requirements are important and we must constantly adapt ourselves. For us this adaptation, as you know, started several years ago with the desire to be present industrially on the theatres of operation where we needed to be. Hence the successive acquisitions of the company Coffrets Création in 1999, located at the heart of France, then of Cazelles in 2009. Meanwhile we created from scratch in 2004 a factory in Romania, Dacica Teca to meet the increasingly important demand for handmade boxes. The objective of this whole strategy being to create complete and high quality products, by integrating as best as possible the expertise of the four companies under one brand name. The Pusterla 1880 group is now worth some 40 million euros in sales and employs around 240 people. Yet this strategy of industrial integration is not sufficient. It was important to upgrade our whole production system in the four factories and fully optimize all production stages. It takes about one year for each production site. We are halfway through. Premium Beauty News - What are the most important stages in this upgrade? Can you quantify the investment it represents? Guiseppe Meana - It sounds simple but in fact it's actually extremely complicated. Said ""plainly"", it is all about reducing the time of going into production. This means optimizing the entire logistics of our plants and doing it consistently as we work more and more on a just-in-time basis. With the method we implemented, we are now capable of reducing this time for production start-up by nearly 15%. But this requires reorganizing production areas, the flow of raw material to machines, reconsidering work schedules, reorganizing the design and development departments, optimizing the relationship between the different plants we have in Europe etc. An investment which is quite difficult to evaluate but that I estimate at nearly one million euros, apart from the investment in equipment, like this new technique that makes it possible to achieve in a record time the pp sample and to very quickly set machines. To note that we have also acquired in our Italian factory two new die-cutting Bobst machines and a new machine for hot stamping. Premium Beauty News - The beauty industry remains one of your main markets? Guiseppe Meana - Yes it's true, but both the wines and spirits, and especially the Champagne sector have sharply increased. So much so that our sales between the perfume/cosmetics and the wine & spirits sectors are balanced. Premium Beauty News - While France meanwhile, remains your main customer country? Guiseppe Meana - Yes, definitely. As it represents more than 60% of our turnover."
HCP speeds up the pace,"With 4000 people, more than 200 million US dollars in turnover, five factories (three in China, one in the USA and one in Mexico), HCP has impressive assets. This giant is supplying packaging to the make up, skin care and fragrance sectors with a focus based on innovation. ""In order to be able to provide innovation and anticipate the trend of the cosmetic market you obviously need to offer a state of the art industrial platform,"" says Eddy Wu. For that a new production entity will be created in the next coming month on one of the existing production site in China with 20000 sqm which will be designated to produce aluminum components including a significant number of transfer pressing and impact extruded machines with an automatic anodizing line. ""Aluminium was a material which was not fully integrated in our production program and where there is a real need on the market and as packaging manufacturer is was a necessity to offer an integrated solution,"" adds Eddy Wu. As a result, HCP will present a new stock make up range combining aluminium and plastic called Magum range at the next Cosmoprof show in Bologna, Italy. In addition, HCP has established a 'Innovation Council' whereby every month, key executives of the company will get together to discuss new innovation ideas, deciding priority of various ideas and making sure the chosen ideas are being resourced and executed. These include both ideas embracing new designs as well as new product function capabilities. HCP will showcase some of the outcome from the council at the next Cosmoprof show. Beside HCP driven innovation, the group also thinks that it is important to execute well customers' driven new product design development. As such, the group have realigned its' new business development team such that various concerned functions including internal sales; design & drawing and project management teams are gathered under a centrally managed New Business Development Team- the 'NBD' team in order to strengthen responsiveness and quality in executing customers' driven new product design development. But there is more to come. The group wants to increase the production capacity in its American facility producing mascara and to increase by 50 % the production capacity in its Mexico plant. ""In the USA these two plants are strategic to support the new dynamism of the American market, and this production facilities are obviously an important asset for our group,"" highlights Wu. The group is making similar investments in its Chinese plants to improve the process and production capabilities by implementing new technologies and focusing on automation. ""Regarding new lines and new process we are open to any new opportunities in the future. As you know we have a strong position in the colour cosmetic market but we are strengthening our action in the skin care and fragrance market,"" states Wu. Over the latest months, these industrial investments have been supported by the recruitment of new executive teams. ""The people are the most important asset in an organization and a key factor of success and we have made important efforts to add new people to our management team in order to reflect what is our company today: a multi-cultural and performing global group,"" concludes Wu."
U.S. consumers expect more from beauty products packaging,"MWV has launched its ""Packaging Matters"" research with the aim to explore the role of packaging in product satisfaction as consumers purchase, transport, use and dispose of products across 10 different categories. The study was conducted trough an online survey of 3,000 U.S. consumers on their shopping habits and interactions with packaging. The results of the research suggest that packaging satisfaction can have a significant impact on purchase intent and repeat purchase, and that there is a low level of satisfaction overall, especially once consumers leave the store and rely on the structural or functional features of the package at home or on-the-go. The study shows that when it comes to purchase intent and product satisfaction, packaging does matter. A majority of consumers will sometimes buy a product off the shelf without prior knowledge of it (64 percent) and rarely use mobile devices to research a product while shopping (72 percent). While quality (85 percent) and price (67 percent) are the most important factors contributing to overall product satisfaction, consumers report little variance in importance between a product's brand (12 percent) and packaging (10 percent). ""The findings show that consumers rate a product's packaging to be on par with the brand itself (10% vs. 12%). Considering the investment companies make in building their brands compared to their products' packaging, this is significant,"" emphasised MWV. Despite the importance of packaging in consumer's satisfaction, there is a clear opportunity for improvement. Actually, fewer than 20 percent of U.S. consumers report they are ""very satisfied"" with product packaging, with the least amount of satisfaction from carry-out food containers (11%) and beauty care product packaging (17%). ""The research further proves that packaging is one of the most powerful tools in the marketing communications mix, but as it stands now, packaging does not delight consumers,"" said Brian Richard, director, Consumer & Customer Insights, MWV. ""Brands should view the current gap in satisfaction as an opportunity to make improvements to their packaging by focusing on what matters most to consumers."" According to MWV, consumer's satisfaction with packaging ends at the store. Indeed, the study identified ""satisfaction gaps"" between the importance of different packaging attributes and their perceived performance. Of the 15 packaging attributes studied, only a small percentage of consumers ranked shelf appeal, or the product's ""attractiveness"" and ""distinctiveness,"" as ""very important"" features to their satisfaction (6 percent and 10 percent, respectively). However, this is where brands were performing best, with performance exceeding importance. While brands are generally pleasing consumers during the shopping experience, satisfaction drops dramatically when product packaging is relied upon for transport and storage and then when the product is used and reused. The largest satisfaction gaps across categories all relate to the structural features or functionality of the packaging. In terms of importance, consumers want packaging that protects from breaking or spilling (74 percent), maintains product integrity (72 percent) and gets the entire product out of the package (66 percent). ""Packaging satisfaction decreases significantly after consumers leave the store, at all touch points along the product lifecycle, such as transporting, storing and using the product. This is a huge missed opportunity for brands,"" said Steve Kazanjian, vice president, Global Creative, MWV. ""Structural features of the packaging should be viewed as the most critical area for brands to make improvements to drive consumer satisfaction."" ""Packaging that lives up to the brand promise of its marketing communications holds the most potential for repeat purchase,"" Kazanjian added. ""As more retail migrates online, consumers are interacting less with brick-and-mortar channels. A disappointed consumer can switch brands with one click, so the role of packaging is increasingly an important vehicle for brand owners to connect with their consumers at touch points throughout the product's lifecycle."""
"VG Emballage: ""Well positioned to deal with changes!""","Premium Beauty News - You took over the reins of VG Emballage 3 years ago now. What were the main highlights of the year 2012? Laurent Chevallier - For us, the year 2012 was marked by three major events: first, the ramp up of our PET offer using our own tooling for both the injection and blow moulding of bottles. This has enabled us to offer all the ranges in our portfolio in a new material, suiting perfectly our customers' expectations. The year 2012 was then marked by the completion of our website, with all its features now fully operational, from the interactive product catalogue – enabling to view a bottle/accessory couple – to the section dedicated to customers and where they can trace their orders, download the technical documentation related to their products, this site has helped us showcase the richness of our offering while providing substantial productivity gains to our teams and our customers. Finally, the year 2012 was marked by the signing of an exclusive distribution agreement for France, of the EZ-FILL range from the Stevanato group, the leader in sterile glass tubes for the pharmaceutical industry. Available from stock in small quantities, this range of glass sterile tube bottles is a ""ready-to-fill"" solution offered to all companies in the pharmaceutical sector to enable them to focus on the core of their activities by outsourcing sterilization issues. Premium Beauty News - We spoke of French exception... But actually the scope of action of VG Emballage is not limited to France. You have even increased your presence in neighbouring countries! Laurent Chevallier - Indeed, VG Emballage is active well beyond French borders. In Germany and Italy, where our flow of business is continuous, we have permanent employees. In the other countries, that our export team manages from our headquarters, we are currently strengthening our network of relays, agents or distributors in order to best use our very broad catalogue. Needless to say that our correspondents abroad were the first to support our new online showcase, available in English, German and Italian languages, which has greatly facilitated their commercial work in terms of selection of items and offer with their own customers. As a consequence, the year 2012 saw the completion overseas of several significant full service markets with new customers. Premium Beauty News - One of the strengths of VG Emballage has always been innovation. A few examples? Laurent Chevallier - In fact, VG Emballage has always strived in the past to design or propose items which are innovative through their functionality or design. This is still the case today with developments coming from our in-house Technical Department and the research works conducted by our Purchasing Department. As an example, I can name two extremely successful innovations of ours: our BeSafe dual tamper-evident service cap, a perfect accessory to secure the packaging, and also our dual-security P2000 Pump that meets two main issues – safety and recycling – and which has already been adopted by major players in the health & beauty sector. Convinced that innovation is a source of added value, we also distribute some innovative products from selected partners: thus in 2010, we integrated in our Airless Ecosolution range, the eco-designed Airless solution from our partner Promens, and this year our catalogue was complemented with the EZ-FILL range, the glass sterile tube bottles from the Stevanato Group. Premium Beauty News - Perfumery, cosmetics, pharmacy, chemistry, food industry... What is actually the distribution between these different sectors of your activity. Is one more important than others? In the future do you intend to develop one more than others? If so, why? And if not, why? Laurent Chevallier - Perfumery/Cosmetics, and Pharmacy each represent 35-40% of our business, with the remainder consisting mainly of other Industries. These proportions remain relatively stable over time. For us, the coexistence of these markets is crucial in our business model, for two reasons: the first concerns the dispersion of the market risk. To cope with economic cycles, it is saver to rest on several pillars which support one another. The second is related to the gradually fading lines between our customer industries: products offered by companies tend to diversify and articles are interchangeable from one catalogue to another. Hence, being historically present in the different sectors, we are well positioned to support these changes. Premium Beauty News - What is the proportion between the products you own and those you distribute? Will it change in the future? Laurent Chevallier - This proportion is completely different depending on materials and types of items: for glass bottles, we operate on a distribution mode since the items belong to our parent company SGD. Yet, we own some lines like for example the beautiful ""Fleur d'Oranger"" range that SGD designed for us. For plastic bottles, the situation is at the opposite: VG Emballage owns almost all the lines it distributes. The company has designed its bottles, chosen the key features and made the investment in tooling for their production. This is entrusted to industrial partners scattered in France and abroad. For accessories, we mostly undertake their distribution, except for our own proprietary models or for the ones that we have co-developed with our industry partners. In some cases, this distribution is performed on exclusive bases. This way of operating is not likely to radically change in the future. But I would like to stress on one point which I believe is the strength of our offering, namely the interoperability of our products: whether they are distributed or ""proprietary"", products have been developed or selected to work with one another, so that our customers find for each of their needs a comprehensive and ready-to-use ""bottle-decor-accessory"" offer. Premium Beauty News - What does the year 2013 look like for your company? What will be the main highlights? Laurent Chevallier - From a technical point of view, the year 2013 will be dedicated to updating our website with our regulatory library which will allow for our customers to download in just one click all the certificates in connection with the items they buy from us. At a time when guidelines and regulatory texts on primary packaging are becoming more stringent, this service seemed an absolute necessity. For business in general, the year 2013 will be difficult for items intended for the finished product to be sold in the country. Export products will probably perform better. However such forecast only applies to already well established products, what we call the portfolio fund. To this can be added the additional business brought by launches and new products in the catalogue. In terms of launches, the number of offers currently in the pipeline is at a level that we consider acceptable. As regards new items, our new product offer will be very rich in 2013, with some very interesting novelties, and this, as of the first quarter. It is definitely for us the highlight of the year 2013! But more is to come up soon..."
Joycos: Design and quality as a credo,"Premium Beauty News - How do you position yourself on the market of cosmetic packaging? Soon U. Kim - We have an international reputation as a leading producer with the variety in creative product lines including airless pump bottle, cream jar, skin lotion bottle, compact, palette, Lipstick, and more. Moreover, we repeatedly have been developing free moulds for more beautiful containers and attractive series product lines to pay attention to the individuality of each customer. Our products are also tooled with the new various functions over the advanced creative design and perfect quality control. We work with over 30 countries including United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Australia, and various South-East Asian countries. We also have agents in Germany and France, for international convenience. Premium Beauty News - Your role begins at the design and creation stage. You develop your own moulds and you outsource manufacturing? Soon U. Kim - That's right! We work with half-dozen plants, all based in Korea. ""Be the Best"", this is my motto. Being the best cannot be claimed with the size of company. In my belief, the affordable price should go with the best quality. What we are trying to achieve is the customer's satisfaction with the products of the best quality and with reasonable price. We put the customers as the priority. In order to assure the quality of our customer service, we promise the leading trend of packaging design in the market, the frequent and fast tools development, worldwide on time deliveries, and a guaranteed quality control. We started the company with the same belief and same promises. I also guarantee that this will remain the same. Premium Beauty News - Can you name some of your clients? Soon U. Kim - Our eye-catching packages can be seen with well known brands such as Estee Lauder, Bobbi Brown, Stila, TIGI, Victoria Secret, Clinique, Smash Box, Noevir, Be Yu, Juvena, Bloom, Artdeco, and more. Premium Beauty News - What is your insight on the evolution of your market? Soon U. Kim - As you know, we actually have two separate companies, Joycos International and Joycos Cosmetic. And we distribute our own brand which is very successful, ""Hope Girl"" through one of them. Speaking of our purely packaging business, it is clear that we are continuing to grow in all areas of make-up (20% of our activity) and skin-care (80%). The key being, as I already said, our capacity for creativity and innovation. A proof of this, are our latest novelties, like this new mascara with a patented closure system and this new opening system on an airless bottle where the actuator appears with a quarter turn on the base of the bottle. At the international level, our goal this year is clearly to refocus more specifically on the Asian market. In addition we are also looking for future competent partners under a long-term relationship basis with mutual cooperation. We guarantee our ability and potential with an increased contribution to the company in the future."
Nortier is maintaining its investment momentum,"After the acquisition of a new hot stamping machine and of a die cutting/embossing machine, Nortier is continuing its investments in 2012 and 2013 with a new offset machine and a new splicer, all these being latest generation equipment. ""It is essential to offer our customers the highest quality they are expecting and remain competitive,"" explained a spokeswoman for the company. [1] Having a state-of-the-art industrial tool, means being also able to perform faster and better increasingly complex tasks, and meet the new requirements of perfume and cosmetic brands. ""Currently, there is a return to high added value folding boxes, with several gildings and embossments, etc.,"" we were told at the French printer. The folding box for Fan di Fendi, is a perfect example of this trend with its particular grain, reminiscent of the typical Fendi leather touch, or of the one of La Petite Robe Noire, by Guerlain, one of the great success to which took part recently Nortier. But as a result, production processes also become more complex and require an extended expertise. ""The various decoration techniques are not always compatible with one another, and they must also be compatible with our clients' technical constraints, in terms of strength, slip and resistance of varnishes. Our greatest asset is our ability to advise our clients and come up with the appropriate proposals, be it for the choice of boards or concerning the process to favour to achieve the desired result."" Hence, the market's general trends seem to bode well for Nortier who, after a positive year 2012, expect a slight increase in 2013. Especially since, for this specialist in medium and large series, the rise of alternative brands and of high-end boxes also offers new opportunities for growth. Thus, Nortier manages to attract a growing number of new emerging brands. Located in the Paris region, close to a large number of brand owners, Nortier can also rely on the synergies developed with its umbrella company, Firopa."
Lablabo opens its new production site,"Premium Beauty News - A word first on Lablabo? Jean-Philippe Taberlet - For more than thirty years we have specialized in metering devices around two main ideas, innovation and reactivity. After creating in 1995 the market's first airless dispenser with a soft pouch, we are now striving to continually adapt it to the needs of our clients in terms of technicality, quality and increased protection of formulas. Premium Beauty News - A few key figures? Jean-Philippe Taberlet - Last year we achieved a turnover of 12 million Euros equally divided between the Pharma and the Cosmetic sector. To note that we export 80% of our production and that, globally, the United States weigh more in our turnover than the French market. With this new production site, we will be increasing our production capacity which will reach 40 million pumps per year, 35 million pouch bottles and 12 million valves. Premium Beauty News - A new factory like no other it seems? Jean-Philippe Taberlet - It's true! We decided to build it for three main reasons: – Moving from a former industrial site which in fact consisted of three parts. – Increase of course our production capacity. – Place ourselves in industrial conditions enabling to meet the GMP requirements. May I recall that we obtained the ISO 9001 certification in December 2003 and that since December 7, 2010 we are also ISO 15378 certified (which covers primary packaging materials for medicinal products) and that with this new site the goal was to achieve compliance with such standards as ISO 8 or grade D. This concretely translates into a 1,200 m2 (13,000 sq ft) overpressure air filtered production clean room. This means that not only some 4,000 m3 of air are filtered and recycled every six minutes, but that the air is maintained at a constant temperature and humidity rate. All parameters are recorded twenty-four hours a day and can be traced at any time. Of course, the staff can only enter production room through security gates equipped with air showers. Finally, and very importantly, no cardboard box nor pallet or wood packaging can enter this room. Premium Beauty News - The different steps in the development of a product have not changed? Jean-Philippe Taberlet - The phases are as follows: – Identify and validate the materials best suited to the product, – Perform the compatibility and development tests adapted to the product, – Ensure the production of pilot batches for the pre-industrial tests, – Provide assistance for the building up of the pharmaceutical packaging file. Premium Beauty News - A few words on your latest novelties? Jean-Philippe Taberlet - Our latest product is called Ellipse: an airless metering bottle, very slim with an elliptical shape, a feat which was made possible using the soft pouch system. This HEAD High Efficiency Airless Dispenser consists of a high performance multilayer aluminium pouch paired to a precise metering pump equipped with a self-sealing actuator. Pharmaceutical technicality combined with cosmetic design!"
Metapack: 15 years already!,"Premium Beauty News - What are the strengths of Metapack? Annette Der Minassian - We must look back at the history of Metapack. In 1998, four people coming from different backgrounds decided to combine their know-how to Chinese manufacturers to produce creative, technical, luxurious and economically competitive innovative products. The diversity of materials we work with, the variety of decoration techniques and of surface treatments are undoubtedly some of our strengths today. We have managed to build strong partnerships with competent Asian suppliers. All of our production sites, ten in total, are based in China and we have a subsidiary in Hong Kong. All of these sites have a particular expertise. Premium Beauty News - Competence and quality but also delays! Annette Der Minassian - Absolutely! For the Metapack teams, each brief represents a challenge. Each time it's a real human adventure for us and our four main Asian partners. Our design office becomes the design office of our customers. From design to modelling, our engineers assist them in their development. Technical drawings in 2D and 3D illustrate our designs. Functional or resin mock-ups formalize them. As for delays we try, of course, to fully optimize them, taking advantage of our structure which is in essence, extremely flexible and responsive. Premium Beauty News - You can work with almost every material? Isaure de la Noue - Indeed, our partners can work with a broad palette of materials ranging from zamac, brass, steel, stainless steel, aluminium, PP, POM, Pe, PVC, ABS, PETG , PCTA, Santoprene, leather. They have acquired a mastery in various surface treatments and decoration techniques including: electroplating, electro-coating, PU or UV spray varnishing, anodization, metallization, embossed, debossed, laser of chemical engraving, (by photo etching of by stamping), hot stamping, silk-screen printing, pad printing or embroidery, translucent or opaque enamelling, the application of cabochons, glitters, crystals, etc. Plants are compliant with environmental and local laws. And they are of course open to controls from specialised external organizations. Premium Beauty News - Small or large batches? Isaure de la Noue - Both! Average production ranges between 50,000 and 100,000 pieces. But of course we can produce larger or smaller quantities (from 10,000 pcs). In fact, people increasingly call upon us for our technical skills and for the trick that will make the difference. Premium Beauty News - Your favourite sector remains perfume? Isaure de la Noue - A sector which still represents 95% of our activity, it's true! To note that these concern mostly sales products and increasingly less promotional products and limited editions. Premium Beauty News - Your main area of action remains France? Annette Der Minassian - More than France, I would say Europe, but the goal for the coming months is clearly to extend our influence elsewhere, especially in the United States."
Albéa takes over Rexam's cosmetics division. What are the consequences?,"After the green light from the European Commission in late October 2012, the clearance from Chinese authorities was the only piece missing, both Albéa and Rexam running significant businesses in this country. This was done a few days ago and the acquisition of the cosmetics division of Rexam Personal Care by Albéa is now finalized. With this new acquisition, the affiliate of Sun European Partners LLP confirms its global leadership in cosmetics and personal care by expanding its packaging solutions to dispensing systems and reinforcing its offer in lipstick tubes, cosmetic rigid packaging, and beauty solutions. It also strengthens Albéa's position in emerging markets to develop its wide product portfolio across multiple market segments. ""This acquisition is consistent with Albéa's strategy of building a strong, sustainable and profitable growth platform offering packaging solutions to the Cosmetics and Personal Care market,"" said François Luscan, President and CEO, Albéa. In the wake of the acquisition of the Betts group in 2011 (a global annual production of 2 billion tubes every year), then the purchase of China-based company Tex (20 million US dollars in sales, 700 staff and 3 plants), Albéa confirms what François Luscan told the readers of Premium Beauty News 18 months ago: ""Albéa is now in a position to grow strongly again, in all segments of its portfolio, and particularly in the beauty sector."" It's a deal! In a recent analysis, Moody's deemed the combined company would de facto hold the second largest market share in the fragrance pumps category and the third largest market share in the cosmetic pumps category. Also note the group becomes the world's leading manufacturer of lipstick tubes, mascara bottles and makeup cases. The company is also among the market leaders in lipstick packaging, fragrance pumps, lotion pumps and cosmetic closures. Regarding the international coverage, Albéa acquires Rexam's industrial facilities on three continents, including in high-growth markets in Asia and Brazil, and also a base of very prestigious clients and a broad portfolio of products. With the integration of the cosmetics division of Rexam Personal Care - no less than 11 facilities in Europe, the Americas and Asia, not exactely a small piece! - Albéa now operates 46 plants in 14 countries. While Albéa considers that the activities of the two groups are highly complementary, it is nevertheless difficult to figure out this acquisition could be achieved without reorganising of some obvious overlaps. When, where and how? To be continued… Anyway, François Luscan has already achieved the goal he had set 18 months ago: ""To have a top-level industrial tool!"""
When plastic packaging is antimicrobial...,"Presented at the last edition of the Emballage tradeshow (which was held in Paris on November 19-22, 2012) the Pylengo technology developed by Pylote - a start-up headquartered in Toulouse, France - addresses the needs of cosmetic formulators that have to cope with new issues and challenges regarding product preservation. According to Pylote, the Pylengo solution is both ""clean and safe"". On the one hand, the microbiological cleanliness is a key element to guarantee product safety but, on the other hand, this requirement must now combine with an increasing demand for natural formulations and the reduction in the number and the concentration of preservatives. In order to deal with these two constraints, Pylote focused its core technology: spherical inorganic particles with innovative performances. By embedding some of them in the plastic bottle at the time of manufacture, the company says that product protection can be guaranteed while maintaining full compatibility with the content, that is to say ""without any diffusion of substances from one to the other."" Main advantage of the technique: the protection against reverse contamination. Its efficacy has been tested in usage simulations with different types of micro-organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus subtilis spores). ""Areas of contact between the packaging and the user do not triggers any bacterial development,"" said the company. The production method of the material - a 100% mineral powder, thermally and chemically very stable - only requires one single step, without any human intervention, thus limiting both contamination risks and energy consumption. ""The process is derived from green chemistry and is based on an additive accepted by Ecocert,"" says Loïc Marchin, co-founder and CEO of the company. This preservation technology is made of white particles, thus making them easy to hide in conventional packaging. Furthermore, they are de-agglomerated (not linked to each other), which facilitates their use and integration in industrial processes. They are also ""free from nanoparticles"", which is an important element in consumer confidence. However, more than producing a simple additive, Pylote has designed Pylengo as a turnkey preservative solution. Relying on a network of authorized partners in the plastics industry, or accrediting the usual suppliers of its customers for using the technologies, the company is committed to both the effectiveness, but also to the absence of supply chain perturbation, whether in terms of required tools, time or quality. ""For plastic converters nothing changes, says Loïc Marchin, they receive a plastic already processed and can work as they are used to."" To date, the technology has been tested successfully on a dozen different plastics."
"Socopol, the spearhead of Bioplan in Poland","The Bioplan-Socopol plant near Warsaw has really nothing to compare with the one acquired by the group Ileos in 2006. The huge work undertaken in 2011 had the effect of completely reorganizing the production and storage halls. ""This has enabled us to double our capacity,"" explains Jaroslaw Rutkowski, ""but above all to put the entire production tool to the quality and hygiene levels required to develop our business in the cosmetic, food and household products sector in 3 separate units."" As a result, the 50 filling lines are distributed more harmoniously and logically in the 6,000 sqm of buildings. Hygiene conditions in which men and machine operate have what it takes to convince the most demanding customers. There is no way of moving from one area to another without being asked to completely change one's protection outfit (mask, cap, gown and over-boots). It is not possible to enter into a production room without having cleaned one's hands thoroughly with several successive disinfectants before. With 300 million units produced per year, all packaging considered, Bioplan Poland has become a European leader in its field. ""In fact, we produce increasingly more different products in this factory,"" explains Izabela Migdal, Commercial Director. ""We follow the market requirements. Promotional sachets, of course, and all sorts of sachets with varied capacities, shapes and presentation types (in the form of sets of colouration beads, for example). We fill mini-tubes, we make Doypack type sachets (200 ml to 750 ml), and we fill mini plastic bottles, among others."" ""And we are also increasingly involved in Co-packing activities, that we intend to intensify in the coming months,"" emphasises Stéphane Frémiot Commercial Director for Bioplan. In the space of three years, the picture on the types of product packaging at Socopol has changed: from a 60/40 ratio in favour of promotional sachets in the beginning, the share of other types of packaging has now clearly overshadowed them, with a reverse situation and a 60/40 ratio in their favour. ""And then there are new very technical niche markets that open up to us,"" details Migdal, ""like the hot filling of small jars of concealer creams."" Not that easy to perform actually because the product is extremely fragile and it's a zero tolerance filling. If you ask the Socopol teams if they are confident for next year, the answer is yes! The competitiveness of the Polish economy is still very real and the teams are always up to the task. Quit enough to bring in investments and orders."
Hot stamping foils: Kurz launches new designs,"In the traditional process for manufacturing a stamping foil with a diffractive continuous design, a small holographic pattern is duplicated multiple times and combined into a large-area design. This results in so-called ""recombination seams"". Hence, the new ""Light Line"" is manufactured without recombination lines. This manufacturing technique opens the door to a wide variety of possibilities. While the design was so far limited to closely repeating patterns, now large, discontinuity-free single-image designs can be produced. It is also possible to combine diverse design elements and with no spatial restrictions. These large-area designs enable impressive effects to be achieved, as the new large-format SB Lightwave and SB Liquid designs clearly show. Hence SB Aquadrops shows casually arranged water droplets with a ""lens"" effect of various sizes and shapes. The particularity of this new design lies in the fact that droplets refract the light in various directions. Lens is particularly attractive thus exhibiting amazingly varied plays of colours and movements. In fact, Kurz employs modern technology equipment for manufacturing lens effects with a very distinctive depth effect. This is the case with SB Aquadrops but also with Diffractive Lens that takes printing to a completely new dimension, where depth and holographic colour plays mingle with clear marked contours. The lens can vary in size and shape."
Bormioli Luigi: a new inner lacquering process,"Premium Beauty News - What are the main advantages of this new lacquer which can be applied on the inside of vials? Felice Nardiello - Compared to traditional lacquering which coats the outside of vials, our process enables to highlight all the depth, shine and thickness effects of the glass. This creates real ""3D"" effects. Premium Beauty News - Does it hinder the use of other types of decoration? Felice Nardiello - Not at all! Quite the contrary! There is no limitation to the use of our ""Inside"" process coupled to other finishing techniques such as screen printing, pad printing or hot stamping. Moreover, this process opens very large perspectives in terms of customization. Premium Beauty News - What types of customization? Felice Nardiello - With this process, we make available to our clients a wide choice of colours and special effects ranging from matte to polished and even metallic finishes. Visual aspects range from a full inner coating of the vial to partial coating. Subtle effects between different shades can even be used. In addition this process can be used for several types of vials with a mini collar of 13 mm. Premium Beauty News - A word on this new decoration facility you are inaugurating in Parma. Felice Nardiello - This unit will host a so called ""traditional"" lacquering line, a lacquering line specially dedicated to the inside of bottles, a binding line and finally a screen printing line. Representing a total investment (for the construction, the machines and annealing arches) of approximately 7 million euros."
"Gerresheimer, the pharma asset to serve cosmetics","""The cosmetic industry's requirements for glass packaging are becoming increasingly discerning, both in terms of the products' quality and in respect of the production processes. We have set a new benchmark with our GMP certification. It confirms that we satisfy to the extremely high standards that apply in pharmaceutical glass production,"" said Bruno Bürkel, Executive Vice President of Gerresheimer's Moulded Glass Division. The ISO 22716 standard was derived from the GMP 15378 standard for pharma production and it was initially only issued in respect of the production of cosmetics such as perfumes and creams. This meant that the standard had to be re-interpreted for application in the certification of a cosmetic glass manufacturer. The certification body DQS Medizinprodukte a company that audits and certifies production and management systems worldwide and Gerresheimer teamed up to adapt the standard for cosmetic glass production and Gerresheimer Tettau was audited and certified a few month ago. Now ISO 22716 also stipulates the requirements of a cosmetic packaging quality assurance system covering the entire process, from design and production to delivery, plus requirements for the sustainable management of natural resources. The application of GMP principles in the production and inspection of primary packaging for cosmetic products is crucial to ensuring safety and quality because cosmetics come into direct contact with their packaging. ""'Gerresheimer Tettau is the first company specializing in the production of cosmetic glass products that we have been able to certify as GMP-compliant. We had never applied the standard to a cosmetic glass manufacturer before, so our close collaboration with Gerresheimer Tettau was a pioneering project,"" said Sigrid Uhlemann, Director Medical Products at DQS Medizinprodukte. Gerresheimer Tettau has been setting certification standards for many years now, so it was optimally prepared for the new certification. Gerresheimer has held ISO 9001 certification for its quality management system since 2001. In 2007, the plant also underwent an audit to confirm its compliance with the HACCP [1] Directive (EC) 852/2004. This system facilitates hazard analysis and critical control point monitoring in the production cycle taking specific hygiene requirements into account. The energy management systems were certified in 2009 pursuant to Article 41 of EEC/2009. In the ISO 22716 Cosmetic certification process, the Tettau Plant was selected as a pilot for the Moulded Glass Division. Gerresheimer Tettau produces around 700 million glass containers such as flacons and cream jars for the cosmetics industry. It supplies reputed customers such as Avon, Beiersdorf, L'Oréal, Mäurer & Wirtz, Procter & Gamble and Puig. The Gerresheimer Group also manufactures glass packaging products for the cosmetics industry at its plants in Momignies (Belgium) and Beijing (China). ""We drew our inspiration from the flacons which were the most appreciated in our latest collection for the original design of the 2012 collection,"" explained Eduardo Ruiz, CEO of Gerresheimer Zaragoza. The last two collections were designed by Valérie Bernard and the GPP Design Centre in Paris. Flacons are suitable for body care products, hair care and shower gels. Customers were able to discover the new collection during two events taking place in Barcelona and Paris. The public showed great enthusiasm each time and the feedback was very positive according to Ruiz. The Gerresheimer Group has won the German Packaging Award for its Mercedes Benz Perfume flacon design. ""We're delighted about the award. Sophisticated glass flacons are an important part of the perfume and fragrance world and Gerresheimer is a specialist in this field. The Mercedes flacon is an impressive example of our design capabilities and we're proud of it,"" said Nicola Balena, Sales Director Moulded Glass at Gerresheimer. The flacon, which the manufacturer describes as ""masculine, modern and elegant"", is produced by Gerresheimer Momignies in 40, 75 and 120 ml sizes. A Mercedes-Benz star is featured on the glass base. The flacons are made at Gerresheimer's Momignies plant on single-drop machines in a blow and blow process. After the production process they are fire polished to achieve a perfect surface finish. Finally, a bi-colour screen print of the famous automobile brand name is applied. The logo which is additionally featured on the base further enhances the flacon's elegance and upmarket appeal."
Corpack: a passion for design,"Premium Beauty News - When was your company founded? Jean-Paul Corbeil - Corpack was founded in 1995, initially to represent packaging manufacturers in the European and North American markets. Corpack combines 15 years of experience in the cosmetic packaging industry, with the last 6 years having specialized in designing and developing complete packaging solutions. Meanwhile, Corpack not only creates custom designs, but has developed its own range of standard lines, that can be ""made-to-order"", satisfying the individual taste and needs of every customer. In order to maintain the focus on complete solutions, Corpack strives to stay ahead of trends through innovative design combined with state-of-the-art production technologies. Premium Beauty News - One of your strong points of course concerns your design capacities? Jean-Paul Corbeil - Our design department is devoted to creating new and fresh ideas, while striving to do their best to transform the customer's vision into production-ready componentry. These units are then produced at consistently high quality levels. The concepts and designs that evolve out of Corpack, are not only constructed with the latest in 3D software, but in the end, have been technically tested in terms of feasibility on the production site. We have the ability to supply either standard components or lines, to modify them to achieve ""customized standard"" products or create an entirely new custom design exclusively adapted to the customer's needs. Basically, our experience is in assisting the customer in finding or developing a packaging solution with standard or custom-designed components, monitoring the production process and coordinating the shipment of the finished goods to any location on the globe. Premium Beauty News - Can you give us some recent examples of products designed by your teams? Jean-Paul Corbeil - Corpack was recently given the opportunity to redesign the BEYU nail lacquer unit. The new BEYU nail lacquer has a more distinct form with a more up-dated outline. The slim, cylindrical form of the cap, allows for a more ergonomic grip which supports a cleaner, more comfortable application. At the same time, the straight form of the cap contrasts vividly with the trapezoid shape of the bottle. The introduction of more pronounced edges, gives the new presentation a more modern appeal. The new BEYU nail lacquer unit basically transforms into a fresher version of the former shape, more contemporary, yet without giving up or losing its' link to the brand. Corpack also developed and produces the packaging of Olfacto's ""db"" fragrance. The clear, simple lines of the unit, visually enhance the ""db"" in an understated way. The square, simple shape conveys elegance on a high level. The choice of colour is intentionally held puristic in nature, to emphasize the characteristic of the mood and gender. Expressive black represents the male side, whereas the female equivalent is designed in classy white. The silky-matte surface gives the consumer an additional sensation of touch, distinctively adding another dimension to the overall impact of the packaging. Finally, a year ago Corpack launched the ""Allegra"" skincare line which is a logical extension to the ""Allegra"" color line. The simple, clear shape, demonstrates, whether individually or collectively speaking, a beautiful compilation of symmetry and proportion. The contemporary style of this line, in conjunction with a complementary colour and graphic finish, will give the line an individual touch and high grade of recognition. This makes it a versatile range of packaging that will appeal to a wide variety of end users. This up-to-date design and choice of materials and wall-thicknesses, transmits a sensation of enhanced quality to the customer. The line not only impresses with its uncomplicated design, but feels good to the touch, a sensation that is also important for the long-term success of any packaging. The line is momentarily comprised of 3 bottle sizes in PET (w/ screw cap or pump), two jar sizes (15 & 50 ml), as well as 3 glass dispenser sizes (two sizes in progress)."
"Pasi Piiparinen, Metsä Board: EUR 120 million investment in two years","Premium Beauty News - To start with, the company has changed its name? Pasi Piiparinen - We changed our name from M-real to Metsä Board as we are part of Metsä Group, which also introduced a new name earlier this year. 'Metsä' means 'forest' in Finnish, and identifies that the Group's operations all centre around forest industries – predominantly using renewable certified wood grown in Nordic countries. With the Group's new logo – a moose supporting a forest on its antlers – we hope this will remind our customers of the origins of our products and the importance we give to sustainability in our operations. Premium Beauty News - You have also announced a number of industrial investments with a particular focus on markets outside Europe! Pasi Piiparinen - Indeed, we have invested for the 2011/2012 period some 120 million euros to increase the production capacity (+ 150 000 tonnes), but also to improve the quality of our products, and this on all of our sites. And it is true that we are planning to give a special focus to other parts of the world like the United States, South America and Asia. Premium Beauty News - Does this name change affect your areas of business? Pasi Piiparinen - The name change does also reflect the fact that we are increasingly a paperboard business, and Europe's leading supplier of folding boxboards and world's leading supplier of coated white-top kraftliners to the packaging industry. We continue to serve customers in beautycare, healthcare, consumer goods, food, confectionery and chocolate, that is, any sectors where high quality and attractive appearance are essential. We have developed products that are especially suited for these end-uses. In beautycare our boards are used for products that include fragrances and perfumes; cosmetics and skin care; hair colouration; and toiletries. Premium Beauty News - Why are your cartonboards particularly suitable for cosmetics and beautycare? Pasi Piiparinen - Our lightweight cartonboards are ideal for beautycare and luxury products because they make eye-catching and prestigious boxes that are stiff without adding weight. The strength of fresh forest fibres makes them especially suitable for special effects such as embossing, lamination or die-cutting, as well as protecting the product. They also have high whiteness and brightness, giving a clean look to unprinted areas. Their coating provides excellent printability, so brand colours and images reproduce accurately. We have just introduced a new triple coating on two of our boards, Carta Elega and Avanta Prima, which provides even better printing results. Safety is another factor particularly affecting packaging in this market. Fresh forest fibres are naturally pure and clean, and boards made from them also have excellent taint and odour properties. Premium Beauty News - Hence the great battle between the GC1 and the pure cellulose board will not occur! Pasi Piiparinen - I wouldn't raise the question under this angle. You know that we are not operating on the market of pure cellulose, but each one has its own place. For our part, we are confident in the continued development of GC1 in the perfumery and cosmetics segment. Premium Beauty News - Do you think sustainability is important within the luxury market? Pasi Piiparinen - Sustainability continues to be very important. Many global brands are giving it very high priority. They are looking at lightweighting and reducing the amount of packaging material, as well as prioritising the use of responsible raw materials and energy. Using our cartonboards for luxury products does not result in sacrificing sustainability – the two can go hand in hand. We use fresh forest fibres in all our products, a renewable raw material sourced from sustainably managed forests. Our manufacturing meets international environmental standards and we hold chain-of-custody certification for our products. As well as being liked as a packaging material by consumers, cartons can be re-used and recycled easily. We have also lightweighted our products, providing the same strength but using fewer natural resources. This means both board and cartons are lighter throughout the supply chain, and in disposal at the end of their life. We are very open and transparent about our raw materials, our use of energy, and our manufacturing processes. We can trace our wood back to the forest, and provide that information to our customers too. Premium Beauty News - What is special about the Chromolux? Pasi Piiparinen - Chromolux is well established as a range with a very high gloss finish, synonymous with luxury products. It includes boards suitable for high quality cartons, and label stock ideal for premium drinks and fragrances. It comes in many different colours, surfaces and grammages, and we have just added six of the most popular Chromolux colours in the heavier 350 g/m2 weight, providing more choice for the packaging of luxury products. Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us more about your IBP (Integrated Brand Packaging service)? Pasi Piiparinen - IBP is a service for global brand owners with many benefits, including cost reduction, improved efficiency, flexibility, speed and simplicity. It can start with an analysis of your packaging needs, and add design, print management and supply chain management. Premium Beauty News - Metsä Board has been making significant investments in its mills and services. How will this help your customers? Pasi Piiparinen - First, we saw the need to increase the capacity of our mills. Demand for fresh forest fibre paperboards is strong and we can now produce an extra 40,000 tpa of Carta Elega and Avanta Prima, and a further 30,000 tpa of Carta Integra, thanks to the rebuilding of our board machines at two mills. Taking these and other improvements together, we have invested a total of EUR 120M in a programme throughout the 2011-2012 period. In turn, we saw the market need to produce more sheeted boards and have introduced new sheeting services at Äänekoski in Finland and Gohrsmühle in Germany. And we have opened a new Express Board facility at Gohrsmühle, ideal for orders with short delivery times and for smaller orders. Premium Beauty News - Are you continuing to invest in improving sustainability? Pasi Piiparinen - We continue to invest in improving the energy efficiency and sustainability of our manufacturing. We have just completed a new bio-power plant at our Kyro mill, which will help us meet our target of cutting CO2 emissions by 30% across all our operations by 2020 compared to 2009 levels. It will also result in the halving of the carbon footprint of both Carta Elega and Avanta Prima, both of which are made at Kyro - another good reason for our customers to specify them. The new biopower plant will replace the use of fossil natural gas with CO2-neutral, discarded wood. This is predominantly bark and other biomass from industrial side streams, as well as logging residual and chips from first thinnings of growing forests. The biopower plant will produce electricity and heat for Metsä Board Kyro, and also provide heating for the neighbouring district of Hämeenkyro. After start-up of the plant, CO2 emissions from the Kyro mill will be reduced by approximately 100,000 tpa, to about a quarter of previous levels."
AptarGroup announces closure of two European facilities,"AptarGroup, a leading supplier of packaging and distribution systems for the consumer goods markets, has announced a plan to optimize certain capacity in Europe. The group intends to transfer and consolidate the production capacity of twelve facilities serving the beauty, personal care, food, beverage, and consumer health care markets. As a consequence, two of the related facilities are expected to close, impacting approximately 170 employees. According to Aptar, the reorganisation is required by increased production efficiencies. The total costs associated with the plan are estimated to be approximately 14 million euros (approximately 18 million US dollars using current exchange rates) while potential annual savings are estimated to be approximately 9 million euros (approximately 12 million US dollars using current exchange rates) beginning in late 2013. ""These actions are part of our long-term strategy intended to prepare us for future growth. We are benefiting from our continual investment in efficient production equipment and our ability to adapt to the changing needs of the markets we serve. In this instance, we looked at product lines, supply chains, and production capacity. We identified ways to streamline certain product technologies, reduce complexity for our people and our customers, and optimize our production footprint. This allows for a more efficient deployment of capital to support our growth in Europe,"" commented Stephen Hagge, President and CEO."
Cosmogen: 30 years and yet more innovations in the pipe,"Trade with Asia was only emerging when Gérard Gieux founded Cosmogen in 1982. At this time, he remembers, ""95% of brushes used by French cosmetic brands came from Brittany."" Therefore, when Cosmogen provided for the first time Korean brushes to prestigious brands, ""it was a revolution!"" However, since this first delivery, projects have followed one another and technological advances also. Today, the historic brush business still accounts for 30% of the company's sales, but in parallel Cosmogen was able to develop a strong expertise in the application of care and makeup, leading it to propose solutions that combine packaging and applicators. Thus, in 2005, the company opens its own research department at the Paris headquarters. No later than 2006, Squeeze'n Tint has emerged, giving rise to the Squeeze'n range. This line has now a dozen products and is the flagship of Cosmogen, which showcased the latest member of the family, Squeeze'n Clean, on the occasion of the last edition of Luxe Pack, in Monaco. During this decade, Cosmogen also opened a sales office in New York (in 2009) and San Francisco (in 2012), as well as a technical and quality office in Shenzhen (in 2010). Eventually, in 2012, the team has grown with new staff and structured in areas of expertise to meet the needs of an increasingly large and demanding market. ""Complexity of demand and the emergence of new markets require us to be at the forefront of quality, reliability, responsiveness and innovation,"" says Denis Richard-Orliange, Cosmogen General Manager. ""The marketing and R&D department focuses all its efforts on anticipating technology trends in the marketplace, factory reliability and security of supply."" A necessity in a market constantly seeking for new products and increased sophistication. "" Cosmetics are increasingly complex. The growing demand for functionalities and the fast changes of fashion and trends require creativity and responsiveness from us. Our customers need to boost their market to capture consumers who are highly stressed and therefore more volatile in their buying behavior. For their loyalty, brands offer therefore more new products, which will experience a shorter cycle of life. "" According to the managing team, the turnover of Cosmogen will be around 20-million euros this year. A strong achievement compared to last year's 17 million euros. As far as the future is concerned, Cosmogen bets on the growth of its two major strategic activities: global packaging activity and care and makeup brush activity. ""The packaging business is experiencing a natural impulse for the past 10 years. In 2013, we want to give more visibility to the brush activity,"" says Denis Richard-Orliange. Actually, in a context where brands market an increasing number of products that look like professional but are used at home, the two axes combine perfectly. ""Already, we are seeing a new trend in their demand: our clients want to give their customers the choice between a global application solution that integrates packaging and the applicator, or a solution that separately offers a care and a range of applicators. For example, we developed the brush of the integrated packaging of SKIN Illusion, by Clarins. Meanwhile, we designed the Ridoki brush for Matis, a separate applicator. Our expertise in the application allows us to respond to these requests."" One thing is certain for Cosmogen, these trends drive the development of permanent innovations."
"Korsnäs launches ""Korsnäs White"", its new whiter and lighter carton board!","Korsnäs White is the flagship product of Korsnäs Paperboard and is made especially for the premium segments of consumer packaging. ""With its unique combination of strength, shapeability and excellent printing properties, Korsnäs White is perfectly suited for the advanced printing and designs of packaging for exclusive branded goods such as health and beauty products, perfume and cosmetics, jewellery and watches, luxury beverages and chocolate, but also pharmaceuticals and wellness products,"" claims the group. Working closely together with converters, brand owners and packaging designers, Korsnäs has driven product development in response to emerging patterns of customer demands. Ever-improving printability is such a demand - and packaging designers increasingly prefer board grades that offer quality printing properties on both sides. ""It is to this end that the upgraded Korsnäs White is a shade whiter on both sides. Higher whiteness means more lifelike colour reproduction, more radiant colour, a wider colour gamut and sharper contrast,"" a spokesperson told Premium Beauty News. Lightweighting - meaning lower weight with retained packaging performance - is a Korsnäs speciality. This requires an exceptionally strong material, such as cartonboard from Korsnäs made of 100% long and tensile virgin wood fibres in a multi-layer structure. According to the Swedish company, due to its strength, Korsnäs White offers an opportunity to choose a lower grammage, without compromising performance. The upgraded Korsnäs White comes in eight new grammages, each of them with a lower weight compared to a corresponding competitor grade and grammage. Lightweighting benefits customers as well as the environment. Reduced weight means substantial savings along the entire value chain. Less raw material is used in the production process. Less energy is used and less waste generated. Less storage space is required and smaller volumes are transported. Resources are saved and costs are cut. The overall environmental impact is decreased. The Korsnäs White product showcased at Luxe Pack 2012 is improved on two counts: whiteness and basis weight. New upgrades and development projects at Korsnäs are ongoing – there is more to come, offering ever-improving packaging material – better product protection, improved cost effectiveness, higher shelf impact and an enhanced brand experience."
Perfumery pumps get more sensual,"We already knew the evocative power of a perfume's bottle, and the importance its secondary packaging, and of its retail channel as well, in the perception of a perfume by the consumer. We learn now how important the pump can be for enhancing the emotional connection to a product. An issue that MWV attempted to explore in detail when launching Melodie Agile and Melodie Forever, two developments of the classic Melodie pump. ""High fashion luxury brands focus on precision, craftsmanship and meticulous detail when creating their fragrances, to convey quality and attract loyal customers,"" said Sandy Gregory, MWV's fragrance marketing director. ""MWV's consumer insights work proves that the spray can evoke different emotional reactions and consequently elevate the user's perception of the brand."" However, the survey conducted by MWV on a panel of female and male consumers not only highlighted the importance of the pump in the perception of a product's high-end positioning. It also shows variations of the overall perception depending on pump types. The ""fine and powerful spray with a gentle actuation and a whisper sound"" of the Melodie Agile pump is perceived as ""efficient"" and ""precise"", linked with words such as ""light"", ""discreet"", ""delicate yet powerful"". As far as the Melodie Forever pump is concerned, its ""spray of fine particles for coverage that wraps around the user"" mostly appeal for women. The three pumps within the Melodie Spray therefore enable brand owners to choose the best spray option to match the positioning of each fragrance. MWV even suggests taking into account ""factors such as the demographics of the target user, the concentration of the formula and the season of the year, all of which impact the overall experience."" Regarding Aptar beauty + home, sensuality first comes from new versions of Éternelle, its atomizer bulb: – Éternelle Couture, an atomizer bulb joined to the bottle by a textile-covered tube, for an indulgent perfume experience. – ""La garde-robe"", a range of knitted coverings in multiple colours and renderings, allowing brands to really stand out and express a strong connection with fashion on the bottle. Furthermore, the manufacturer of dispensing systems also presented during Luxe Pack a preview of a new version of the Sensea pump offering a soft and long actuation for a more enveloping spray. Rexam Personal Care Division paved the way of these new pump developments last year, with the launch of Panache, a new technology delivering a continuous airy, light and dry spray. ""Through control of the size and dispersion of formula particles, Rexam created a spray experience that communicates purity, opulence and sensoriality to the consumer,"" explained the company. Rexam's consumer tests indicate that more than 65 percent of those surveyed believe Panache provides a clear difference from previous technologies. ""Panache creates a totally new gesture. The sensation is like walking through a gentle, deep and long-lasting cloud of fragrance that captivates the senses. It's an unrivalled experience for consumers,"" added Samira Chmiti, Product Manager - Fragrance, Rexam Personal Care. This year, Rexam adapted the Panache experience to its XD11 pump, which retains the dosage, diameters and attachment systems of the standard XD11 platform of technology. For deodorants, hair care and atomizers, Panache incorporates the SP22 new generation engine, ""renowned for its powerful and flexible emulsion handling."""
Brussels opens the way to the merger between Albéa and Rexam Personal Care,"According to the Commission, its investigation confirmed that, ""beside the merged entity, customers in the cosmetics and perfumery industry will continue to have alternative suppliers for cosmetic packaging."" Under the EU Merger Regulation [1], the Commission has the duty to assess the biggest mergers and acquisitions in order to prevent concentrations that would lead to dominant positions that would significantly impede effective competition. In the focus: the competitive effects of the combination of Rexam's personal care business with Albéa, one of Sun Capital's portfolio companies. The investigation encompassed the markets for mascara wands and lipgloss applicators, lipstick applicators, fragrance caps and cosmetic closures. Conclusion, according to the Commission: ""a number of competitors remain active for each type of cosmetics packaging concerned."" The Commission also investigated possible impediments to competition in the airless tubes market, but also found that tube manufacturers competing with Albéa would have alternative sources for pumps and that it would be ""unlikely that the merged entity would stop supplying competing tube manufacturers with Rexam Personal Care pumps."" Therefore, according to the European Commission, the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition in the European Economic Area or a substantial part of it. The Commission's green light thus opens the way to the creation of a diversified global leader in laminate and plastic tubes, foam pumps, fragrance samplers, lipstick and mascara containers. Rexam Personal Care (10 manufacturing units, 6,000 staff) will become a division of Albéa (35 manufacturing, 10,000 staff), a spokesperson of the French company told Premium Beauty News. According to Albéa, the activities of the two companies are very complementary. In particular the acquisition of Rexam Personal Care will help the French group to consolidate its pumps business. In a recent analysis, Moody's deemed the combined company would hold the second largest market share in the fragrance pumps category and the third largest market share in the lotion pumps category."
"Oekabeauty, announcing major innovations","Premium Beauty News - With this series of innovations, you discredit the belief according to which large groups are the only ones who can afford to offer innovations. Gerald Oehlhorn - You are quite right indeed! What is important in innovation is often to meet ""the"" right person(s), partner(s). In both cases, it's the result of an encounter. The development with Jean-Louis Mathiez from the CinqPpats company will definitely be the innovation the market had been long waiting. And the partnership with the Inotech Company for the new co-injected vial will probably be a revolution for the lipgloss and mascara segment. As for means, we simply have to find them. In our case the decision-making process is very short and we know what means it takes. The Oekametall group is doing well. Industrially speaking, we have continued to improve our productivity in recent months. We have also invested this year with two new high speed pad printing machines (one part per second). And may I remind you that – in addition to our PU metallization and lacquering unit in Bamberg – we have been integrated in vacuum metallization and UV lacquering for the past three years with our CCO production unit, where we also manufacture flocked applicators. Not to mention the very important efforts we have made to equip ourselves with high-speed and ultra-efficient assembly lines. Premium Beauty News - Investments that can be compared to the ones dedicated to innovation? Gerald Oehlhorn - For us, one cannot go without the other. And the impact on our customers caused by our new co-injection vial which enables to see the product through a transparent window is a proof of this. This radically changes the look and use of this type of product. Our partner, Inotech granted us the exclusivity of its process on the make-up segment. As for the brand new distribution concept of liquid lipstick, it is truly revolutionary. It combines a new gesture with an increased formula protection thanks to the airless system. Premium Beauty News - And that's not all... You have more surprises in store... Gerald Oehlhorn - Our goal has always been to master all the product manufacturing stages. This will for integration is a key asset because it also allows us to control all the creation steps of a product. We are quite proud, for example of being innovative and efficient in the field of ""fibre"" brushes. And, if I dare say, at times when fibre is perking up. In addition, our engineers are very innovative when it comes to applicators and lipgloss and we regularly launch new innovative applicators. Being present both in the automotive industry and in the stamping of aluminium and metal parts is a plus which we intend to make the cosmetic sector benefit from. Finally, we are pleased to have created a new packaging line called ""Go! Collection by Oekabeauty"" This line includes the most popular of our standard packs of mascara and lipgloss in combination with our most performing brushes and applicators. This new collection also allows us to adapt to new market requirements rather more oriented towards smaller quantities (from 10 000 pieces)."
Strate College: Design is more a question of individuals than of matter,"""The work of designers must participate to the innovation process,"" explains Jean-Paul Cournillou, noting that design does not only limits itself to creating ""nice looking"" objects but mostly of ""placing the use and the user at the heart of the design process"" In fact, it is more life than the matter itself that is at the heart of the designer's creative process. ""The core question is: what is happening between the human being and the object?"" adds Cornillou. The Strate College students therefore learn to develop scenarios of use incorporating all stages of the interaction of a product with a user: from the moment of the discovery of the object to its end of life, including its purchasing, its unwrapping, the entering into contact with the product, and of course its use. This implies the cross-cutting of courses. ""Even if the Packaging and Retail fields require learning specific knowledge, they are also complementary and call for common skills."" Courses at the Strate Collège therefore include two core years of training and three years of specific training depending of the orientation chosen by students. ""Even if the designer must be able to address different activities,"" stresses Cournillou. Indeed, creating products that perfectly answer uses or life styles is not enough; products also have to be adopted by a final user who is permanently sought-after. Left to his own devices, to the shelf and retail spaces, the consumer must be convinced of the quality of the products he is offered, by the sole strength of the graphic speech, by their packaging shape uniqueness, by their responsible approach and by the quality of their point of sale staging. In this regard, the Strate Collège's Packaging Branding & Retail department trains tomorrow's point of sale designers. While integrating of course, constraints of cost, feasibility and industrialization. If the race for innovation and the fierce competition at the point of sale have greatly contributed to the awareness of the importance of design among marketers and to a better understanding of its role, environmental issues have also played a part in the setting up of key scenarios of use. According to Isabelle Chasseriault, as regards this subject, the role of the designer overlaps several parts: the matter and its implementation on the one hand, and designing the object on the other. The choice of the necessary materials (recycled or recyclable materials, for example) is a first step, but the designer's role cannot be limited to this only. He must also integrate a multitude of options in the use of the object to enter into an ecological approach: help to reduce the quantities of product used, promote the packaging's effective recyclability, etc... ""In an eco-design approach, the designer will optimize the scenarios by taking account of both the choice of materials, transport costs, terms of use and the end of life,"" she details. Of course neither the designer nor the manufacturer can do everything. ""The difficulty of an ecological design approach is that it can be reduced to nil by the consumer's behaviour. That is why designers are tempted to introduce some pedagogy or even some fun in their scenarios of use"". Chasseriault provided her help to the seventeen 3rd grade students of the Strate College who participated to the workshop initiated by the BeautyFULL Club on the theme ""How to create distinctive signature packaging to reveal the sustainable positioning of a cosmetic brand/beauty sector"". In this context, the goal was not only to design products taking part to a sustainable approach, but also to make sure that it would be visible. ""And it is obviously a very tricky issue,"" explains Chasseriault."" Within the week's time we had been granted, there was no place for providing answers, but more of presenting areas of work on."" Markers or signs immediately associating the product to a sustainable approach may concern both, packaging, the point of sale, the visual identity or the interactivity. Their importance is paramount since, obviously, they can significantly impact sales. Designers are not finished being called upon!"
Cosfibel prepares new acquisitions,"The sale of Primack to U.S. company Topline, in 2011, marked the launch of Cosfibel's new strategy. So far, the group had developed itself in the packaging and merchandising businesses around three areas: primary packaging, secondary packaging and promotional items, primarily for the perfumery and cosmetic markets. ""We sold Primapack because its development required investments and the implementation of a strategy that did not correspond to our projects,"" explains Alain Chevassus, President of the group. By selling its primary packaging business and thus stepping down from three to two core businesses, the Cosfibel group also gained the means to achieve new ambitions. ""We will focus our efforts to become one of the two or three leaders in this market,"" says Alain Chevassus. The group, which is expected to generate approximately 75 million euros in sales in 2012 (15 million euros for Cosfibel Industries and 60 million euros for Cosfibel Premium), is aiming 100 million euros in 2013. Created twelve years ago, Cosfibel experienced a dramatic organic growth that exceeded 25% per year, excluding the crisis years. ""We now want to add external growth through acquisitions to the organic growth of our sales and thus diversify our products and markets."" It is in this context that, during the summer, the group acquired Solvpack, a company specializing in the manufacture of luxury boxes for the wines and spirits European market. The Cosfibel group's managing team does not hide that other acquisitions are under discussion. ""Our ambition is not to become a generalist but a multi-specialist able to meet the various demands of customers,"" says Alain Chevassus. The new projects are expected to materialize before the end of the year and are expected to help rebalancing the respective shares of the beauty & cosmetic business (which still represents 67% of sales) and of the wines and spirits business. Cosfibel intends to operate this strategic shift while retaining all the assets that contributed to the group's success so far, in particular its creativity combined with a multi-material competence. ""The more we move towards ultra luxury, the more we must be able to achieve multi-material projects,"" says Ilan Schinazi, President of Cosfibel Premium. Today, Cosfibel teams can work indifferently with plastics, metals and cardboard, and even wood and textiles, thus bringing strong differentiation to the company. In parallel, Cosfibel, which had initiated an active sustainable development programme since 2007, is expanding its activities to cover diversity and solidarity through a project called CARES for Cosfifel Action for Responsible and Ethical Sourcing. An employee of the group is responsible for this program with the mission to select suppliers in China that are willing to hire minorities and people with disabilities."
"Valérie Jacob SGD: ""More than glassmaking, a vision!""","Premium Beauty News - Your group seems to be fully benefiting from a year full of launches? Valérie Jacob - That is right. We are very proud to have been chosen by many brand owners in the Beauty sector to design and produce their bottles. Our expertise in glass and decoration combined to our desire to always want to push the boundaries, make of SGD, and this year especially, the privileged partner of major and successful launches. We can name for example Lady Gaga Fame whose bottle is manufactured in our factories in France and the U.S.. The black juice of this perfume is enclosed in a bottle with a well defined oval. From the day of its launch, it has won consumers over both for its fragrance and the bottle, more than 6 million units have already been sold! Also superb this bottle with a thick bottom glass for Florabotanica by Balenciaga which immediately catches the eye. Where we can notice the gently curved base, the distinctive signature of Balenciaga perfumes. Our technicians' mastery of the glassmaking process is illustrated by repeating the same angle on every vial produced. The decoration of bottles dictates its constraints and challenges the boundaries of surfaces to be decorated. The screen printing of a red solid colour requires perfectly flat and smooth glass surfaces. Decorating chamfers, an area which cannot be decorated in principle, required all the skill of SGD to draw a perfect purple line, all around the bottle. Third example, the bottle with feminine lines of Manifesto by Yves Saint Laurent is delicately enhanced by a multi-facet amethyst coloured diamond. The glass distribution, the thick base and the well defined edges of the diamond, combined to a purple lacquering designed with two caches, make this bottle a haute couture jewel. For the launch of Pleats Please by Issey Miyake, we managed to render, starting from the solid glass material, the concept of movement very present in the creator's lines. The bottle has a complex shape, which requires careful demoulding. The difficulty also stands in the numerous taut edges and flat facets. Decorating on a ""tormented"" surface requires a perfect anamorphosis and excellent quality of application of pad printing. Another example of the SGD expertise, to make the bottles glitter in Paco Rabanne's Absolutely Gold editions, we proposed Puig our interior mirror treatment, compatible with the juice (exclusive to SGD) combined to a gold coating. This technical combination offers a precious metal finish. Premium Beauty News - The year 2012 also seems marked by a revolution on the side of skincare and haircare products illustrated by the launch of very upscale positioned products. Valérie Jacob - Absolutely! A phenomenon well illustrated by the Blue Therapy Serum for Biotherm. An intense blue degraded metal lacquering dresses this formula with unique properties. In its approach towards responsible development, in line with its image of natural efficiency, purity and luxury, Nude chose SGD to protect its delicate formulas. And you are right, high end hair products are starting to prefer glass. With the Initialiste Serum, its high-end hair treatment, Kerastase chose a weighty thick glass bottle with a gentle metal coating. Premium Beauty News - This is one of the strong points of your marketing approach and your action at Luxe Pack Monaco, demonstrate that SGD is not only an industrial glassmaker but also and most of all a provider of ideas helping trends to emerge. Valérie Jacob - And we are illustrating this approach this year with three internationally renowned partners, Givaudan, Rexam and Iléos. We are inviting our customers on a world tour to discover our expertise by offering them four fragrances in a nomadic format (bottles from The Collection Lavande 15 ml), each evoking a country. Each fragrance was created by Givaudan's assessors, according to the olfactory trends of the concerned country. And each fragrance is subtly translated through the look and touch of the bottles decoration, the techniques used being of course available in the countries represented. Our customers will therefore be able to spray ""A cloud Celadon"" from China, ""Wafts of creativity"" from France, ""A breath of colours"" from Brazil or ""A trail of satin"" from the United States, thanks to the XD11 pump designed by Rexam. Premium Beauty News - This action undertaken with your three partners actually shows your will to anticipate the future. Valérie Jacob - This operation targeted on Monaco is only actually one aspect of a more comprehensive proactive approach that we are undertaking with our clients to look ahead of the future with them. To study them, we cross consumer profiles with traditions, customs, economic and cultural changes that will result in different expectations in terms of consumption and experience, to which brands will be answering with a suitable offer. From these trends, we anticipate solutions which can serve as the starting point for further reflection, to support our customers in their future success. Hence, for example, travelling, whether it is undertaken for business, shopping or tourism purposes is an integral part of modern life and makes of travel retail a essential distribution network with strong growth, profitability.... and visibility."
Toly France: 23 years already!,"Premium Beauty News - Figures prove it. France remains the first country in the portfolio of the Toly Group! Nicolas Garnier - That's correct! France where Toly established itself in 1989 accounts for, more or less, 35% of the group's turnover, depending of the years. Our position in France continues to strengthen and we took full advantage, during the past five years of the strategic shift decided by Andy Gatesy, namely an increased presence in the field of packaging intended for the skincare sector which currently accounts for 50% of our activity while this segment was equal to zero before 2006. Which doesn't mean we weren't efficient in the make-up niche, quite the contrary. And the many products that we will be presenting at Luxe Pack Monaco will be there to prove it. It is clear that France is and will remain a leading base for the Group. We have made plans next year to extend our offices and strengthen our teams in spite of the economic situation. Premium Beauty News - Certainly thanks to a diversified offer and this will to present each year always more novelties, you have the ability to attract, more than any other, a whole lot of small and medium size companies. Nicolas Garnier - It is one of our strengths! We are fortunate to work with all major cosmetic groups but our largest customer represents less than 10% of the Group's turnover. It is true that our diversified offer both in skincare and make-up allows us to approach many emerging brands in the world of SMEs. So much so that we managed to attract between ten to fifteen new customers each year. Premium Beauty News - Airless systems are strong point of this ""skin care"" offer? Nicolas Garnier - A strong point indeed. As Andy Gatesy explained it very well in your columns a few months ago, our entry in the world of airless was achieved at the top level and has led the group to build a factory in the suburbs of Seoul in 2010, the size of which was increased twofold recently. Toly Airless Packaging already exceeds 12 million euros in sales. Airless systems currently represent about 50% of our turnover in skincare. As you know, we have a very broad offer both in bottles, jars, droppers and various applicators. Latest innovation to date, which will surely be one of the ""flagship"" products of our presence at Luxe Pack Monaco, some transparent airless systems containing formulas in the form of spirals or featuring amazing effects.... Premium Beauty News - In the field of applicators, precisely, you are also operating in the segment of motorized systems. Nicolas Garnier - A segment of interest for us, of course! We have been offering for more than a year now a dose delivery system that vibrates and offers an ionizing effect. And we have no intention of stopping our efforts there. Premium Beauty News - A constantly enriched product portfolio! Nicolas Garnier - The group is strengthening and diversifying itself in all segments of beauty packaging, regardless of the technology or material. As you know, we now offer lipstick tubes (made in India), make-up palettes, cardboard-made set-boxes (we just signed a new alliance partnership with Hung Hing, a major cardboard player in China) and a whole range of accessories made of aluminium or zamac. The group definitely aims to become a world leader in the field of luxury packaging for the cosmetic, skincare and perfume industry."
"Yves Dominioni, Geka: ""Capitalising on our know-how!""","Premium Beauty News - What explains this return to the world of beauty packaging? Yves Dominioni - Several years ago when at the head of a large multinational packaging group working in the Beauty and Pharma sector, I had taken close interest in the Geka company which could have provided perfect complementarity both geographically and in terms of products. Since then, this company has grown remarkably, adding to its true technical expertise, an aggressive and innovative marketing approach. A few months ago, 3i, the international investment fund company acquired Geka; I joined them as member of the Supervisory board and then recently as President & CEO of the Geka Group. Premium Beauty News - Geka today? Yves Dominioni - It is an international company with around 800 European and American talents achieving over EUR 110 million in turnover. An industrial centre of excellence is situated in Bechhofen Germany (one hour's drive from Nuremberg), where the company has successfully grown, and where more than 600 people produce and develop the Mascaras Lip Gloss and other Cosmetic Brush Applicators, supplying all the major players in the ""Cosmetic World."" A new factory was recently opened in the U.S., near Chicago, to be even closer to key U.S. customers and prospects, with the support of a commercial department that has grown strongly. In addition, a sales office in Paris was opened two years ago, which is expected to grow rapidly to support the development of our partner customers. Premium Beauty News - What are the specific assets of Geka and your vision for the company? Yves Dominioni - The mascara sector remains one of the most dynamic in the world and if annual growths of 3 to 5% can be expected for Europe and the U.S., growth rates in Latin America, China and India should be even higher. Geka distinguished itself in recent years thanks to its creative force and its industrial dynamism; a number of patents have been filed and many others are potentially in our research centre. It will be up to us to capitalize on this know-how and in our technological advance first in the field of mascara, lip-gloss and in the eyeliner. Our mission is more than ever to provide our customers with the highest level in terms of innovation and quality the world over. Our vision is to become truly global with the desire to assist our customers, both industrially and commercially. Regarding the potential broadening of our product offer in the cosmetic field, it is still too early to talk about this; we must consider ourselves as ""challengers"" in the packaging industry and this ""state of mind"" will reinforce our commitment to growth and the ensuing dynamics. Premium Beauty News - Will Geka be showcasing any new products at Luxe Pack Monaco? Yves Dominioni - A significant number of launches are in the pipeline; confidentiality obviously prevents me from making allusion to them; one can simply say that there is a real dynamic underway throughout the Group. We cannot emphasise enough on the huge opportunities offered by the cosmetic industry which is constantly growing on a global scale and which continues to offer excellent prospects. Geka intends to seize this opportunity and, thanks to the continual integration of talents and new technologies, will participate in the development of its customers through a close proximity; this is our common Group ambition."
Innovations: PVL Beauté gains momentum!,"Premium Beauty News - Il You must actually see it to believe it! Quite surprising the look of these moulded parts whose surface decoration can vary from one side of the injected part to the other, all this in a single pass! What is the technical trick? Jean-Stanislas Orlowski - Amazing, isn't it! I admit I was finding it difficult to believe from the start that this type of decoration could be achieved in a single pass. But in fact it's possible! That's what makes this patented process called ""Heat & Cool"" so clever; a process for which the group acquired a license and which was mainly used so far for the manufacture of technical parts for the automotive and multimedia industry. Schematically, we can say that the process consists in injecting some material into a ""hot"" mould instead of a ""cold"" mould. When I say ""hot"", I mean a mould whose temperature is raised, by a induction device, to reach the appropriate temperature to inject the material. Hence, the fluid material fits perfectly into the details of the injection mould to create effects and even entirely new touches, all this in a single pass. We will present several amazing parts that can only attract development and marketing teams from brands operating in the beauty sector, such as parts with a even glittery effect or ceramic parts with a quite amazing ""cold touch"". Premium Beauty News - And that's not all! Jean-Stanislas Orlowski - You're right, it's not all! With the help of the Plastivaloire group, we offer a decoration technique called the ""traitement cubique"" (cubic treatment) which enables the complete decoration of a part after its immersion into a bath in which is floating a suspended film. A technique that allows for amazing effects, an excellent rendering and a great regularity of printing. Always in terms of finishing, we can also offer the so-called ""peinture au tonneau"" (barrel painting) technique that enables to paint in a perfect way small parts like actuators or lipstick hoods..."
Luxe Pack Monaco: biggest edition ever,"While a great majority of the past years' exhibitors have renewed their presence, fifty companies are exhibiting for the first time this year. We can quote for example, among the new exhibitors, which will be located mostly in the Atrium lobby: IZT Zamak Injection, which specializes in zamak injection and offers solutions applicable to many sectors, Salamander Bonded Leather, which offers leather material, Cartones Ondulados Especiales SA (COESA), specialising in inset cardboard as an alternative to foam or other cushioning material, Arelec, closure magnets, Ningbo Rainbow International, finishing and dressing of glass bottle for high-end products, Schekolin, for its lacquers and varnishes, Artoria working Limoges Porcelain and offering boxes and bottles in this raw material that is new at Luxe Pack, or also Delta Components, decoration by micro perforating and trimming, exceptional and rare craftsmanship.

Yoshida is setting course on international markets,"What is the relation between mobile phones and cosmetics? The question seems almost incongruous as both industries seem to concern completely different businesses. Yet these are the two core activities of the Yoshida group, the Japanese specialist in the moulding and decoration of plastic parts with high added value. ""Apart from the fact that, in both cases, we transform plastic, I think the link lies in the importance given to details in the finishing of products and in the continuous innovation that these two markets require"" explained Taro Kakizaki sole agent for Yoshida in Europe. Since the creation in 1946, of the Yoshida Seisakusyo company who was at the start a manufacturer of plastic caps, the Yoshida group has been behind several major technical developments in the injection and decoration of plastic parts. In 1979, Yoshida is for example the first company to manufacture plastic make-up case with the actual modern type push-button. Quite a revolution for women at the time, who could finally open their cases only using one hand. The same year, the group develops a decoration technique that will revolutionize the world of plastics. By laying special inks on an adapted film the decoration of plastic parts can be done during the moulding process - hence the name in-mould decoration. This technique will ensure the reputation of the group outside its frontiers. ""Hundreds of millions of pieces were sold worldwide, thanks to this unique know-how, up until the 1990s,"" recounts Kakizaki. To serve the European market, the company created a joint venture, the TYM company (Techpack Yoshida Manufacturing) with Lir-Techpack. Prior the creation of this venture, technological know how transfer was already made starting the 80's. In the following years, the Yoshida group also made the headlines several times, in particular with the development of multi-chamber flexible tubes, airtight compacts, compacts with a side opening. Even the knowledge developed in the world of mobile telephony benefited to the cosmetics industry, with for example the adaptation of mobiles closure systems to make-up cases. Always with innovation and perfection in mind, the Yoshida group was one of the first converters to industrially manage to over-mould a hollow component using Surlyn with strong variations in thickness. This method allows for the creation of particularly striking aesthetic effects and enables to go a step further in the substitution of glass by Surlyn, hence the name given by Yoshida to this material, PlaGlass. A technique which has enabled Yoshida to develop, in partnership with the Japanese subsidiary of Dupont, the producer of Surlyn, a double thick wall jar. ""This technique allows us to offer new solutions in the area of skincare, but also fragrances,"" emphasised Kakizaki. Yoshida owns six production sites, four in Japan, one in Tianjin, near Beijing, and one in Taiwan, as part of a partnership. The group which employs approximately 1,100 people, is still very much focused on its domestic market, which represents 70% of its turnover. However, to the image of Japanese cosmetics giants, its main customers, Yoshida is seeking to increase its global reach by targeting mainly the most advanced markets. The group has two sales offices abroad, one in New York and the other one in Issy-Les-Moulineaux, near Paris. [1] ""We mostly work on niche markets requiring high added value products and with a lot of innovation,"" confirmed Kakizaki. ""What our customers expect from us is superlative quality and innovation."" With the exception of lipstick, Yoshida is present in all segments of cosmetics. But today, the group is mostly known outside Japan for its make-up cases and especially for its airtight cases. Yoshida also has a significant expertise in eco-refills, an area of growing interest for the luxury sector."
Axilone USA bets on innovation,"Premium Beauty News - You surprised many visitors last week with several new novelties. Can you tell us more? Jacques Cohen - That's true! The last MakeUp in NewYork trade show gave us the opportunity to present a whole series of new products on which we had been working for several months. Our visitors were able to review some currently popular products to which Axilone USA had been associated, in particular the famous ""Chubby Stick"" for Clinique, The New lipstick designed for Maybelline or the superb Tom Ford and Lancôme ""Rouge in Love"" which have become benchmarks in the world of high end lipsticks. Aside from lipsticks, Axilone USA showcased a range of airtight patented jars that can be filled from the top or the bottom, with a flexible nylon sifter which enables to adjust perfectly the desired amount of powder to use. ""The airtight Loose Powder Jar"" presented on the stand, was very successful too with a 7g version and a 3.5g version for eye shadows. Our visitors also particularly appreciated our new liquid formulas, ""watercolors"" conditioned in these jars equipped with sifters. To note that these jars - supplied with brushes which were specially developed by ""Leonard"" - can be filled in our factories. Premium Beauty News - Your were also quite successful with this new Click-Pen for lip glosses!

MWV is about to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its Barcelona plant,"Last year the acquisition of Polytop, a company specialized in high tech closures, show how MWV is strategically investing in the packaging solutions. It will indeed be next year that the group will be celebrating the 50 years in operation of its plant in Barcelona, which became in a few years the spearhead in Europe of its production strategy for pumps intended to the perfume and cosmetic and airless industry. The occasion also to announce some new investments in this segment. A few months ahead of schedule, Laurent Bourgoin, VP Sales & Marketing, Beauty & Personal Care Europe gives Premium Beauty News an update on the situation of his company. Premium Beauty News - The pump sector has been posting impressive growth rates from one year to another! Laurent Bourgoin - That's right! And the forthcoming Luxe Pack event in Monaco will be an opportunity to show just how dynamic our group is in this field. We are launching two new sprays to complement the highly successful Melodie® pump that will provide the most advanced dispensing technology for the high-end luxury perfume market. This Spray Collection will build on MWV's existing Melodie portfolio to enhance the luxury packaging experience. The new sprays feature the discreet, low-profile design that offers smooth actuation and an engine that disappears in the collar of the perfume bottle, completed by the patented invisible NoC® diptube empowered by the pre-compression spray technology for which Melodie pumps have earned a reputation in the Prestige fine fragrance market. Premium Beauty News - In fact, you are broadening what you call ""the Melodie Spray Collection!"" Laurent Bourgoin - The Melodie Spray Collection will be officially unveiled at Luxe Pack Monaco. With the new sprays in the Melodie Spray Collection, brand owners can now choose the best spray option matching the needs on which their brand strategy is focused, taking into account such sensitive factors specificities, targeted consumers, formula concentration and the season of the year. Through consumer tests, MWV's research has evidenced that when consumers were asked to focus on sprays, they could easily differentiate and appreciate a variety of spray experiences. MWV's research has shown that a fragrance's spray can enhance the emotional connection to a brand. Premium Beauty News - The fiftieth anniversary of your Barcelona plant that you will be celebrating next year should also be an opportunity to announce some new developments? Laurent Bourgoin - You know that we have heavily invested in recent months in Barcelona in terms of production capacity for both our perfume and cosmetic airless pumps. I can already tell you that we are also working on new versions of our airless containers offering extended customization options and who will also benefit from new actuators. We will also offer more upscale bottles (PETG) and models specifically adapted for the delivery of smaller doses (200 microliters). In the same airless segment, we have extended our decoration offering with the support of some Spanish partners. In another area, we have also installed new machines for the assembly of spray cap actuators. Premium Beauty News - Barcelona is not the only plant to benefit from these investments. Laurent Bourgoin - Indeed! To meet growing demand, we are also investing in our plant in Milan to increase the production capacity on our Aria cosmetic pump but also in both our plants in Wuxi, China and in Mexico. In Italy alone, production was simply increased twofold this year."
Pascual Cosmétiques invests in nail polish,"Premium Beauty News - A great adventure indeed your company is experiencing on this segment of cosmetic packaging! And quite a recent adventure actually? Simon Pascual - Yes, a great adventure, started in 2010 a bit by chance, even if our activities were already very much focused on the contract packing of cosmetic products. It all began with the acquisition of a Citus filling machine for lipsticks and the construction of a clean room. It was a growing market and demand was there. But we didn't stop there and we also decided to invest in a line for hot filled products which enabled us to meet requests for the conditioning of foundations, concealers, etc. Premium Beauty News - But very quickly, you realized there was more to it. Simon Pascual - Yes, exactly. We were quickly overwhelmed by orders for lipsticks. The Citus machine was only running at 1200 pieces/hour. An opportunity enabled us to acquire an even more powerful model with a capacity of 3,600 pieces/hour. We did not hesitate to invest the extra 380,000 euros required. Premium Beauty News - But you did not just do filling operations you also innovated! Simon Pascual - There too, there was an opportunity no to be missed. A chance encounter enabled us to develop a new transparent lipstick a few weeks before the start of the MakeUp in Paris show. The expected effect exceeded all our expectations especially since the innovation also concerned packaging itself in which was integrated a system enabling to illuminate the grape from inside. Thus, under the pressure of demand and the interest generated by this product, we are currently improving the concept. Premium Beauty News - From lipstick to nail polish, it only takes one step... Simon Pascual - Yes, it's true there are some similarities. Both markets have high growth rates and we are still dealing with the world of make-up. So we decided to dare take the plunge this year by investing in an ATEX clean room and acquiring two filling machines that will make it possible to produce about 20 million bottles per year."
Packaging training : specializations dedicated to luxury companies and sustainable development,"Globally, the number of people following courses in packaging, regardless of the sector, is very low compared to industrial demand. ""In Europe, only 10 schools train students in the field of packaging, hence the offer is scarce, while industrial demand is high,"" confirms Serge German, the ESEPAC director. You need only witness the placement rate of ESEPAC graduates to evidence this: 96% of them find a job less than four months after graduation, which is a feat in the current period. In the U.S., there are 21 dedicated courses and that of Rutgers University is the first to offer an integrated curriculum with studies in engineering. "" All students take a 1st year in engineering before specializing in packaging,"" confirms Charles Chang. Courses are designed to train young students who are fully operational once they have graduated. ""Students are placed in a industry-like context: reporting to a pole manager, assignments for companies on real size projects, workload, pace and work tools similar to those of companies,"" emphasises Serge German. A great part of the teaching staff comes from the industrial world, as 35 professionals provide their expertise to the ESEPAC. To remain at the leading edge of advanced technologies used in the field, the school invests more than 20% of its annual budget in the purchase of new equipment. For its part, the Rutgers University has created since 2011 an advisory committee of 50 members coming from the industry and such companies as L'Oréal, Estée Lauder, Avon, Revlon, Bayer, Johnson&Johnson, Bristol-Meyer, Colgate-Palmolive, Mars… All the main packaging actors and users are present to make recommendations on study programs and the choice of speakers, research projects to develop, training periods to perform within companies. Both schools emphasize on the need for students to immerse into the corporate world, to complete their training. 95% of students from an ESEPAC promotion follow a work-based training. The training offered by the University of Applied Sciences in Stuttgart (Hochschule für Technik - HFT Stuttgart) is also in close connection with the corporate world. ""Since 1972, date of creation of our training which initially focused on printing, our relationships with the industry has always been a priority,"" confirms Ursula Probst. To continue to adjust to industry requirements, the ESEPAC started in September 2011 a specific training on luxury packaging to which cosmetics belong. ""On the initiative of Guerlain and Puig, we created a luxury packaging module which is part of the current master. 15 Students have a total 240 hours dedicated to cosmetics and perfumery"" underlined German . The whole includes the intervention at the ESEPAC of professional in the perfume - cosmetic industry, the setting up of tutored projects, the submission of technical subjects to be worked by students. ""There was a real shortage in young graduates with a technical expertise in cosmetics"" testifies an actor of the industry. Across the Atlantic, the focus is on eco-friendly packaging. ""We have identified that sustainable development was a key area for the future of packaging. From one company to another, the evaluation of the eco responsible characteristics of a product range varies and we would like to be in a position to propose measurement standards."" The Rutgers University leads workshops with manufacturers on this subject and develops research projects on alternative materials. "" We are the only university to propose this, ""underlines Chang. Students are delighted about these trainings that stick as much as possible to the industrial world. As have emphasised Amandine Paulet, student-apprentice at Guerlain and Guillaume Drouilly, student-apprentice at PUIG ""Professionally, the training has provided us with the necessary weapons: technical knowledge, , spirit of innovation, optimization and analysis, in order to begin a career as a Packaging project manager (...) and highlight true Technical qualities ."""
Verreries de Masnières (Bormioli Rocco group): more determined than ever!,"80 million euros in turnover, a factory in Masnières in northern France, the perfume and cosmetic division of Bormioli Rocco will therefore be gathering a great deal of attention from leaders of a group that employs a total of 2,600 people scattered in nine plants in Europe (glass and plastic) and which has a strong presence in the pharmaceutical sector (170 million euros), tableware (250 million euros in turnover), and the food industry (65 million euros). ""Many things have changed,"" explains Bruno Bogaert, new Perfume and Cosmetic Managing Director. ""Our group has decided with its financial partner, Vision Capital, to invest heavily in the Verreries de Masnières. A modernization, that implies repairing some furnaces but also improving the performance of production lines and increasing our production capacity in terms of decoration, not only in screen printing but also in lacquering and hot stamping."" A decoration workshop which was built in 2009 and currently hosts about 50 employees who can rely on seven screen printing lines and five annealing arches. ""Most of all,"" emphasises Bruno Bogaert, ""we have to be more reactive to our customers requirements but also more competitive. This means efficient investments in our glass-making activity but also a diversification of our decoration equipments."" Investments in equipments relayed in recent months by a significant renewal of the technical and sales teams, since nine executives joined the teams since the beginning of 2012, with the creation of four positions. ""Commercially speaking"", explains Jean-Luc Leblond, Commercial Director, ""we have not only increased our capacity to respond with the addition of new sales reps. but we now are in direct contact on export markets, especially the United States which now accounts for nearly 20% of our turnover."" Another asset of the Verreries de Masnières, but not the least, a supply, almost unique in the industry, of its raw materials (especially sand) using inland waterway transports! Quite cost-efficient since a barge can deliver at once 350 tons of sand (as against 20 tons for a lorry) and.... ecological too."
Mino Gaillard joins the Medicos group,"For the group based in Lyon and specialized in plastic injection, automated assembly and finishing operations, this acquisition is part of a two-pronged strategy in the sectors of health and beauty. After the acquisition in 2002 of the RR Plastiques company, headquartered in Corveissiat (in the Ain department, East of France), and the creation in 2006 of Rovipharm as part of a joint venture with Rovip, located in Treffort-Cuisat (Ain), the acquisition of Mino Gaillard enables the group Medicos to consolidate its beauty division. Based in Izernore, also in the Ain department, Mino Gaillard is one of the leading European suppliers in thick-walled plastic jars, for the cosmetic and perfume industry. ""Located within 35 km of one another, the three group entities will be able to easily exchange, share their cultures and implement the industrial and commercial synergies,"" explained Medicos in a statement. Founded in 1925, Mino Gaillard is a family business that employs 63 people. It has a factory of 6,500 m2 (70,000sq ft), with a significant strike force in terms of thermoplastic moulding and for decoration and finishing, including an automatic UV-cured coating line. It also has its own technical department and an engineering workshop to design prototype moulds. Mino Gaillard manufactures a wide range of standard and specific products, such as caps and closures, thermoplastic set boxes for the main market players and, of course, thick-walled jars for which the company is one of the European specialists. The company took a part in the ""PlastiGlass"" project aiming to achieve, with a multi-injection process, thick-walled jars, with high transparency and a sensory aspect similar to glass, and offering exceptional technical characteristics (chemical inertness, mechanical strength...). In a very different field, the company also produces cheese strainers, individual moulds and block moulds, in plastic, for the dairy industry, an area where the company is the European leader. It is ISO 9001 certified and is in the process of being certified ISO 14001 with the aim of continuously improving its environmental performance. In 2011, the sales of Mino Gaillard exceeded EUR 7 million, with 70% for perfumes and cosmetics and 30% for the dairy industry. Its customers are among the big names in cosmetics and perfumes (Clarins, Dipta-Esthederm, Givenchy, L'Oréal, Shiseido, YSL, Yves Rocher,...) and the food industry (Bongrain, Besnier Group, Lactalis, Société des Caves de Roquefort, etc..). The transaction is expected to provide a boost to the company, particularly for its developments and for the amplification of its commercial reach. As the head of the company since 1985, Jean-Pierre Goillon will provide his assistance to Cédric Marmonier, President of Medicos, in the conduct of the company and in the development and industrialization of new projects. Finally, this transaction will enable the Medicos group to become a major player in the beauty industry. The operation provides the perfume and cosmetic division of the group with a better visibility, both in France and abroad, and will enable Medicos to offer a broader offer to European perfumers and cosmetic manufacturers. It also has a balancing effect on the group's activities, historically oriented in the medical and pharmaceutical sector. At the industrial level, this acquisition should enable the group to benefit from industrial synergies and to combine the mutual technical skills of its different entities, particularly in the moulding of thermoplastic elastomers, the production and assembly of plastic parts in a controlled atmosphere, finishing and on line UV coating of components, etc.. to strengthen its position on high value added manufactured products. Created in 2002 and fully owned by Cédric Marmonier, Medicos employs 130 people scattered in its three production sites. The group should achieve in 2012 a turnover of EUR 22 million euros, with 30% of sales on exports."
Perfume-cosmetic glassmaking: Gerresheimer more than ever in the race!,"With more than a billion euros in turnover achieved in 2011 with a workforce of 10,000 people, Gerresheimer the German group will have simply doubled its turnover in just ten ""small"" years. The first market is pharmacy currently worth around 82% of the activity, followed by perfume and cosmetics with about 12%. The group is present on all fronts with four divisions: technical parts and plastic packaging (34%), moulded glass (31%), drawn glass (27%) and laboratory glass (8%). The beauty sector, requires the use of six furnaces out of the seventeen currently running in the eight glass factories that the Group owns worldwide. Latest investments to date, the repair of a furnace in the German factory of Tettau last year with the installation of an additional production line and the commissioning, next fall of a new coating line in the Momignies factory in Belgium. To note among one of the specificities of Gerresheimer, the group is one of the few European glassmakers to produce opal glass, also in Belgium, in one of its specially dedicated furnaces for this production. The plant also produces cosmetic clear glass with recycled glass (post consumer) at 40%. The announcement last April of the acquisition of the Indian glassmaker Neutral Glass & Allied Industries Pvt. marks a new milestone for the German group in its intent to produce ""locally"" as much as possible. ""It's normal, we were explained at the headquarters in Düsseldorf, because either our customers are global and we must serve them across the world, or they are local and in which case, we need to bring them an answer on the spot."" Neutral Glass is one of the Indian leaders in the manufacture of glass for the pharmaceutical sector and can rely on a very modern factory in Kosamba (Gujarat province). Its turnover reached over the 2010/2011 period 15 million euros and it employs 600 people. A presence in India that sounds like the first step of a broader offensive to other niches than pharmaceuticals, like the one of mass market cosmetics for example. A glass strategy intended for the perfume and cosmetic sector which has enabled the group to score in the ""prestige"" sector. Some examples with the new skincare ranges of Yves Saint Laurent, Helena Rubinstein, Lancôme, or Avon, Clarins and L'Occitane, among others. We can also mention some great achievements in perfumery, with in particular the new line of perfume vials for the famous German automotive brand, which was launched very recently in the U.S., more precisely on June 5th in New York. ""We're quite proud of having been chosen,"" says Nicola Balena, Moulded Glass Sales Director at Gerresheimer . The vials (40, 75 and 120 ml), produced at the Momignies factory in Belgium, have a very thick glass basis (260 grams for the 120 ml size) which highlights particularly the famous star of the brand. ""Our aim is to respond to all requests, whether from the prestige or mass sector,"" emphasises Balena. ""Our global presence (Europe, China, India, U.S.) enables us to assist our clients wherever they are. We have also heavily invested in recent years in decoration techiques (water-based lacquering, multi colour decoration, hot stamping, metallization) with a dynamics we intend to keep in the future."""
SIMP: Building on a unique expertise!,"A visionary man, Manuel Viegas, the former owner of SIMP? Undoubtedly, yes! But a visionary who also had the chance of making a name for himself over the years, as the industrial arm of innovation for wipers and injected mascara brushes for L'Oreal. ""Actually, explains Eric de Bardonnèche, Sales and Development Director, our adventure in mascara began with the wiper. A seemingly insignificant small accessory but which is fundamental to ensure an even distribution of the bulk on the brush."" Precisely, this is where the French firm will stand out: an elastomer-based wiper (and not just any elastomer!) proves being much superior to its thermoplastic-based counterpart. At the beginning of 2011, Manuel Viegas is convinced that the development of its business depends on the entry of new shareholders in his company. Hence it is Alain Blondel, who has a 30 year experience in beauty with cosmetic brands and their suppliers, who takes over the company in July the same year, along with Eric de Bardonnèche and an investment fund (Crédit Agricole Private Equity, now Capital Omnes). ""I was immediately seduced by this company,"" explains Blondel. ""It matched perfectly what I was looking for, that is to say, a small French company performing and ultra-specialized in a fast growing area and which produced an apparently simple product with a high technical content."" Upon their arrival Bondel and de Bardonnèche get on with the job with clear goals: ""Invest each year between 8 and 10% of revenues to have an oversized capacity and therefore be able to cope with changing needs, always have a fleet of machines at the cutting edge of technology, never stop automating all the production phases of the process and internationalize the customer portfolio."" A year later, things have well advanced. Two new electric injection presses were added this year to the already existing fleet of twenty five plastic injection presses currently running, and a new 150 tons automatic rubber press has just arrived in addition to the fifteen in operation. The firm produced last year some 100 million injected mascara brushes and 90 million wipers. ""And we are currently working hard, underlines Blondel, to both diversify ourselves (lip gloss and different applicators for tubes for example) and internationalize ourselves. We have become specialists in tailor-made products and we intend to accelerate our growth in this niche, with, moreover, a true know-how in the joint mastery of two materials, thermoplastics and vulcanized elastomers."" Hence the creation from scratch of an ""innovation pole"" within the company. Six new patents are issued or on the brink of being validated. Innovation ... but also responsiveness! ""We can come up with a pilot mould in eight weeks, underlines de Bardonnèche, and develop series moulds in ten to twelve weeks time."" And by the way, Our logo has also had a make over... A logo that indicates more clearly that the company is fully dedicated to the beauty sector. And we must admit the result is impressive."
"IPack, a passion for innovation!","35 people for a turnover last year of EUR 5.5 million, IPack will have succeeded in twelve years to emerge as one of the injection company probably the most innovative in the field of perfumery and cosmetic packaging. Who has not noticed the brand new packaging in the form of a stirrup for ""Voyage"" of Hermes for which engineers at IPack have managed to design an invisible assembly system to make the connection between glass and metal possible, thus following the wish of Philippe Mouquet, designer for Hermes. The guides used for the rotation enabling to absorb the differences between the two materials, while insuring an open/close positioning of the stirrup. A fine achievement too, this famous one-piece spray cap for Decibel by Azzaro a perfect imitation of a microphone. Only five components including two metal parts were necessary for the design of this project. Components are mechanically assembled together by a non-removable crimping and clipping system. Spray caps, have become one of IPack's specialty ensuring today more than 10% of its turnover, thanks to a range of three standard nozzles suiting all the pump engines currently marketed. ""Innovation, explains Daniel de Rosa, it's really a second nature at IPack"". This is certainly what has formatted the company since its inception with a strong support from our engineering office combined to a fleet of fifteen injection machines ranging from 25 tons to 300 tons, including a brand new electric press of 150 tonnes commissioned early 2011, plus two assembly and UV bonding lines, an automatic assembly line for spray caps, three machines for the mounting of actuators and another 100% controlled assembly machine for actuators at a rate of one pc/second. First market, all categories included, the perfume sector where the Normandy company offers all kinds of closures, caps (Surlyn, PETG) or packagings. ""This segment probably still accounts for a too big share of our activity,"" admits Daniel de Rosa. ""It is essential nowadays to diversify our business in other areas of beauty or, why not the food industry."" Sirmi, the firm's latest generation, new non-drip capsule is one example of this. This computer designed capsule, facilitates the distribution of the product by simply squeezing the bottle or tube. The upper part automatically repositions itself naturally after use to reseal the container and maintain a perfect balance of the atmospheric pressure (or not, in airless versions). ""The consumer, explains Daniel de Rosa, can permanently keep the capsule in an upside down position to enable a full use of the content, the product used only coming out under the pressure of the consumer's fingers, thanks to the automatic resealing of the capsule"". Sirmi also features a quarter-turn locking system ensuring complete airtightness, which makes it easy to carry around safely in one's handbag or luggage. The concept of this capsule has of course been the subject of several patent applications and can be declined in all forms and with all possible finishes. Another particularly clever innovation, this time for the make-up segment, with a casing for lipstick tubes or perfume caps made of a material incorporating magnetic particles. Not only is the whole system particularly heavy but the cap also enables an automatic closing by repositioning itself the right way (patented). ""We are now capable of transforming a plastic magnet directly integrated in the injection process. Made from a very stable material, its price is a real asset when considering the economic instabilities of magnets currently marketed,"" explains Daniel de Rosa. This new concept which can be customized using classical techniques of surface treatments, is an alternative to magnets made from Rare Earth and opens new avenues in the field of plastic injection."
"Qualipac: ""To offer luxury brands all technologies""","Premium Beauty News - To use your own words, you qualify yourself as a ""maker of beauty caskets""! Pierre Marand - An expression that sums up quite well, actually, all the work and passion driving the Qualipac teams. And this is true every day for every launch. I can give you some recent examples... With ""Orchidée impériale, concentré de longévité"", Guerlain wanted the bottle design to reflect the technicality, the ultra-concentration and efficiency of its new serum. The result is a unique packaging concept, a multi-component container, with a strong identity, whose aesthetics and ease of use would never suggest all the complexity of its mechanism. Because the whole bottle is made of nine plastic components we entirely produced and assembled. The spirit of elegance and luxury of the iconic brand is clearly visible in the choice of materials and finishes, in particular the central insert made of natural PCTA highlighting the deep blue colour of the bottle, surrounded at each end with a golden trim in galvanized ABS. And the shape of the bottle also calls for vertical gestures, the bottle ""upside down"" and a ""twist off"" gesture for the opening, for the application of serum and the fully secured closing of the box ""Orchidée impériale, concentré de longévité."" Another example. After the feminine fragrance 212 VIP, the Puig Group has entrusted us with the production of its men's version: ""212 VIP MEN"" by Carolina Herrera. For this project we designed all the aluminium and plastic components and we were in charge of the whole project management. Among the components we assembled there was metal, various plastics, glass, steel and magnets. The bottle was delivered ready to be conditioned on the chain. Third example... with ""Prada Candy,"" which has just been singled out as the ""Best Packaging of the Year"" at the Fifi's Awards, where we designed a multi-component cap. At the centre of this ultra-sophisticated design, the galvanized gold logo is placed in a pink ring whose design is evocative of ""Safiano leather"". And the glass produced by Pochet du Courval makes of Prada Candy a fine example of development in synergy within the Group. Premium Beauty News - A multi-technology offer that has a cost! Pierre Marand - A cost first in terms of investments. This year, we are investing 20% more than we did in 2011, which had already been a consistent year in that area. Investments that are synonymous with an increase in capacity, a continuous optimization in production and therefore a reduction in costs. In concrete terms, we started earlier this year vacuum metallisation activities in Brazil, added new automated assembly lines and increased by 25% the production area of our Shanghai plant in China. Premium Beauty News - Colour cosmetics also seems to be an increasingly important axis? Pierre Marand - Correct! Our renewed presence at the MakeUp in Paris show in June and then to the second edition of the New York counterpart in September reflects our desire to assist our customers in this segment by making every effort to be and remain the reference for them in terms of packaging development. This is an axis that we want to develop through the strengthening among others, of our position in the area of make-up cases but also by developing ourselves in all products related to make-up for the lips. With our industrial tools running in Brazil, France and China, we are able to offer both mass market and very upscale products. This sector requires both a lot of know-how and technology, while also being subject to very tight price ranges and short deadlines. A every day challenge. Premium Beauty News - Did you take part to many launches this year? Pierre Marand - Yes, and this is probably the result of the trust that has developed between our customers and our teams. Among major launches that took place earlier this year we can name for perfumes, Truth of Dare (a very technical cap, designed with no visible parting line, whose relief consists of 29 hemispheres), Allure Homme Sport Eau Extrême by Chanel, Duo now Azzaro EDT; and for make-up, the compacts and the 3-in-1 foundation in the CK One Colors line by Calvin Klein and the compacts in the Wong Kar-Wai line for Shu Uemura."
"Pulvorex launches ""Lipress""","Premium Beauty News - In terms of lipstick samples, what were your findings? Gérard Sannier - Concerning ""Lipress"" the aim was not just to offer a sample but more to offer a new product which is easy to carry around in one's hand bag, but also quite conveniently in one's pocket, enabling to easily put some lipstick on, in any circumstances of modern life. But nowadays we can only observe, that the current forms of lipstick packaging don't allow this. In our case, with ""Lipress"" It's really is a ultra slim lipstick that works! Premium Beauty News - How do you actually applied? Gérard Sannier - It's very simple in fact! Just place ""Lipress"" between your lips and press on it while moving it up and down at the same time. It can be used from three to ten times and can be conditioned in boxes in quantities of 10, 20 or 50. And each ""Lipress"" has its colour reference for re-purchase. Of course, to enable a uniform coverage on the lips, the flexibility of the ""Lipress"" sample is essential. A lack of flexibility would put the lips out of shape and too much flexibility would not make it possible to cover them. It is of course patented at the European level. The model is therefore protected, the trademark was registered and internet domain names were registered too. Premium Beauty News - Actually, what are its main advantages? Gérard Sannier - For the consumer, it is easy to apply without needing to use a mirror. It is flat and small and can therefore be taken along without needing a handbag. You can change the colours at any time and easily. It is hygienic for pre purchase tests/trials. Finally it is very price competitive. For brands, it enables of course the promotion of lipsticks in magazines. It can only generate a high purchase rate. It offers many communication options and its brand potential is high. Its innovative presentation will help attract new customers and will offer brands a real competitive edge on the marketplace. Premium Beauty News - In fact, just don't forget to slip in your pocket and you're all set for the day! Gérard Sannier - Exactly! Each ""Lipress"" consists of a resealable unit packaging. And because it is extra slim, it can be inserted in a magazine like a promotional sample. Its shape and printable surface offer a very broad space for communication with the consumer."
MBF Plastiques metallizes without using vacuum metallisation!,"Premium Beauty News - A few words first on the key industrial events that have marked the year 2011 for MBF Plastiques... Jean-Michel Fouilland - First of all I can confirm that this was a good year. You know that we now own four production plants, including two injection plants in Oyonnax and Martignat, a polishing/metallization plant in Groissiat and a new assembly plant in Evron built in July 2011 and to which we will be adding 13,000 sq ft. We also started a second polishing line at Groissiat which enabled us to double our production capacity. Premium Beauty News - You had already qualified at the time of ""references years"", the years 2008 and 2009 after signing one after another, One Million by Paco Rabanne, Ricci by Nina Ricci, Scarlett by Cacharel and L'Eau Mega by Viktor Horsting & Rolf Snoeren. Launches that had at the time somewhat surprised people due to both their daring marketing approach and their technical prowess. And what about 2011? Jean-Michel Fouilland - Clearly, 2011 is a continuation of these outstanding years. We have never stopped strengthening our expertise in ""complete products"". We are no longer considered as ""mainstream"" injection specialists but more like specialists in the manufacture of premium technical plastic parts and like highly specialized integrators. So much so that the manufacture of sophisticated spray-caps, for example, has become one of our spearheads and now accounts for nearly 60% of our business. We integrate all types of materials and/or components. We seized that opportunity in the early 2000s and, over the years, our experience has grown considerably. To such a point that we have ended up designing some nozzles for actuators because of cost control issues and technological know-how. Last year was marked, of course, by the designing of Valentina de Puig where we took in charge all the spray-cap part and the whole upper part too, including assembling using UV bonding and the famous ""nozzle."" A 2011 year also marked by the release of Omnia Coral by Bvlgari where the tooling was far from simple. Premium Beauty News - Closures, packaging, spray-caps ... but also bottles? Jean-Michel Fouilland - That's right! A fact which is not known enough is that we also make mascaras in injection blow moulded vials. Our capacity is of about 2 million pieces per month. In fact, we can consider that the spray cap activity has now become the key activity of MBF Plastiques. The so called ""luxury"" segment also holds a significant share but ""Mastige"" also continues to grow steadily (20% of our business). Premium Beauty News - You have decided to remain very discreet for the time being, concerning this brand new decorating technique called ""ColorMeta"" for which you filed a patent! Jean-Michel Fouilland - You will know more soon enough. What I can unveil today is that this technique which is not a metallization technique as it is usually understood, offers surprising results who have nothing to envy to traditional metallization. And it's not lacquering either!"
Transparent dip tube: MWV strengthens its patents validity,"It is therefore with some satisfaction that the leaders of MWV attended this new edition of Luxe Pack New York. Because this favourable ruling from an American court of Justice on the validity of their patents on that famous transparent dip tube puts an end to many months of proceedings opposing the group to several of its competitors. ""MWV's research has proven that consumers identify a fragrance's packaging as the main reason for trying a scent, so brands looking to further their market share must take advantage of striking, visual packaging innovations – such as NoC® – to better stand out in today's competitive fragrance marketplace,"" said Sandy Gregory, MWV fragrance marketing director. ""The patent application approval in the United States is a critical victory for MWV] because it validates our efforts to produce significant innovations for our fragrance and cosmetics customers."" Specifically, MWV will highlight the patented system's use in several prestige fragrances including The Beat by Burberry; Féerie by Van Cleef and Arpels; Parfums Intimate by Victoria's Secret; Zaad by O'Boticario; and Bright Crystal by Versace. The patent approval comes just five months after MWV received a Notice of Allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on the patent application. Related patent applications are pending in the U.S. and other countries. The fragrance dispensing system using the NoC dip tube was introduced by MWV in 2006 and is manufactured globally to support prestige fragrance brands around the world. Meanwhile, the Group was presenting an extension of its popular Melodie line of fragrance pumps with the launch of Melodie® Delicate and Melodie® Forever. ""These two new solutions,"" we were told at the MWV stand, ""build on MWV's current Melodie portfolio to provide the most advanced dispensing technology options available for the high-end luxury fragrance market."" Originally launched in 2005, Melodie fragrance pumps are known for a discreet, low-profile design that offers smooth actuation and an engine that disappears into the neck of the fragrance bottle. The new pumps also offer these discreet aesthetics along with pre-compression spray technology. Melodie Delicate enhances the luxury experience by distributing an even, delicate spray pattern with gentle actuation and a whisper sound. Melodie Forever elevates the luxury experience even further by providing a long, sustained, uniform spray of fine particles for a ""weightless, subtle"" feel. ""At MWV, our goal is to provide robust and innovative packaging solutions that meet every unique customer need,"" said Mark Cross, senior vice president, MWV Packaging. ""These extensions to our Melodie pump offering help build our dispensing technology platform while continuing to support high-end luxury fragrance brands with the best quality spray performance in a well-known and proven design."" It may be recalled that MWV employs a total of 15,000 people worldwide and operates in 30 countries and serves customers in over 100 countries."
FACA bets on transparency and thick-walled jars,"With 100 million euros in turnover in 2011 and a hundred employees FACA, the Catalonia-based specialist of standard plastic jars, is passing through the difficulties of the Spanish economy. Its secret? ""Having proved able to adapt ourselves to the highest standards in quality,"" we were said at the company's headquarters in the suburbs of Barcelona. Hence the creation of a clean room to protect products from contamination, from the injection process to the packaging. The family business generates 90% of its sales abroad. Mainly in France, the company's biggest foreign market, in Northern Europe and in the United States, with customers such as Clarins, Sisley, Filorga or Estee Lauder. This success was built on the extent and the quality of the company's offering, especially for thick-walled or double walled jars for the industry (80% of sales). FACA, which operates its own workshop to create new models, boasts its range of standard jars as one of the largest in the market. ""And of course, since all brands want to differentiate themselves, through colours and decorations, we can take care of screen printing, pad printing and hot stamping operations ,"" said the company. As far as trends are concerned, let's highlight FACA's great interest for square shapes and cylindrical pots with straight edges, such as the T22/40, one of the latest production by the in-house studio, a 50ml jar. Moreover, as brands, in particular in the high-end segment, are still looking for a transparency as similar as possible from the one of glass, many of FACA's items are made from acrylic or SAN, despite the fact that these materials are not accepted by Ecocert. That does not mean environmental issues do not concern the company. On the contrary, FACA's management is actually very concerned about the company's environmental impact. ""We seek to minimize our releases of greenhouse gases and waste. Thus, we have equipped the production site with a heat recovery system and we also reuse all our manufacturing residues. But it is especially on these manufacturing issues that we are mainly investing. Indeed, the demand for environmentally friendly packaging is still marginal. It's a niche market, driven by small businesses and where volumes remain low."""
The ESEPAC creates its first specific training focused on high end packaging!,"Premium Beauty News: A few words on your school first... Serge German - Founded on 5 October 1991, at the instigation of the ICC of the Haute-Loire region and the University Blaise Pascal, 20 years ago, the Esepac delivers a European Master of Packaging Engineering since 2005 and the European License of Packaging Technology since 2009. 600 students have graduated since 1992. The Esepac has 9 full-time employees plus 13 university professors, 35 professionals. The bulk of revenues come from the training levy, considering that each student costs an average of 10,000 euros. To note that in 2010 we built a new building of 1,200 sqm (12,916 sq ft.). We can say that the Esepac under the leadership of the ICC and of the University, has become the leader of higher education in packaging in France, with the only Master in this field and a promotion with more than 40 students. The placement rate is, four months after graduation, of 96%. We have developed a very strong relationship with the companies. We manage a portfolio of over 200 partner businesses (Work-based learning, Training, Intervention, Vocational Training, Studies & industrial projects...). Finally, we animate the ""Prospective Packaging"" club which brings together decision makers from different industrial fields of activities. This club proposes potential axes of development for packaging courses. Premium Beauty News - Work-based learning is a strong element of your training? Serge German - 95% of students are on a work-based learning scheme! The ESEPAC aims to train line managers in the field of packaging. It offers full-time courses (with trainings) or on a work-linked basis, to enable students to confront their theoretical knowledge to corporate reality and develop real skills. Work-based learning can be achieved with both packaging manufacturers, distributors and packaging users, in SMEs and SMIs or multinationals, on the entire French territory and in all areas of activity. Premium Beauty News - You have also reviewed your Master in Packaging Engineering in 2012! Serge German - Diplomas are rehabilitated every 5 years by a European agency (AERES). We have organized the master along three courses focused on, the occupations of packaging project manager, packaging technical designer/developer and as Head of the graphics chain. The project manager has a transversal role of project organizer, of conductor. He has the responsibility of the project completion, and he must take into consideration all the constraints; technical, economic compliance, deadlines, as well as the adequacy with the strategies of the company, its resources, its prospects for development in terms of markets and staff. The technical developer is in charge of the technical realization of the project, its perfect match with the technical, economic constraints and deadlines. He is responsible for the perfect workability of the designed solution. The role of graphic chain manager is to improve the efficiency of the creative process and graphic design. It interacts with such functions as communication, marketing, sales force, regulatory, creative agencies and printers. He is responsible for the adequacy of the printed document to the original document, the technical, economic requirements, and deadlines. Premium Beauty News - How did this specific training on luxury packaging emerge? Serge German - Several companies involved in luxury products (perfumes and cosmetics mainly) were having difficulties finding qualified staff in packaging technologies. Positions concerned project management in which the necessary technical knowledge is high. At the end of 2010, the LVMH Group, through Daniel Saclier, looked for a training organization that would be in a position to organize training courses focusing on technical packaging. After studying several avenues with LVMH and the Puig group. The decision was taken to create a group of 12 to 15 students for whom three complete EU of the Master program were adapted to the specificities of this field. This corresponded to about 190h of technical courses. The implementation began transversally as of September 2011. The system is complemented by interventions at the Esepac of professionals in perfumery/cosmetics, by the establishment of tutored projects (Case studies), through the submission of technical subjects for students to work on the during their training. There is a an introductory brief on the subject, an interim review and a dossier and/or defence given at the end of the training. Subjects come from the perfume/cosmetic industry, the school supports students on their technical work. The evaluation of results and comments are made by the perfume/cosmetic industry. (The first one was undertaken by Guerlain). Premium Beauty News - And what about the future? Serge German - The future is also hinged for us around vocational training and international development. The dissemination of knowledge to the company will be at the heart of the Esepac's concerns as part of degree courses or qualified training (targeted training). Packaging is currently experiencing major changes in terms of technologies, materials, organization and working methods. Brand owners are integrating or developing packaging functions focused on design; in parallel convertors are increasing called upon for global solutions, combining several materials; distribution gets involved in functions pertaining to design and the structuring of technical demand in packaging. Cross-cutting skills are increasingly gaining in importance for the success of projects and therefore of companies, beyond people's need for retraining. As for our entry into operations abroad, it will help develop know-hows, the attractiveness of the school for the industry and to offer higher job opportunities for students. Actions are currently underway on diplomas and content with two European schools, on work-based learning with several companies outside France, on the recruitment of foreign students. The local industrial fabric and its expertise in the field of packaging is a bearer of this line of evolution."
Aircos presents a novel injection technique for cosmetics,"""It took us eighteen months to develop this technique,"" explains Éric Merville, General Manager. A technique that, according to the company, offers multiple advantages that can be summarized in three points: – an optimum result in terms of textures, shapes and surface effects, – an extremely clean process, – a highly competitive technology. Both a manufacturer of cosmetics and a plastic injection specialist for the manufacture of packaging, Aircos will have drawn from this dual expertise for the development of this new process. A dual expertise that enables the French firm to also offer the best possible mastery in terms of container/content compatibility. ""This technology clearly opens us the door to new markets, emphasises Merville, and represents a real breakthrough in this market due to the quality of the obtained textures; and we are still making progress every day with the help of both our expertise in formulation and our knowledge in injection processes."""
Stora Enso: closer to the end consumer,"A 2012 year started ""briskly"" for the world leader in the production of paperboard (in volume) who has the particularity (and the asset according to its leaders) of having the widest board offer on the marketplace, from the virgin fibre-based grades to those made of recycled fibres. ""It is clear, explains Hervé Vue, Sales Director of Stora Enso Renewable Packaging in France, that cardboard, and consequently the packaging industry, are more than ever a strategic product for the Group. We are obviously aware of the impact of new information technologies on our business and of its inevitable consequences on the global production of printing and writing paper."" Hence, the constant investment in the packaging segment. ""Hence also, emphasises Vue, the important research work undertaken by our engineers for this material to be used where it is least expected and in replacement, in some areas, of other materials such as plastic or metal."" In terms of investments, two announcements were made recently that mark the desire of the Finnish group to be present globally to serve an increasingly demanding customer market. China, for example, where Stora Enso has confirmed the construction of a mill with a capacity of 450,000 tons per year of board and 900,000 tons of pulp. A joint operation conducted with The Guangxi Forestry Group. Total investment, 1.6 billion euros. Main objective, produce liquid packaging boards and other premium packaging for the consumer products market. With a start-up scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2014. ""What is important, insists Vue, is the industrial approach of our Group with this kind of investments and the philosophy that accompanies it. The forest is the cornerstone of our business. We start first by establishing the conditions enabling for the proper exploitation of this forest before we start building a mill. We start by making sure that the required raw material is available, even if it means sometimes investing ten years before in the plantation of Eucalyptus trees, like in Uruguay. In Vietnam, we even took the opportunity to participate in an extensive mine-clearing program of the forests."" Another important credo at the centre of the four key objectives of the group, the ""renewable ""notion. ""We have the incredible opportunity of being able to work in an area where this concept is permanent,"" people at Stora tell us. ""It is our raison d'être, from the exploitation of forests to the end of life of our products. It was therefore something that could be asserted without any room for doubt and put forward too! "". For Jouko Karvinen, CEO of Stora Enso, the message is clear: ""The construction of this new mill in China is part of the same process. Namely, an integrated mill at the top level fitting into this concept of 'renewable raw material' for the benefit of Chinese consumers within one the most dynamic consumer market in the world."" Another area of development for managers at Stora, tomorrow's paper and board, or how to use this material for applications that seemed until yesterday unthinkable. ""We are very close to reaching concrete results,"" says Vue. ""We already offer composite wood based materials that largely outperform some plastics and who will also outperform some metals in the future. As a proof of this, some conclusive tests already carried out to manufacture surfboards that make other plastics look like a bygone material. A series of revolutions that is sure to impact also the premium packaging industry. ""For now, explains Vue, the marketing of our new Ensocoat range launched in January 2010 has exceeded by far all our expectations. The Imatra mill, and its #2 machine with a capacity of 220,000 tons/year, that we have highly specialized for this Premium niche, is steadily increasing its performances. The result of a substantive work in both the quality of the product and service, but also on communication. This is probably the first time in the group's history that there was such willingness to bring together all these conditions. And the results are there to prove it!"""
Quadpack: new logo and new lease of life!,"Hats off to this firm created in 2002 by three partners (Tim Eaves, Philippe Lenglart and Jeremy Garrard), then distributors of several packaging brands in their domestic markets (Spain, France and England) who decided to create Quadpack. Ten years later, there is no denying that the merger was successful: 33 million euros in sales, a total staff of 91, presence in 11 countries worldwide, including Spain (28% of the business), Britain (18%), France (15%) and Italy (15%), not to mention Germany, Turkey, Poland, Australia, China, Korea and the US, all mark a particularly impressive journey. Spearhead of the company is the distribution of products from Korean company Yonwoo and, more particularly, the success of its range of airless packaging, which now represents about 60% of Quadpack's activity. ""But that's not all we do,"" insists Tim Eaves, CEO. ""Our image as an airless specialist should not overshadow our key activities in the marketing of glass jars, make-up packaging, plastic vials and jars, pumps and dispensers, tubes, roll-ons and pan sticks. Last year, we also signed an exclusive distribution deal with Korean company Apollo, giving us access to its cutting-edge foamer technology."" For Quadpack's CEO, there is no doubt that the company's share in 'make-up' is set to increase significantly in the group's activity over the next few years, particularly thanks to its expertise in airless. ""This is also one of the reasons for our partnership with Brivaplast,"" explains Lenglart. ""Brivaplast possesses great expertise in manufacturing and development, while we offer marketing vision and a successful commercial network."" Quadpack's main assets, according to its leaders, are its marketing abilities and its commercial presence. ""On these points, we have to keep reviewing our means to ensure these assets remain effective,"" emphasises Lenglart. Concerning the commercial network, the group headquarters in Barcelona are set to move to larger, 600m2 (6,500 sq ft) offices this September. In Paris, the ten-strong team from Quadpack France have just moved into a 200 m2 (2,150 sq ft) office located at 10 rue Vignon, a stone's throw from La Madeleine. ""It had become necessary,"" explains Laurent Frydlender, the new Head of the French business unit. ""This brings us closer to our customers, 80% of whom are located in this area."" The main objective for France is to double its activity in five years' time! In terms of marketing, there is the new logo. Tim Eaves explains: ""It expresses what we value: passion, dedication and integrity! It conveys our mission, which underlines everything we do: 'Helping beauty brands perform!"" What better goal, indeed!"
Airless: Aptar wants to regain control by recalling its expertise in vacuum conditioning,"An opportunity, in any case for managers at Aptar of regaining control, in the midst of this debate, by recalling during a recent press conference, their unique expertise in this area, particularly concerning filling and vacuum snap-on, thanks to a comprehensive packaging solution. Main advantages of the ""Airless Concept by Aptar"", according to officials, ""a team dedicated to vacuum filling machines, contracts with fillers in the United States, France and Germany, conditioning machines that meet pharmaceutical and food standards, to be the only supplier capable of ensuring a vacuum packaging, a 100% control of all pumps and bottles and three types of Airless machines suiting different production rates."" And to claim the group's lab expertise with drastic control criteria on air tightness, precise and consistent dosage delivery, restitution rates, product integrity and air return during drop tests, a guaranteed priming and icing on the cake, the preservation of the product's integrity during use even with piston systems thanks to, among others (and that is a novelty), a new patent at this level insuring perfect air tightness. ""After developing our 'Irresistible' solution consisting of a coextruded pouch, Aptar's management said, we sought to develop a 'Irresistible' solution with a piston system to cover wider viscosity ranges. This resulted in this new patent which prevents any air contamination from the bottom of bottles to ensure complete air tightness to micro-organisms."" A series of arguments that will inevitably, and they are right, hit the bull's eye in a market estimated at 500 million units a year, where growth rates each year, remain particularly high and where the needs in terms of preservation of a content consisting in fragile preservative-free formulas are increasing."
Beauty packaging: What about brands' expectations?,"In partnership with Premium Beauty News, Invescomm interviewed 182 marketing and packaging development managers working for beauty brands, with the aim to understand what is, according to them, the relative importance of packaging in the success of their products on the market and what are their expectations towards their suppliers. Invescomm surveyed marketers about the importance of packaging in the success of their products. While primary packaging is ranked in third place, after the brand and the effectiveness of the formula, as a factor influencing the consumer's decision to purchase a beauty product, the overall aesthetics of the product is perceived as the first key to commercial success for a beauty product, before advertising, effectiveness of the formula, and the pleasure of grasping and touching. However, as far as the future is concerned, the marketers who participated in the survey consider, that pleasure of use, aesthetics, environmental friendliness and dispensing convenience will be the four most important characteristics of packaging for consumers. However, if the search for fun and sophistication have reached consensus, environment friendless is apparently dealing with several paradoxes. However, while 86% of respondents believe that brands increasingly promote packaging added value, and 58% believe that the constraint of price may decrease the quality and diversity of packaging in the future, 65% believe that environmental constraints will have no impact at this level. Furthermore, for the vast majority of respondents beauty packaging will be very different in 10 years. Perhaps because of the increasing sensitivity of consumers to the composition of formulas. Finally, concerning the relationship between brands and their suppliers, if the satisfaction level is correct, there are still significant improvement margins, with high expectations in terms of eco-design and innovation standards."
"Brazil: Arcade Latam, a segment leader","In thirteen years, Arcade specialized in the design and manufacturing of multi sensory sampling systems for the beauty industry will have imposed itself in South America as ""the"" main provider of top perfume and cosmetic brands in the region. ""It must be said that it was the only company capable of ensuring quality and quantity in that matter,"" confirmed Philippe Ughetto, Senior VP International. ""As of 2010, we started producing locally,"" emphasised Jérôme Massei, CEO of Arcade Latam. ""Door to door sale of perfume and cosmetic products is the largest distribution channel in Brazil and requires editing millions of catalogues each month, explains Massei, for a million sellers operating in the field."" Now who says catalogue, often says scented samples. Not to forget the needs in terms of material for point of sales, press inserts and specific needs of franchise stores. ""For example, I can tell you that one of the biggest door to door selling brand publishes about 4 million catalogues of thirty to forty pages every three weeks!"" Brazil will have been the main growth engine of Arcade in South America. The mission of Arcade Latam now consists in consolidating its leading position in Brazil and to expand in other countries with a high potential like Mexico and the Andean region, mainly Colombia and Peru. Arcade Latam wants to position itself as the best partner for sampling solutions and communication tools for perfume, skincare and make-up."
"Aerosol packaging: Sleever proposes ""his solution""!","Premium Beauty News - In fact, the first question that comes to mind is: ""In what is it really new and why didn't anyone think about it earlier?"" Eric Fresnel - It was not that easy to combine all the constraints in connection with this type of packaging, its material, its production rates and the markets in which it operates to reach the optimal solution in terms of aerosols packaging. It was therefore necessary to elaborate a particular film, a printing method and a new machine concept. In addition, the solution proposed by Sleever had to also meet growing demands for the development of late differentiation, for the printing on complex surfaces and the management of large stocks. Premium Beauty News - A new film and a new printing technology... Nothing less? Eric Fresnel - Indeed, we have developed for this application a new material, a white opaque film, in order to reach a more attractive packaging solution that could be used for the packaging of white or neutral aluminium aerosol containers, with simple or complex shapes. But this also meant a new printing technology, the Helioflex, which combines two technologies, rotogravure and flexography for the printing of images and of sophisticated texts. A technology that offers great printing flexibility with up to 10 colours, special effects like Braille or the application of technology varnishes enabling a better grip and technical solutions like tamper-evident systems or the printing of all type of codes like the DataMatrix,... Premium Beauty News - A significant advantage of course, only one type of aerosol whatever the reference! Eric Fresnel - Indeed this is a significant Asset. SleeverAerosol is clearly a sustainable development solution through the optimization of the supply chain it enables. Only one type of aerosol whatever the reference. This means a stock optimization, a simplified management of sleeves and a greater ease of implementation, a responsiveness and lower batch sizes ≤ 25 000. Premium Beauty News - A word on this positioning machine... Eric Fresnel - Our engineers have developed a new more efficient machine concept, the SleeverCombi. Ultra compact, monobloc and modular, it offers a great flexibility in terms of formats, changeovers ≤ 10 minutes, speed with up to 300 aerosols per minute, easy ergonomics (workspace, accessibility, user-friendly, digital screens.)"
"Charles Chang, Topline: ""Industrial challenges and social responsibility""","Premium Beauty News - This new plant in Mexico and your desire to be more present in France were strategic moves for you? Charles Chang - Yes, of course! At one stage, you must let intuition take the lead. Clearly it was necessary to build the plant in Mexico. This is the story of the pendulum. Production has left the U.S. to go to Asia. But costs are increasing a lot in Asia and a reverse movement will occur. Cost and service concepts will still be the key considerations. Don't forget that we acquired for this purpose, in June 2010, in Dundee, Michigan the former Motor City Plastics injection factory that was producing compacts and caps. For certain types of operations, Mexico is also the right choice. As for Europe,the acquisition of Primapack was an important step. It allows us to provide high quality products and services at a regional level and to streamline the production line, while increasing at the same time our responsiveness to the market. Europe is a dynamic market for innovations in the beauty and skin care sector and this acquisition will strengthen our competitiveness on this market with the help of Topline's multiple production sites. Premium Beauty News - But you are not stopping there? Charles Chang - The U.S. and Mexican industrial experience are very instructive for us. And I haven't overlooked anything for Europe. What matters is our ability to meet the needs of the market. Obviously, this demanded a ""1st class"" organization which we are building. Similarly, I can announce that we are opening a sales office in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where I'm not excluding anything either. Premium Beauty News - Industrial tools are important! But men are even more! And you wish to take every offered opportunity to highlight your commitment in this area. Charles Chang - It's true! And I must thank you for giving me the opportunity to do so. Nothing is possible in our business without adequate training. That's why I've decided to take part in the development of Packaging Engineering at Rutgers University. In this area, ""network"" and ""financial means"" are both crucial tools. So I created the Rutgers Packaging Engineering Advisory Board (RPEAB), which consists of leaders and decision-makers from the fields of business, industry, government and education who provide guidance and assistance to Packaging Engineering and its students at Rutgers University. The purpose and mission of the Advisory Board are: – Supports and promotes Rutgers Packaging Engineering as a premier packaging program in US; – Provides Rutgers with assessment of the curriculum, both existing and proposed, and with a sketch of what is going on in the industry including trends and needs; – Helps to build specialty programs for specific industries such pharmaceutical, cosmetics, household and personal care, printing, corrugated, food, plastic molding and other sectors; – Provides internships, co-ops and other training opportunities for students, continues to assure the development of excellence and outstanding graduates at all levels, and provides productive employment where feasible; – Fosters truly cooperative activities between industry and Rutgers Packaging Engineering including packaging research sponsorships and new, innovative technology development; – Actively raises funds for student scholarships and more teaching staff for the program through an annual fundraising event, industry seminars and the UPPER (University Partnership in Packaging Engineering at Rutgers) program. Last year we raised $110,000."
Mascara: the revival of fibre,"Premium Beauty News - A revival of the mascara fibre resulting for you in a significant increase of your production capacity? Sarah Perreard - That's right! We have clearly noticed a strong surge in demand since mid 2010. So much so that we have almost doubled our production capacity in the space of a year and a half in our U.S. plant of Washington Works, Virginia and which has fully justified the commissioning of a new production line in our factory in Shenzen, China. We are staying in tune with the market and are not excluding to continue this expansion on a regional basis. Premium Beauty News - ""Tynex®"" is not a novel product though! Sarah Perreard - We can say that historically it dates back to the period of creation of the Group's Filaments division more than 75 years ago, very much related as you know, to the discovery of nylon. One of the first applications of this fibre concerns the manufacturing of toothbrushes. One kilo of ""Tynex"" enables to make ""only"" 1,000 toothbrushes... but 10,000 mascara and 40,000 nail polish brushes. Premium Beauty News - How do you explain the renewed interest for this type of fibre compared to injected brushes? Sarah Perreard - For both economic and technical reasons. Economic because the development cost of an injection mould can be very expensive and that this market is somewhat saturated in terms of patents. Overall, the use of filaments enables greater flexibility during the development phase. Modifying the shape, rigidity, or the number of filament of a fibre brush is much more simple and cost saving to achieve than it is with an injected brush which would require the manufacture of a specific mould. Technically because we were able to propose new shapes of fibres, of textures, which enables to better adapt them to the application of new formulas on eyelashes, take for example the success of the very trendy Hollow Tynex® fibre but also of ""Sea Horse"", ""Super Soft splittable"", or ""Quadrilobal"", to name a few. We offer various forms of filaments, with the inside that may be hollow-shaped, and the outside which can be in relief, etc. Then it's all the know-how of the brush manufacturer that can express itself in the way of cutting the fibres to give them such-and-such original characteristics in terms of formula load and restitution during application. A last important point concerns patents on fibre-based brushes, many of them have fallen into the public domain which considerably broadens the field of application and enables the use of filaments that we had developed several years ago but which had been little used so far. Good news indeed for developers of mascaras..."
"Surlyn 3D..., five years already!","Premium Beauty News - ""Revolutionary"" was the word that was most appropriate in 2008 when your group introduced for the first time this new technology! Five years later, what are the achievements? Philippe Milazzo - You know, it's never easy to introduce a radically new technology on a market. But after five years, one can really be optimistic. I will recall the technique in a few words. You start by manufacturing a container using extrusion blow moulding or injection blow moulding, then it is overmoulded using a specific injection technique with Surlyn®, an overmoulding that can take a different form. At the same time, the overmoulded container can benefit from any type of decoration. You can also insert something between this inner container and the Surlyn® overmoulded part. Of course, and you are aware of that since we have a partnership with Bormioli Luigi, the container can also be overmoulded with glass. Main advantages of this Surlyn® 3D technology, an unparalleled aesthetic result, the possibility of having multiple shapes both for the inner and the outer container, and an excellent deep, glass-like transparency, not to mention the possibility of having the decoration literally sandwiched between the primary container and its Surlyn® shell, as if it was suspended between the two. Of course, this also allows to condition products that would not necessarily be compatible if they were in direct contact with Surlyn®. Premium Beauty News - The over moulding of a glass bottle works but has not found any applications yet. On the contrary, many plastic/plastic products are already on the market? Philippe Milazzo - Absolutely! I can name a few like ""Grandaine Luxage Skincare"" by Kosé, ""Aquagirl Brightup Foundation"" and ""Clinique Repairwear Laser Focus"" by Estée Lauder. Each product has its own characteristics but each of them made the most of the unique advantages of this technique. Other brands are on the brink of setting foot on the market in the coming weeks. I must emphasize on the extraordinary variety of types of shapes and finishing that can be used with our technology. Small objects, pieces of fabric, granular products can be inlaid... You can play with hollows and reliefs..."
"Heinz Glas launches ""New Age Glass""","Premium Beauty News - The Heinz group and the environment, quite an ongoing story? Nicolas Lejeune - Situated at the heart of a nature park on the border between Bavaria and Thuringia, it is clear that the sites of the group are environmentally friendly and meet very stringent control rules from the authorities. The environmental approach instilled by our President, Heinz Karl August, started in the 70s. The depopulation of the low mountain country region has left abandoned difficult to access areas. To maintain these fallow lands, M. Heinz introduced the only animals capable of maintaining these pastures during extreme weather conditions, Scottish cows, this as of 1980, on the hills surrounding the factory. The self maintaining of landscapes was an environmental and ecological choice. Another example, that of the waste water treatment facility which aims to neutralize and purify the waste water generated by the industrial site. The treated waters are discharged into ponds populated by swans and trout, this may seem trivial, but it is a guarantee of quality for our equipments. We also Integrated since 1998 water-based lacquering techniques, that is, eight years before the legal requirement, and 10 years before the implementation of this decree among most decorators working for the cosmetic glass industry. These same principles were applied to the metallization workshops since their establishment in 2009. From this results production process using very little solvent which are therefore environmentally friendly. Another environmental approach, this time in order to recover energy: the heat coming from the furnaces used for production is collected and reused. To further develop this concept, M. Heinz has launched the construction of heated greenhouses where tropical fruits will be grown and a fish farming activity of warm-water fishes (tilapia) will be also launched, this for commercial purposes. This project will create 30 jobs, and if it proves viable, will be duplicated in each of our glass factories. Premium Beauty News - In what consisted your approach? Nicolas Lejeune - Quite logically, since this corresponds to our first activity, Heinz Glas has also chosen to produce bottles and jars with 100% recycled glass. The project started in 2009 and the first trials in mid-2010. The ""plus"" in the process stands in the way the glass is melted. To take our environmental ideas to their logical conclusion, we opted for the purchase of renewable energies, which enables us to claim for a zero CO2 produced glass. The whole issue lies in three watch words: sourcing, transformation process, product quality. This concept was made possible thanks to a high recycling rate in Germany, by a proximity sourcing, and also by the availability of clean energy. If the main raw materials used for glass, namely sand, soda ash, lime and dolomite exist in vast quantities in nature and appear to meet our needs almost infinitely, the full recyclability of glass makes it a matter of interest for the future in terms of sourcing. France recycles 68% of glass, in Germany the rate is of 88%. We benefit from a raw material with constant quality, which has undergone strict grinding and cleaning stages. With no adjuvant, the material is pure, and capacities are of the order of 30 tonnes per day. On the ""energy"" side, the recycled glass is melted in electric furnaces, and the energy is provided by solar, wind and hydroelectric power. The network of natural energies in Germany is well developed. In the 90s, the country opted for a phasing out of nuclear power and in 2009 was already producing 18% of renewable energy, against 44% of coal, 2% of oil, 12% of natural gas, and 23% of nuclear energy. Premium Beauty News - What are the advantages and disadvantages of your ""green"" glass? Nicolas Lejeune - Concerning its aesthetic aspect, we get a slightly tinted glass, this is due to the origin of the raw material itself, and to the micro-bubbles that come from the high viscosity of molten glass. These points could be improved with the addition of a decolourant and fluidizing additive, but presently we preferred to keep the choice of a 100% recycled and pure glass which is consistent with the overall concept of New Age Glass. Nonetheless and concerning the advantages, the physicochemical properties of the glass thus produced, remain similar to new glass: safety, thermal, chemical and mechanical resistance, recyclability. The hydrolytic class III is guaranteed in accordance with the requirements for packagings intended for cosmetics and food stuff. In its 100% recycled glass, additive-free formulation, bottles and jars can receive any type of decoration (lacquering, screen printing, pad printing, hot stamping), with the exception maybe of metallization which requires very smooth and very stretched surfaces. Our customers with a comprehensive environmental concept can, with the New Age Glass, claim for the ECOCERT logo. By comparison, Melting of 100 tonnes of raw glass in a gas furnace = 81 tonnes of CO2 Melting of 100 tons of recycled glass in an electric furnace = 5 tons of CO2 Melting of 100 tons of recycled glass in an electric furnace using solar, wind or hydraulic energy = 0 tonnes of CO2 Nevertheless bearing in mind that the finishing operations, not benefiting from these natural energy supplies, and taking account of transportation, finally the gain obtained by our procedures is 90% over the carbon footprint. The New Age Glass enables to reduce the carbon rating by 10 compared to usual practices. EXAMPLES OF CARBON BALANCES"

Since its inception, the company has continued to grow annually, being named five times to the Inc. 500/5000 list of fastest growing private companies in the United States. Premium Beauty News - You have built your reputation on an original concept: disposable accessories, instruments and packaging for the beauty industry. Sari Sternschein - In 1987, Stuart Herskovitz, founder of Qosina Corporation, an international medical components supplier, was walking by the cosmetic counters in a major department store when he noticed consumers trying on lipsticks and placing the tubes back into the display units. It was then that he realized there was a need for disposables that would help reduce the risks of cross-contamination. He thought, ""If doctors and hospitals use medical disposables to reduce these risks, why not apply the same principle to the beauty industry?"" Thus Qosmedix was born, and has since expanded to provide a wide array of high quality products that offer both convenience and value to its customers. In 2009, Qosmedix added a line of professional makeup brushes (PRO Brushes) to satisfy the need for high caliber makeup brushes that are competitively priced and fully customizable. Premium Beauty News - What are your main markets? Sari Sternschein - Currently, Qosmedix actively markets its products in the United States and Canada, but we sell to customers all over the world.

When airless becomes a source of questions!,"Premium Beauty News - During the conference, you had the opportunity to question on several occasions some of the speakers. What observations do you draw from these discussions? Xavier Sutty - Actually, I would first highlight two points. First point, the manufacturing and filling phases for the bulk are essential to ensure a long lasting protection of very fragile formulas, especially during the sometimes neglected pre-purchase storage period that can represent months, and sometimes even years. However, manufacturing and filling operations in an aseptic environment are relatively exceptional (pharmaceuticals excepted). Second point, preservative-free, and anti-oxidant-free formulas are seldom seen and currently only represent a niche market. To note that the Ecocert type fragile formulas are protected by authorized preservatives and used sparingly. So if we summarize: – The choice criterion for an airless packaging lies mainly in its 360° restitution capacity of viscous formulas. – The protection criterion often comes second after the restitution capacity and design/decoration. – You might have noticed that iconic brands in the segment of natural cosmetics no longer use airless containers, due to the low perceived added value, the often banal design, the high price and relatively good stability of formulas. – Precise dosage delivery is a very relative concept when it doesn't concern dermo-cosmetic, make-up and pharmaceutical products. – Brands' marketing teams haven't totally grasp the technology and the benefits of airless systems for their communication to consumers, aside some exceptional cases. – The efforts of manufacturers of airless containers in order to reduce the environmental impact are rarely included in the brand's marketing messages. Premium Beauty News - However it looks like brands that took the floor during the conference did clearly describe their expectations? Xavier Sutty - It's true! Expectations that are hinged on three poles: First, there is functionality: ease and convenience of restitution, adequate protection for fragile formulas but still containing some preservatives, low environmental impact (eco-friendly). Around this pole, brands expect more technical simplicity and a very attractive price. This equal to 75% of the market. Then, a design that must inspire dreams to consumers and amplify their senses. This equal to 20% of the market. Eventually, the ultra-protection of very sensitive formulas, with no preservatives, manufactured and filled in very controlled, and even aseptic conditions. This equal to less than 5% of the market. We can therefore question ourselves on the response offered by airless packaging on the marketplace - pump bottles or tubes - in the light of these observations, and through an analysis of the value of the means used to satisfy the majority of needs. In addition, leading packaging manufacturers attending the conference don't seem to be developing other ways of ensuring the protection and restitution functions aside from the concept of inserted pump. With conventional airless packaging, pump bottles or tubes, aren't we on the brink of over-quality-in quite a few examples of cosmetic applications? Is there not a new avenue to explore in the airless domain that would just focus on simplicity and appropriate quality, to protect fragile formulas while providing consumers with a real service limiting the environmental impact? Premium Beauty News - We can see where you're getting to? Xavier Sutty - Clearly to our solution: Pumpart System has opened this pathway with its pouch tube and pumpless, tubairless ®, which offers an excellent restitution of viscous products thanks to its flexible piston as well as a sufficient protection for fragile formulas with its anti-air intake device. Tubairless® only consists of three parts: a conventional tube + a flexible pouch + a cap. The key advantages of tubairless® are: – The protection of fragile formulas by the anti-air intake device. – The effortless full product restitution even for highly viscous formulations. – The preservation of the tube's shape and aesthetics to the last day of use (our tube does not collapse on itself). – The reduction of plastic materials due to the absence of pump. – The ease of recycling since the tube is mono-materials (PE tube and pocket; PP cap) – The simplicity and reliability of the tube. I invite of course people to discover our patented, tubairless® solution, by watching the short 3D video available on our website: http://www.pumpart.com/ products (click on ""View the Video""). Other manufacturers of packaging will probably join Pumpart System on this market to meet the unsatisfied pending needs of brands."
Pierre Hémar appointed president of Ileos,"This nomination follows the acquisition, announced on January 2, of Ileos (Nord-Est) by Oaktree Capital Management. Pierre Hémar will work with a streamlined management team. His mission will be to reinforce innovation and pursue the development of sales and industrial initiatives at Ileos group. In 2010, Oaktree's French affiliate finalised the acquisitions of SGD, a French specialist of glass containers for perfumes and cosmetics. Pierre Hémar has managed a number of companies in the luxury-goods and cosmetics packaging sectors. ""He will bring his industry and client expertise in addition to his successful track record as a manager of companies that have seen strong growth,"" comments Ileos in a release. ""Pierre Hémar will have the support of Oaktree's industrial expertise (as SGD shareholder) to establish collaborations with the glass sector to benefit the group's clients,"" the group adds. Ileos will be reorganised into 2 divisions: Ileos Beauty, which includes Axilone and Bioplan and will be managed by Ludovic Anceau, and Ileos Graphic, comprised of Alliora and Packetis, to be headed up by Philippe Declerck. With facilities in Europe, America and Asia, the group employs more than 4,000 people, half of which are in France and has a turnover of 325 million euros in 2011."
MWV is continuing its expansion strategy on the perfume market,"With 30 factories and 18,000 employees worldwide, customers in more than 100 countries and a global turnover of about $ 6 billion in 2011, the MeadWestvaco (MWV) group is today one of the packaging world leaders. A strategic transformation for this group which was operating at first in the forest and paper industry, as 72% of its sales is currently generated by the packaging industry worldwide. Packaging operations are organized according to the key markets to serve: beauty & personal care, beverage, food packaging, healthcare, home & garden, tobacco, etc. For the beauty and personal care market, MWV offers both complete solutions in primary packaging (in particular distribution systems for cosmetics and perfumes, airless, aerosols, etc.) and in secondary packaging such as folding boxes, cases, with all the relevant decoration techniques. In this market, the group has set a target to achieve US$ 1 billion in sales within five years, which implies a large industrial and commercial deployment in the world. In practice this will mean gaining significant market share and, probably, seizing all relevant external growth opportunities in the future. ""We will make significant investments, but by targeting our innovations the closest possible to the needs of our customers. Nowadays the complete development of a pump represents an investment of more than 10 million euros. Which means we must know perfectly well the consumer habits and expectations,"" explained Laurent Bourgoin, Europe and Middle East Sales Director. In 2011, the beauty & personal care activity increased by 6%, with a double-digit growth for airless and foamers driven by the development of natural products, the lesser use of preservatives, research for an optimum product restitution and of adapted doses. For cosmetics, MWV has heavily invested in the development of pumps containing no metal parts, to make recycling easier but to also improve the compatibility with formulas and reduce allergy risks. In the fragrance market, after a record 2010 year, in particular thanks to the success of One Million by Paco Rabane, MWV has continued to gain market share and now has approximately 500 customers in Europe, with more than 300 million pumps sold in 2011. The doubling of the production capacity for the Melodie pump at the beginning of the month in the Barcelona plant, is emblematic of the group's current success and of its ambitions in the cosmetic and perfume market. ""Since its launch in 2005, the Melodie pump, one of the most discreet and smallest pump on the marketplace, was so successful among luxury perfume brands that it had become crucial to increase our production capacity,"" explained Sandy Gregory, Marketing Director for the Fragrance Division at MWV. It's an investment of several million euros that was earmarked in 2011, not only to modernize the injection tool, but also for the installation of the best multi-cavity moulds in their category and of even more automated and faster assembly chains. In addition to an increase in production, this cutting edge equipment should also contribute - together with a whole range of other measures - to the unit's significant reduction in CO2 emissions. Overall, the Barcelona factory (an industrial site of 9,172 sqm, on a land of 12,309 sqm with 250 employees), the core of the group's centre of excellence for perfumes, was upgraded to comply with the best industrial standards : ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 22716 (for Cosmetic Good Manufacturing Practices). Quite enough to offer all the guarantees of quality to particularly demanding customers. And as good news never come alone, MWV was pleased to learn that recently the State Intellectual Property Office of the People's Republic of China had approved the patent application on its distribution system using dip tubes made of fluoropolymer (such as NOC), which, through differences in light refraction becomes almost invisible to the eye in a perfume juice. In addition to China, this patent was also approved in the United States, Mexico and Russia. An additional argument to attract luxury brands, obviously eager to preserve the elegance and refinement of their bottles."
FSKorea claims the first place!,"For brushes, an historic sector of the company, it's almost done with a production of over 100 million units a year; for the more recent packaging activity, for airless containers, make-up cases and mascaras, FSKorea is taking great strides. It can already boast producing one hundred million mascaras a year with FSKColour, its subsidiary created in joint venture, and the twenty three injection machines from one of its Chinese factories which was build from the ground up in 1995 are running at full capacity to provide, among others, the compacts. Since its inception in 1988, FSKorea remains a model of its kind in terms of development. That year for example, the firm only employed 10 people, produced its first brushes in a tiny factory and achieved USD 230,000 in sales. The first customers, many of them from the Middle East, could be counted on the fingers of one hand. Four years later, the company's profile is no longer the same. Customers are named Avon, Maybeline, Mary Kay, to name only a few, and the turnover has jumped to USD 6 million, just like the number of employees who was simply multiplied by ten. As a result, J.K. Hwang decides to build a second plant in 1995 of 3,000 sqm to manufacture both his make-up brushes but also brushes for nails and foot care items. The man starts putting on the market his first make-up cases manufactured in subcontracting. It will only take two more years for the third plant, also of 3,000 sqm and fully specialized in the manufacture of brushes, to see the light in China, this time in Taijan. So much so that in 2000 FSKorea achieves a turnover of USD 12 million and employes 400 people! But there is more to it! In 2005, a fourth factory for brushes emerges also in China, north of Beijing, and then a fifth one in 2007 where, this time, JK Hwang integrates ten injection machines. The year 2009 sees the installation in Seoul's of the Research & Development Centre, and finally, two years later, the CEO of FSKorea decides to buy a metal processing plant that employs more than 150 people. Phew! One would be tempted to say in the face of such a dynamic Industrial development. ""You forgot to mention our factory in Belgium which opened in 2005 and is specialized in the manufacture of automatic eyeliners,"" adds JK Hwang, with a mischievous smile on his face, ""which today produces ten million pieces per year!"" But where will he stop? 100 million brushes a year, USD 35 million in sales a year, 2,000 employees, with, as first overseas market, the U.S. followed by Europe... The plastic injection currently hosts 23 presses and the joint venture, FSKColor, produces 100 million mascaras a year. The R&D Centre, based in Seoul, with its twenty employees creates a new design each month and has just been singled out as the ""best global supplier of brushes"" by Korean authorities. And when, to conclude the conversation, JK Hwang announces the construction of a new plastic injection plant in the coming months..., who can we still be surprised? And by the way, FSKorea will be attending the Make Up in Paris show next June. A word to the wise..."
"PacificGlas, the Korean company invests in a new furnace!","Upon arrival in the courtyard of the factory, the tone is set. Several banners on which is written in large letters the slogan ""2015 Vision"" explain the new objectives of the glassmaker. 450 people, a flexmelter furnace of 50 tons/day built in 2006 and five IS lines capable of producing some 150 million pieces a year, PacificGlas is the glassmaker to be reckoned with in this region of Asia. The plant has all the necessary equipment for decoration including a score of screen-printing machines and new coating lines recently delivered on site. It supplies most of the major perfume and cosmetic brands of the region, exports 30% of its production (mainly in the U.S.A, Europe and Japan) and claims producing one of the most transparent glass (the first grade sand comes from Australia), ""largely on an equal footing with European standards,"" explains Jack An Export Sales Manager. The commissioning of the new furnace of 20 tons/day in June, is of course, mostly designed to cope with particularly strong demand in the domestic and overseas market. ""But not only,"" insists Jack An, ""we have the ambition of serving more customers outside Asia, particularly U.S.A and Europe, by highlighting our assets that are real like the quality of our glass, our flexibility and/or reactivity (no more than four weeks are required between the designing of a bottle and the first pilot sample) and, of course, our costs!"" To note that the plant has two lines for small batches (as of 20,000 pieces). The goals of the ""2015 Vision"" are also very clear... ""To become the No.1 glassmaker in Asia in the perfume and cosmetic sector thanks precisely to the commissioning of this new furnace and of all the peripherals equipments that are going to be installed, especially in terms of decoration but also of mould designing (the company in charge is incorporated). The whole of it punctuated by a significant effort in terms of productivity and new product development."" The glassmaker is of course ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certified. The plant has adopted ERP-SAP since 2005 and has introduce MES (Manufacturing Execution System) since 2010. The capacity of the decoration workshop was increased by nearly 30% last year and in 2010, PacificGlas received the export award from local authorities for breaking the record of $ 10 million invoicing overseas."
"Yonwoo: To be in the ""top 10"" global packaging suppliers by 2015!","In 1983, there is no doubt that when Mr. Joong Hyun Ki created an anodizing plant, he was not yet aware that he had just started what would become, twenty eight years later, the number one producer of airless packagings with a piston. In 1990 he had the idea to engage in the manufacture of pumps. At the time, they were all imported pumps. Soon enough, demand is there and in 1992, the man moves into a new plant fully dedicated to the manufacture of his pumps. In 1995 Yonwoo launches its first airless packaging with a piston. The growth is rapid. In 2008 the company records net sales of more than 72 million USD who will jump to 95 million the following year, to reach 140 million last year. In parallel, the staff rises from 562 people in 2009 to 960 people in 2011. ""Actually, explains Daniel Cha, the export sales manager, we have had to cope with growth rates ranging from between 20% and 32% per year for ten years! It would be impossible for Yonwoo to absorb them if we didn't have a clear vision of the future of the company and one of the reasons we have managed to increase our business successfully and rapidly so far is due to the pre investments undertaken and based on our forecasts for the year ahead. Hence, we add new equipments and also innovative automated processes to our production tool. In doing so we can remain competitive in terms of lead time and also be able to accommodate large amount of new orders from our customers. We believe that the key to our success was so far and still is today based on continued investments in R&D and in the increase of the production capacity."" The factory tour proves it, production runs full speed. Yonwoo weighs 55% of Korea's airless market and believes being one of the 1st players on the global market. Main assets of the Korean company, a maximum integration from the designing of the moulds including injection, the stamping of metal parts, all the finishing techniques (coating, plating, anodizing, hot stamping, screen printing etc.). and, of course, assembly. The population of assembly machines is also impressive with no less than 35 lines (2009 figures) for the pumps and 62 lines (2009 figures) for the pump/body/piston set. Last December, two new buildings have been built to house fully automated production lines with eighteen high speed injection moulding machines. Total amount of the investment, more than eight million USD. ""Purpose of the operation, explains Daniel Cha, to be able to respond competitively to the demand for larger quantities. In fact, we can now offer a wide range of competitive solutions in both the high end and what could be called the class-mass segment."" Here again, only one key word, ""innovation"". No fewer than 90 people work in R&D. ""We put a dozen new products on the market each year,"" emphasises Daniel Cha. Latest developments to date, a series of new dispensers combining the advantages of airless to what is known today as instrumental beauty. ""More clearly, we were told at Yonwoo, this concerns electrical or electronic appliances that provide a real service at the pre-treatment level of the skin and to which we add our expertise in the field of airless."" The airless, of course, but also the tube. Because, since 2007, Yonwoo also manufactures plastic and aluminium/plastic tubes. ""And we will invest again in this area too,"" concluded Daniel Cha."
Airless packaging (Part 2): From innovation to market,"The benefits of airless systems are numerous and it is translated in the strong progress of their sales, +15% a year on average. Mainly characterized by their ability ""to perfectly dispense a liquid, cream, or paste product, avoiding any possible contamination from an external source (direct contact with fingers, air, etc.),"" there are two main airless categories: airless with a piston that represents 95% of volumes and airless with a pouch. A study of patents filed and of the latest innovations shows numerous attempts to adapt the airless system to any kind of packaging (mascara, powder) even if to date bottles, tubes and jars are mostly found on the market. The EU cosmetic regulation, defines packaging and containers mainly in terms of safety vis-à-vis impurities likely to migrate in the product and of microbiological contamination. As stated Laurence Mulon, regulatory consultant ""airless packaging enables quite easily to overcome the regulatory constraints by meeting these requirements."" However, in order to ensure that formulas are really protected, even sterile, filling systems often remain inseparable from the packaging and must provide an atmosphere free of outside contaminants, from the manufacturing of the bulk to the installation of the pump. For their part, environmental concerns, seldom mentioned in the regulation, are supported instead by standards on natural and organic products such as Ecocert, Cosmos, etc. Each organization has its own rules of acceptance even if it appears that the end of life and the recyclability of the packaging are the main criteria. In this highly innovative industry, numerous airless manufacturers try hard to propose the most eco-friendly solutions, through the reduction of the carbon footprint of each reference, the lightening of products, the reduction of the number of components and/or their recyclability, the introduction, of refilling systems, etc. But do all these efforts answer consumer demands? The various participants explained their difficulty to valuate their environmental efforts towards consumers. Consumers that are s attracted by sustainable development, but often make the choice of the cheapest product. Actually, behaviours vary from one market to another, from one product to another. For instance, buyers in emerging markets, or buyers of luxury products appreciate heavy products, considered as products of good quality. Nevertheless, some markets fit especially well with airless packaged products. This is the case with dermocosmetics. However, using an airless packaging still often appear as an answer to a technical need rather than a marking argument. ""It is not the consumer who imposes airless it's the formula,"" said a member in the audience. Some innovation levers remain to make of the airless an additional selling argument. Could we say that the airless still has many assets to reveal?"
Airless packaging (Part 1): High expectations,"In the introduction to the conference-day co-chaired by Étienne Soudant, President of the French Society of Cosmetology, and Daniel Saclier, Packaging Development Director at LVMH Perfumes and Cosmetics, Premium Beauty News proposed to draw the panorama of the use of airless packaging in the cosmetics industry. Airless dispensers were first widely adopted by toothpaste producers in the mid-80s, for both marketing and technical reasons. Then, very quickly, skincare makers got something out of these solutions too. Today, consumers also find them worthwhile, and for many reasons: However, it seems important to begin at the beginning and to define what is an airless dispenser. Several definitions were proposed but manufacturers usually agree to define an airless dispenser as ""a non-pressurized tamper-proof dispensing system, combining a mechanical pump and a container which after being filled and closed in an air-free atmosphere, delivers the product with no air intake."" They also add that the container can be used ""with a piston or a pouch."" With a traditional system, when the product in the bottle is used it is replaced by an equal quantity of outdoor air. While with an airless system, when the pump is operated, the product is delivered but when the pressure on the actuator stops there is no air intake inside the container to replace the used product. In the absence of a trade union gathering statistical data, Premium Beauty News questioned the various players on this market, which was thus estimated at approximately 500 million units per year, with annual growth rates that are simply amazing, ranging from 10% to 15%. Korean producers are estimated to produce between 140 to 150 million units, the western ones 230 million, the Chinese 50 million units and other manufacturers 15 million... However, some participants deemed these figures under evaluated the global market that would weight 650 or 700 million units per year. In terms of consumer countries, Europe appears as the biggest market (between 160 and 170 million units), followed by North America between 150 and 160 million, Asia around 130 million and South America with about 50 million. Cosmetics account for most of the market (95%), then the pharmaceutical market account for 4% and food for 1%. Finally, it is estimated that 83% of the global production is composed of piston systems, while 5%%, with a pouch 10% for tubes and 2% for jars. A success that can be explained by the numerous advantages of airless systems, which are suitable for all sorts of textures (fluid or viscous, for liquids, creams, gels or pastes) and can even deliver two incompatible or complementary products. When it comes to the container aspect, airless can be used with a bottle, a jar, a pen or a syringe. Technically speaking airless systems offer a number of possibilities: round, square or oval shapes with sizes that can range from 15ml to 250ml. Dosages are extremely precise and can range from 0.1 ml to 3 ml. Other advantage, an airless container never needing to be opened during its use, makes it possible, under certain circumstances, to significantly extend the period of use after opening compared to conventional products. Even when using less preservatives. Furthermore, the excellent product restitution rate of airless packaging prevents the consumer from having a feeling of waste when he cannot use the entire product contained in the packaging he purchased. Finally, its convenience of use in all positions, including upside down, and the smooth actuation of the metering pump offer the user a real comfort of use. It's not a surprise therefore that such a dynamic market attracts new comers, most of them attending the conference which also unveiled strong expectations in terms of functionalities and innovations.

Weckerle: Growth on all fronts,"Premium Beauty News - From the outside, it seems like a impetus was given to the company these last three years. It started with the acquisition of Dr. Scheller Cosmetics which enabled you to set foot in the full service activity, and then there was the development of a highly innovative powder pressing machine, and finally your decision to establish a new plant in China and move into a new and bigger factory in the United States! Thomas Weckerle - This cannot be denied... Our group has certainly taken a new dimension since 2009. Certainly a turning point to both, more strongly settle our legitimacy as manufacturer of high performance machines for the production of lipstick and with the development of the multi-layer technologies and our innovation capacity through the development of a series of brand new machines including one for pressed powders. We have achieved our goals on both points, since in both cases, our ""machine"" activity has continued to strengthen and we are already working on other techniques that we had actually also developed two decades ago like the liquid filling of powders. Premium Beauty News - But currently the ""machine"" activity more or less, only accounts for a relatively small share of Weckerle's overall activity. Thomas Weckerle - Yes, but it still is very important! I often say that it represents the ""heart"" of Weckerle and that the other activities represent the other parts of the ""body"" of the company. And you know ... without the ""heart!"" Especially since it is with the know-how acquired in the manufacture of machines that we can claim a real legitimacy in the cosmetic sector in general. One example, the development of multilayer lipsticks which really relaunched this product. Our customers want more performance and speed. One drawback to this ""machine"" activity, is to find technicians and engineers who identify themselves with cosmetic products, which is key to develop cosmetic products. Take the full service activity... The take over of Dr Scheller Cosmetics in 2009 might have appeared as a risky gamble. Three years later, we have integrated the factory with all its ""know how"" in the group. This ""know how"" is now available to all our customers around the world. We are using our proprietary technologies to develop innovative product lines and our customers are very satisfied. And then speaking of full service, you are well placed to know, it is a ""heavy"" trend. Concerning the ""pencil"" activity, it remains extremely strong and we are continuing to invest in this area. Premium Beauty News - The strengthening of your positions abroad has also been a major growth driver! Thomas Weckerle - Undoubtedly yes! Even though sometimes this growth is not quite the one we expected. In China, for example, the market of colour cosmetics is not growing as fast as we would have thought. In South America, on the contrary, growth is strong. As for Russia, our activities are growing much faster than the rest of the group. Premium Beauty News - Innovation remains a key growth driver on the market of colour cosmetics? Thomas Weckerle - Our customers want innovation. Our business is therefore entirely focused on innovation. We are not only concentrating at the finished product, we are also innovating in the process to produce the product. This has been the one driving us since the creation of Weckerle by Peter Weckerle in a small garage of Peissenberg. Now Weckerle has grown into a major corporate force with their own laboratory facilities, in-house plastic moulding, packaging design team, and Global Marketing Bureau, providing the world's leading brands with the entire spectrum of high quality products they can trust for years to come. For the future, Thomas Weckerle proudly continues the legacy his father began over 30 years ago—staying true to the Weckerle motto: innovation never ends."
"Sincoplas, small is beautiful!","January 23, 2012 When Patrick Morel in 2007 took control of the firm, its overall situation was good. ""I must say that the work which had been accomplished over the years by my predecessors, he explains, enabled to lay the foundations for a very healthy business industrially speaking but also and above all, in terms of human beings"". For Patrick Morel, former CEO of Berlitz it is a bit like a baptism of fire! ""It's true, he admits, this business was new to me but I was quickly seduced."" Because the potential was there! Four years later, Sincoplas is more than ever in motion. First project, which is about to be completed, find new markets to make for the reduction of technical parts. To complement its business in the beauty sector, Sincoplas focuses both on the Wine and Spirits industry and on medical packaging. ""You could say that this work is starting to take shape, explains Patrice Lhomme, Commercial Director. Of the eight million euros in turnover that we will achieve this year, it is by far the Make-Up and Perfume sectors that represent the biggest share of our activity (with nearly 80%). But the Medical and Wine and Spirits sectors are also slightly progressing."" Second project, also completed, a good control of production costs. ""This will have taken us some time, emphasises Patrick Morel, but now we have reached a perfect balance."" A key project in the context of a continuous improvement of the company's competitiveness. Finally, the third project, which is to constantly work on improving relationships within the company with, as a main tool, communication: more horizontal communication and exchanges between the staff and services - a greater and shared awareness of a common goal: ensure the sustainability of the company by meeting the needs of customers and through a spirit of innovation. ""This last one, stresses Patrick Morel, is obviously a never ending project, so essential and rewarding. And it's one of the main advantages of relatively small structures like ours."" In parallel with these projects, Sincoplas has carried out its carbon footprint to best measure its impact on the environment and take appropriate action to limit its emissions. 23 injection moulding machines among which 22 of 50 to 800 tons of closing force and four bi-injection, for a hundred employees, Sincoplas converts each year some 320 tons of plastic material. Concerning recent launches to which the French firm took a part, to note the presentation box for the fragrance Alien ""Décor Oriental"" by Thierry Mugler. With its base composed of a transparent ABS made insert to sustain the deformation due to the shape of the bottle and block the bottle appropriately, this box has a lid made of crystal PMMA and is decorated by hot stamping. Among the latest developments: a Surlyn made jar with very thick walls designed for the brand Guinot, finally, a first achievement for the Perrier Jouet brand: a pomponne base over-moulded in a material giving the appearance of soft chalk."
"With Federico Ferrer, the ambitions of Thomas Group in luxury!","Common point between the Spanish Federico Ferrer and the German Thomas Group, metal, of course! But up to this day of October 2011 when the acquisition of the former by the latter became official, the two entities had different industrial and commercial strategies! ""This is precisely where stands today the interest of our merger,"" explains David Gregorio Ballesteros, the new General Director of Federico Ferrer. Because Thomas Group is primarily a big machine to convert metal parts for mass packaging. The Langenselbold plant, the group's headquarters in Germany since its inception in 1963, has an annual production of some 5 billion parts, mostly cups for aerosols with a score of presses. The two U.S. plants with one of them, the Thomas Erie Inc, in Pennsylvania, was founded in 1980 and the other one Solla Eyelet Products Inc. in Connecticut, which was acquired in 2000, can produce about four billion parts (1 inch cups) for the first one with 17 presses and 750 million (ferrules, pump covers, syringe caps, 1 inch threaded cups, actuators) for the other one with 62 presses. The factory in Valencia, established in 1982 also produces ferrules, pump covers and actuators with eight presses. It has a capacity of one billion parts a year while its anodizing line can treat in the same period some 450 million parts. And that's not the end of it... The Chinese factory founded in 1997 by the Group also produces cups and ferrules and can rely on an annual capacity of 600 million parts. Finally, the two Argentine factories have a total capacity of 750 million parts mostly for the manufacture of 1 inch cups, ferrules, pump covers, actuators, caps with more than 25 presses. ""As for Federico Ferrer, you do know its positioning,"" explains David Gregorio Ballesteros. ""Basically to process metal parts for the high-end sectors of perfumery and pharmacy. The whole of it thanks to 13 transfer presses, eight uni-stationary and two automatic anodizing lines."" ""Clearly, we were meant to become partners,"" emphasises Miguel Sanchez Alpiste, the new Sales Director (but former Commercial Director of Federico Ferrer who left to join the Valencia plant of the Thomas Group six years ago. ""Especially since Thomas Group's strategy is clear, he says, to increase its penetration in the luxury and selective market and, of course, especially in perfumes and cosmetics."" And to succeed in this luxury segment the group now owns two production units of importance in Europe with a plant in Valencia and the other, of Federico Ferrer, in Barcelona. ""Not only does the anodizing capacity of both plants (550 million units) represent a real plus on the marketplace, points out Thomas Turiaf, but the lines that run in Barcelona (chemical and electrolytic) are extremely efficient."" When you know that one of the keys to operate in this luxury segment stands in the ability, flexibility and versatility of anodizing lines. ""And in their ability to achieve quickly quality tooling. Which is our case!"" adds David Gregorio Ballesteros. A Barcelona factory, whose managers intend to make the best use in the coming months to better invest in this high-end packaging segment, particularly the one concerning make-up where the company already generates 40% of its turnover with some outstanding references for Helena Rubinstein or Lancaster. ""But we also have some very interesting references in high-end perfumery, insists Miguel Sanchez Alpiste, and skincare with Shiseido, Issey Miyake, Jean Paul Gaultier, La Prairie, Jesus del Pozo among others."" To note the very recent installation of a thirtieth transfer press at the factory."
Brazil: A 25 million euro investment for SGD!,"The French glassmaker has invested 25 million euros in its Brazilian plant in Sao Paulo. Main objective, a mere doubling of the existing capacity, 70% of which is dedicated to the perfume and cosmetic sector (the remaining 30% intended for the pharma sector) with the start of a second furnace that will step up the total capacity of the plant to 140 tonnes/day. In addition to this new furnace and to five additional production lines, the investment also concerned the progressive commissioning of new decoration machines comprising two multi-pass screen and hot-stamp printing automatic machines. An investment that occurs at a time when the local turnover of SGD will reach this year almost EUR 50 million, representing about 15% of the group's overall turnover for the perfume and cosmetic activity./0} Actually, a 15% increase of the turnover on the previous year."
PR Service Graphique meets growth targets,"""The traditional case with its standard box and box insert, it's almost a thing of the past,"" strongly believes Petra Roth, the founder and President of PR Service Graphique. ""Nowadays on an ultra-competitive marketplace, first and foremost customers are looking for ways to differentiate and customize both their products and their packaging. They demand originality and flawless quality."" Founded in 1989, the company was first specialized in the publishing industry. But with its location at the heart of the Cosmetic Valley, high end perfume and cosmetic brands gained an increasing important in the portfolio of the company, accounting today for about 80% of its turnover. ""This growth was achieved by fostering the brands loyalty with quality products and services,"" emphasises Petra Roth. A quality based on the careful selection of the best suppliers. ""The relationship of trust we have built with our partners in China is a source of permanent progress. In most cases, factories are audited by our customers. But if our portfolio of suppliers doesn't change much, this doesn't stop us from continuing our research to maintain the highest level of performance,"" explains Petra Roth. As a consequence, an impressive growth in sales which have almost doubled in three years time and which are expected to reach € 6.5 million in 2011. PR Service Graphique achieves 50% of its turnover with cases, 25% with paper bags and the rest in design and sourcing of accessories and exclusive items (toilet bags, bags, etc,.), and in different service offers, particularly in the field of logistics, with a warehouse of 22,000sqm. Among the company's recent achievements, the Karl Lagerfeld snowball which is part of the line developed by Sephora for Christmas. ""We found a Chinese supplier of snowballs, who worked in close collaboration with our supplier of cases,"" details Petra Roth. A characteristic of the product is that the flakes are made of gold paper and not polystyrene as is usually the case with this type of product. ""This helps obtain a shinier effect with larger flakes too,"" she adds. To highlight the designer's black profile inside the ball, the case was adorned with gold facets. Another novelty this year, the design of paper flowers to decorate the packages and bring added value to the cases."
Metal processing: Bristol Pivaudran the Brazilian model,"With thirty-transfer presses and fourteen anodizing lines, 30% of Bristol Pivaudran's production are intended today for the manufacture of spray pump covers, 50% to that of various closures for the perfume and cosmetic industry and nearly 20% for the manufacture of lipstick tubes. ""Our partnership with Pivaudran, explains Almir Barberini, dates back to 2002 and it was a real turning point in the development of our company thanks to the experience and technological contribution provided by our French partner."" Not surprisingly, Bristol Pivaudran's biggest customers are called Aptar, MWV, Rexam for pump covers, O'Boticario, Natura, Avon, Coty for all the other products... ""To continue and develop ourselves and to cope, especially since these last three years, with Asian competitors, there was only one solution, namely to automate and increase our anodizing capacity,"" explains Lauro B. M. Silva. A solution, however not that simple to implement for the Brazilian firm for financial reasons but also in terms of availability of industrial areas. Obviously, there was a lack of space at the factory and headquarters of Cumbica-Guarulhos and the new building recently acquired on the other side of the street came at the right time. And then there's also the social side! ""Social responsibility"" is also one of the home-made characteristics established and maintained by the two Directors, Almir Barberini and Lauro B. M. Silva. And it is given the place of honour in the brochure and the film introducing the company. Probably a great deal more than in a number of European companies. ""Does that surprise you?"" enquires Lauro B. M. Silva. When it comes to actions, a daily session of collective gymnastics to keep the body and brain fit. And that's not all! Training, food, harmonious organization of work stations ... Everything has been carefully scrutinized. ""Undoubtedly, our main economic asset, is decision-making and the flexibility of our production tool for large orders as much as for smaller batches"" emphasises Almir Barberini. ""Not to mention our ability to offer a wide variety of different colours for our anodized parts."" In any case, spirits are high at the Cumbica-Guarulhos plant. If only because of the annual growth rate of the Brazilian perfume and cosmetic market. ""For example the two largest Brazilian brands in the sector, alone, have forecast growth rates of 15% to 22% per year, over the next five years,"" revealed Almir Barberini."
"La Factory or the winning strategy of ""custom-made""","This team from La Factory is discrete indeed! ""It's true, admits Isabelle de Maistre, Executive Vice President, we didn't communicate too much during these early years. And this is normal! We had to work and above all prove ourselves."" Work and prove oneself... a daily task that started one day in June 2007 for Jean-Michel Pontier, CEO, Jerome Bouvet and Isabelle de Maistre, both of them Executive Vice Presidents. Jean Michel and Isabelle took office in Boulogne-Billancourt, in the suburbs of Paris, while Jerome settled in Oyonnax, near Lyon. ""And for good reason, explains Jean Michel Pontier, we have a factory of plastic injection and moulds and a local partner, Sylmaplast and PMP, of which Jean Michel is a shareholder."" All three of them have the culture of perfume, this French Touch so dear to many foreign customers. And those foreign customers, they actually also know them quite well. Especially those located in the Gulf region. It is true that the young firm has quickly earned a solid reputation for itself in the manufacture of high technology components by hiring not only renowned designers but also by selecting materials and manufacturing processes that would give a finish comparable to that of prestige bottles. ""Actually, explains Rémi de Précourt, Sales Manager, we take part in all stages of the design of bottle components. From 3D design/development and modelling including the study, the design and creation of prototype moulds (small and large series), plus the injection of all types of plastic materials, treatments (electroplating, plating, lacquering, etc.), decoration, assembly, metal and wood parts, glass to the final stage packaging, with one factory Condiluxe of which Jean Michel Pontier is also a shareholder."" 2009 was a new milestone for the company when managers decided to build their own injection plant in Romania. ""This was a logical decision, emphasises Pontier, we had to insure our development and at the same time, guaranty our industrial independence under competitive economic conditions vis-à-vis market demand."" With 40 people, with a location in a region strongly ""plastic industry""-minded due to the presence of the European automotive industry, this plant in Romania, La Factory G&J, came at the right time for the management at La Factory. ""The plant in Oyonnax, details Pontier, is recognized for the quality design of many projects in Surlyn, PCTA, PA, PP, ABS, SAN... The G&J factory in Romania, whose main objective is to find an alternative to French production costs facing Asian competition, helps us strengthen our offer in the injection and transformation of all plastic parts with a strong specialisation in Surlyn. The local team not only monitors the production projects in injection, but also provides a logistical support for additional assembly operations (gluing of rhinestones on plastic or glass packagings) finishing or surface treatments. It is also in charge of sourcing for some industrial partners in other fields of activities."" And glass in all this since it remains undoubtedly the customers featured material to contain their fragrances? ""In fact, explains Isabelle de Maistre, our role is to introduce, of course, customers to the best glass-making partners. We have fifteen years of experience in this field. To note that our internal structure is in a position to offer graphic solutions in terms of decoration and to ensure its industrial production. In parallel, we also create series of stock containers, 'ready for decoration,' to optimize development time and budget."" Since 2010 the firm has strengthened its business in Asia. ""Secured partnerships were established, we were told by officials at the Boulogne-Billancourt headquarters, on the basis of cross commitments to insure the processing of a wide variety of materials (aluminium, zamac, plastic injection, moulds). This strategy mainly focusing on 'technical' metal parts has been awarded this year the prize 'Forme de Luxe' for the design of a 'metal' range on Swarovski's Eau de Toilette and skincare range. Furthermore, to support this activity a technical and quality representative office was opened in the South of China to relay the production operations comprising sourcing, development, production, and quality control."""
Rexam do Brasil in working order!,"Operational since 1999 and located in the city of Jundiaí more than an hour's drive from central Sao Paulo, in the Campinas Region of the São Paulo state, Rexam's Brazilian factory mainly specialized in plastic injected parts for the manufacture of closures and packaging but also of lipstick tubes and make-up cases, probably has one of the most impressive and most consistent investment program of the Group the world over. ""And for a very good reason..., explain officials locally, we have to follow the double-digit annual growth of the local Beauty sector!"" Let's understand ""local"" in the broad sense since some neighbouring countries like Colombia are getting stronger and stronger. Delighted?... Thomé Brito, the current CEO of Rexam do Brasil has every reason to be! With an increase in demand easily progressing at a rate of 10% a year, concerns are of a quite different kind. And the industrial investment momentum imposed in the last two years is a proof of this. For the year 2009 only, at the height of the financial crisis, the Jundiai plant acquired its third lacquering line and a new vacuum metallization chamber. The following year, the plant invested in both a laser engraving and decorating equipment and in its first fully automated assembly line. The same year, to supply the South American market, it equipped itself with the second generation mechanism for lipstick tubes which was developed by the group. In addition, the plant has also installed the necessary equipment to provide a full range of airless tubes. ""You know that we also assemble the pumps on site since 2004,"" emphasised Thomé Brito. Finally, the same year, a whole area of the plant was retrofitted in order to receive three brand new injection blow moulding machines to produce lip gloss bottles. With 540 people and 13,000 sqm of industrial surface the Jundiai plant is probably one of the largest packaging manufacturing centres intended for the cosmetic sector on the Brazilian territory. ""But obviously there is more to it"", says Paula Santiago Froes, Sales and Marketing Director, ""as demand continues to grow and as visitors can see, we are constantly redeveloping the production cells to fully optimize our production area."" Especially since projects from some large customers are very important and concern all areas of the beauty industry, especially make-up. ""In fact, this plant was built in 1999 to actually serve this specific segment"", says Thomé Brito. The following years were punctuated by the arrival of new key customers like Natura in 1999, Avon in 2000 and O'Boticario in 2001. The year 2002 marks the start of the production of Surlyn and PCTA based closures. Then in 2004, the factory equips itself to be able to produce pumps and so on. At present, the site in Jundiai houses no less than 47 injection machines, 3 blow moulding machines, 26 assembly lines, 13 lines for decoration and several lacquering and metallization lines. ""And yet we continue investing to keep up with the growing demand,"" admits Paula Santiago Froes. ""Our nonetheless consistent development team, has loads of projects underway."""
Anomatic invests in two new anodizing lines,"Premium Beauty News - You are an important player at a global level for the transformation of aluminium parts intended for the beauty sector, but you are still little known in Europe. Steven Rusch - Yes, we haven't positioned ourselves in the market as being directly on the forefront of the stage for the processing of aluminium parts for the perfumery and cosmetic industry. Many of our customers, for example can be found among manufacturers of pumps, of lipstick tubes or of mascara. But that does not mean, of course, that we are not also producing directly for major brands. It is indeed in our strategy to be a privileged and global partner for the supply of anodized parts for the packaging of companies operating in the health and beauty sector. Premium Beauty News - Because in terms of production capacity, you look more like a heavy weight competitor with your four plants around the world including three in the U.S. and one in China that dates back to three years! Steven Rusch - Currently, our global anodizing capacity is 1.5 billion components annually; however, in March of this year, our leadership decided that in order to better support our global customers with reduced lead times coupled with increasing demand, we had to expand our anodizing capacity with a new Greenfield project, which will house two brand new anodizing lines and create an additional 250 million units of capacity. In addition to the anodizing capacity expansion, Anomatic has invested in transfer presses, a tooling and die shop as well as assembly equipment. Our global operations now feature more than 60 high speed presses and 23 semi and fully automated assembly machines. The latest Greenfield project will also house our Innovations Center, designed to showcase more than 45 years of anodized components and bring to our customers new technologies such as rapid metal prototyping and laser engraving. Premium Beauty News - You never fail to highlight what you call the ""Anomatic System"" which is related to the anodizing process. What do you mean by that? Steven Rusch - That's right, our anodizing system or the ""Anomatic System"" was originally patented in 1967 and is still unique throughout the world to this day. Our concept of a continuous conveyor belt system was designed to constantly move parts throughout solution in order to achieve consistent uniformity in color and finish. Benefits include: Uniform coverage (inside and outside the component), color consistency (lot to lot), repeatability and high speed automation (each machine produces 500,000 pieces/day). Premium Beauty News - You have also heavily invested in environmental protection. Steven Rusch - Absolutely! We completed a few months ago a global sustainability plan which had been implemented in 2008 to reduce our energy consumption, while significantly increasing our ability to recycle and reuse all of the materials in our processes. The plant and the equipments were transformed: up to 40% of the water used is recycled and reused, a new closed circuit solvent cleaning technology, implemented in September 2009, demands 92% less carbon based energy as compared to the previous technology to clean the raw aluminium parts before anodization and also enables more than 90% of the oil used in the forming process to be recovered through advanced filtration for direct reuse. Premium Beauty News - Some ambitions in Europe of course? Steven Rusch - Yes, of course! We have already set foot there with an office in Paris. This continent is one of the cradles of perfumery and cosmetics in the world and Anomatic has all it takes to meet European needs for metal parts, closures, decoration and finishing."
Toly: Five years that have changed everything!,"Premium Beauty News - If this goes on, you will be one of the few European companies with a global vocation, specialized in plastic injection for the beauty sector, to be able to claim the status of family owned company! Obviously, this autonomy is one of the keys to your reactivity and flexibility, and this is not incompatible with the necessary financial resources needed to develop one's business. Andy Gatesy - That's true! You are right to say it's one of the keys. It is not the only one, but the 868 people that make up the Toly Group today are to me the expression of a real family. It is very important! This is also included in the first paragraph of what we call ""Toly's Core Values"". We are a people company and Toly is a way of life. We have a strong corporate spirit and teamwork is an integral part of our everydays activities. We believe that people will make the difference and create a unique experience for our customers, the « Toly experience ». Whilst we are a small company by international standards, we are dynamic and are not frightened of going out to the four corners of the world to seek opportunities and develop a global business. We encourage people to take initiative and we are prepared to take the necessary risks for the company's development. Premium Beauty News - And you have made a demonstration of this almost constant risk-taking strategy over the last five years. Andy Gatesy - Risk-taking is primarily the desire to take full advantage of opportunities. In a word, to not watch the train go by! This was the case with my father, Dr. Zoli Gatesy in 1956 when he left Hungary for England with a refugee status to create ten years later his first company for the manufacturing of moulds and plastic injected parts for the toy industry. It's with this in mind that he decided to outsource the manufacturing to Malta in 1971 and in 1975 to specialize in the manufacture of make-up cases, blushers and eyeshadows. There has been a lot of risk-taking decisions in Toly's story. It has almost become a second nature. When I joined the company in 1986, my vision was clearly to develop its activities abroad. The following year, I decided to set foot in the United States. Two years later, we created Toly France. At the time the Toly Group already had a staff of 400 including 300 for Malta alone. In 1990 we commissioned our first lacquering line and we started our diversification in closures and packaging for the perfume industry. Then years succeed to one another at an impressive rate with as key points, the commercial partnership with Geka in 1996 and the first incursions in Asia as of 2000 with a equity participation taken in Metapack, not to mention the partnership in 2001 with the Japanese firm Sinwa for the opening, on a joint venture basis, in 2005 of a production plant in Shenzhen, China, immediately followed by the opening of offices in Hong Kong (Toly Asia), Seoul (Toly Korea) and New Delhi (Toly India). Premium Beauty News - The year 2005 is definitely a pivotal year for Toly as regards its desire to produce overseas. Andy Gatesy - It is indeed! It was obviously a requirement for us to be industrially present in countries like China and India. This doesn't mean however we neglected the site of Malta, where human and industrial investments have always been constant. In 2002 we installed a second lacquering line and in 2007 all of Toly's ""development"" activities were concentrated over there. The plant in Malta now also hosts some 46 injection presses ranging from 25 tons to 400 tons of thrust. It is becoming increasingly automated and has all the equipments one can dream of in terms of decoration processes (hot foil stamping, transfer printing, tampo printing, silk screen printing, laser engraving, mirror cutting, U.V. lacquering & painting). Today, Malta is truly the Group's nerve centre be it in terms of marketing, logistics, operational and finance activities, quality, design and development. But to go back to your question, it's true that 2005 really represents Toly's industrial leap in other parts of the globe with the launch of our first joint venture factory in China. Today this plant has 19 injection machines ranging from 55 tons to 300 tons and also ensures all the decorative phases of tampo printing and hot stamping type. Then comes the year 2008 with another big leap when, in quick succession, we opened a new factory in India at Dehradun (160 persons, 15 injection machines, an air-conditioned assembly workshop with a cleanroom section), and then in South Korea with the creation of a joint venture, Toly Airless Packaging in Bucheon City. Premium Beauty News - A global industrial strategy, which actually reflects your determination to diversify! Andy Gatesy - Absolutely! Our portfolio at the time, that is to say in 2005, needed to be broadened. The perfume and cosmetic market is a fast moving market with demands for always more innovation. Not only must we follow this movement, but we must precede it. This is the whole challenge! At the same time our partners are changing and it is only natural. We must therefore diversify and reinforce ourselves in all segments related to beauty packaging, whatever the technique or material it takes. So much so that we now offer lipstick tubes (manufactured in India), cardboard-based cases and a range of aluminium or zarmac-based accessories. Our vision is clear: we want to be the world leader in luxury packaging for the cosmetics, fragrance and skin care industries. Premium Beauty News - And your entry in the very closed circle of producers of airless systems has been an important component of this strategy! Andy Gatesy - An entry that we wanted at the top level. And with no compromises! That is why we chose to join forces in 2008, with probably, one of the best Korean engineers operating in this field. This choice proved to be the right one. At a 40% growth rate each year, the airless concept is growing strongly. To such a point that we have built a brand new factory on the outskirts of Seoul in 2010 and that we will again double in size next year with in addition, the installation of two lacquering/metallization lines and several new injection machines. Toly Airless Packaging this year will exceed 12 million euros in turnover and growth prospects are huge. Premium Beauty News - You are mentioning innovation and creativity! They have both become the core of your strategy! Andy Gatesy - Well, it's always been in our genes! And it is also part of our charter. We recognise that we need to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and also move away from being positioned as a commodity supplier. We are constantly designing and developing new products and we try to develop unique processes and differentiate our approach to manufacturing. We also strive to be technically excellent in producing the highest quality in luxury packaging. And we are quite proud to be able to present each year some 100 new packagings to our customers! Yes, it seems incredible, but you did hear 100! And this in all areas, whether in terms of make-up cases, closure systems, applicators of all types of airless bottle and jar of course, tubes of lipstick etc. And, year after year, we keep on the same pace. Given the conditions, it is not surprising then that the meetings we organize during trade shows, or during private gatherings are always full! Our customers always demand more and more innovations. And we believe it is our duty to satisfy them. Premium Beauty News - A diversification and a progression expressed in figures! Andy Gatesy - And believe me, they are good! They even exceed our expectations and show that we have adopted the right strategy. We posted a little over 34 million euros in turnover in 2005. We will achieve this year 55 million euros, 20 million thanks to the diversifying our product portfolio! Another important figure... Just for the factory in Malta, we invested in five years nearly 11 million euros! And the investment cost for the two Korean factories one of which is already operational and with the construction of the other one being completed next year will amount to a total of nearly 9 million. You must know how to invest appropriately! And this is one of the other keys."
"Luxe Pack Monaco 2011: ""An excellent year""","No space was left vacant by the 340 exhibitors. As usual they represented a wide range of products, materials and know-how in the luxury goods packaging sector. Thus among the 340 exhibitors, there were both manufacturers of boxes made of any kind of materials (34%), of closures and/or frets in all materials (15%), raw materials (cardboard, paper, plastic), 13%, bottles and vials made from any kind of materials (11%), labels, including 3D labels, 6%, as well as pouch bags, samples, tape trimmings, pumps, valves, and POP displays, decorative finishes, plastic tubes ... It is the Natura Chronos jar presented by Eastman that won the 2011 Luxe Pack In Green Award. The Natura Chronos jar is made with a grade of Eastman's Glass Polymer containing 45% of renewable organic material. It dries 25% faster than traditional co-polyesters and processes at 20% lower temperatures, resulting in less energy usage and faster production times. Brazilian brand Natura offers its Chronos line in refill packs thus reducing the amount of resin used and the packaging material required, while also reducing environmental impact of the manufacturing process. TheLuxe Pack In Green jury has also awarded a special mention to the Lumson TAG System (Techno Airless Glass System), an airless cosmetic packaging with a system facilitating its recyclability: thanks to the ""Eco-Lock system"" patented multi-functional component, the final consumer, after usage, simply has to unscrew the pump to easily separate all plastic components. Bormioli Luigi showcased new developments of its bottles with an over-moulded Surlyn shell, thanks to a co-operation with Dupont and the Italian Group Pibiplast, specializing in injection processes. The manufacture of this type of bottle is a two-stage operation. First, the design of the glass bottle itself in blow-and-blow, press-and-blow or press processes. Then, the over-moulding stage where it all happens. At Luxe Pack 2011, Swedish cardboard maker Korsnäs introduced Artisan, a new grade with a silky smooth surface and excellent printing capabilities. ""The new board has a very interesting soft touch allowing for new unique packaging experiences. The product is a high-white, multi-layered board made of 100 % virgin fibre. The long, tough and resilient fibres make for an extremely strong and formable material and the single-coated, silky smooth surface offers excellent printing properties. The combination of outstanding shape-ability and printability makes Korsnäs Artisan an ideal packaging material for luxury products such as cosmetics, perfume and exclusive confectionery,"" said the company. Korsnäs Artisan is available in grammages from 270 to 390 gsm. The material is recyclable and made of compostable ingredients. As its part, Stora Enso continues to develop its products and services for the needs of the luxury packaging segment. The company's flagship product Ensocoat was relaunched in two versions (one- or two-side coating) in 2010, and it has attracted many among the major luxury brand manufacturers. The Finnish pulp and paper manufacturer is completing its range of packaging board grade suited for cosmetics and beauty care packaging uses, with the launch of an enhanced Performa White. Worth to be noted too, Cosfibel's new Fan Tray solution, a wedge that is no longer tucked away and no longer has a purely functional role but is both innovative and beautiful. The Fan Tray is composed of two panels that open like a book. Simple on the outside, it reveals its charms upon opening. Indeed, the wedge, designed following the idea of a fan, opens up around the product to release its contents. Through this novel design, the wedge becomes an integral part of the coffret's animation, while also doubling as a vector for communication. Available in cardboard, PET, PVC or foam and adaptable to all shapes, the Fan Tray can hold up to two products and can be decorated and have custom folding options. Among the other novelties showcased at Luxe Pack: Rexam's Panache pump, the Magic Inside beauty solution by Aptar + home, the new glass and plastic metallization processes of Solev, and the interesting lipstick case developed by INCA."
MWV doubles its Melodie pump production capacity!,"Year after year, month after month... the MWV group is slowly gaining some market shares in this highly competitive sector of spray and distribution systems for fragrances and cosmetics. ""A long-time recognized global leader for the production of trigger sprayers by the Home & Garden division and in the production of pumps for the pharmaceutical sector,"" explains Laurent Bourgoin, Sales & Marketing Director Europe, ""we still had to earn our stripes in other market niches."" A long-winded process undertaken since several years, which is now bearing fruit. ""We are clearly now on an equal footing for selective perfumery with the global market leader and we are one of the top three global producers of lotion pumps."" For perfumery, the doubling of the production of the Melodie pump is a proof of this. ""Its main assets"", stresses Laurent Bourgoin, ""are, its reduced size, one of the smallest on the market, its NoC patented invisible dip tube, its excellent pre-compression rate and a particularly effective spray angle. Clik IP, its injected plastic model offers in addition decoration possibilities like sublimation, among many others course, and last but not least a worldwide production, allowing us to support the growth of our key customers in emerging markets."" A pump model complementing a range including such models as, Orchestra made in Italy, Maestro, which fits perfectly in the trend of spray-caps, and Sinfonia an extremely versatile, and now solvent resistant pump. Second important news for MWV at the termination of this year, the marketing of its new Adagio All Plastic model. ""A real revolution"", emphasises Bourgoin, ""since this model manufactured in our Milan factory, no longer has, as its name suggests, any metal components thanks to the addition of a valve. Not only does it make recycling easier, but in addition, it is now available in three different outputs of up to 300 microliters. A pump manufactured using the airless membrane technology, built around the so-called 'Rolling Bellow' system combining several functions with just one component thanks to its unique design. This 'Pure Path' concept placing the metal spring outside of the fluid path helps avoid compatibility issues experienced with some creams and serums."" Airless, a market, where the group is continuing to play its cards right with the originality of this system. ""The investment pace in this domain in terms of production capacity remains just as strong for us,"" points out Bourgoin, ""which has been the case in our Barcelona factory. But this is not so much to produce even more airless containers than to offer the market new design possibilities for actuators (i.e. the Pearl and Pearl Mini line) and decoration options with the clearly stated objective to position ourselves also on the selective market""."
Spain: metal processing makes the headlines,"The Spanish converter of metal parts intended for the perfume and cosmetic industry, Metalerias Finas Federico Ferrer SA, based in Barcelona has just integrated the German group Thomas GmbH, headquartered in Langenselbold, also specialized in the processing of metal parts. The German firm already owns production facilities in Germany but also two in the United States, two in Argentina, two in Spain and one in China. As for the Spanish firm Federico Ferrer, it has a factory in Barcelona (2 anodizing lines, 8 automatic presses, 11 transfer presses) and employs 62 people. Based in Barcelona, the company Covit is specialized in the processing of metal parts for the conditioning of perfumery and cosmetic products is back on tracks after the dramatic fire that destroyed much of its production tool in 2010. As planned, and to the day, the new anodizing line installed in a new building was commissioned on June 6th. In addition to this new building, it is the whole industrial site which had to be refurbished, especially the offices and the roofs of the other workshops which had suffered significantly from the fire. This new anodizing line has a capacity of over 300 million pieces/year and the location for a second line is already planned. The forty-press transfers which had not suffered from the fire are currently running at full speed. A industrial recovery, the cost of which will have exceeded five million euros in total. It may be recalled that Covit, owned since July 2010 by the PHI Industrial Acquisitions group had achieved a turnover in 2008 of 19 million euros and that this restart should allow Covit to post this year more than 13.5 million in turnover."
Laser cutting of folding boxes: CLP Packaging and Point to Paper offer cutting edge quality!,"A full service specialist, the French company CLP Packaging, a subsidiary of the Verpack Group, offers a comprehensive and integrated solution for all types of packaging components: folding cardboard cases, set up boxes (semi/automatic and hand made), cardboard and plastic tubes (thermoformed blister holders, folding cases, sleeves, boxes, lids, tubes), conditioning. Concerning the Dutch firm, Point to Paper it is certainly one of the major European manufacturers specialized in laser cutting. As part of the next Luxe Pack trade show, CLP Packaging and Point to Paper presented the results of their research in the form of various laser cut packagings: cases, boxes, holder concealers, sample cards... ""By combining our expertise, explains Julie Foucart, Sales and Marketing Development Manager at CLP Packaging, Point to Paper and ourselves have managed to offer an extremely fine cutting for the enhancement of cardboard and plastic packagings. It was also necessary, given the extremely fine cuttings performed, to have a perfect mastery of the work carried out downstream on the folding and gluing of boxes."""
Cosmetic packaging: Natural plastic resins are emerging,"The main innovation is a thermoplastic resin, so called Gaïalène, made from non-food resources grown in France. This new generation of plastic [1] - obtained from starch and biosourced at a minimum rate of 50% - has characteristics similar to polyolefins. Its main interests are numerous : local farming, no GMO, recyclability, much better carbon footprint. The more oil prices increase, the more the over charge is reducing. The Gaïalène resin can be used for extrusion blow moulded bottles and injected parts. It also allows manufacturing 40 micron thin shrink films for multi packing solutions [2]. The French chemicals industry, as in other major farming countries, is well advanced in terms of non-food vegetal technical valuation. France has one of the most advanced food-industry, in link with world class specialised industrial clusters [3] and research institutes [4]. The synergy between the food, the plastics industries [5] and the packaging sector, provides France with numerous assets and should help the country to play a leading role in this sector. In the family of polyolefins, thermoplastic PE Green resins have been introduced into the cosmetic market in 2011, resins made from 100% cane sugar ethanol [6], which have identical mechanical and aesthetic properties than crude oil derived high density polyethylene. Other thermoplastic resins, the so-called bio-PET, should be used soon in cosmetic packaging. Blended up to 20% or 30% with traditional plastics, these resins are already on the shelves for liquids such as water and soda bottles. Being only available from a restricted number of suppliers worldwide these materials address the marketing needs of brands willing to highlight their sustainable practices. There are other advantages for packaging manufacturers: these new vegetal plastic materials do not change production rates, and tooling can be used in similar conditions. Bio-sourced plastics have sometimes been controversial upon their ecological impact versus plastics derived from crude oil. At the moment when the test phase of environmental labelling is beginning in France, life cycle analysis (LCA) of bio-sourced materials should demonstrate their positive impact on the climate and the air, and on water and biodiversity. During the 1st half of 2011,vegetal plastics have gathered much attention from packaging professionals during exhibitions such as PCD in Paris, SINAL in Châlons, INTERPACK in Düsseldorf and FIP in Lyon. The Union of Chemical Industries' objective for 2017 indicates that for France renewable resources should represent up to 15% of chemical specialties. An incentive for the cosmetics industry [7] to demonstrate their pioneering ability to make sustainability come true. Resins derived from renewable botanical resources are likely to grow as a new category of green materials, thus opening large perspectives for the plastic packaging industry. In the meantime, these new vegetal plastics should improve the image of cosmetics and beauty products in the mind of environmentally concerned consumers."
Yonwoo: A turnover multiplied by 30 in 13 years!,"Quite a saga indeed, the story of this Korean company founded in 1983 by its current owner and Director James Ki. In the beginning a ""mere"" distributor of packaging accessories and dispensers also offering an anodising activity, the firm then decides in the mid-90s to start producing airless systems. In 1998 Yonwoo ""only"" achieved a turnover of $ 4.2 million in (compared to 125 million (!) forcasted in 2011, just thirteen years later!). The turn of the century will be beneficial to the company: A large American group operating in the beauty industry is in an urgent need of an airless container that one of his suppliers is unable to deliver in good conditions. The Korean company will be there at the right time to provides the much needed solution. ""From there on, explains Daniel Cha, Export Sales Manager, our progression will never stop!"" During the same period, it is the encounter with the first partners of what will become in 2003 the Quadpack Group. There too, the ties of both business partners will lead them far beyond their expectations on their conquest of the European market of beauty packaging. ""Ties so strong, says Gérard Perrin, that Yonwoo now accounts for a significant share of Quadpack's turnover and that, conversely, the commercial dynamics of Quadpack offers Yonwoo with a constant development."" A word sums up pretty well the collaboration between the two companies, ""trust"". And it is precisely in this spirit and to respond to the will of many of their global customers, to only rely on one industrial partner in the world, that both partners mutually agreed to set up a new division, Quadpack-Yonwoo which will be in charge of global key account customers under the responsibility of Gérard Perrin. ""It has really become our second nature"", insists Daniel Cha. ""Innovation is an integral part of Yonwoo's industrial culture. A field in which we are quite complementary with our friends from Quadpack."" So it's no accident if the Korean company is now one of the top suppliers of several major global groups in the cosmetic world. Among Yonwoo's flagship products, of course, we find the airless systems developed in recent years and for which the Korean company has wished to position itself voluntarily among the high end suppliers! ""Anyway the Korean market is always pushing upwards"", emphasised Daniel Cha. Local groups like Amore Pacific and LG, which are large customers of Yonwoo, of course, contribute every day to this. Under such conditions, it is not surprising if, the growth of the firm, about 30% to 40% each year, has forced the company to move from one industrial building in 1998 to six today with a strike force of more than 230 injection machines. Out of the approximately 900 employees who work there, forty of them are only involved in R&D and nine designers also work full time. ""But we are also thinking of a way of accompanying our customers industrially in some parts of the world,"" confided Daniel Cha. To be continued..."
The new dimension of the Pochet Group,"The redeployment of Pochet beyond glassmaking, its original business, was undertaken at very high speed. Following the acquisition of the entire Qualipac entity in 2004, the Group created from scratch in 2008, a metal processing plant in China, Qualimetal, then took over the Brazilian plastic converter Ipel, in February 2009. Then followed the acquisition of Lisi Cosmetics in April 2011 also a plastic and metal converter. Finally, the group acquired in May last, the French company Solev, a recognized specialist the world over in such finishing techniques as vacuum coating, varnishing, inner lacquering and laser decoration of high end packaging items made from glass, plastic and metal. A development that required reinforcing the Group's organization, including the creation of several corporate functions around a new Management Board. ""This new board, explains Irène Gosset, President of the Pochet Group, is really the expression of the 'new Pochet' we wanted to develop. It is organized around a Glassmaking Pole, headed by Charles de Forges, President of Pochet du Courval, and a Plastic/Metal Pole, directed by Pierre Marand, President of Qualipac. Hubert Varlet is General Manager Business Strategy and Marketing for the Group and Alain Mauriès, is the Director of Human Resources for the Group"". Jean-François Bouygues as of September first will complement the team as Chief Financial Officer for the Group. The first goal is of course to achieve and consolidate the Group's development in glass and plastics. But for Irène Gosset, it is equally important to ""strengthen and perpetuate a genuine culture which is group-specific, around our values, which I recall, are among others, customer satisfaction, duty of excellence, family culture and, let's admit it, the pride of working for Pochet!"" An outstanding performance to say the least, for this French group, who is indeed still family owned, and who has managed, in recent years, to deal with the incredible industrial transformation of a sector which has become highly competitive and increasingly demanding. ""It's true, notes Hubert Varlet, the Group managed to modernize its glassmaking approach, by continuing to focus on innovation and by investing heavily in finishing techniques, while redeploying at the same time its industrial strategy, via Qualipac, to develop itself in France and abroad. As 2011 draws to a close, figures seem to speak for themselves. The Glassmaking Pole, known by the name of Pochet du Courval, is the world leader in its field and the Plastic/Metal Pole also called Qualipac, represents a unique and complementary industrial asset perfectly in line with market demand."" Because it is indeed the market that is causing the Group to constantly adjust industrially. With the acceleration in the number of luxury perfume launches and especially with the ever-increasing sophistication of products, Pochet has understood the importance of acquiring complementary skills and of moving towards a comprehensive strategy in product offering, including bottles but also decoration and accessories. A strategy whose relevance was confirmed in 2008 with two flagship projects, initiated by two international groups. ""It is clear, explains Hubert Varlet, that the L'Oréal group with Diesel and the launch of Only the Brave, and Procter & Gamble with Hugo Element, were among our first customers to express the emerging market trend consisting in only dealing with a single partner. I would even be tempted to say, a single development team, a single order, a single invoice for the development of a complete product, from bottle to cork, including decoration, accessories and assembling. Then it was all a question of providing the appropriate industrial response!"" After parting from the Stock Exchange market in 2006 and getting rid of its participation in the crystal segment in February 2008 with the sale of its shares in Lalique, the Pochet group was able to focus completely on its ""core business"" namely Beauty packaging. ""Concerning glass, explains Charles de Forges, we never stopped investing in our industrial tool. Our effort is constant with, as key axes, innovation, automation, finishing in all its forms and, of course, improving the supply chain. In this regard, this year we will be completing the implementation of our ERP system launched in 2008 and which will coordinate all our activities, from procurement to production, including sales."" Investments that also have to do with environment, a concern involving two full-time engineers at Pochet. ""Efforts who resulted, among other things, in the awarding of '3 peonies' (out of four possible) which were granted by the Cosmetic Valley for our site in Guimerville. The main selection criteria were the reduction in the environmental impact of products and processes, an offer taking into account environmentally friendly and eco-responsible values, a continuous improvement approach and, finally, a social approach of eco-responsibility,"" emphasised the President of the Glassmaking Pole. Beyond technical and industrial investments, the Pochet Group has also striven to rely on human skills. By maintaining and enhancing the ones acquired internally, while also seeking to acquire new ones at company levels. Hence the importance of creating a Human Resources Department at the Group level. ""The purpose is also to create a common culture, where initially co-existed two yet very independent Poles, while continuing to develop talents within the Group, through recruitment, training and mobility,"" adds Alain Mauriès, who is in charge of this mission. With currently fifteen manufacturing sites on four continents, 500 million euros in sales expected this year, the glassmaker originating from the Bresle Valley, will have managed in fifteen years to meet its major global customers' marketing and sales ever changing requirements. ""There were some strong growth opportunities in plastic, metal and decoration. The Group not only succeeded in seizing these opportunities, but also managed to transform them into value creation for its customers,"" explained Pierre Marand, President of Qualipac. The results of the Plastic/Metal Pole which speak for themselves, confirm the relevance of these choices. ""Concerning glassmaking, explains Hubert Varlet, I really believe that we were quite pragmatic about concentrating our industrial efforts on our three French sites while nonetheless being present on the U.S territory for decoration. Overall, the Group's strategy has enabled us to withstand the crisis of 2009 and to get going again in 2010 and 2011. Our customers do not necessarily expect volume. They want service, flexibility and, of course, quality. In our business where sophistication and constant creation come fully into play, the Group is currently equipped to continue its development and to always better serve its customers."""
The Heinz-Glas & Plastics group acquires its colleague Böhm,"According to managers at Heinz-Glas & Plastics, the range of products manufactured by the Böhm company has the advantage of being perfectly complementary to those manufactured by the Heinz group. An acquisition raising the Heinz group's number of employees to nearly 3500 and making it one of the county's largest employers in his region in Germany. And as a result, the total revenue of all Heinz companies will exceed this year and for the first time in its history 300 million euros! Let us look back in time. As a professional glassmaker, the history of the Heinz group dates back to over 350 years. The group currently has five factories in Germany and several others in China, North and South America, Poland, Switzerland and the Czech Republic. It employs 3000 people (including 1700 in Germany). The plastic division, which was founded in 1955, can currently rely on about 100 processing machines to which must be added the ones belonging to the Böhm group. With its three factories located in Germany, the Böhm group offers, in addition to custom-made solutions, a selection of individual standard components (caps and bottles), as well as standard, coordinated complete packaging products. To note also that its three factories also manufacture and distribute complex technical injection moulds used by the medical sector."
"""To create for a brand requires to master its codes first"", Fabrice Legros, Studio Pi Design","Premium Beauty News - You are celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of the design agency you founded. What were the key moments of this story? Fabrice Legros - In fifteen years, we had the opportunity to work for many prestigious brands and on a variety of projects. Our clients include Guerlain, YSL, Dior, Jean Paul Gaultier, Coty, Inter Parfums and many others. Apart from the selective sector, Studio Pi Design also works with South American and Nordic groups. It is an experience that compels us to find creative solutions which are different from the ones we use in the luxury sector. It's difficult among all these achievements to highlight a particular project, but let's say that the creation of the Omnia bottle for Bulgari was a great moment, in terms of both creativity and relationship with the brand's teams. I also like mentioning the Narciso Rodriguez Essence palette comprising a liquid fragrance a concrete and a scented foundation. Premium Beauty News - What lessons do you draw from these experiences? Fabrice Legros - I think the main issue at stake stands in the quality of the relationship that builds up between the designer and the teams. From this relationship will depend the quality of the creation, the words used in the brief to express the needs of the brand, and their understanding by the designer. A badly chosen word by the marketing team, or misinterpreted by the designer, can be a real pitfall. It is therefore important to communicate well to avoid such surprises. Of course, the more the brief is complete, the more obvious the creation is. Sometimes a board is preferable, because images are a help to enter into a world while giving more freedom to imagination. Here too the creation of the Omnia bottle for Bulgari will remain a great memory. For the first time we were given carte blanche. This forced us to review the brand's whole DNA from scratch, and from this solid base we could leave it to our imagination. Strangely enough, this did not result in a whole lot of ideas but instead in a project that immediately won the enthusiasm of the client. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, is it not where the talent of the designer stands: to know how to imbue himself of the spirit of a brand prior to innovating? Fabrice Legros - I think it's actually the gist of the profession. Many designers believe they are artists. I believe instead that this profession is very different from that of an artist. A designer has to be at the service of a brand and of its codes, he must adjust and adapt his style to the brand. That does not mean he cannot have his own artistic sensibility, but he must be able to integrate it into the codes of the brand. That means to master the codes of Baroque when the brand requests it, and on the contrary to know how to stay minimalistic when brands require it. To work for brands is very different from a creator's design activity, who produces personal objects. You must be able to adapt your creative expression to the identity of your customers. And entering into a brand's DNA is all the more important when it concerns a creator's brand with a strong personality. I recall in particular the work achieved for the bottles of the Boudoir and Libertine lines by Vivienne Westwood. Finally, design also requires technical expertise. Designing pretty shapes is not enough. You must also know how to use materials which are consistent with the desired shape and to know how to take into account costs constraints which are inherent in each project. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, on this subject, what is the impact of ecological constraints in your business? Fabrice Legros - We see some briefs emerge, who are strongly focused on their compliance with environmental specifications, requiring very often the use of recycled or recyclable materials. But I must say it is a very complex issue for the luxury industry. Because luxury's challenge is to constantly enchant people, and for that reason packaging plays a vital role. I believe for example that it is an area where to try and further reduce the weight of packagings can quickly become a problem on the market. This does not mean however that the luxury segment can side-step environmental constraints, but that certainly specific solutions must be found. We can imagine, for example, that bottles remain precious objects, and that they even become more and more precious, but that people don't throw them away anymore. This is the concept of the perfume fountain developed for the Angel perfume by Thierry Mugler. We could also go back to the original spirit of luxury perfume bottles: a collector's item that is carefully saved. An almost similar phenomenon exists in Japan, but for different reasons. Japanese women use very little perfume but love beautiful perfume bottles they can place conspicuously on their bathroom shelves like rare decorative objects. In any case, it's the consumer who will trigger or not this phenomenon. Currently, marketing teams are sticking so close to the market and are so responsive that when this trend or another one suddenly emerges, brand's response will come very rapidly."

They have set the bar high with regard to offering high quality and innovative products along with service and support that is second to none. We are honored to represent this great line of products and it is the only company that we are currently partnering with in the make-up segment at this time. We look forward to creating additional partnerships for other kinds of primary packaging products in the color cosmetics market segment using a similar business model."
Arrowpak to expand its network in the U.S.A.,"Initially focusing, when it was founded in 1980, on the distribution, of standard bottles of nail polish designed by with its own moulds by several glass-makers worldwide, this New York based subsidiary of Baralan an Italian group, has considerably expanded its scope of activity both in the skin care and then the make-up sector and also by integrating new partners, particularly in Asia. Currently, Arrowpak's portfolio comprises bottles, caps and plastic jars, but also an increasing number of make-up cases, lipstick tubes, mascaras, lip glosses, etc., plus a range of airless bottles, including, twenty new models which were recently presented to clients. ""It's fairly simple,"" Jim Slowey, the Commercial Director explains, ""given the slowdown in the U.S. skin care market because of the economic crisis, we decided to invest more in the make-up segment."" Hence the firm's presence at the very first edition of the MakeUp in New York trade show, which will be held on 13 and 14 September next, in New York. One of the company's biggest assets is obviously, its catalogue of standard products designed by its own team of designers/developers making it possible to offer some 500 moulds for nail polish bottles and at least as many in the other areas covered by Arrowpak. Another asset, a stock which is divided, for the time being, between the firm's historic headquarters in New York (7,500 sqm) and also on the west coast in Los Angeles (3,000 sqm). ""For now, a significant part of the plastic packaging comes from Europe thanks to one of Baralan's converting subsidiaries in Italy, but it is not said that this will continue"", pointed out Slowey, ""taking into account the euro/dollar rate that remains very disadvantageous."" And there is only one step to take... before considering converting ourselves directly on site on the more or less short term."
New York: Iggesund's Black Box under the sign of beauty,"With each new box the black box project grows. Latest exhibition to date of the black box and its content: the one held at the Milk Studio in New York, last month. On this occasion, the designer, Marc Benhamou, chose to revisit the 22 first cards of the Tarot - the Major Arcana - using the theme of Beauty. Brigitte Reiss-Andersen achieved the make-up of the models. ""How to determine what is at the core of something as elusive as beauty? I have worked for many years in the beauty industry and this is a question that has been puzzling me over and over again,"" emphasised Marc Benhamou, a French designer based in North America and also the fourth designer who accepted Iggesund's challenge to create a Black Box with an advanced design and an original content. ""Art has the magical power to change life in beauty. This Major Arcana deck is dedicated to these connections. From the most complex and mysterious game, We searched for visual simplicity, leaving your imagination entering the cosmos and your soul looking for knowledge."" This Black Box operation is a story that dates back to November 2010. The first designers to accept the challenge were the packaging specialists in cosmetics and fragrances at Paris-based agency Landor and then the maestro of printing techniques, Frans van Heertum of Tilburg in the Netherlands. ""Free spirits at Landor did what designers so often do, explains Guy Mallinson, Marketing Director for Iggesund, namely to break all the rules for the commission right from the start. Their contribution is called Virtually Real and is based on the concept that everything we produce can be broken down into pixels. So they thought: why not produce a pixel that people can use to build something with? The result was a Black Box containing a single pixel. The box didn't create much excitement until it became clear that the creative minds at Landor had not just thought outside the box - they'd also blown it to smithereens."" In addition to the box, Landor's contribution consisted of four works of art, each made up of 4,900 physical pixels, resulting in four pictures, each 3 x 3 metres in size. In contrast to Landor's concept-driven contribution, that of van Heertum Design was clearly technology driven. ""Frans van Heertum, the company's grand old man, adds Guy Mallinson, is all but legendary in the graphics industry for pushing the boundaries of what is possible. He happily combines gravure, offset and screen printing and then adds 34 printing inks and a multitude of varnishes. As if that weren't enough, he also likes to integrate Swarovski crystals into his design. He is a multiple winner of the Golden Cylinder honorary award from the American Gravure Printing Association."" On opening van Heertum's black box, whose design is based on Dutch identity, one discovers a highly intricate laser cut construction made from a single sheet of paperboard. The box also contains a number of cards that display a variety of various printing and finishing techniques - ones that most printers and designers can only dream of achieving. As for Andrea Brunazzi of Brunazzi & Associati in Torino, Italy, has created a black box that is the ultimate in Italian style. His solution is a survival kit for pasta lovers. The complete ready meal is packed and placed in Invercote Bio and the packaging ultimately functions as a pasta strainer. ""The next black box will be presented this autumn in Hamburg,"" explained Carlo Einarsson, head of communications for Iggesund Paperboard."
"Somater, strengthens its position in all compartments of health & beauty packaging","In order to strengthen its position in injected tubes, Somater is investing in new production machines and, more importantly, in a new offset printing machine capable of running at pcs/minute. In the make-up sector, where the management aims to double the turnover of the company in three years time. ""But don't be mistaken"", insists Alix Hubin, ""not only our investments have been steady over the last thirty years (between 8% and 12% of sales each year) but we continue to invest in all the compartments where we are operating, that is to say, extrusion and injection blow moulding, injection and thermoforming."" The group remains a bit a model of its own in the French industrial world where large family-owned SMEs are becoming fewer and fewer. ""It is true that we are a bit of an exception,"" admits Alix Hubin, ""with an exclusively family owned capital and a vision that has always remained very perennial, in terms of industrial development."" The least one can say is that the gone through road is impressive for a company who has managed to become one of the leaders among specialists of plastic processing in Europe mainly by the means of external acquisitions, including the latest to date, the former Polyflex factory near Dieppe, which dates back to 2006. Currently the group's core activity continues to concern the pharmacy-hygiene packaging. However, Somater has also earned itself an excellent reputation in the manufacture of upscale PET bottles for the beauty sector. The groups stepped in the make up market at the outset of the years 2000, following a fortuitous discussion with one of the leaders of a major global cosmetic group. ""I call that a strategy of opportunities,"" Alix Hubin explains. ""We often operate along this scheme. But then, of course, industrially everything has to follow!"" And, in fact, it always does! ""That's why our customers trust us,"" she insists. ""A trust based on several other parameters that are called, responsiveness and speed of decision, a long standing family business, financial security, no risk-taking policy, local manufacturing, the will to manufacture in France and to assume our social responsibility in this matter."" ""The example of mascara is interesting,"" she says. ""A large group comes to us expressing its needs. The decision was quickly made. We decided to make every effort to build an industrial tool suiting the site of Marolles les Saint-Calais, especially concerning machines and their automation where we claim a real know-how. In a few months we were ready."" As a result, a genuine expertise that can only be renewed and transformed into renewed orders. ""Undoubtedly, make-up is one of the segments Somater is seeking to develop,"" we are told at the corporate headquarters in Boulogne-Billancourt, near Paris. ""And we fully intend to set foot on that specific segment!"" Next steps underway, to reinforce our partnerships in terms of development and in supplies of mascara brushes and take advantage of the Group's experience in the manufacture of tubes of lip balms to invest in a new segment, that of lipstick tubes. ""And in a general manner, emphasises Alix Hubin, focus more on foreign markets to no longer only depend of our domestic market."""
Sustainability and cost top the agenda of the packaging industry,"According to an on-line survey of packaging professionals conducted by DuPont's Packaging & Industrial Polymers division in March 2011, sustainability and cost are the major concerns in the global packaging industry to date. Actually, more than 500 packaging professionals were surveyed* and almost 40 percent sited sustainability as the toughest challenge, while 33 percent named cost as a major factor. ""Sustainable, cost-effective solutions that reduce packaging's environmental footprint are a top goal across geographies,"" said William J. Harvey, president at DuPont Packaging & Industrial Polymers. Among the multiple options available to improve the environmental impact of their products, 65 percent of the respondents say their efforts are focused on design for recyclability or on use of recycled content, much more than those opting for renewable or bio-based materials (41 percent) or focusing on compostable materials (25 percent). ""These survey results confirm that there are many pathways to improving packaging sustainability,"" said Harvey. ""It starts with close collaboration throughout the value chain to spark innovation."" To address these concerns, DuPont Packaging & Industrial Polymers proposes a number of ways to enhance sustainability. Regarding the Surlyn ionomer, which looks like glass and is particularly used in the packaging of cosmetic products, Dupont claims it ""helps reduce the total amount of material in packaging structures"". DuPont also says its Biomax Strong modifier helps bio-based PLA (polylactic acid) products gain more widespread use by enhancing the performance attributes of this material."
Arcade to invest in make-up,"""We got involved in the make-up segment ten years ago"", explains Philippe Ughetto, Senior Vice President International, ""but it currently only accounts for 20% of our business."" Arcade's brand new commitment is reflected by a significant commercial involvement focusing on the Stand-Alone Beautiseal, a sample that can be distributed easily and that looks like a small printed card that just needs to be opened to reveal the cream or the foundation that one wishes to apply on his face. Quite a promotional effort was undertaken too with ClearAdvantage, which allows to offer the consumer a make-up powder directly on an insert from inside a magazine. ""The technical performance in this case,"" emphasises Philippe Ughetto ""is that the powder is trapped in a transparent label featuring the desired shape (that of a case for example) glued on a printed medium."" No burrs and a perfect respect in the shade of the powder. Arcade's third flagship product in the make-up sector: the Beautipod. It consists in a clever little sample glued to a paper medium whose dose is made available by tearing the trim line positioned on the insert, a gesture which allows to tear open at the same time the upper side of the sachet through which the product is released. A system that allows a presentation under multiple forms, the last one being the one marketed by the brand Benefit consisting in three available samples aligned on a leaflet, inserted into a small advertising and explanatory booklet. Industrially speaking, to note the opening by the group, in April of a fully owned subsidiary, ArcadeLatam, in Sao Paulo."
Plastic price hikes: manufacturers are sounding the alarm bell,"Premium Beauty News - Price instability for monomers, such as ethylene and propylene, adds up to the continuous increase in the prices of plastic materials recorded since November 2009. This situation is increasingly worrisome! Françoise Gerardi - Indeed, increases in prices of 19 to 35% of plastic materials were recorded over the year 2010. This critical situation was aggravated by numerous supply disruptions and forces majeures due to breakdowns, strikes and shortage in monomers due to the closure of European units. These rises have been steadily increasing since the beginning of 2011, with 12% to 32% rises according to the material in less than six months and prices currently gaining 5% per month. Moreover, price variances between geographic zones, to the detriment of European manufacturers, worsen the difficulties of companies. For example: crystal polystyrene costs 64% more in Europe than in Asia and 23% more than in the USA. These sharp increases, coupled with those of different energies, make the manufacturing costs of flexible and plastic packaging in Europe even higher and have put a strain on the competitiveness of businesses operating in the area. Thus rises in plastic prices in Europe over one year (January 2010-January 2011) were of 28% for PS, of 32% for Homo Injection PP, of 31% for Copolymer PP, of 19% for PVC, of 25% for PET, of 35% for LDPE, of 21% for Blow moulding hdPE and Injection HDPE, of 23% for Linear LDPE (Butylene) and of 13% for Film HDPE. Premium Beauty News - Rises that are worsening? Françoise Gerardi - Absolutely, price rises that are steadily getting worse in 2011 with +12% to +32% in less than 6 months and +5% currently announced every month. Premium Beauty News - With a constant price rise in monomers? Françoise Gerardi - Indeed, the 30% price hikes recorded for monomers (ethylene and propylene) over the past 6 months will get worse under the full impact of the geopolitical context. Premium Beauty News - What seems incredible, is the price difference between geographic zones! Françoise Gerardi - The difference in price between geographic zones are also very worrying for plastic and flexible packaging manufacturers, suggesting that raw materials produced in zones with cheaper resources (Middle East) have preferred destinations outside of Europe adding to the problems of structural competitiveness of our countries increasingly difficult access to raw materials at competitive prices and in sufficient quantities. A mobilization of Europe must be undertaken with our manufacturers to reverse this destructive trend. Some examples of price variances: – Crystal PS: +23% between Europe and the U.S. - +64% between Europe and Asia - +33% between the U.S. and Asia – Homo Injection PP: +16% between Europe and the U.S. - +22% between Europe and Asia - +5% between the U.S. and Asia – Blow moulding HDPE: +26% between Europe and the U.S. - +36% between Europe and Asia - +7% between the U.S. and Asia – Film HDPE: +15% between Europe and the U.S. - +28% between Europe and Asia - +11% between the U.S. and Asia. The main consequence is that companies are now facing financial difficulties, the situation is getting worse in terms of deliveries, there are no disruptions but postponements in deliveries. If this situation goes on we feel very much concerned by the financial health of businesses that find themselves very weakened and for some of them in alarming proportions."
Packaging training: ESEPAC at the cutting edge,"Premium Beauty News - Since when does this school exists and what kind of training do you provide? Serge German - The ESEPAC was created in 1991 on the initiative of both the CCI of Le Puy-Yssingeaux and the University Blaise Pascal in Clermont-Ferrand. We train a hundred students each year. There is first a Masters in Packaging Engineering (European diploma, 5 years after A' Levels). This training is open to owners of a Degree in Science and Technology or incidentally of professional degrees related to packaging, and who wish to start a career as ""Packaging Developers"" or ""Packaging Engineers"". It's a two year work-linked or full time training, but companies tend to prefer the first solution. We also offer a Professional Degree in Packaging Technology (3 years after A' levels), for graduates (with 2 years academic background) wishing to start a job in Engineering Office (paper-cardboard & plastics); it is a one year work-linked or full time training. Students are placed in a environment similar to that of a corporate one: reporting to a Cluster Manager, assignments for companies on real projects, work load, rhythm of work and work tools similar to those of a company, participation to professional contests. We are also a human scale school. There are a hundred students which enables to have reduced working groups comprising 16 to 18 trainees. The classrooms are located directly around the workshop, staff offices are in the workshop, in permanent contact with students. When we designed our new building, we tried to replicate the team spirit which is so efficient in a corporate environment. Premium Beauty News - Indeed, you have just inaugurated new buildings. Why was this investment important? Serge German - This unique school for its 20 years of existence, has made a fine project come true. At last a building to our image, a close link between the corporate world and training. Through this achievement, the ESEPAC wishes to promote packaging occupations and identify them as positions producing value added and with career prospects. Moreover, the job market in this area is particularly attractive and the proposed positions very motivating too. Since 2006, 96% of our graduates found a job four months after having graduated. Thus, the ESEPAC is improving further the quality of its service offer to the industry, both in training and in the services offered in an infrastructure to match its ambitions. Premium Beauty News - What is your link with the beauty business? Serge German - Since our inception, our students join packing users and for some of them, the field of perfumery and cosmetics. If you find them, with a full job or alternating with training sessions, at Yves Rocher, Puig, Dior, Shiseido and many other great names, it is because the curriculum forms them to the different materials in use in the field of beauty, to the tools for designing and prototyping, but it's also because professionals in their trades share with them their passion for design, innovation and give them an entrepreneurial spirit. We convey, I am convinced, similar values to those of such a sector: we strive for excellence, results, we encourage creativity, we invest heavily in technical equipment. The field of beauty has a lot of attractiveness for young people. The ESEPAC is therefore setting up an even stronger partnership with this specific sector. Our new campus dedicated to packaging has been designed for flying packaging colours high to Beauty operators and meet their expectations. It's a fine available tool, for all of those who, like us, have grown a passion for packaging designing allowing young people to develop our future."
Ileos is boosting its presence in China,"Do you know Shangyu? A ""small"" city with just over a million inhabitants, about a three hour drive from Shanghai. This is the place where the Ileos Group decided to settle in 2004 by the means of a joint venture with a Chinese partner specialized in plastic injection and metal processing. Reflectively a good idea, since after seven years, the plant now employs some 1,400 people spread, within a single site, between the historic plastic and metal processing activity via the entity Axilone Shunhua, and the new cosmetic uni-dose manufacturing activity started in September 2007 with the Bioplan/Flexasia entity. The latter also receiving a great deal of attention in terms of investments by the Ileos management. A few weeks ago one section of the production workshop was placed under controlled atmosphere (Class 300,000) and another part, in Class 100,000. An investment of nearly half a million euros. ""He who can do more can do less,"" explained Vincent Hasenfratz, Managing Director of Bioplan/Flexasia. ""The trend is moving towards an increased level of purity for the manufacturing of our products. We are accompanying the phenomenon and, we are even anticipating it."" It has to be said that this firm of French origin has further ambitions in this filling segment and is taking an interest in the parapharmaceutical sector and in that of the make-up with a dedicated workshop. Especially since it already undertakes packaging operations with glass bottles and tubes. An upgrading that can only help reinforce the confidence of brands already working with the company. ""An increasing number of local brands,"" confirms Hasenfratz, ""but we are also more and more considered as an operational base by our global customers."" This desire to reach the highest ranks is the same with Axilone Shunhua who is undertaking strong investments in all areas of the plant that had already been expanded in July 2009 with the addition of a new building of 40,000 sqm on three levels. The equipment population the company owns will jump from currently 62 injection machines (160 tons to 350 tons), to 90 by 2013. A brand new 350 ton, dual injection machine was commissioned in 2010. The workshop processes some 150 tons/day of plastic materials, 80 percent of which for the production of lipstick tubes. The factory already comprises five anodizing lines and will host a new one in a couple of months, bringing the capacity from 700,000 pieces per day to 800,000 pieces per day. In a month's time, a new polishing line will come in addition to the twelve the workshop already uses. The mould-making workshop which employs about 70 people manufactures about twenty moulds per month and has just been equipped with a new EDM machine. As for the assembly workshop, it employs nearly 300 people spread over some thirty lines. Finally, there will be four new transfer presses arriving in a month for an overall park of twenty units."
Recycled PET bottles for cosmetics: Bormioli Rocco paved the way,"Premium Beauty News - What is the weight of Bormioli Rocco Plastics in the European market of packaging converters? Bormioli Rocco - The Bormioli Rocco group as a whole, that is to say, Tableware and Packaging in 2010 achieved a turnover of more than EUR 500 million. The plastics activity itself accounted for more than 25% of the turnover achieved in the packaging activity. Three factories produce plastic packaging, two in Italy and one France. Premium Beauty News - And the customer markets? Bormioli Rocco - Pharmacy remains our first customer market, followed by the cosmetics and food industries. The capping activity is the most important segment, followed by bottles and accessories. Finally, France is our largest market for the cosmetics sector. Premium Beauty News - Since 2005, there has been a real environmental awareness at Bormioli Rocco Plastics? Bormioli Rocco - Yes, it's our R&D department who initially assessed and approved the recycled material channels. We logically started with recycled PET channels. One of our first projects was a bottle for a phytosanitary product. Premium Beauty News - How many PET recycling channels currently exist in Europe today? Bormioli Rocco - Half a dozen with acceptable quality levels for cosmetics. After having found ""safe"" channels, we then had to work on the injection blow moulding process with bi-orientation. Premium Beauty News - In 2008, you are all set for the cosmetic market! Bormioli Rocco - Yes, we then started producing the first 100% PET recycled bottles for the cosmetic market. With some success since the L'Occitane Group in Provence entrusted us with the design of 300ml and 500ml 'Aromachologie' bottles and of 150ml 'Verdon' bottles. Italian brands of cosmetics like Landoll, Natyr and Bjobj have also opted for our solution. Premium Beauty News - Your efforts are rewarded! Bormioli Rocco - They are actually starting to be. The technique is perfectly controlled and the results are very promising. Using one ton of recycled PET results in a decrease of 1,5 tonne of CO2. Sometimes Marketing managers still need to be convinced that the transparency of a recycled PET bottle is obviously not as good as that of a bottle made from virgin resins. But habits are changing very quickly. As a result, this type of bottles represented last year a significant part of our cosmetic activity. We are seeking to increase reasonably the production of PET-R bottles in the two to three years to come. Premium Beauty News - And beyond recycled PET, what else? Bormioli Rocco - Recycled HDPE is also available, even if demand is still low for the time being."
CEP Cosmétique: a series of innovation in plastic injection,"CEP Cosmétique's two-part mascara sample already, the first of the series, already made the headlines of Premium Beauty News. The two other innovations are currently undergoing production tests: it is on the one hand a new injected breakable sample tube, which has the particularity of being both resealable and as competitive as a sachet, the ""Minicep"" and, on the other hand, a new HDPE [1] injected tube, in replacement of LLDPE [2] injected tubes, which about to be launched, and has the advantage of offering totally identical properties to the ones of extruded tubes in terms of flexibility and barrier properties. Not a start-up, this company located in Thiers, in the Auvergne region (France), whose origins go back to the 1860s but who has not finished drawing attention to herself! Its real start-up in the segment of cosmetic packaging dates back to 1990, when Géry Dambricourt, CEP's owner and CEO for five years, decides to take-over a unit specialized in the manufacture of caps. The firm distinguishes itself at the same time with the development of the famous bi-injected cap for the range of facials in jars for the brand Vichy (Liftactiv-Neovadiol). A flagship product that is still produced at several million copies each year. But that's not the end of it! As of 1992, the first researches are launched on the manufacture of a injected tube. During the same year, the decision is made to set up a new plant dedicated to the cosmetic packaging activity. ""The CEP Group, explains Stéphane Léonard, Sales Director, now comprises three separate entities, CEP Industries or Cosmétiques, CEP Agriculture (injected products for the garden and/or agriculture) and CEP Office Solutions (storage accessories for office use)."" Total turnover of 28 million euros for a workforce of 210 people. ""The cosmetics activity has grown steadily over the years, especially thanks to the boom in the production of injected tubes (100 million per year) and the latest developments should only help accelerate this progression,"" points out Léonard. Walking down the aisles of the production site of the factory in Thiers, in the centre of France, is enough to convince oneself, with its 28 injection presses, including four bi-injection presses, not to mention three offset printing machines, two screen printing machines dedicated to the decoration of tubes with a diameter of 16 and 19, and the impressive ""in-house-designed line"" dedicated to screen printing and hot stamping of tubes with a diameter of 30 and 35. At the end of the hall, stands the also in-house-designed new machine for the assembly of the famous sample tube for mascaras that is truly quite astonishing. Located at the end of the injection machine, it assembles the three basic components this sample is made with, namely the tube itself (one piece injected, including the wiper), the cap including the stem also one piece injected, and the fibre or plastic brush. As a result, a sample for mascara whose manufacture and assembly are reduced to their minimum and, more importantly whose filling is achieved from the base (the brush being already inside). ""The product development took us more than a year,"" explained Léonard. Next imminent step, the development of a identical sample for lip-gloss. But that's not the end of it! The French plastic injection firm is also launching its ""Mini CEP"", a one piece injected sample tube, cap included, therefore single block that only weighs 1.3 grams and whose head is fully squeezable which allows total and effortless product delivery (3ml). Another extra trick: simply use the other end of the breakable cap to reseal the tube if it has not been fully used. ""A manufacturing concept, insists Léonard, which allows us to be very competitive and to even tread on the toes of the famous sample sachet. In addition, we are certainly more environmentally friendly than the sachet in its multilayer version"". As for the barrier aspect, the ""Mini CEP"" has also benefited from progress made by engineers, in recent months, to replace the use of LLDPE resin with HDPE resin which allows to offer a truly flexible tube with barrier properties, which is easily squeezable, surfactant resistant, and with an especially nice touch. ""A technique that has forced us to push the boundaries of injection,"" admitted Léonard, ""and that of course we have made available for all our other tubes."""
Topline Products: an ultra-thin precision brush for L'Oréal Paris,"Let us look back in time. In December 2009, Charles Chang had explained for Premium Beauty News the ambitions of his group on the dynamic segment of full service to serve the cosmetic industry. At the time, the Topline Group was worth about $100 million, employed 2,000 people and was running five factories in China. A few months before, the group had opened itsEuropean office based in Paris, headed by Jean-Robert Bonneil. Yet the group could already boast of several product innovation such as the ""Dual Hinged Compact"", a Topline patented creation chosen by L'Oréal for its True Match line, but also the tube of the lipstick / lip gloss Infallible also designed for L'Oréal, not to mention the loose powder compact with its brush for Max Factor or the ""French Manicure Pen"" for Sephora. Charles Chang's motto was clear: ""constantly seek for innovation and performance."" In May 2010, the group added to its existing structure, a first industrial plant in North America, in Reynosa (Mexico). This plant provides a complementary base to the Asian structure for both the filling of perfumes and nail polishes and the assembly of gift boxes. A plant of 2500 sqm including, among others, a clean room for specific filling operations. In June, the same year, the group bought the plastic injection factory, Motor City Plastics in Dundee, Michigan, whose main strong point is bi-injection, and even tri-injection. A plant which has even strengthen its production potential with the installation of multi-cavity machines. In October 2010, Topline signed the new foundation distributor for Maybelline's Instant Age Rewind. Already a rare piece of technology in the form of a transparent bottle with a collar that you just need to turn to allow the juice to rise through a convoluted foam which can then serve as an applicator. Today, the group has signed the new packaging of L'Oréal Paris' new foundation, Infallible. The new ultra-fine brush of this packaging benefits from an ergonomic design for a perfect application of the foundation and a flawless absorption for an undetectable coverage and an infallible finish. The innovative nature of this brush is largely due to the technological quality and design of its Flexi-fibers. The bristles of varying heights are optimally positioned to form multiple layers. During the application, each successive layer of Flexi fibers glides effortlessly on the contours of the face to apply the formula on the skin. The result is an ultra-thin make-up for a flawless coverage which stays natural and undetectable. The guarantee of a make-up with no overload. The ultra-soft and smooth touch of the Flexi-fibres guarantees rapid absorption of the foundation on the skin without leaving any marks. This brush applicator was specially designed with a high bristle density and a flat head shape with rounded edges for a double effect. It allows to quickly and easily obtain an optimal coverage, by applying make-up in broad strokes moving downwards, on the nose, forehead, cheeks and chin areas. The bevelled edges of the ultra-soft brush are used to spread the make-up on the most delicate areas like the wings of the nose, hairline, eyes and lips contours. Finally, the size and thickness of the bottle allows a better control of the application. When applying make-up, it is important to ensure that the proper amount of product is applied to the angle and pressure suiting a efficient application. The new metering system, implemented with a simple click allows to control the desired amount."
French National Council of Packaging: a disruptive approach to boost new packaging generations,"Premium Beauty News - As an association, the CNE is in charge of doing positive thinking focused on ""useful packaging""! Michel Fontaine - Yes quite true! Moreover, isn't our slogan ""together for the best packaging""!. In the beginning, the mission of the CNE was to develop and disseminate best practices in terms of design, utilization and marketing of packaging for consumer products. Historically very much involved in the development of a waste prevention policy for packaging, the CNE obviously wanted to become more broadly a driving force in the creation of a responsible policy of eco-designing for consumer products. For the CNE, this resulted in different missions: – Develop and disseminate best practices in terms of design, utilization and marketing of packaging for consumer products, – Become a driving force in the creation of a responsible policy of eco-designing for consumer products, – Develop prevention through source reduction, – Issue opinions, recommendations and advices to public authorities, on the packaging of consumer products, – Organize a dialogue between partners. The National Council of Packaging encourages businesses and organizations, taking a part in the packaging chain, to get involved in this active policy of prevention and to act efficiently in the design, manufacture, composition, use and recovery of packaging, while also ensuring both the integrity of the packaging's functionalities and the use value of the product/packaging duo. Premium Beauty News - The word ""disruption"" appears regularly in your communication today. What kind of a disruption exactly? Michel Fontaine - When I took office, in order to take things forward and start a positive dynamic for packaging, we actually wanted to identify areas where it was truly possible to start a real disruptive approach, at the level of consumer behaviour, commercially or technically. We can work, for example, on a simplification of the packaging system, in line with questions pertaining to the usage function of a case for consumers in the case of a toothpaste tube. Premium Beauty News - Your contest Emballé 3.0 is a perfect illustration of this! Michel Fontaine - Absolutely! We chose this title, ""Emballé 3.0"" simply because young people nowadays are fully integrated into a computer and Internet universe. As for this contest for students, the goal is truly to single out the packaging of the future by playing precisely on ""disruption"". And believe me, we were not the least disappointed by some of the presentations. Overall, fifty schools and/or universities were requested to participate. In the end 87 students, in engineering or design, participated to this contest. The awards ceremony was held on January 27. This first edition awarded four teams, whose proposals are remarkable in terms of waste prevention and eco-design. I was very impressed by the range of natural shampoo powder given by AgroParisTech Massy. We will repeat this event every year. Premium Beauty News - A word about another work of yours under progress, the prevention indicators. Michel Fontaine - Pursuant to mission regarding the prevention of packaging waste, the CNE has developed with the support of its partners, a methodology to analysis source reduction, which is a repository of prevention cases and which can be found on our website. The CNE, with its partners, decided to objectify prevention by defining a list of 4 relevant and explanatory indicators concerning flows or environmental impacts. These indicators are: – Mass: it refers to the total weight of all the components of the complete packaging system, – The contents/container volume ratio: it reflects the ability of the packaging of the consumer sales units to contain in an optimized way the product, – The Palletizing volume ratio: This is the ratio between the volume of all these consumer sales units on a pallet and the volume of the pallet load, – The utilization ratio of recycled material: the share of recycled material will be the proportion, by mass, of post consumer recycled material in the complete packaging system. We are updating its methodology for prevention through source reduction by including new indicators."
Eastman teams with designer Marc Rosen to develop make-up packaging,"""Packaging is an art form,"" Rosen says. ""Our job is to create packaging and products that speak to consumers on many levels. The wellspring from which we draw is based on our experiences as well as our imaginations."" Best known for his iconic fragrance bottle designs made of glass, Rosen used Eastman's Eastar CN copolyester, the latest addition to The Glass Polymer family of cosmetic materials, to develop sophisticated make-up designs that he says would not have been possible otherwise. ""Innovative silhouettes and unexpected material distribution allowed us to create unique offerings that aesthetically redefine this category,"" Rosen says. ""This is why The Glass Polymer is the designer's choice and makes creating new compact, lipstick and lip gloss packaging an adventure. The results can be memorable if deployed as part of a larger branding initiative. They can become signature to that brand, giving it a real competitive advantage."" The seven collections designed by Marc Rosen feature the moulding expertise of six global manufacturing companies: Albéa (ex-Alcan Packaging Beauty), in Brazil; Plasmetik Precision Molding Company, Ltd., in China; Pieriplast, in Peru; and Axilone, Jackel Cosmetics, and Leidel Corporation of the United States. ""Working with Marc, says Jayme Leita, global market development manager for Eastman, a renowned designer, and some of the world's top molders is a new model for innovation in the cosmetics industry - one that provides brand owners a catalyst for innovative cosmetics packaging."" ""Rarely do designers have the opportunity to step outside the confines of the expected and pursue new aesthetic and packaging directions. Rarer still are sophisticated materials that allow designers to fulfil their vision,"" we are said at Marc Rosen. The following seven cosmetic collections draw inspiration from many sources; all, however, were created to maximize the innovative potentiat of The Glass Polymer family of cosmetic materials from Eastman Chemical Company. – Chic, this sleek and apparently simple line manufactured by Axilone was inspired by the elegant cosmetic packaging of the 1940s and 1950s. During that period, prestigious jewelers would often create beautiful powder compacts and matching lipstick cases for society ladies. It was a statement of status to carry such refined and well-crafted make-up accessories. ""We tried to capture the spirit of such collections, but in a contemporary way. The compact clasp and the lipstick and lip gloss cap are clearty a nod to elegant jewelry-inspired closures of years gone by,"" says Marc Rosen. – The Halo collection, manufactured by Albéa, (ex Alcan Packaging Beauty) is all about the purity of proportion and beauty of innovative materials. Here, classic design creates a clear resin halo effect to showcase and enhance the product within. Exacting wall thicknesses and even material distribution all underscore a simple, yet sophisticated, design. – The Triad collection, manufactured by Leidel Corporation, is inspired by a personal compact created in the 1940s by ""Jeweler to the Stars"" Paul Flato for Elizabeth Arden. The compact, crafted in gold, was reminiscent of an envelope. Crisp, clean lines and sharp edges create a collection with an immaculate, precise presence. The compact lid was designed to reflect the flap of an envelope, the product inside obviously reflecting precious contents therein. – Pallette is a special piece designed to embody ""The Art of Clarity"", Marc Rosen's theme at Luxe Pack Monaco. This unique package, manufactured by Plasmetik Precision Molding Company, holds a multitude of shades and products for the face. By executing a classic art accessory in modern, clear Eastar copolyester CN, we've taken this well-recognized object to a fun, exciting plane. Its over¬ sized proportion makes it all the more interesting. – Also produced by Plasmetik Precision Molding Company, the Puzzle line was created to both amuse its user and have practical applications as well. Fun, fresh, and young at heart, the puzzle design can be used to create customized product mixes. Each piece can be used individually or combined (quite literally) to create a ""personalized picture of beauty""! – Fashion forward and based on the timeless appeal of stripes, the Prive collection is a tactile experience with alternating thick and thin recessed bands around the lipstick, lip gloss, and across the body of the compact.

Amorphic and sensual, this collection extols The Glass Polymer family of cosmetic materials and its ability to effortlessly flow and hold unique shapes and forms. The varying wall thicknesses of these components are very and feminine and create a soft, tactile experience in the hand. The relationship between the product and package also varies as the material ebbs and flows in thick and thin waves."
Flacon Couture: a concept that works!,"Xavier Vaisière - Our clients are companies who are making their debut in perfumery and who want to rely on our 25 years of experience in bottle designing. We are able to provide a service tailored to their needs, from supplying the empty bottle to a full service offer. We select the most relevant provider according to the specificities of the launch: It can range from the extract or the semi-automatic designed dummy to the high end automatically designed perfume bottle including bottles for home fragrances. Usually we take in charge the development of the project, from the brief to the delivery according to specifications and agreed deadlines. The advantage for our customers is to free themselves from the purchasing and development activity in order to devote themselves entirely to the marketing of their product. Xavier Vaisière - The luxury standards activity has not yet achieved its objectives but there is a rising interest for the development of specific molds for short batches. Prospects for 2011 are to continue to develop our customer portfolio and to regear the luxury standards activity. The goal is to offer pre-developed bottles available for exclusivity: our customers will then be able to choose among several bottles for which with samples exist and which therefore can be used for a market launch within tight deadlines while being sure of having the exclusivity. Our core business concerns glass bottles, but we are also able to supply pumps, caps or extrusion blow moulded bottles."
A second youth for bulb atomizers,"Two millions... , three million a year? ""The number of bulb atomizers sold in France (the leading consumer market) fluctuates a lot,"" admitted René Karla from Karla Innovations. ""But actually these last months seem to show a promising market increase."" Especially since this almost ancestral product was upgraded at the beginning of 2010 thanks to a technical trick applied on the spray head, allowing, with a simple twist, to seal the whole distribution system. Karla Innovations' bulb atomizers are manufactured in Taiwan. A manufacturing process requiring great technical expertise, first for the bulb which is made of two TPE injected then welded shells, and then for the spray head, especially concerning the nozzle which must perform a perfect spray. ""Bulbs..., are currently available in all shapes, materials and colours,"" explained René Karla. ""When I mention materials for the bulb, I mean that some of them may be dressed with a thin net (the sock!) of any type but they can also be flocked."" However, having a bottle fitted with a fine bulb atomizers on his bathroom shelf has a cost Between 1.50 € and 3 €. ""Obviously this kind of container is rather more naturally meant for niche and luxury perfumes,"" admitted René Karla, ""but it is more and more found in the home fragrance segment and even in that of make-up powder!"" As for the airtight bulb atomizer, it represents a real progress. ""Its lack in airtightness was considered as a real drawback when the consumer wanted to take it with her in her bag,"" insisted René Karla. ""Today, it's totally safe"". So much so that this type of airtight spray should represent 50% of the market in the two years to come. And it is only the beginning of it. Engineers are working on a system that would make it possible to control the spray dose, which is impossible to do today, whatever the pressure. Because currently, the sprayed volume only depends of the finger pressure on the bulb. A real headache!"
"An ""Irresistible"" pump for the safety of preservative free cosmetics","""Because of dermocosmetic and bio trends, consumers are more and more looking for preservative-free care products or for the ones containing a low concentration of them. Preservatives are nowadays no longer welcomed, even the authorised ones with a proven safety record like phenoxyethanol or even parabens,"" explained the management at Aptar Beauty + Home. It is true that figures speak for themselves. During the first half of 2010, 14% of launches on the face care segment claimed to be ""preservative-free"" or with ""a low concentration,"" against only 11% over the same period last year. According to the Aptar group, currently available alternatives to traditional preservatives are not fully satisfactory. ""In response, we have been looking for the breakthrough packaging solution that would guarantee both the absolute impossibility of product contamination and the sensory texture of the formula."" The ""Irresistible"" pump uses the Ultragate technology that combines two types of barriers against external contamination: A first barrier against possible contamination of the product from bacteria in the air: This pump uses 0.2 micron sterilizing filters that can stop the smallest bacteria. The technology derived from the pharmaceutical industry, specially from nasal preservatives-free sprays, has finally been implemented for a cosmetic pump. A second barrier exists to avoid the retro-contamination of the product via a contact of the user's fingers with the tip of the pump. The ""Irresistible"" pump features a ""Tip Seal"" shut-off valve, (a needle embedded in the actuator which makes any product return impossible in the distribution channel and seals the actuator's orifice. In order to develop and validate the protocols for certification tests, Aptar collaborated with external partners, the Zwisler Laboratorium GmbH (Laboratory of Microbiology), for the tests, and SRC Consulting, for regulatory affairs. The ""Irresistible"" pump comes in two versions: An atmospheric version and an airless version, both of them being FEA 20 compatible."
Sleever International strengthens its positions in make-up,"It was undoubtedly the main attraction in the beauty sector ofthe lastest Emballage packaging trade show in Paris. In showcasing its brand new SleeverLogicpak, the French group Sleever International has left a lasting impression. Because this machine introduces for the first time on the market a two-in-one concept that combines sleeve positioning and shrinkage in a single compact mono block structure designed precisely for the market of small unstable containers like lipsticks, mascara, lip gloss, among others. The whole of it at speeds between 7,200pph and 24,000pph. ""And, besides which, it's a beautiful machine!"" we are said at Sleever. But it's not its only strong point! The new SleeverLogicpak have received a great deal of attention from the engineers of the firm. In addition to its high production rates, its ground dimensions have been reduced thanks to a compact mono-block structure (2300 mm x 850 mm) equipped with a single electrical equipment cabinet. Settings were simplified to optimize adjustment times during format changes. Operating costs have been examined closely and streamlined wherever possible, in particular through a better control of power consumption due mainly to a better distribution of heating elements. Vacuum conveyors and the addition of specific guidance systems ensure a perfect stability to small sizes products. Finally, the positioning head for the sleeve also lost nearly 50% of its weight in the process thanks to the horizontal mechanical principles used for removing the sleeve. ""SleeverLogicpak was designed to process containers from 6 to 50 mm in diameter,"" explains Eric Fresnel, CEO of Sleever, ""with heights ranging from 20 mm to 200 mm with all films available (PET, OPS, TPE .... ) in thicknesses from 30 to 100 microns. It can also be equipped with a series of specific equipments according to customer's production requirements. A complete unit can also be added to insure micro-perforation and cut-out lines for tamper proof purposes (300 strokes per minute, tolerance 0.5 mm). It is also possible to add a module to position the sleeve vertically and laterally according to the shape of the container and the dimensions of the sleeve. A nonstop reel change per remote receiver can also be installed."" To note that dual-camera monitoring systems control the marking, the orientation of the sleeve on the bottle or the tube, making it possible to work in self-control mode."
"Weckerle: first ""powder"" machine","A first for engineers at the Weckerle Machinery division of the Weckerle group: their machine for filling and compacting make-up powder, The MPL - Multi Color Powder Line - is running successfully in the group's plant in Eislingen, and several more machines are already being assembled. It is quite a revolution for this German manufacturer primarily specialized in the manufacture of machines for the production lipstick. But it is also a true revolutionary machine compared to current filling techniques used for make-up powders. Firstly, the MPL is fully shrouded to ensure a controlled atmosphere. It is above all extremely flexible and accepts format changes and the possibilities of filling and pressing multi-coloured powders. It is clean (no more powder waste) with a clever system for dispatching powders of different colours via eight air-tight tanks stowed on either side of the machine and ""dusting"" stations for the feeder cups before the filling and pressing stages. Weckerle claims a capacity of 2200 pieces per hour, depending of course on the size of the pans, with a single operator."
"Rotary, vibrating, heating, 100% crystal clear: Asia rivals in ingeniousness for mascara","Of the two halls dedicated to packaging converters, the one where were grouped together the cream of the Asian industry was by far the most visited. ""Which is only normal,"" confided one of the European exhibitors from the other hall, ""our customers prefer finding new suppliers and then possibly come to visit us afterwards!"" In this hall proliferate mascaras which have become true electronic gadgets. The Taiwanese company Top-Well Cosmetics Industry Co., was presented the ""Rotating Super 3D Mascara,"" a mascara with a head that can operate a 360° rotation. The same company was also showcasing a vibrating stick, the ""TopiclearEye Gel Massager"" which enables to apply the eye contour product with a ""massaging"" effect. Another converter, also of Taiwanese origin, Polaroisin International Co., presented a whole series of mascara simultaneously vibrating and rotating, featuring some 10,000 vibrations per minute and also a 360° rotation. Big plus put forward by the manufacturer, the easy replacement of the battery. We had a go at it and it works! Polaroisin International Co. also proposed a large range of make-up packaging equipped with LED, including, of course, a mascara. At the stand of Boya Enterprise Co. Ltd, was ""simply"" presented a mascara with two rotating positions (left and right rotation monitored at the cap level) and a vibrating mascara. On the stand of the Chinese company FY Packaging, was displayed an also rotating mascara but featuring a sliding switch instead of a rotating one, much more practical to use because the direction of rotation can be reversed while applying the mascara. Mascara, lipstick tubes, lip gloss, mini tubes, jars, ""transparency"" reigned supreme in the aisles of this new edition of Cosmoprof Asia. To the delight of the producers of resins that, indeed, spared no efforts in recent years to conquer this huge market of beauty products by developing new resins able to condition and protect fragile and expensive products. On the stand of the Chinese society, Blossom Cosmetic Inc, one could found a new flexible and transparent mini-tube and a whole series of solid lip-glosses. Same strategy for Boya Enterprise Co. To note also at Udn Packaging Corp., a whole series of metering tubes being at the same time both flexible and transparent. Tubes equipped with a micro-valve for a precise metering of the product through a simple pressure on the body of the tube."
Samples: Orlandi targets Europe for growth,"For 15 years, Orlandi has consistently increased its turnover and market share. The company is led by Sven and Per Dobler, respectively President and Vice President, For this specialist of cosmetic sampling and Air Care solutions, 2010 is a milestone in the implementation of a new customer-focused strategy, both in the U.S. and in Europe. In the U.S.A, a new 17,000 square foot, advanced technology R&D laboratory is completing construction in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The new facilities is equipped with state of art technology and its infrastructure is LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified, thus complying with the company's commitments on sustainability. As far as Europe is concerned, Orlandi has appointed Renzo Sereni as its new General Manager Europe. In parallel, the company moved to its new offices in the suburbs of Paris, France. ""We wanted to move closer to our customers in order to improve accessibiltiy and responsiveness and to better contribute to the successful evolution of their business. Orlandi's new showroom will allow us to efficiently present our innovative solutions and customized services to meet customer needs,"" says the company in a release. Furthermore, 2010 confirms Orlandi's continued commitment to Research and Development with the launch of two new sampling products: – Oasis perfume labels incorporating an alcoholic formulation, – Oasis Beauty labels, which are adaptable to all cosmetic bases for print and retail single-use sampling. Both products will complement the broad catalog of existing products including Orlandi TruEssence scented strips, Emanescent and Touch-a-Scent cards, ColorKiss lipstick samplers, i-Apply cosmetic samplers, and the new Versa brand labels that achieved great success this year. Orlandi will be presenting at Les Places d'Or at the Hotel Meurice in Paris, France, from November 23 to 25, 2010."
VPI: a step further in Surlyn transformation,"The teams of VPI, a company specialised in the injection of plastic parts, located at Orgelet in the Jura region, France, have scored high! Indeed, to achieve this effect of bells floating in a transparent Surlyn-made crystal ring was not an easy thing to achieve. ""This innovation was made possible through a close partnership between our teams, Lalique Parfums and DuPont, who produces the Surlyn"" we are told at VPI, ""which allowed us to develop a brand new tri-injection process for this project."" Overall, it's no less than 19 bells with an average diameter of 6 millimetres, which are scattered at the heart of the collar with a thickness of 17.5 millimetres and a diameter of 70 millimetres. It took eighteen months of development to optimize the tri-injection process and to perfectly encapsulate the moulded lily flower, without damaging it and preserving all the details of it. But what a result! ""This is a further proof of what is driving us at VPI,"" explains Gilles Pauget, General Manager. ""Injected in two operations, this collar requires three layers of material and complete mastery of the processing parameters to maintain the overall quality of the product at each stage. Beyond the classical development aspect, all partners have pushed boundaries of creativity and technology to carry out this project which is a tribute to René Lalique on the year of his 150th birthday. We prove our expertise in multilayer injection with this innovation project 'Ice Cube' which this time, consists in making three layer massive parts in the same mould. A promising concept, which is opening new horizons."""
Bormioli Luigi : a glass bottle with an overmoulded surlyn shell,"It took several months of research and testing to Bormioli Luigi and its industrial partners in order to successfully master not only transformation techniques but also the type of glass required to eventually produce the very first overmoulded bottle prototypes. The manufacture of this type of bottle is a two-stage operation. First, the design of the glass bottle itself in blow-and-blow, press-and-blow or press processes. But it is not just any glass. Its so-called ""Sparkx"" composition patented by Bormioli Luigi was the subject of special attention to feature both, increased mechanical strength and also an even more abrasion resistant surface finish. Its chemical stability was also improved. This glass is free from lead or any other heavy metal. It is also very clear. [1] As for the overmoulded shell, it is made from the famous Surlyn resin developed by DuPont. Thus, the combination of the Sparkx glass with the Surlyn resin gave birth to the Linkx range. But it is obviously during the overmoulding stage that it all happens. ""A very specific technique, we are told at Bormioli Luigi, which is made possible thanks to the characteristics of the Sparkx glass but also thanks to a few tricks developed for the mould and, of course, thanks to a particular cooling system."" This technique allows to achieve fully or partly moulded bottles. We shall know no more! The result is quite spectacular and there seems to be endless possibilities offered in terms of shapes for the glass bottle and the overmoulding process. ""Linkx allows to give free rein to one's imagination in terms of shapes and colours for the bottles,"" Bormioli Luigi claims. The glass offers its usual resistance characteristics to chemicals and alcohol. Actually all options are possible regarding colours and shapes for both materials and also very broad possibilities in terms of internal and external finishing. Being able to play on full or partial moulding can also be very interesting. The smoothness to the touch is also very pleasant. The whole of it is of course unbreakable, etc. But the list would be too long to enumerate here. Undoubtedly, the Bormioli Luigi Group and its partners, Pibiplast and DuPont, are only starting to discover all the extraordinary possibilities offered by this new process. To be continued…"
"MegaPlast, Louvrette and Seidel join forces to launch new luxury packaging range","MegaPlast, the world's leading producer of all-plastic airless packaging, which supplies over 130 million airless pumps per year for use in the cosmetic, pharmaceutical and healthcare industries, has joined forces with fellow packaging manufacturers Louvrette and Seidel to develop new 'enhancements' for its market-leading dispensers. Louvrette's 'double wall' design sees the Mega dispenser enclosed within a high-transparency SAN casing. ""This not only adds weight to the dispenser but also enhances its aesthetic appeal - giving the look and feel of a high-quality luxury product,"" says MegaPlast in a release. Similarly, Seidel's anodized metal process houses MegaPlast's standard plastic body and actuator cap inside secondary metal shells. The products are available in any colour and with the option of a matt or high gloss coating, anodized metal, or anodized coating. According to MegaPlast, they afford cosmetic and pharmaceutical manufacturers the choice of a more exclusive, premium finish when packaging their products. ""The new, upgraded specifications we have introduced for Mega dispensers will allow our clients to select premium packaging designs which enhance both the shelf appeal and user experience of their products,"" commented Mrs Lucyna Silberstein, CEO of MegaPlast."
Cardboard: coping with shortage ... for a long time!,"""Blame it on bad luck, we are told by people on the side of cardboard producers, because the current situation is the result of a series of events which unfortunately occurred at the same time."" It began with a paper industry in a specially bad shape in 2005 due to chronic overcapacity and insufficient price levels to allow minimum profitability (note that a brand new paper machine costs a mere €500 million and that a ""simple"" recovery furnace will cost €240 million!). Thus European paper makers decided to reduce their production capacity. A drastic reduction in fact. Within three years, from 2007 to 2010, it is more than 460,000 tons of theoretical cardboard production capacity that will have disappeared! Incredible considering that the total production was around 2.5 million tons! A lack in cardboard of nearly 20%! In 2008, comes the financial crisis! Up to a point, justifying cuts in production capacity because of collapsing orders due to massive de-stocking. The same year Strömsdal reduces production capacity by 70,000 tons and Stora ignores 225,OOO tons. And it goes on in 2010 with Iggesund and its plant in Workington (- 70,000 tons) and the Mayr-Melnhof Group which in turn discards 30,000 tons. But that's not the end of it! Other upcoming events are also going to increase the phenomenon. Like the earthquake in Chile which significantly impacted global pulp supply (Chile accounting for nearly a quarter of world production). But there is also the Finnish stevedores' strike which lasted for two weeks followed by the strike of Swedish paper mills' workforce ... Last but not the least it is the transfer of part of the demand from recycled paper made board to virgin pulp made board, due to a controversy over the likely ink migration, resulting in large orders of Groups specialized in consumer products such as Nestle... Not to mention a particularly harsh 2009/2010 winter in Northern Europe which hampered forests exploitation and logistics in the North Sea. ""We were spared nothing, papermakers were saying ironically. The only thing missing would probably be a plane crashing on one of our mills...the works!"" As for the immediate future, it is actually more than tense! In one year, prices per ton have jumped by more than 20% to 30% depending on types and ... it is probably not finished yet. The shortage situation is going to remain for a while considering very strong remaining demand and massive restocking. On the side of future possible increases in production capacity, they are not that many solution at hand. M-Real has even so announced 80,000 extra tonnes in the second half of 2011. But delivery times are not going to just disappear. Stora indicated that improvements on existing machines would give a little more visibility without saying much more. As for Iggesund the Swedish paper maker announced that it will manage to gradually supply the market with 20,000 extra tons... within the next two years! (When compared to the 70,000 tons which disappeared!). Tough, very tough...!"
"Dieter Bakic, ""Our industry needs to continue perpetuating vision, creativity and innovation""","""There are issues to which I am emotionally related to, such has the key role played by, vision, creativity, and innovation,"" immediately points out Dieter Bakic. According to Dieter Bakic, ""vision is to create the right product and the right packaging for the right market or customer at the right time. Vision entails correctly foreseeing future unmet needs in the market."" ""This reminds me"" he says, ""of Marchesa Luisa Casati, one of the most extravagant society ladies of the early 20th century: Luisa Casati who expressed her lifestyle very creatively, for example, by riding in a Venetian gondola escorted by two leopards. Every move she made was watched and admired. Luisa was one of the first to use eye shadow in an extreme way, decorating her eyes in heavy black to resemble a mask. I can only imagine that during the 1920's coloured eye shadow was not on the market, which reduced her colour assortment to black. Creativity brought about the concept of a liquid lip colour... why continue to apply lipstick just using the traditional bullet system when a liquid, shiny colour could perhaps be more beautiful and effective?"" Dieter Bakic, inexhaustible on the subject adds, ""another example of creativity could be the trend away from liquid foundation to 'Cake Make-up,' this creamy powder that is applied using a sponge..."" ""Innovation should attract consumers with new solutions,"" he insists. ""Innovation is about thinking about the box and discovering new ways of creating added value for the customer. Innovation is the follow through of the creative idea to reality. Which often creates a problem for marketing because it needs entrepreneurship, time, financial investment, and consequent follow-through, where the end result may not be successful."" ""From this point of view, the first edition of MakeUp in Paris was a model,"" he says. ""Actually the event gathered all the ingredients that enabled players in the cosmetic industry to demonstrate their creativity and innovation capabilities."" ""Stock packaging is an excellent example of innovation: we create a design for a standard, then we develop it, and then we offer it to the market. And in fact, the current climate of low consumer prices, which result in lower profit margins, could be a contributor to reduced innovation. We all know the high costs of developing new products and of course packaging is included in this scenario."" Dieter Bakic concludes on a optimistic note, ""I encourage my colleagues to continue to perpetuate and enhance inspiration, creativity and inspiration, which are inseparable from an industry, one of the most special and creative!"""
Topline Europe: 30 months of growth,"Latest decisions to date, the opening in July of two sales offices in Moscow and Barcelona and the impending arrival of two new employees in Paris. Latest product to have been launched on the market, a brand new and very clever foundation distributor for Maybelline and its product Instant Age Rewind. ""A rare piece of technology,"" explains Jean-Robert Bonneil, Topline Europe, ""which comes in the form of a transparent bottle with a collar you just need to turn to allow the juice to rise, with the help of a piston, through convoluted foam which can then be used as an applicator."" And the so-called foam was not that easy to achieve since it was previously flocked to allow smooth application of the foundation on the skin. For its part, the parent company in the United States has continued the development of its industrial potential with the opening of a new packaging plant in Mexico and the recent take over, last July, of a plastic injection plant, Motor City Plastics in Dundee, Michigan, whose strong point is bi-injection, and even tri-injection."
Hermann Koch: innovating decorations,"The German firm specializing in the manufacture of plastic jars and bottles is working twice as hard, at the end of this year to offer a whole range of new products featuring new finishing techniques. To start with, a series of packaging with embossed screen printing which not only offers a very qualitative aspect but also gives the whole a comfortable grip for an easy handling making it simpler for the user to open the cap. Hermann Koch also offers laser decoration. Note that for this decoration possibility a special composite batch is required. Laser process decoration allows contactless decoration for all types of surfaces and enables fast changes of layouts. It is abrasion-proof, light-resistant and also chemically resistant. It is forgery-proof. To note also a standard collection, Sipario, which comprises a 50 ml jar, a 200 ml tottle and a 250 ml bottle. With the 50 ml jar, three different surface characteristics can be selected: mat, shinny or mat/shinny. Bottle and tottle are available with bi-injection caps The oval design of this new line is framed by edge-gated, soft outlines."
Airless Pack Association presents its charter,"At a press conference organised last week on the occasion of Beyond Beauty Paris, the APA (Airless Pack Association), which comprises to date, five member companies [1], presented its charter summarizing the main technical criteria required to obtain the future quality mark it wishes to put on all airless containers produced by current and future members of the Association. The goal of the association being ""to clarify the global offer in terms of airless packaging"" and to identify a ""genuine airless system"" from a system misusing the denomination. APA's initiative comes at a time when the airless market is booming. On the one hand, fragile formulas of current products require greater protection, and, on the other hand, technological progress allows airless to be used for more varied textures and sizess. APA's charter classifies airless products into three categories, whether they are meant to package cosmetic products, pharmaceutical products or preservative-free products. All criteria are reviewed: instant seal, durability of sealing, protection, pump priming, full restitution, dosage accuracy and regularity, container integrity under drop test, air intake under drop test, sterilizable pack or not, and sterility preservation during use, etc. Every company wishing to join the Association and use the logo ""Certified Airless by APA"" will therefore have to submit its products to a series of tests performed by an independent laboratory. Effective implementation planned by the end of this year. See chart attached:"
Plastic industry: Network and co-operation help Germans and Italians to perform better than French,"The results were presented in July in Lyon, during the annual meeting of the plastics industry. Main conclusion, the French industry suffers from a chronic lack in solidarity and from the weakness of networking actions. Titled Business practices in the plastics industry, benchmarking France/Germany/Italy, the study focuses on two sectors: car construction and packaging. The situation of the plastics industry in these three countries appears somewhat mixed. Champions of profitability German firms are followed by Italian companies. French companies rank far behind. As far as bank financing is concerned, there is no comparison: French companies have a much more limited access to such type of funding than Italian and German companies do, while at the same time, payment delays accepted by the clients are much better in Germany. If we compare the German plastics industry with that of Italy and France, we can quickly notice that German companies have become over time much bigger, while Italian companies are more comprised of very small businesses. The size of many French firms is intermediate. However, their sustainability is weaker as many of them are disappearing or are absorbed before being transmitted. One of the main reasons, according to Accenture: the legal framework. It favours transfers, investments and durability in both Germany (establishment of an exemption system with a tax ceiling on donations and inheritance; existence of non-profit public investment fund investing on long-term basis in SMEs take-overs, with no possibility of any decision making within the company), and Italy (abolition of inheritance tax in the case of family transfers). Regarding the manpower cost, Italy certainly enjoys the most competitive situation. However, costs are quite similar in France and Germany. Actually, it is at the level of ""collaborative"" approach between partners of the same industry that German and Italian companies have obviously got the picture. Thus it is not unusual to see informal gatherings and business associations in those countries without any legal organization that corresponds. To optimize business relationships with brand owners, partnerships are created between mould manufacturers, converters and plastic suppliers. Common bids are made to some invitations to tender. One can even notice a spontaneous and non official market sharing... and improved coordination in response to tenders to avoid getting stuck in a price pressure pattern. To expand overseas, German companies group themselves together and agree on trade shows participations (logic in stand co-financing, co-representation ...). For example, in Emilia-Romagna, three hundred people have left a large company, have each created their business with a staff of ten/twenty people, work together and have become world leaders in packaging ... Another example, again in Emilia-Romagna, 60,000 SMEs joined within guarantee cooperatives to negotiate with bankers, which enabled them to get a loan guaranteed by the cooperative with the same credit rates as those obtained by Fiat! Regarding innovation, concerted training plans were introduced in Germany between universities and companies in order to offer the industry employees mastering advanced technology and meeting recruitment needs and to make the plastics manufacturing sector attractive in terms of career opportunities. In Italy, highly industrialised districts exist in Veneto, Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany. Hence the Italian industry is very flexible, ready to innovate, to perceive all the technological changes and adapt to market changes. On the subject of ""Training and development of the sector and jobs"" ... there too, there is much to learn from our German neighbours. Apprenticeship is one great strength of this country as it is considered as a real ""national priority"". Training provided to the largest possible number and co-financed by companies and federal subsidies. On the subject of ""business practices with customers"", upstream of the contract, in Germany particularly, there is often consistent information sharing between the decision-maker and the subcontractor with a dialogue between each technical teams (purchases only occur often at a later stage), a sharing of the business plan, an understanding of associated variables (impact of a volume delta, impact of price fluctuations on raw materials, scenario implementation...), a mutual commitment on key assumptions, finally a consistent technical dialogue upstream of the contract signing. In Germany again, contracts usually take into consideration financial issues with real commitments on volumes, thus paving the way for trust and understanding in the event of changing conditions. Usually, Italian and German companies have more flexible business practices allowing to find a compromise with possible contract adjustments (in financial terms, or regarding specifications...). There is a will to find the best compromise and review together all contractual elements (and possible financial arrangements). Finally, concerning the access to financial resources, in Germany and Italy, brand owners don't have to bring guarantees. In Germany, business plans and prospects offered by brand owners (volumes, contracts...) suffice to haveaccess to financial resources. In Italy, it is the ""privileged"" relationship and proximity between the local or regional bank and the subcontractor that almost always gives access to financial resources. What a dream for any French manager!"
RPC Beauté meets success with its flexibility strategy,"""Our sales achievements are mainly due to the expertise we offer to the market,"" explains Olivier Joulin, RPC Beauté. ""Namely a high-performance manufacturing tool for injection and assembly, coupled to a true expertise in surface treatment via electroplating, the whole of it located in the very centre of France in Marolles, that is to say close to our customers. Not to mention the knowledge and technical support of a Group which has in Germany, among others, a real know-how for designing sophisticated moulds."" Main specialties of RPC Beauté, the manufacture and assembly of lipstick tubes, perfume caps, lipgloss, mascara and make-up cases. ""Industrially speaking our philosophy,"" explains Olivier Joulin, ""is clearly to favour the versatility of our assembly machines and not to dedicate them to a specific line. This allows us to make the most of our tool depending of production hazards."" This is what managers of the RPC Group will have been focusing on in recent months: gather and fully encourage synergies between RPC Beauté and the Bramlage/Wiko pole, also operating on the cosmetic sector, with in particular, a strong speciality in airless packaging with therefore the mastery in the manufacture of small precision moulded parts. ""But we work more on the design of specific products,"" underlines Olivier Joulin, ""while our colleagues are rather more positioned on standard products."" One's experience could therefore only benefit to the other and vice versa. ""I must say that we are currently fully taking advantage of this synergy which is at the same time technical and logistic. MakeUp in Paris, to which we participate and who proved to be a success as of its first edition, was also an opportunity to take advantage of this synergy. This is actually why, a new client with whom we are currently doing business with in Germany, decided to choose us. The same synergy will also encourage us to offer shortly a range of standard products. "" To be continued ..."
Qualipac: automation and innovation,"Yet there was no way of predicting in 1984, when the ""Auriplast"" entity was actually created that this company would become one of the French jewels of the plastic injection and surface treatment of the 2010s. Several economic slowdowns had not spared the historical company, Sauvagnat, who started in 1852 with the manufacture of wooden... umbrellas! And with the tenacity of a handful of entrepreneurs the ""new"" Auriplast finally emerged in the mid-1980s by specializing almost entirely in the plastic parts conversion and surface treatment sector to serve the perfume and cosmetics industry, a choice which had been partly made, ten years ago. Which was the right decision! As of 1984, the line is drawn. Six years later, the company integrates a second electroplating line. As of 2000, the factory takes advantage of large industrial investment plans initiated by Pierre Hemar, Qualipac's current President with increased injection and electroplating production capacities, not to mention the revamp of the pre-treatment station for liquid effluents. In 2003, it receives ISO 9001 v 2000 certification. In 2007, new automatic assembly machines are installed. And in 2008/2009, a expansion of the factory of more than 12,000 m2 is undertaken with a further increase of electroplating and injection capacities without forgetting a strong automation program (""robotizing"" would sound more appropriate) in the assembly shop. ""Clearly"", explains Raymond Lozano, the factory's Director, ""industrial performance, for us, is synonymous with automation, efficiency (no additional costs), quality (not scrap), availability (no stops), responsiveness (no delays), and integration of new processes."" The result: from €14 million in turnover in 1991, the factory will have achieved this year €70 million in turnover, along with a workforce increase of 140 to 560 and by converting some 1,700 tons of plastic each year! This is probably what will surprise people the most when they visit the premises: a constantly buzzing industrial environment. Whether you find yourself in the assembly shop or, at the corner of a hall you will discover a fully equipped workshop comprising state-of-the-art robotized machines assembling several parts of a capping system for bottles at impressive speeds. The situation is the same in the electroplating workshop where you will see racks, also previously filled with robots, automatically conveyed to various dip stations. ""Our innovation approach can be summarized in six points"", explains Raymond Lozano: ""Broadly, with new finishes, new looks and new material ... But also with new product functions (antibacterial, anti finger marks etc.), new design processes (more competitive, more innovative), with an ongoing commitment to find ways of reducing costs and deadlines, by expanding our current processes (colour electroplating, etc.), with new opening and conditioning systems."" And it is true that the plant in Aurillac like the other plants of the Qualipac Group can achieve about everything on plastic parts... Or almost everything! Marbled effects, 3D effects, effect pigments, metal over-moulding, antibacterial polymer, special lacquering, transparent metallization, (aged) ""Vintage"" effect, ""constrained"" opening systems for jars, advanced heat transfer etc. Caps and/or bottle decoration and finishing, boxes, spray-caps (which in particular, has been one of the factory's specialities for many years), decoration and finishing of lipstick and mascaras, skincare jars, Injection moulded inserts, Injection of massive transparent parts, bi-injection... It's a comprehensive range. ""Obviously it is also through the automation of assembly and decoration stages that we've made tremendous progress"", underlines Raymond Lozano. ""Be it with glass/plastic or glass/metal sticking, all screen printing and hot stamping possibilities, sublimation, laser engraving, embossed decoration."" Productive investment which shouldn't make us forget the huge sums invested in protecting environment. More than EUR 12 million in 10 years! ""It's normal"", underlines Raymond Lozano. ""We use sensitive products. Concerning air, there is a vapour vacuum system above the plating baths, connected to wet scrubbers, that treat vapours before discharging them. A accredited laboratory conducts periodic measurements. Concerning water, a new building was constructed in 2000 to secure the waste water treatment (station). In spite of a steady increase in production for ten years, there has been a significant reduction in discharges of polluting substances in water and a reduction of the water consumption per sqm processed in electroplating. We have also developed a new cyanide-free silver range. And we have an active partnership with our suppliers of chemicals to reduce the environmental impact of our activities (replacement of hazardous chemicals etc..). As for our electroplated products, they are analyzed by an accredited laboratory to measure their content in heavy metals (lead, cadmium, mercury and total chromium )."" Concerning this electroplating technique the plant is working on a new technique called colour electroplating ... However ""it's too early to talk about it"", we were told at the factory ""but undoubtedly, it will be ground breaking"". To be continued..."
"""Important investment underway,"" Guillaume de Demandolx, MWV","Premium Beauty News - Properly speaking, you are not a ""new comer"" in MWV organization! Guillaume de Demandolx - Not really, I have been in the company since 2005, joining in the US where I participated to the acquisition of Calmar by MWV and after that in some other growth initiatives like, for example, the acquisition Keltec, specialized in Airless. At the end of 2006, I moved to China to lead the company growth in the region where we have built a state-of-the-art manufacturing plant, fully operational since 3 years, producing both dispensing systems (pumps, triggers, airless) and folding cartons. Premium Beauty News - Looking to the world of ""dispensing system"" as a whole, including triggers, MWV remains today by far the global leader! Guillaume de Demandolx - You are right and it is always useful to remind it to the industry, as it reinforces our image of being ""the"" leading specialist of spray and fluid dispensing. Regarding the Beauty market, we are not yet the global leader, but we have become, under the leadership of Thomas Jonas, President, an active challenger and we are reinforcing our position a little more every year. The ""pumps and Airless"" share of our production of dispensing systems is becoming more and more important. Our development program and capacity growth for the following months is very significant, for both our plant of Barcelona and in China in our Wuxi plant. Premium Beauty News - Some capacity growth and innovation on the whole product range, including airless systems? Guillaume de Demandolx - Yes, absolutely! For perfume or cosmetics pumps and also of course for airless where you know our market presence is relatively new, after the acquisition of Keltec in Holland, but whose system (one-piece engine) has proven to be very well suited to the market demand. As for innovation, it remains a permanent objective for our teams. We will for sure surprise some next year. The development of Airless is obviously a key factor for us, either with our existing system or some other systems under development. Premium Beauty News - In the end, the crisis had little impact on you! Guillaume de Demandolx - It is true that the diversity of our range and our markets has help to create a relative economic stability and we have been quick to react to the crisis in restructuring part of our manufacturing footprint and our commercial organization. The company has a strong balance sheet, with important reserves of cash for potential investment (850 million dollars in cash!) so we have the means of our ambitions. But what is also important is that our global manufacturing footprint gives us a key advantage in being able to respond to the needs of our customers in whichever part of the Globe. Premium Beauty News - You also have the business of ""folding carton"" under your watch? Guillaume de Demandolx - A very active market for the company which now dedicates some of its teams and some of its manufacturing assets to the specific and demanding market of Beauty Personal Care. We have had a very strong growth in China and our new plant is now a major supplier of MNCs like L'Oreal, Unilever, or Kimberly Clark. In Europe we have also been successful in developing some new customers and provide a more differentiated and competitive offer. The production dedicated to the Beauty & Personal Care market is more and more concentrated in our plant in Poland with a strong development in our plant in Russia. The manufacturing and the service for the boxes and folding cartons remain to be an important growth driver for the company."
"The French Packaging Council wants to promote ""the best of packaging""","The CNE is composed of eight boards including consumer goods companies, producers of packaging materials, packaging manufacturers, companies approved for the collection and recovery of waste packaging, distribution companies, consumer associations, associations for the protection of the environment and local authorities. Premium Beauty News - Firstly, packaging seems to suffer from its poor image? Environmental issues obliterate the benefits of packaging in terms of product protection and preservation? Michel Fontaine - That's the whole problem, exactly. And that's surely why the role of the National Council of Packaging makes sense. It's from the start, its vocation. My predecessors have done a remarkable job delivering technical analysis and reports on various issues, particularly concerning prevention and reduction from the source. From that starting point, we must attract consumers again by compensating the negative image of packaging waste with the numerous qualities and advantages of packaging before and during consumption. The ""sustainability"" of packaging must also be explained like the ongoing efforts of the entire industry to continually improve them. Finally, this approach must be part of a European vision since issues and actors are mostly European. Premium Beauty news - Precisely, what will be the actions undertaken this year? Michel Fontaine - We must continue the elaboration and dissemination of ideas currently addressed in the working groups of the National Council of Packaging, pertaining to concepts of ""acceptability"", ""rupture points"" and ""prevention indicators"". Because these works are representative of the legitimacy of the CNE. We must in addition develop a positive and ""sustainable"" communication policy. This means updating the website, developing and distributing a newsletter, making interventions in schools, universities, Chambers of Commerce and Industry ..., not to mention participating to professionals conferences. Premium Beauty News - And next year? Michel Fontaine - It seems obvious enough, but what is essential is to really be ""European minded"". Which means we must actively participate to the Regulatory work at both French and European levels and therefore bring our vision and expertise to authorities. Premium Beauty News - Because there are still a number of misconceptions about packaging? Michel Fontaine - It's true that globally the business is suffering from its poor image upon general public. But are people aware that plastic in packaging only represents 1.5% of our oil consumption! Do people know that the victims of the earthquake in Haiti were largely saved by the massive supply of mineral water kept in plastic bottles?"
Spurting raw material prices might threaten the European flexible tubes industry,"In the first half of 2010 the European flexible tubes industry recorded up to two-digit increases in order income, depending on the requested tube diameters and tube types, says the European tube manufacturers association (ETMA). ""At present production capacities are well utilized,"" says the association, which also notes a trend towards short-term orders with smaller lot sizes requiring an enormous flexibility from tube producers. Nevertheless, ETMA members are rather confident that tube deliveries will have exceeded 10 billion units again. ""In some European countries even quantities comparable to the good 2008 results might be possible."" However, the positive development of the demand in 2010 is accompanied by ""huge raw material price hikes."" According to ETMA, these rises clearly threaten the industry. The association says that from June 2009 to June 2010 oil prices increased by 23 percent and aluminium prices by 40 per cent. The prices of the plastic materials PE-LD and PP rose by 53 and 64 per cent respectively and that of paper by even 77 per cent. The rise of raw materials is obviously passed on haulage contractors, lacquer, printing ink, closure and cardboard producers. According to ETMA, the pressure is becoming dramatic on the European tube industry. Other associations of plastic converters, in France, in Germany and in the United Kingdom have recently expressed similar concerns. ""The raw material price developments in the last twelve months are now drastically squeezing the European tube producers' margins. This is a major problem for the industry because in any business reasonable margins are a precondition for securing innovativeness, sustainable production and necessary investments in new technologies,"" says Martin Hintz, the new President of the European tube manufacturers association."
"Peter Pfeiffer, Aptar: ""Innovate, convince, persist!""","Premium Beauty News - Could you please tell us more about the major restructuring your Group went through recently? Peter Pfeiffer - As you know, the creation of Aptargroup was the result of the spin off of Seaquist from the American Pittway Corporation and at the same time the acquisition of the Pfeiffer company in 1993. Seaquist included at that time several other companies, most of them at least from the beginning focused on manufacturing of dispensing pumps and aerosol valves, in particular for the perfume, cosmetic and personal care industries. Companies at the time were Pfeiffer, Valois, Perfect, Emsar. Over the years we have become an undisputed leader with the market share of 30 % to 80 % depending on the market we are serving. We gradually diversified into other sectors often related to the same business with new products like for instance closures. Other companies from France and from abroad specialized in upscale plastic injection (MBF) components have been acquired. Most of all these companies where competing with each other on the market. The market had changed considerably over the past ten years. It had become global and huge ""customer"" Groups had formed. So we had to fundamentally change the very structure of our Group in directing teams towards what was the essential purpose of our business, namely, ""markets"". That's the reason why we started a few months ago a strategic realignment which led to the creation of Aptar Beauty + Home, Aptar Food + Beverage and AptarPharma. We have always been driven by the desire to better serve our customers, first by constantly improving the understanding of their expectations and secondly, by anticipating market trends. Our ambition is that this new organization will facilitate the relationship with our customers and will offer them a wider product range in all three segments. This new strategic step will allow us to continue our growth in the long term and consolidate our leadership in our industry. Premium Beauty News - How many people does this realignment directly concern? Peter Pfeiffer - More than 2,000 people are concerned throughout the Group. It is therefore an important task which has been undertaken. A task, which is as a matter of fact, being implemented smoothly and which will be completed by the end of the year. 2010 will be the transitional year between the former and new Aptar. You mustn't forget that this new organization aims to reinforce our ability to better identify the expectations of our markets and to implement them quickly under the form of new innovative dispensing systems fully adapted to the needs of our customers. Premium Beauty News - Innovation is one of Aptar's main assets! Is it still possible to innovate in your segment? Peter Pfeiffer - Quite true! Innovation has always been the driving force behind our business. We have placed innovation at the heart of our strategy by continuously strengthening our R&D organizations and forging a strong and durable network of partners. Of course, it is still possible to innovate in this market. And Aptar Beauty + Home will continue to focus on developing innovative dispensing systems. It is clear that this new organization aims at providing our customers with unprecedented levels of services and quality products, even higher than the ones they were expecting from our former brands. Premium Beauty News - A few recent examples in terms of innovation? Peter Pfeiffer - It's very difficult to make a choice. But, however, we can mention the latest developments in terms of samples and promotional products with the Travel Fragrance range which has seen recently the addition of the Travel Spray which allows consumers to use their favorite fragrance in all circumstances. We can also name our irresistible pump. An innovative pump that participates to the sustainability of health care products, and cosmetic products by avoiding contamination. The patented valve ensures protection of the formula while optimizing the pack's reliability. But innovation can also consist in updating a former innovative product. This is the case with ""Eternelle"", the bulb atomizer guaranteeing a totally new and unrivalled locking device. Note that, on production lines, manufacturers can directly mount the bulb on the bottle of perfume. Premium Beauty News - When will pumps be designed with electronics inside them? Peter Pfeiffer - You know it already exists! And we've worked hard on this issue. This is certainly the technology of our century. But in this area we must give time to time. It must match market needs. Times will come. Remember our famous valved closure ""simply squeeze"" for ketchup-type products. It took ten years for it to impose itself. Premium Beauty News - Your Group eventually worked its way out of the crisis relatively serenely! Peter Pfeiffer - We have the chance of being very diversified and we supply the whole planet. We're operating in the perfumery, cosmetics, but also the food industry, pharmaceuticals and household products. We provide highly dynamic country like China, Brazil and India. A market offsets the other and vice versa. If the first months of 2009 were particularly harsh, the last quarter of this year and the first six months of 2010, on the contrary, kept us very busy. Overall we were down by only 11% during the year 2009. This does not keep us from being very vigilant for the coming months. Premium Beauty News - Your group is listed in the stock market and can therefore be subject to any potential market fluctuations. Yet, contrary to received ideas concerning the ""short term"" strategy often imposed by these ""markets"", Aptar has built and continues to build itself on the long term. What is your receipt? Peter Pfeiffer - ""Markets"", as you say, in this case our shareholders have always understood the benefits of having a long-term industrial strategy. This is what has ensured and will ensure the sustainability of our Group. Wet must be persuasive and persistent. The pharmaceutical sector, in particular, has taught us that. Premium Beauty News - There is bound to be some markets in which Aptar is not operating yet? Peter Pfeiffer - Depending on the technology we manufacture, I think we are operating almost everywhere. We do not have an acquisition strategy based on the sake of ""growing for growing"". It must be in line with the acquisition of new technologies and new markets. But it's true there are some segments where we have an interest in increasing our presence. The make-up area is one of them."
Sleever international taps into make-up,"Premium Beauty News - What can you tell us, in a few words, about your group and its philosophy? Eric Fresnel - A few interesting facts to start with! Sleever International, it's approximately 1,000 people working virtually in every corner of the world in truly ""multi-specialists"" industrial and commercial sites for a turnover which will this year exceed EUR 150 millions. Sleever International has doubled its business in ten years. It is true that an unrelenting quest for innovation and industrial rigor are behind Sleever International's thirty-five years of growth, enabling us to raise the sleeve concept (thermo-shrink plastic label) to the rank of a major technology. Founder of the concept and owner of Sleever® brand name, Sleever International has constantly nurtured this technology through a spectrum of expertise from chemicals and engineering to transformation and service. As a result the sleeve today represents a solution of its own. Note that for example our manufacturing plant of mono-oriented film in Toulouse has tripled in size in ten years time. The sleeve concept has convinced the most demanding pharmaceutical, perfume and cosmetic brands. While at the same time constantly enriching its features: decoration, labelling, customization, tamper-evident seals, Sales promotion and traceability… What is very important is that Sleever International is becoming a leader on the market for high value added solutions. This accurate analysis of each marketing, technical and economic issues takes shape through our extensive experience of sleeve technology, backed up by the various entities that are part of the ""Sleever System"". Sleever International includes Sleever Technologies® for films, Sleever-Studio® for prepress work, Sleever-Labels® for label converting, Sleever Machines® for shrinking, and Decosleeve® for contract packaging solutions. They all represent the varied facets of the expertise we offer our customers, backed up by a commitment to results: the Sleever® Charter. Keeping our word is more than a company value, it the foundation of our philosophy: establish long-standing relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees. Premium Beauty News - What makes the sleeve unique is that in a single 3-dimensionnal media it combines all together four functions: decoration, information, protection and promotion. Éric Fresnel - Unique, you are so right! And that's surely why our product caught the attention, among other industries, of the cosmetics industry for whom we set up, four years ago, a dedicated team. The issues this industry has to address are often linked to the small size of the products, their sometimes complicated shapes, with their elongated aspect too. Quite obviously and in particular make up, the richest segment in terms of novelties in cosmetics, relies on packaging innovation to move upmarket and propose novel methods of application (powder shakers, eyelid roll-ons...). Nomadic formats, jewel boxes, duo concepts, gentle shapes ... Everything is made available to fulfil women's desires for changes. To meet the specific needs of brands, for example, in make-up, we have developed highly efficient solutions in terms of print quality, precision in decoration, shape constraints, communication surface, special effects, tamper proofing, range effect and packing optimization. Premium Beauty News - This clearly concerns make-up pencils, lipstick tubes, lipgloss or mascara. Can you give us a few examples of applications? Éric Fresnel - Exactly! And believe me it was not easy to adjust to the proper speed and accuracy the horizontal machines, which were specifically developed for such applications. Concerning the products that are currently on the market in this area, I will name the Biotherm, Cacharel and Shiseido products, but also Schwan Stabilo or Faber Castel, leaders in the manufacture of make-up products. To help us achieve these designs, we have a Sleever-Logicpak machine offer with multipurpose Combisleeve® machines with a wide range offer to treat colour cosmetics unstable by definition on production lines, and with complex shapes. As far as films are concerned, we have technical films, white injected, light barrier, etc.., low density and / or with extremely low thickness (30 microns). We also offer revolutionary finishes, with duplex printing and specific feels, tactile effects, and why not olfactory sensations. All this is made possible using the new Helioflex technology developed by Sleever International. Premium Beauty News - A ""machine"" offer combined with a very large offer in film processing! Éric Fresnel - It is true that the beauty sector is very interested not only in sophisticated printings but also in tactile effects and even olfactory sensations which currently our dedicated research teams are able to offer. Premium Beauty News - A currently unavoidable question nowadays, what is your response in terms environment? Éric Fresnel - Our environmental approach, started as of 2001 around VOC-free* inks, then with TPE-G low-density films in 2005 and then biodegradable films in 2008, is based on a very simple idea: being that the best packaging solutions - future solutions are the ones offering the most limited impact on the planet throughout their life cycle. This explains why we have invested so much. The launch in 2008 of Biosleeve®, a biodegradable sleeve solution, has strengthened our offering in terms of sustainable development. We have also developed a new printing technology, Helioflex, with new generations of UV water based inks to further minimize the impact of packaging on the environment. Premium Beauty News - You will be attending MakeUp in Paris. What will be the highlights of your participation? Éric Fresnel - We will stage the full palette of innovations Sleever® can bring to the cosmetics market: decorating solutions for the most creative shapes, or for small size products (3 mm in diameter), with a customization capacity for very large volumes at high speed (300 strokes per minute), or for small series or even collectors' items. Will be also showcased, all the tamper-proof solutions offered by the sleeve through the full range of possibilities in terms of protection and security. At the same time, innovations in terms of printing solutions (mirror, ...) or 3D-effect (Skinsleever) stimulating the consumers' senses and thereby getting closer to them, will be highlighted. Surprises will also await visitors, with animation we have specially set up on the occasion. So we sure hope you will come and visit us at MakeUp in Paris!"
PAK 2000 focuses on four growth issues,"""At the start comprised of thirty upscale paper bag manufacturers a decade ago in Europe, the market extended currently to almost sixty suppliers due, of course to the development of the market itself but also because of the arrival of new companies often built up by people coming from former businesses,"" explains Eric Blanche from PAK 2000. The result is an increasingly competitive market where difference quite obviously lies in experience, quality and deadlines. ""In this battle, we have maintained our position very well,"" says Eric Blanche, ""thanks to our excellent network of industry partners scattered mainly in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, which have acquired a unique expertise and are able to develop appropriate techniques to make even more beautiful and attractive high quality paper bags"". Yet the last year's crisis struck hard the entire profession with a fall in demand that reached at times 30% in Europe. ""Our sales network in France, Germany, England and Italy, and our presence in North America, globally supported by our development team based in Lausanne, have helped us absorb this shock wave and not only meet market demands but also be there when the market turned around,"" explains Eric Blanche. Each year it is nearly 200 million bags [1] that come out from PAK 2000's factory, a quarter of it to supply the higher-end segment. ""In such conditions, our development prospects are obviously huge"", believes Eric Blanche. ""Especially since many of our current and potential customers haven't yet taken full advantage of the extraordinary potential of the bag as a vehicle for communication and as an image media. Of course we do our best to convince them and when it's the case it works! Especially as we offer the top level in printing and accessory quality"". Clearly, it's the company's focus for the five years to come is: – Guide the brands in their choices so that paper bags become real vectors of image and communication. – Continue to develop industrial capacity bearing in mind cost control. – Capitalize on our capacity to innovate, improve responsiveness and the array of available responses. – Further develop solutions for environmentally friendly products. ""Concerning this last point"" explains Eric Blanche, ""we are developing a brand new eco-friendly packaging line by exploiting the possibilities offered by materials and accessorization""."
Toly benefits from its development in the airless segment and in India,"Premium Beauty News - Your strategy in the airless packaging segment appears to be fruitful. Andy Gatesy - Since our investment into airless packaging in South Korea, TAP - our airless business - is growing rapidly. Our focus is upon innovative standard packing with easy customization. We have developed over 20 standard lines since we started this business, including for instance, double walled packaging for the high-end market; hi-tech packs including shut off nozzles, and innovative packaging such as dual airless and airless packs with specially designed applicators. We are not just another pump company but a packaging specialist and we are bringing to our customers all our creativity in this segment. For instance, we have recently invested in an automated assembly machine for airless pouch containers. French beauty brand Lancôme has taken advantage of this new technology within Toly in order to launch Genefic HD, its new men's line. Lancôme has also launched new piston type packs with Toly for their lines of 'Renergie Microlift' & 'Blanc Expert'. In the pipeline are many other prestige launches for luxury brands using our airless technology. Premium Beauty News - What do you think can still make the difference on the cosmetic packaging market, where there's a fierce competition? Andy Gatesy - Toly as a group has changed a lot over the past 5 years. We have expanded from one European factory focused upon compacts, to investments in 4 separate manufacturing locations in Malta, China, India and South Korea. In addition, our product portfolio has been diversified across make up, skincare, fragrance and promotional items. Creativity is inherent within our organization. We challenge ourselves continuously to come up with new packaging concepts, application systems and production techniques. Even in times of recession, when many companies have cut back their investments on innovation, the Toly group launched more new concepts than ever before. Being a privately owned company, we still have the speed and flexibility to follow the changing market in order to make the relevant investments. Premium Beauty News - What is the outcome of 2009 for your company, and what are your forecasts for this year? Andy Gatesy - 2009 was a challenging year for the Toly group. Our customers sold less product and also undertook a massive de-stocking exercise. We also ended our long-term alliance with Geka Brush mid way through the year. Despite falling business levels, we increased our customer base worldwide and continued to diversify our product portfolio. We launched a stock smooth torque lipstick mechanism; we launched our own lipgloss and mascara strategy, and we focused upon creativity and customer satisfaction. Our factory in India took off, with many new products for the local market. We are the first Western packaging company to set up in India for the make-up industry and we really have a state of the art factory based in Dehradun This strategy has been rewarded and after the first 4 months of 2010, our business is increasing dramatically. Business levels are up across all our market segments and we are now investing heavily in capacity to meet these new production requirements. Ten new moulding machines have recently been ordered across the group as well as new decorating machines and automations. We are also looking to strengthen our position in new markets such as Eastern Europe, China and South America and I am confident that 2010 will be a great year for the group. Premium Beauty News - Does your business stop at packaging? Andy Gatesy - We still see ourselves as a packaging company and we do not offer filling services. Instead, we prefer to support the fillers in the different markets such that they promote our packaging to the brands. Should we offer filling services ourselves, then we would create more competition and continue to blur the separation between packaging and formulation specialists."
Seen at Luxe Pack New York,"New High Glass introduces at Luxe Pack New York a new line of airless packaging. Available in 50ml, 100ml and 150ml, the packaging features unique styling and clear dust caps, the company says. New High Glass Inc. is a total packaging supplier for the cosmetic, food and pharmaceutical markets. Headquartered in Miami, FL, the company has warehouse facilities in Florida, New Jersey, California, Mexico City, Guatemala and Colombia. Global Packaging Inc., in addition to its wide selection of airless bottles in both commodity and prestige presentations, is featuring a new selection of airless jars in various sizes and airless tubes in 30mm and 35mm diameters. Global Packaging Inc. is California-based company and is a certified Minority Owned Business. With headquarters in the Los Angeles area, and manufacturing bases located in Asia, the company specializes in a broad product line of plastic packaging components comprising of extruded seamless plastic and laminate tubes, airless pumps, bottles and jars. Dapy Paris has designed and developed a cube-shaped fragrance diffuser for Editions De Parfums Frederic Malle. The body is injected in tinted red ABS with a shiny gloss finish. ""The Éditions de Parfums Frederic Malle"" logo is raised on the left side. At the front, an on/off switch allows an aluminum cone in black to diffuse the fragrance. In back, there's a light that indicates the battery's energy level. The base is injected with tinted black PP. Two cavities are located beneath the base–one to insert the fragrance refill and the other is for the rechargeable batteries. Four silicone feet positioned under the base provide stability for the cube. The diffuser features two possible drive positions: pressing the switch once results in two continuous hours of operation and pressing twice, the diffuser works intermittently every 30 seconds for four hours. Small bottle, massive volume. Small is Beautiful. These are the themes showcased by Geka during Luxe Pack. On display will be the company's new ""magicRuby"", a bottle that can be filled with up to about 9 ml of lip gloss. The injection blow-moulded bottle offers a much greater volume than injection moulded bottles, the company says, thus creating space for lip gloss and individual design ideas. Also highlighted at Geka's booth is Lip Definer Max, a collaborative effort from makeup artist Michele Burke and Geka described by the company as simple, ergonomic and practical. ""This power lip gloss loader achieves even lips and precise contours at a glance,"" Geka says. According to the company, the secret of the application is its shape, inspired by the ""pinky finger"" of the Hollywood makeup artist. Now, the tool yields a tactile quality to the application that feels like touching your own lips. The flexible, soft flocked applicator is a patented creation of Michele Burke, exclusively produced and distributed by Geka. During the seminar series, Alcan Packaging Beauty provided testimony on its sustainability achievements and goals from eco-design to its carbon offset program. Since 2002, Alcan has implemented a vast range of eco initiatives to reduce its standard plastic tube's carbon footprint by 35%. Details ofAlcan's sustainability initiatives are available at a dedicated website, www.theartofreduction.com"
Pochet invests in its range of customizable bottles,"""New proportions"", explains Lucie Ray, Industrial Marketing Manager, ""have come in addition in order to enrich our high-end collection of bottles and jars carefully playing on details like sharps edges, heavy weighing glass and beautiful distributions which will find their place in our customers higher end and selective lines "". Premium Beauty News - Is it a new strategy you have developed in order to increase your presence in this segment of high-end standard bottles? Lucie Ray - First of all, we prefer using the term ""customizable bottles"" to the term ""standard bottles"". We have already been offering customizable bottles for some time now, but we want to keep on improving our ranges in this area that we believe in line with the market. It's a question of offering new sizes and new proportions based on our most popular generic forms allowing a fragrance or cosmetic usage of these ranges, depending of the selected universe, by offering our customers the Pochet quality, with a level of requirement identical to the one involved for our specific designs. Each brand operating whether, in the perfume, care or make-up industry can find what it's looking for and add its personal touch and creativity to it. What we are also putting forward, aside from the financial benefit of choosing such ranges because of the economy related to tooling costs, is also and above all the saving of time it represents since all products are immediately available, against three to six months development required for a specific bottle, this may well be a strategic move considering the current environment. It is also a guarantee of flexibility since our bottles offer many different shapes (cylindrical, square, rectangular), which can be combined together and also because the minimum quantities to be supplied are well below those of a specific bottle. Then, customization with many possible finishing techniques available in-house, make it possible to completely customize bottles and jars to create ""the family spirit"" between the different chosen models. These product lines are anything but standards: they are high end bottles extremely versatile since they were designed to meet our customers ideas; we can engrave them, decorate them, give them a new collar, produce them using a stained glass, make them heavier… Premium Beauty News - Precisely, let's talk about finishing techniques. For your bottles, you have been proposing the ""Speed Picture"" for several months,. Are there already some applications available?

Tubes: European producers remain cautious,"According to the members of Etma, the European tube manufacturers association, the year 2009 ended on a 5.3% drop compared to the previous year, that is to say a production of 9.65 billion tubes compared to 10.2 billion in 2008. According to Etma, this production drop cannot be completely attributed to a reduced level of consumer consumption. The tube manufacturers' customers would have amplified the phenomenon ""by rigorously cutting back stocks"". The crisis affected the various markets for tubes in Europe differently. That's the cosmetics industry, which is the largest market for tubes with a share of about 40 %, was particularly impacted, with a fall of 8.5 % in this sector alone. The pharmaceutical industry, with a fall of 6.2%, and the relatively small sector for household and industrial products, with a drop of 7.4 %, were also significantly weaker in 2009 than the previous year. By contrast, tube consumption for toothpaste remained almost unchanged and there was even a small gain of 0.5 % in the food sector. The different developments in the various markets were also reflected in different developments for the different tube materials. Despite a fall of almost 4.8 % in 2009, aluminium tubes just managed to exceed the 4-billion-tube mark, hence the most important type of tube in quantitative terms. According o Etma, the fall in the production of aluminium tubes is attributable for the most part to declining demand from the pharmaceutical sector and the depressed market for hair dyes. Weakness in the cosmetics market was the main reason for the production drop of 11.8% in 2009 for plastic tubes. Total production of laminate tubes just fellshort of the 3-billion-tube mark. ""Nevertheless, despite the crisis 2009 proved to be something of a small success story for the laminate tube with 2.9 billion units produced, an increase of slightly less than 1 % year-on-year,"" Etma says. Even though the economy has shown a small amount of growth in the first quarter of 2010, Gregor Spengler, Etma's secretary general is not sounding the all-clear just yet. ""I still cannot see any clear signs of a sustainable economic turnaround, although there has been a slight increase in demand from core markets, partly due to new products and partly as a result of relaunches. And customers are also again stocking more tubes. Growing confidence among European consumers is being tempered, though, by increased unemployment and the possible negative effects of austerity programmes of European governments. It is thus not possible at this point in time to make a serious forecast regarding the development of the tube markets in the second half of the year,"" he says."

A brand new spirit for Hermann Koch,"It is undoubtedly a different spirit which has been driving the Hermann Koch company these past few months. Who doesn't know Hermann Koch? In almost one hundred years of existence, the German SME has earned itself a solid reputation for reliability and quality in the world of cosmetic packaging, with 22 million euros in turnover, and 195 staff. As regular as clockwork, the firm based in Coburg produces about 365 million plastic jars per year to supply most of the major brands of cosmetic products in Europe and worldwide. ""Not only jars"", insists Florence Cox, Sales Director. ""We also have a solid reputation in the manufacture of plastic bottles, sticks and roll-on"". ""Lines of premium quality products, of course"", explains Christian Lutzenrath, General Director, ""but it is clear that the world surrounding us is always expecting more innovation."" Upon his arrival late 2008 to head the company, the tone is set: ""We have to get moving and innovating!"" And it doesn't take long! New designs, new shapes, new decorations: marketing and development departments are packed with new ideas. ""Especially since the existing production tool, where we have three bi-injection machines and where we fully master the technique of in-mold labeling, allows us to design very beautiful things"", underlines Christian Lutzenrath. As a result, the German company displayed at Cosmoprof Bologna not only a brand new look but also new lines of jars and bottles, including a line designed with bioplastic."
L'Oréal relies on innovative suppliers,"On the 7 and 8 April, L'Oréal organized two open days in collaboration with five suppliers invited to the group's headquarters to present exclusive packaging innovations. At L'Oréal, we are told that this internal event, which put in direct touch decision makers and suppliers, was for the group the ""starting signal"" of a new kind of approach regarding relations between L'Oreal and its suppliers, with as a main principle an ""amplification of the collaborative process"". The operation named ""Cherrypack"" is in any case a first for L'Oreal group, where people are convinced that the ability of providers to offer new technologies, develop innovative solutions or to integrate environmental criteria are as many key factors taking a part in the success of launches carried out by the group. Concretely, five suppliers of international dimension - Alcan Packaging Beauty, AptarGroup, Yonwoo, HCT, and Autajon - were selected by both the Purchasing Department and the Packaging & Development Department, to present their innovations. Overall, a hundred packaging innovations were presented to some 350 people belonging to the group (members of the General Management, International directors of brands accounting for 85% of the Group's turnover, R & D teams). However, this operation was not only aimed at reorienting and improving the relationship between L'Oreal and its suppliers. Very specifically, it was also to allow the Group to set up a differentiating offer which would anticipate consumer expectations. Among the innovations on display some of them will therefore be retained for future developments that L'Oreal wishes to roll out on the market in less than a year, as exclusive products of course."
Tag-System by Lumson: four years of research,"250 employees, 22 injection machines, 3 air-blown injection machines, a Pump assembling department, 5 decorations departments, EUR 30 million in turnover last year (against EUR 33 million in 2008) but a forecast of 38 million for 2010, the firm is typically the very picture of the Italian packaging industry comprising most essentially family-owned SMEs. Created in 1975 with as a first goal to market cosmetic containers, Lumson operated a first important shift in 1985 when it decided to start producing them. Six years later, the company was designing its own models and was developing its first standard ranges in glass and plastic. In 1999, again another shift with the start up of the first manufacturing and assembly line of dispensers for body care products and in 2003, the company launches its first cosmetic pump. ""Our USP (Unique Selling Proposition) is to offer complete standard cosmetic packaging collections, decorated and ready to fill"", says Stefano Focolari, Marketing Director. ""For us a complete collection means that from one design we develop both plastic and glass bottles and jars in different sizes, with different kind of closures and pumps, that can be combined from other designs or collections, and of course a wide range of decorations to customize the product in different and creative ways. Obviously, this creative process requires time, and this is why we only launch one complete line per year"". Lumson can currently rely on twenty complete standard packaging lines, all of them with original design, and more than a hundred different accessories. ""One of our slogans is: 'make it easier for the customer',"" says Matteo Moretti, CEO, ""we offer a 'Full package Ready to fill' service. A formula that has encountered quite a lot of success, and that's even getting increasingly popular, lately there has been a growing demand for a360° full service"". An example of this successful formula is the latest product launch done by ICIM, an Italian company that, with its trademark ""Bio Nike"" is a leader in the production and marketing of cosmetic products dedicated to the pharmaceutical channel, that has chosen Lumson packaging for its line ""Defence Body"". As a matter of fact, the entire line of products for body care ""Bio Nike – Defence Body"" will be launched on the market using a standard packaging collection fully designed, manufactured and decorated by Lumson. For ""Defence Body"", which launch will be supported by a massive advertising campaign, Bio Nike's management team has selected the packaging out of twoLumson's standard collections: ""Collezione Indy"" and ""Collezione Victoria"". Oval accessories that match the shape of the bottles by following the overall design, pearly green or translucent colour tones and decorations like shiny silver hot stamping and tampo printing were chosen to create ""a complete product line, with a uniform and consistent image, recognizable, fresh, professional, reassuring and elegant"". For the Anti-cellulite 2 different packaging solutions were chosen from the Collezione Victoria: a 400 ml bottle with a flip top cap for extensive body applications and a 200 ml bottle with a pump for more targeted applications. For the Moisturizing oil was chosen a 200 ml bottle in translucent PET from the Collezione Indy with a pump. The Breast Firming Cream is offered in a 100 ml bottle from the Collezione Victoria, with a pump for a targeted and precise application. ""It's to meet growing demand from a number of our customers,"" explains Matteo Moretti, ""that we decided to get involved in this airless project. Obviously, product formulations becoming more and more sophisticated were calling for such a system. Formulas were also more fragile with more sensitive ingredients. Organic products were getting more and more popular. On the other hand, existing airless systems weren't fully satisfying, both in terms of complete preservation of contents against external agents but also in terms of full product restitution. Finally, on an aesthetic point of view with theTag-System we were able to combine the beauty of a glass bottle with all the technical and functional advantages of an airless system"". It took four years to develop theTag-System concept, an airless system with a pouch combining both a glass container and an extruded pouch. A patented manufacturing process which looks in fact like a preformed with a rigid collar and a flexible body. Another smart device, is the ""Eco-Lock"" system which allows you, after total product dispensing, to unscrew the pump and separate the entire dispensing group and its plastic parts, from the glass bottle, this allows an easier recycling of the product: glass with glass and plastic with plastic. ""Finally, underlines Matteo Moretti, while we were at it, we also decided to invest in a new decoration, only possible with our Tag-System. It is called Glass Enhancer and it consists in applying a water lacquering inside the bottle to enhance the beauty of glass. This is only possible because the formulation inside the pouch never gets in touch with the glass. So there is no contamination risk associated with the lacquering. Furthermore we developed another innovative decoration that we called: Mirror Effect, thanks to the use of a metallic lacquering also applied inside the bottle, we are able to offer a glass bottle with a metalized/mirror effect in the inside. In addition to the three lacquering/varnishing lines installed at the Capergnanica plant, we just added a new line specifically dedicated to this unique decoration process"". ""And as you know, it's this airless container that Collistar, a leading Italian cosmetic brand, recently chose for the launch of its new product, 'Perfection Serum', which is part of the anti-ageing line, Perfecta""."
An innovative two-in-one lip product wins WorldStar Award,"Presented by the World Packaging Organisation, the WorldStar Awards are the pre-eminent international awards in packaging. US-based manufacturer of cosmetics packaging, Topline Products, in cooperation with L'Oréal USA, has won the WorldStar Award for Packaging Excellence in creating a chrome package for the L'Oréal Paris Infallible Lipcolour Vogue Limited Edition, a two-in-one lip product that innovatively houses two colour cosmetics products, side by side. The airtight Topline package for L'Oréal Paris consists of a lip colour vial and a propel/repel slim-line tube, containing a conditioning topcoat, housed together in a sophisticated looking metallized shiny silver casing that also functions as a mirror for application. The consumer first applies the lip colour, waits for it to dry, then applies the topcoat to seal in the colour and moisturize the lips for a longer lasting result. A number ""1"" and number ""2"" are debossed on the tops of the lip colour and topcoat respectively to readily indicate the order of usage. Because the two products are held together in the casing, they cannot be separated or lost. ""We created a package that's both practical and user-friendly, yet exhibits a chic, premium look - a huge advantage in the extremely competitive mass market world. In working closely with L'Oréal, we developed a truly revolutionary design. The WorldStar Award is a confirmation of this remarkable achievement,"" said Charles Chang, Topline Products president. The colour of the silkscreened plant graphics on the front of the casings, plus the colour of the cap and lip vial, match the shade of the product within, allowing customers to easily identify which shade they are choosing."
A marking from inside the glass!,"Premium Beauty News - Your company is almost a start up! Xavier Costet - That's right, TrackInside was created in 2007 to meet market needs by developing and marketing the new Naginels® technology from the 5th and 7th Framework Programs of the European Union. Hence, our technology benefits of more than 5 years of research.

The other major advantages of the marking are :no microcracks, no additives, a marking inside the material with a diffractive effect and a very high resolution which allows the miniaturization of 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm data matrix codes. The laser marking technology itself, offers many advantages: no consumables, low energy consumption and optimum reading of the codes. Premium Beauty News - You are obviously interested in the beauty industry! Xavier Costet - This technology fully meets the requirements of the perfumery and cosmetics industry in terms of traceability, authentication and anti-counterfeiting. Each vial may be marked with an unalterable mark inside the material, guaranteeing the visual authenticity of the product (control by the buyer). We can also add to the marked information a coded and hidden element to ensure the consolidation of data and of the anti-counterfeiting aspect (control by the authorities). You can compare this internal engraving to a watermark in the glass that we call Filiglass®. With our partners, we can also manage the integration of our technology on the production line. We can also perform evaluations and small batches with the equipment available in our laboratories."
HCP to start new Mexican plant,"2010 is to mark a milestone for the group headed by Jeff Chen as HCP starts up next March, its brand new injection plant in Mexico, the fifth of the group (three in China and one in the United States). HCP Mexico is located in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, near the U.S. border. The plant initially having 110 employees and 8 injection molding, machines will cover 10,000 m2 of buildings. Eight new air-blown injection molding machines should come into operation before the end of the year as well as assembly and decoration machines to design vials of mascara and lip gloss. The facility will also manufacture jars and make-up cases and will be equipped during the year with a polishing line and a vacuum metallization workshop. The new plant, which reinforces the internationalization of the group outside China, comes at a time when HCP prepares to celebrate its 50th anniversary ... A amazing performance for this company of Chinese origin which remains to date the only one to have decided to exploit fully the internationalization of its production tool to support locally its key customers. In 2004, HCP took over its current U.S. plant in New Hampshire. A strategy that seems to have paid off, since six years later the company is moving to Mexico. Meanwhile, it was inaugurating its third plant in China. HCP is one of the few industry players in the processing of plastic parts for the beauty industry to have invest as much in times of economic turmoil. To note eventually, that recently the company was awarded with the Supplier Excellence Award a prize granted each year by P&G."
Collistar chooses Lumson's latest airless,"Named ""Tag-System"" (for Techno Airless Glass System), Lumson's new airless system features two major innovations: a glass container and a patented manufacturing process for the extruded pouch, which looks like a preformed with a rigid collar and flexible body. That is precisely the container that Collistar, a leading Italian cosmetic brand, recently chose for the launch of its for the launch of its new product Perfection Serum, which is part of the anti-ageing line Perfecta. The management team of the Italian manufacturer of cosmetic packaging products has nick-named the system Eco-Lock, due to the product's two functional characteristics: – A tamper-evident feature, thanks to a blocking system between the pump and the inner pouch that avoids the tampering of the bottle once it is filled in and helps protecting the product. – The ""Eco-Lock system"", which allows unscrewing the pump and extracting the full separation of the plastic components from the glass bottle, in order to recycle glass with glass and plastic with plastic. The packaging is therefore fully recyclable and ecofriendly. Lumson also proposes a wide range of decorations, in particular what they call, on the one hand, the ""Glass Enhancer"" that implies water lacquering of the inner of the bottle in order to enhance the natural beauty of glass and, on the other hand, the ""Mirror Effect"", through a metallic lacquering of the inner of the bottle. ""In brief, explains Lumson's CEO, our new airless container combines the tremendous aesthetic and environmental advantages of glass, with a perfect suitability with high viscosity formulae, a product restitution rate exceeding 95%, and the fact of being a very simple product with a very practical top filling system, and eventually the fact that the pouch and the container can be separated easily to facilitate the product recyclability, and that the pump can be used in any position. And, I was just about to forget the cost issue! It is a very competitive packaging. The beauty of the glass bottle, the techno advantages of the airless system and the ecofriendly attitude were the main issues for Collistar to choose TAG-Techno Airless Glass System. In addition to the container itself, we also customized and decorated the entire Collistar product using a dark blue water based spray colouring and a shiny gold hot stamping on the bottle, gold UV metallization on the pump and dark blue colouring on the overcap hot stamped with the Collistar logo on the top"". The Tag-System is available in the follwing sizes: 15, 30 and 50 ml."
VPI relies on eco-design and innovation,"The launch of the new line of R'PET caps for perfume illustrates the underlying objectives of the eco-active strategy begun by VPI, a French company specialized in plastic injection. ""Our positioning is to be a source of proposals, for our customers by concentrating all our innovative efforts on substitute materials which are at the same time, eco-friendly, cost effective, efficient and marketable"", explains Gilles Pauget, President of the company. In this context, VPI has chosen to prioritize the use of R'PET a recycled material resulting from PET bottles collection. According to VPI, because of its high quality in terms of brightness and transparency, R'PET offers aesthetic results compatible with the cosmetics and perfumery sector requirements. Depending on the options chosen by the brand owners, it is possible to display or not, on the packaging, the fact that the product is made out of recycled PET. ""In other words, brands have a wider scope for their communication. In fact, according to their marketing strategy or to their sustainable development policy, they can highlight or not the fact that the material comes from recycling"", the company declared. With 3 kg of CO2 saved for every kilogram of R'PET processed, VPI is convinced that this type of material provides an ecological advantage. But its use was not that obvious in the first place. VPI had to learn first, how to master the processing of this material ""which was not originally intended for plastic injection"". Currently, the range of available R'PET closures offered by VPI includes covers for cosmetic jars like the one designed for the Naya movement, perfume caps, pump covers , collars or boxes, either in standard or specific shapes. Keeping the same logic, VPI has designed boxes with recycled polycarbonate from collected car headlights as part of the WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment). This is very much part of VPI's innovation policy, the company having undertaken the creation a large portfolio of projects, including in particular the Ice cube project approved by the Pole of Competitiveness Plastipolis, which focuses on the development of the three layer injection process for the production of massive parts made from Surlyn offering a perfect look. Some other projects concern ceramics charged injection, glass molding or 3D in mould decoration (IMD 3D). These projects, which are backed up with shareholders' equity or by a joint investment with clients, represent more than half the company's investment capacity, ie 3% of its turnover, which should reach 12 million Euros for the current fiscal year (ending late April 2010), ie an increase of 5% over the previous year."
Gianfranco Ferré goes beyond transparency with Surlyn,"The design for the bottle and cap of ""In the Mood for Love"" was created art director Fabien Baron, and is described as ""clean, architectural and fluid"", and has been created to be reminiscent of the female form. Their colour - white - is the emblem of Gianfranco Ferré's style and is said to evoke a spirit of purity of love. Gianfranco Ferré Profumi's new fragrance has as a floral ambery woody scent and is available in three sizes (30ml/1 oz, 50 ml/1.7 oz and 100 ml/3.4 oz). It was when seeking to replicate the glossy white appearance of the lacquered glass bottle, that ITF Cosmetics S.p.A., the Italian company responsible for handling the creation, development and worldwide distribution of Gianfranco Ferré Profumi fragrance lines, approached the French perfume packaging specialists Qualipac S.A. for assistance in recreating the cap's design using polymers. ""It was clear from our discussion with the customer, that in light of the thickness of the cap and the requirement to cost-effectively match the appearance of the bottle, that Surlyn would be the material of choice for this application,"" recounts Christophe Benigni, development manager at LMA Packaging (part of the Qualipac group). ""By adding a colorant to the Surlyn ahead of moulding, we were able to produce a part with the same gloss white appearance of lacquered glass straight from the tool. This is in direct contrast to alternative polymers such as polypropylene, which require the application of a lacquer to achieve a comparable surface finish and appearance."" The chemical resistance of Surlyn to the ingredients contained within many of today's fragrance was a further benefit of the material in terms of its long-term appearance. ""In contrast, polymers such as copolyesters are more susceptible to chemical surface attack which, in turn, can lead to visual defects on the surface of the moulded part,"" explains Dupont in a release. The thick-walled, injection-moulded cap was produced in a single shot without the need for additional post-moulding operations."
Stora Enso announces new board for high-end packaging,"""The development of new Ensocoat shows our dedication to always meet the needs and expectations of the highest end of packaging, such as cosmetics, perfumes and exclusive chocolate, wine and spirit brands. Ensocoat reputation already shines high on these market segments. By improving the attractiveness asset of our flagship product our clear ambition is to strengthen our position on the luxury niches, which we consider as highly strategic"" says Hervé Vue, Sales Director France, Stora Enso Carton Board. ""In a tough economic situation, brand owners are looking for options. We have responded to this demand by putting all our effort into the development of new Ensocoat. We are pleased with the results and enthusiastic to be going to the market with the product."" The development project for new Ensocoat started in early 2009. ""We carried out several trial production runs on the board machine at Imatra Mills to achieve the desired board profile and consistently high quality from batch to batch. In parallel with the production trials, we conducted printing trials in close cooperation with leading high-end package converters. The results and the customers' comments have been solely positive,"" says Ari Tanninen, Market Support Manager,Stora Enso Carton Board, Finland. The development project focused both on the visual appearance of the board as well as packaging performance. Optical properties have been improved, including whiteness, brightness and a bluer shade. The new Ensocoat offers the best reverse-side smoothness and whiteness available in the market. Within this new Ensocoat range, the 2 sided-product, known on the market as Ensogloss, is now branded as Ensocoat 2S. ""Ensocoat 2S benefits from all the same advantages as the new Ensocoat and , what's more, on both sides,"" Hervé Vue says. The product launches are backed up by an extensive marketing campaign. ""We are introducing a new logo for Ensocoat, and the images have been taken by the world-renowned photographer Andrea Klarin. Anyone who deals with design and branding should have a look at the website www.storaenso.com/ensocoat,"" encourages Hervé Vue. The new Ensocoat will be presented at the PCD exhibition in Paris January 26-27 and shortly after at ProSweets Cologne 2010. Stora Enso will also participate in Luxe Pack 2010, October 20-22 in Monaco. *** Ensocoat in brief – Category: solid bleached sulphate board (SBS) – Substance range: Ensocoat 170-380 g/m2, Ensocoat 2S 190-500 g/m2 – Typical applications: cosmetics and luxury packaging, chocolate and confectionery packaging, wine and spirits packaging, pharmaceutical packaging, graphical products – Produced at: Board Machine 2, Stora Enso Imatra Mills, Finland"
LyondellBasell launches PET-alternative for cosmetics packaging,"The Rotterdam-based polymers producer has developed a new resin that could be a valuable alternative to PET-based cosmetics packaging. According to LyondellBasell, the Metocene RM2231 resin combines excellent transparency with the typical attributes of polypropylene-based copolymers, such as flowability, thermal and impact resistance, and recyclability. According to LyondellBasell, the new resin can be considered as a replacement for amorphous and transparent polymers used in cosmetics applications, which are traditionally the domain of injection blow moulded PET. ""We were able to combine the clarity and gloss of PET with the density and recyclability advantages of polypropylene,"" claims Bernd Schütz, marketing manager for Metocene resins at LyondellBasell. LyondellBasell also argues that its new resin is a more cost-effective solution than PET for applications produced using injection blow moulded technology. The Metocene RM2231 resin does not require pre-drying and the high processing temperatures associated with other resins such as PET, thus allowing converters to ""save time and energy costs, thereby improving the overall economics of the process,"" claims the company."
Sleever dresses Jean-Paul Gaultier's limited editions,"With two different gift sets, featuring a 20ml bottle of Classique for her and a 40ml bottle of Le Mâle for him, it was also the first time Sleever International had undertaken to work on such large formats for the brand. Sleever International had already illustrated its know-how in the up-market perfumery sector in the field of miniatures. However, with this project for Jean-Paul Gaultier, the group provides confirmation that sleeves can be adapted to all sorts of sizes and shapes of bottles, whilst continuing to meet the exacting requirements of the luxury sector. These bottles are the fruit of Sleever International's dedication to full service. To carry out this project, Sleever International opted for a 7-color rotogravure cello-enamel printed SI-PET-TG/050 film. The group selected inks that withstand alcohol, thereby ensuring that the visuals remain stable should they come into contact with the fragrance. Sleever Studio was entrusted with the anamorphic work carried out on the generously shaped and complex bottles, particularly the parrots, to ensure that no deformation occurred after shrinkage. Decosleeve was in charge of dressing the bottles."
Airless pumps: a market growing in sophistication,"It's no surprise, such a dynamic market is attracting new players. Latest to date, the Toly company that produces this kind of packaging in a joint venture with a Korean company which led to the creation of Toly Korea. The drive is the same with the company Cinqpats that uses the technology developed by German Megaplast to design a new range of standard bottles. Among the current leaders on this segment, the Airlesssystems company, which is owned by the Aptar Group, recently presented band new lines: – The Auriga range, available in sizes of 15, 20, 30 et 50 ml, which offers a combination of material (PP, PP frosted, SAN). Auriga allows a variety of finishes through the use of different techniques: coloration, silk-screening, hot stamping, offset, heat transfer. The collars can be coloured with one or two shades using the dual-injection process, anodized silver or gold, shiny or mat. This high end airless system with a piston is convenient for face care formulations, necklines eyes contours, in the form of gels, creams or serum. – Aura's prestige Airless packaging designed for cosmetics using highest technology is currently available in 50 ml, 30 and 15 ml variants. This pack is recommended for selective cosmetics: anti-aging care products, concentrates of bioactive natural substances, real alternatives to cosmetic surgery. Concerning Quadpack/Yonwoo, the company has developed Visoanska's latest model which combines in the same pack a cream and capsules for internal and external treatment. This new concept is a three chamber single bottle. The upper part containing the cream is an airless system ensuring maximum protection for optimal use. The bottom part is closed by a turning base which allows the consumer to extract one by one the food supplements. At Rexam, the group has had encountered big successes recently, particularly with its airless Prodigio. For instance Oriflame, one of the world's fastest growing direct sales beauty product companies, has selected Prodigo – the lotion dispenser equipped with the patented system CleanPoint Technology - for its anti-aging cream day / night North For Men. For Oriflame, the product was customized with a silver actuator and a matching tank. ""Through elimination of drips, clogs and product contamination, Prodigio offers true consumer benefits"", said Virginie Lemeunier, Product Manager - Lotion, Rexam Personal Care. The neutrality of this 100 percent recyclable lotion pump is ensured by the use of polypropylene and polyethylene components. There is no elastomer or metal in contact with the lotion. Further, the Prodigio is designed to dispense precise dosages of fragile, viscous formulations, such as those used in anti-aging creams, thanks to wider internal channels, the pack can also withstand high-speed atmospheric filling and other processes. Concerning Megaplast, the German firm adds new sizes to its top-fill lines in time to be shown at this year's Luxe Pack show in Monaco. Megaplast has introduced 20ml and 40ml sizes to its Micro line of dispensers which has a dosing of 0.3ml. This brings the number of sizes in the range up to five, including the already existing 15ml, 30ml and 50ml containers. A new container of 100ml has also been added to the Mezzo line of dispensers, the older sister of the Micro, which has a larger diameter and a dosing of 0.8ml. ""This larger Mezzo size helps skin care customers looking to bottle body care products and is also a good choice for hair care applications,"" says Lucyna Silberstein, President of Megaplast. Adding the new sizes, therefore, creates greater variety for existing personal care customers as well as widening the potential client base for the company. The airless packaging market continues to grow as manufacturers release improved formulas that require better packaging. Although the economic conditions are challenging, mass-tige products are faring well. People can treat themselves to better products easier than a new car or vacation. Small pleasures help people cope with the current economic conditions. With the French company Lablabo, the EasyFoil pouch used for its pouch Airless system for cosmetics and pharmaceutical products has won an Alufoil Trophy 2009. A major advantage of the pouch is the protection of the product against Oxygen and UV lights. And the viscosity of the product has no negative effect on the ability of the pump to dispense precise dosages. The EasyFoil pouch consists of an aluminum multilayer film PET/ALU 12 microns/PP or PE (depending on application) rolled and welded around a superior ring and an inferior plastic cup. The pouch, is suitable for both highly viscous and highly fluid alcohol based-products. It is equipped with a precise airless metering mechanism (+/- 5%) even when it is actuated upside down. The dispensing system with no spiracle insures product protection when the pouch is not in use. The most common products for which it is used are alcoholic gels used for pharmaceutical products, particularly for transdermal applications. The use of alufoil is critical in these circumstances as it provides an absolute barrier to alcohol and prevents evaporation of pharmaceutical products, which often have a shelf life of two years. Another major contribution of the EasyFoil pouch to pharmaceutical and cosmetic packers is that filling is undertaken by gravity feed on any standard machinery. Another important operator, RPC Bramlage-Wiko. Among the products launched recently by the firm, one can note, the decorative versatility Magic SL dispensing system which has been underlined by its selection by Clarins in a stylish pack that incorporates a translucent plastic cap and an eye-catching aluminum band. Eye contour skin care products (designed to lift, firm and renew facial skin) are new in the Clarins Men range. Clarins required a dispenser that would ensure accurate dosing as well as complementing the classy appearance of the Clarins Men brand. RPC Bramlage-Wiko's Magic SL is designed to ensure the controlled dosing and hygienic application of creams, gels and lotions across a range of viscosities. The ingenious and easy-to-use airless dispensing system provides the required amount of product in one measure, avoiding the inconvenience of multiple dispenses, while its unique design is optimized for consistent performance. The container body is manufactured in transparent PCTG and then decorated with multi-color silk screen printing to achieve a glossy, luxurious effect. The cap uses translucent PCTG, allowing the dosing head to be seen within. The dispenser's eye-catching aesthetic is completed by an aluminum band – laser-inscribed with the Clarins Men logo - that connects the cap to the container. For ClarinsMen Eye contour skin care products, the Magic SL is supplied in 20 and 50 ml variants in light blue and dark blue colors. AirFree is a concept patented by Promens to obtain packages with no air intake. AirFree is based on a simple idea: no need to insert a pouch in a bottle (unlike a conventional airless system), just manufacture it directly in co-extrusion in a single operation. ""With a restitution rate of 95% to 97%, AirFree allows exceptionally high evacuation rates. A traditional (non-airless) bottle with pump will evacuate only 86% of a high viscosity cream"". said Promens R&D director Pascal Hennemann. This represents substantial economic gains for brands. AirFree allows high viscosity products to deliver a regular dose. The purpose of AirFree is to provide users of packaging comfort and security. With AirFree any form of bottle is possible. ""The user can easily locates the visual codes developed by each brand, which restrains the risks of confusion,"" says Isabelle Orhan, Innovation, Marketing & Research Director at Promens. AirFree is suitable for containers from 15 ml to 500 ml with transparent or opaque bottles. Airfree can be used in any position, very useful for the various applications to be performed by users of packaging: a direct and hygienic application with the packaging upside down becomes possible. Eventually, ""AirFree is a honest packaging"" says Isabelle Orhan. ""The packed quantity equals the evacuated quantity"". No over-filling, no empty volume, AirFree is concerned by requirements on environment and eco-design. Reckitt Benckiser's specific bottle for the Veet brand uses Promens AirFree system. Finally, one might remember that MWV Calmar has reinforced its presence in the primary packaging markets thanks to the acquisition two years ago of the Dutch company Keltec Dispensing Systems. Today MWV Calmar Netherlands contributes to the enhancement of MWV Calmar's personal care product assortment with its know-how and expertise in foamers and airless systems. Its range is composed of two foamers, Ocean™ H and Ocean™ T. Foamers, previously named HH and TT Foamers, as well as two airless ranges, Pearl™ and Luna™ Airless formerly known and Star and Light Series. Based on MWV Calmar's Rolling Bellow Technology™, Pearl™ Airless is a dispensing system for creams, gels and lotions. Offering a complete range of options with different closure diameters, bottle sizes and outputs, Pearl™ Airless is completely metal-free, extremely easy to actuate. Luna™ Airless is a way to dispense creams, gels and lotion products. Compatible with the most sophisticated formulas, Luna™ Airless is MWV Calmar's bottom-filled dispensing system."
Cinqpats: an innovative range of airless bottles,"Cinqpats' new airless line displays several innovations based on technological inputs from Gaplast in Germany and Tirrit in China. ""The pump manufactured by Tirrit using a design from Cinqpats [1] can be considered as one of the most performing pumps on the market"", explains Jean-Louis Mathiez. ""Its design allows an easy rise of product with little loss of energy. So it can dispense very viscous products or products with a sticky texture or even reasonably heterogeneous products..."" An actuator at the end of which is fitted a closure system is under development. The process implemented for the production of the co-extruded bottle (patented by Gaplast) helps keeping the inner pouch attached to two fixed points, at the top and bottom of the bottle, so the pouch contracts itself evenly avoiding product blockage. Hence, it guarantees a evacuation rate close to 100% with constant dosage from beginning to end. Gaplast has also developed and patented an industrial process consisting in the drilling holes in the outer bottle, preferably hidden under the collar, to help atmospheric pressure naturally shrinks the pouch during operation. After the bottle is blown a machine provokes a detachment of the inner pouch to guarantee the end user a fast priming of the pump. Eventually on the same machine, a re-positioning of the pocket is operated with a full control of internal bulk and air tightness. The pump-collar-actuator-cover set is assembled by the means of clips including a little trick to optimizes the filling costs. Once fitted to the bottle, it is totally impossible to remove the pump, which guarantees the airless quality of the product and avoids contamination, especially in the case of organic or paraben free products. A 30 ml bottle is already available in industrial production, a 15 and 50 ml bottles will be available early 2010, and the range will be completed by mid-2010 with 100ml and 200 ml sizes and 2x15 ml and 2x50 ml duos. There are many customization possibilities. ""With Tirrit, explains Jean-Louis Mathiez, we can easily adapt the shape and technical characteristics of the pump to specific products. With Gaplast, we take advantage of the flexible multi-layer technology which allows to render various aesthetic effects on the outer layer (glossy, transparent, soft ,...) and to obtain exceptional barrier properties of the pouch. With our cosmetic partners we can even offer a full service option with atmospheric or vacuum filling""."
Cosmoprof Asia 2009: the airless boost,"The small core of industrials producing airless pumps and that could be numbered, at first, on the fingers of both hands see themselves facing what is not yet a flood of competitors but could well become one. Some 500 million airless systems are probably produced each year in Europe, the annual growth rate approaching 15%, meaning that at this rate, the market will simply double in size within five years. Enough to attract anyone wanting a piece of the cake. But in fact, what is an airless system? According to the definition given by the Airless Pack Association, created by four majors of the global industry in 2009 (Rexam Megaplast, Lablabo, Quadpack / Yonwoo): ""An airless packaging is a non-pressurized, tamper-proof, dispensing system, combining a mechanical pump with an airless filled and sealed container, which delivers the product with no intake of air. The container is either deformable or rigid, with a piston or a pouch."" A simple and clear enough definition that still gives us a chance to grasp at the sum of technologies involved behind this kind of product. A container, a pouch (inserted or formed after delamination of a coextruded layer in the container) or a piston, a pump (not an ordinary one), often sophisticated systems to render this pump, specifically airless, a packaging process free from contamination ... the protection demanded by an increasing number of brands of health care/beauty products has a price. The first airless systems were adopted on a large scale by tooth paste makers in the mid '80s, for technical and marketing purposes. Then very quickly the cosmetic industry got something out of it....today, consumers are more than satisfied…for a number of reasons... The preservative agent will safeguard the microbial stability or avoid alteration of the ingredients involved in the composition of a cosmetic product once the bottle is opened. With the use of an airless system with an actuator or a pump there is no need to open the bottle, hence avoiding exterior contamination. This explains why the reduction or even the absence preservative agents is completely compatible with airless systems. Some preservative agents are known to be subject to controversial issues regarding their side effects on health. The airless bottle by preventing air oxidation preserves some sensitive ingredients from deteriorating, such as vitamin C, this is what happens when the container is opened. It guarantees maximum protection against bacteria and micro-organism (viruses, fungi, yeasts) and some allergens (pollens, spores, dust). In the end, whether liquid or pasty, whatever the formulation, its purity and efficiency remains right through. Piston or pouch, whichever system used, consumption is optimum, with no product waste. Dosage being extremely precise, can range from 0,1 to 3 ml and airless bottles can be used in any position including upside down, making them easier to use. The benefits of the airless system in natural and organic cosmetics are considerable. Taking good care of oneself without harming Mother Nature, is taking into consideration the principles of sustainable development through responsible consumption. The airless system meets this requirement with the use of natural less aggressive biodegradable substances instead of artificial substances. The system itself is made from recyclable material. But the change has also to do with the design that combines aestheticism and practicality to comply with choice criteria of all cosmetic products from luxury brands to mass brands. The European market estimated to half a billion unit per year keeps on growing steadily. Currently, several dual systems are marketed with pouches or pistons that can deliver two incompatibles or complementary products. Both pumps are activated by a single actuator keeping the two incompatible products separated until dispensing or, for two complementary products each pump has its own actuator allowing each product to be used in turns."

MWV focuses on flexibility and customization,"MWV's market-leading pumps, Aria and Prelude, are now reinforced with new aesthetics and design options. In addition, snap-on and screw-top versions are available with two new overshells (Convex and Silhouette) and two new overcaps (Convex and Cubic), which can be combined to deliver a specific look and feel to the pump. Further decorative customization is available with a variety of applications such as hot-stamping, lacquering and metallization. The Aria and Prelude products are capable of supporting a variety of formulations, including complex foundations, due to the advanced technology of the engine and inclusion of a PBT accumulator. All these combinations are available for the atmospheric version and for the airless range. MWV also showcased the latest developments of its fragrance pump solutions, still emphasizing the company's commitment to customization and flexibility. Leveraging the success of Melodie Clikit IP, MWV Beauty & Personal Care now enables brands to personalize the pump itself through advanced sublimation techniques, allowing the pump to play a vital role in the look and feel of luxury perfume packaging. Customers now have access to a variety of designs, decorative finishes and an unlimited colour range which can transform the fragrance pump into an integrated component of the final pack by matching its colour scheme and pattern to the brand's image. MWV has also announced the introduction of a threaded ferrule option for Melodie. This development allows the consumer to easily separate the pump from the glass bottle. In addition, to facilitate the use of spray caps in fragrance packs, MWV Beauty & Personal Care also debuted its new telescopic insert at Luxe Pack Monaco. ""A unique and flexible solution which can allow for an affordable and fast way of customizing the length of the extension required within the spray cap, helping customers reduce capital investments and increase speed to market for new projects,"" the company says."
Protection of trademarks: the beauty sector is lagging behind,"Are beauty products less concerned than before? According to Herlé Carn, Sales & Marketing Director at ArjoWiggins Security, taking a walk in the shopping streets of many countries is enough to prove that counterfeiting is far from having disappeared [1]. ""Yet, the new techniques developed are fully reliable,"" he told Premium Beauty News. Premium Beauty News - What are these new techniques? Herlé Carn - Prior to detailing the new techniques themselves, you must understand against what we are fighting ... One can distinguish four main plagues: counterfeiting, breaking in (the container to change the content), gray markets (or parallel markets), and, eventually, outright theft. Regarding the fight against counterfeiting, our response requires elements of authentication on three levels: – Level 1, visible and unambiguous elements for the consumer in the form of watermarks, holograms, optically variable inks. – Level 2, elements that are invisible to the naked eye but which can be revealed with a simple tool like a magnifying glass or a UV lamp (used by customs), and that can take the form of fibers, fluoforms (invisible forms bearing the colors of the brand's logo), hilites (pigments of different colors), threads, microtexts. – Level 3, concealed elements, undetectable without a dedicated reader (taggants, rare earths, DNA, tracers). Regarding the protection of the product itself in the sense of ""evidence of tampering"", we can supply manufacturers or printers with what is called the ""Synthetic Tamper Evident Substrate"", STES, which combines the function of evidence of tampering and authentication. It is impossible to remove the label without destroying it. The STES, which contains hidden security elements, allows authentication without destroying the packaging. As far as traceability (Track & Trace) is concerned, it is used to enable a better management of flows of goods and also to fight parallel markets. In this case, there are numerous technologies for the management of flows, such as linear barcode (most used), the 2D barcode, the combined barcode, RFID, including other systems such as cryptography, OCR, magnetic stripe, coding, engraving, ... The only big problem is that most of these systems can be imitated or duplicated! Premium Beauty News - If they can be imitated or duplicated, it is quite a nuisance! Herlé Carn - You are right! And that is why we created SecuMatrix with the help of the Domino company, one of the global leaders in the inkjet printing industry. SecuMatrix can secure a standard traceability system without disturbing the on line processes. You surely already have seen codes, often the date of manufacture or the expiry date, in small print on water bottles, soda cans, …Precisely that is industrial inkjet on production line. Well, without modifying the process, you just need to secure the ink. Authentication may then be carried out very discreetly on the field and, in the event of a hard blow, the brand holder will have an indisputable answer to assert whether the identified product was genuine or fake. It can also be the 2D code that is printed with security ink. It is undetectable without the appropriate reader and the chemical signature may be exclusive to the brand using it. This ink can be applied to any surface. Hundreds of millions of products are protected with this high security taggant but also banknotes or passports. We have not had a single counterfeit or a single ""false positive"" in 12 years, thanks to this chemical signature. Combining multiple techniques is the key to protection. Counterfeiters will naturally focus on products with little or no protection. It you look at labels on laptops, they are real banknotes but they are only authenticating an operating system. In all cases, we provide solutions - such as labels, notices, cardboards - suiting customized needs, and minimizing the impacts on the industrial line. The ""anti- theft"" device may also be embedded in an authenticating tag. Premium Beauty News - Actually, only the combination of different techniques would be efficient. Herlé Carn - Indeed. Let me give you two examples. In the field of labels, you can combine functions with the STES, ensuring the consumer that he is the first to open the box and allowing the authorities to check to the naked eyes, for the presence of invisible security elements without having to open the box. You may add the Bimetal, a great innovation in the world of holograms, which mixes alloys of aluminum and copper or gold, hence allowing a very innovative and extremely stylish authentication for perfumery and cosmetics. Combinations can even go further by mixing in the printing process of the logo the very concealed SpotTag. And why not a ""uncopyable"" Track & Trace system? For a folding box, the manufacturer can choose the option Securepack, a standard carton coated on 1 or 2 sides, with stylish grooving or iridescence effects, etc., and with elements for authentication, at the heart of the material, invisible to the naked eye (2nd level for authorities) or very concealed (3rd level) for field inspectors. And why not a watermarked notice (+an option for instant verification using a white marker that will reflect a red trace)? So, as you can see, the number of high security solutions available for brands wanting to protect themselves is impressive. It is our know-how accumulated during 200 years in banknotes that allow us to secure the forged manufacturer. And as you are about to raise the financial side of the subject, let me take the lead by telling you that security is not expensive and on the contrary can make you save a lot of money by limiting financial losses, eliminating the risks associated with the company's image or by monitoring those related to public health. We protect many reputable companies in virtually all sectors of activity (of course we will not give away any details to ensure the strictest confidentiality) and the cost often does not even equal 1 cent."
MBF for Victor & Rolf and Nina Ricci,"The two Dutch dressmakers Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren, have launched their new fragrance, called Eau Mega in a packaging that really ""takes one's breath away"". The old fashion style pear has been redesigned in a sort of ""Megamizer"" particularly original. It is the French company MBF, a plastic injection specialist which is part of the Aptar group, that managed this technological achievement by designing a pear composed of nearly 12 pieces assembled automatically. A real puzzle of injected technical parts to insure distribution of the product by pressing on each side of the brand logo itself. MBF also designed part of Nina Ricci's latest bottle and its metalized fuschia cap, the ribbon of which dresses the glass in a way that reminds us of the Fashion House... The bottle cap displays, a bi-material cap made of densified PP and Homo PP, a two part metal collar including a ""ribbon"" with an invisible bond line and a finish by vacuum metallization and bright varnish."
HCP USA and Belvada create a 'pen-style' mascara,"Belvada, a new name in mascaras, claim to have brought the first major change to mascara application in over fifty years, with the introduction of their new 'one handed' mascara. HCP have worked very closely with the Montreal based Beauty Company to develop the industrial design and manufacturing technology for a 'pen-style' applicator mascara. The 'one-handed wand' system features a slider mechanism that propels the brush out through a patented (pending) double wiper seal system, ensuring perfect product delivery with no clumping or wastage. Virtually no air is able to enter the formulation chamber during application, keeping the mascara product fresh and free from drying out. The pack ergonomics are completed by a 'twist-off' closure that can be clipped onto a button at the bottom of the pack during usage. The Belvada pack's finishing uses HCP's metallisation refinishing technology, with a gunmetal finish and a white silk screen printed 'Belvada' logo. Belvada entrepreneur Dov Grossnass has spent over two years developing the concept and packaging for the one-handed wand mascara. Dov's aim is to focus on the development of new, innovative, niche market products that excite the consumer and create real value. This new product, marketed as Mascara Noir, will be sold, initially, to selected salons, before rolling out to speciality stores."
Thibault Ponroy: taking into consideration the concerns of retailers from product design,"This is a new step for both, the former manager of luxury brands, and for the agency created in 1988 by David Nitlich and Elie Papiernik and dedicated to ""fine brands"". Thibault Ponroy [1] intends to give a new dimension to projects related to construction and transformation of brands, by integrating upstream, concerns from retailers and by supporting the internationalization process of the company. Premium Beauty News - What are the main reasons for this co-operation? Thibault Ponroy - In the first place it is a human adventure I have known David and Elie for nearly 15 years. I have had the opportunity to appreciate their talent when I was President of Guerlain. We worked together on great projects: Habit Rouge, Issima, Terra Cota, Aqua Alegoria, Divinora... We discovered we had quite a few intellectual affinities, the same vision of projects on the long term, the desire to do things of quality, an aversion for flashy stuff. So the connection was done quite simply. David told me about his project of international development and I offered my services. After that, things followed on. We signed our agreement in July and I arrived at the agency last August 24. Premium Beauty News - Specifically, what topics are you going to focus on, at the agency? Thibault Ponroy - Mainly, on two components. The first one is related the international development to which I am going to contribute using my own experience of international markets. The second component is related to my knowledge of issues linked to distribution. We also want to integrate ahead of projects the essential dimension of ""retail"". We have a saying in our business: ""retail is detail"". And obviously today, it is inconcevable to design a product without also considering its putting up for sale, its positioning on the shelves among other competitors. Centdegrés should soon have new strings to its bow with new jobs associated to categories such as management, merchandising, definition of assortments, CRM... Premium Beauty - News - It is rather atypical Thibault Ponroy - If I reflect on my career (almost thirty years in the cosmetic industry and its distribution), I realize that I have made changes in directions every six years. I like to join a company to solve issues, develop products, and take chances...I arrived at Helena Rubinstein's, when the brand was struggling on the European market. I took office in RoC to create retinol straight from the lab and invent new creams that have become the brand's best-sellers... Centdegrés attracted me because of its great potential, its people, and its projects. And also I made a choice that is priceless. The choice of freedom! Premium Beauty News - A few words about the Agency Centdegrés Thibault Ponroy - Like its managers, they are passionate people. About 30 of them. The creative pole has the characteristic of being divided into three sections that characterize the businesses of the agency: volume design, image, architecture. Centdegrés has developed a methodology of its own: co-creation. The principle is to integrate the client into the creative process. The work done with the brand Herborist, owned by the Chinese group Yahweh, is a perfect example. In 2006 the agency was consulted by this major Chinese conglomerate, which has a joint venture with LVMH. The challenge was to rethink one of the brands based on traditional medicines, Herborist, in order to seduce the Asian market but also the international market. The Herborist project went on for two years with many exchanges between China and France. One of the fifteen designers in the Herborist team in China even integrated for some time, the team of Centdegrés in Paris to end up with a ""fair"" creation that reflects perfectly the origins of the brand and its ancestral know-how. Centdegrés also designed the network architecture of 200 shops in China and a SPA of nearly 1,000 sqm in Shanghai. Premium Beauty News - What are in concrete terms the projects of the agency regarding international development? Thibault Ponroy - Last April Centdegrés opened an office in Casablanca and in May an office in Shanghai. The story with China did not start yesterday. David and Elie actually created their first structure in Hong Kong in 87. For years now the agency has been working for major actors of the cosmetics industry in Asia. The establishment of an office in Shanghai, managed by Cecile Devillers, will strengthen our presence with these clients. We will be able to better assist them in the development of premium brands for the Asian and international markets. In addition, Morocco is a country with a high development potential. Politically stable, not really affected by the crisis in the North African countries, the middle class is organizing itself and can prevail upon interesting intellectual elite who will build the country's economy for tomorrow. Premium Beauty News - What are the next steps? Thibault Ponroy - Our development focuses essentially on emerging countries. It is our ability to build major international luxury brands that interest them, our know-how the French way, the ""French Touch"". Centdegrés has indeed many references in the cosmetic and perfume sector such as: JP Gaultier, Givenchy, Dior, Guerlain, Lanvin, l'Artisan Parfumeur....etc."
Qualipac raises plastic manufacture to an art form,"Premium Beauty News - Qualipac has decided to exploit fully the internet tool to communicate with clients. Pierre Hémar - That's right! And we are all very proud. We actually took the time to work on this site because we believe it is a important way of enhancing our work. Premium Beauty News – What main principles guided you for the website development? Pierre Hémar - It was primarily to create a site that was at the same time accurate and sufficiently informative, aesthetic and very visual. To achieve this our marketing and technical teams worked with the Aesthete agency (may they all be thanked for their contribution) in order to leave a stylistic signature that could compare with what our clients demonstrate in this field, but with fewer resources. At the same time, we have, for example, paid special attention to the interactive chapter dedicated to standards which illustrates a group synergy with the bottles from Pochet. We also needed to underline the synergy between all the packaging offers of the Qualipac group ranging from the cap to the box or the glass (with Pochet) including plastic and promotional offers. Premium Beauty News – How is the site structured? Pierre Hémar - In fact there are several access keys. The first might be called ""Process"" which is more dedicated to buyers and developers, with a more technical classification by ""know how"". The second key, more product oriented, with a classification by product family should be of a more natural access to the marketing teams. A ""synergy"" chapter using an animation to display a fictional product showing all the skill areas of the Qualipac offer. Premium Beauty News – In the site's introduction, you compare your business with a genuine artistic spirit combining different materials to different forms and different processing technologies. Pierre Hémar - Absolutely, it's truly through the aspect of embellishment of material that we look at the ways of processing plastic in our factories. Finally, the best piece of advice to give would be to suggest visiting your website? Pierre Hémar - Absolutely !"
Codipack: new range of standard caps,"Premium Beauty News - For many companies in the plastic industry, times are tough. How do you cope with the current situation? Michel Cochet – With our main partner Pibiplast, plastic bottles, the beginning of the year was still positive in particular with the launch of the new range of PET bottles and service caps in PP manufactured by the Uriage Laboratory very active in the pharmaceutical sector. We have also worked on a new reference for Sephora to design a new 200 ml PET bottle for shampoo with a identified hinged cap. These are the 2 exclusive projects that were finished, all the other specific studies were postponed to 2010 or 2011. Activity on standard products is doing quite well and since June, we have noticed very high demand in order to condition bactericidal gels, the production of which is increasing to meet demand related to influenza A, H1N1. We are eager to attend the Luxe Pack show in Monaco to see what the trends are on the brand owners' side. Premium Beauty News - Industrial choices that your company has made in the past are now completely impacting your activity. We are refering to your implantation in Dubai. Can you tell us more about this tool and its assets? Michel Cochet - Yes, we have concluded a trade agreement since 2 years, with a new partner in the injection field in the perfumery sector. This plant based in the Emirates transforms mainly Surlyn (caps) and PP (caps and collars). The great advantage is that the factory is equipped with UV metallization, which means our customers can choose between a part, completely dressed, silk-screened or even pad-printed. This structure supplies mainly customers from the Persian Gulf, but also Europe. Our clients include: Parfums Benetton, Ajmal , Frédéric M, Arno Sorel , SODIP, Corania, Diamond Parfums, etc. With exclusive but also standard models the start range comprising 10 caps was completed this year with 4 new models: the ""canot"", the ""valentine"", ""the king"" and the ""bombay"". For 2010, 4 new models are planned. Due to a strong slowdown in the perfumery sector, the offer for standard caps, displayed on our new website, helps a little to balance the activity which is nonetheless reduced. Hoping for a recovery in June 2010!"
HCT's metal tips aim to revolutionise the skincare sector,"First to acknowledge the potential of these tips is global prestige cosmetics giant, Dior, whose internal innovations team worked closely with engineering and design teams at HCT France to develop a beautifully sculpted custom tip, bringing the exciting project to fruition this September. The injection moulded metal tips are designed to be attached to stock tubes, thus adding a touch of affordable luxury and unique functionality to essentially unremarkable packaging.

The HDPE/ LDPE tube is pearlised in custom Dior brand colours and is highly lacquered with hot stamped decoration."
Alcan Beauty Packaging not included in Amcor-Rio Tinto deal,"As expected, Alcan's Beauty and Personal Care division is not included in the deal. Amcor said that it had only offered to buy the businesses meeting the group's growth objectives in its strategic business areas of flexible packaging and folding cartons packaging. Rio Tinto stated the division would be divested separately, but did not disclose the identity of the potential buyer. The combined company will be one of the world's leading packaging companies with significant breadth of expertise, products and services. As at June 2009, Amcor generated AU$ 9.53 billion in sales from operations in 34 countries and has 226 sites worldwide, with approximately 21,000 employees. The parts of Alcan Packaging that Amcor has offered to acquire would add approximately US$ 4.1 billion in sales and 14,000 employees across 80 plants in 28 countries. ""This acquisition is a clear fit with our strategic growth plans, building greater shareholder value by expanding our business whilst obtaining the economies of scale that comes with an opportunity such as this,"" commented Ken MacKenzie, Amcor's Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals. Closing of the acquisition is not expected to occur for several months. Until this time, both Amcor and Alcan Packaging will continue to operate as separately run companies. Rio Tinto always said it has no intention of holding Alcan's packaging division. The group recently sold the Food Americas operations of Alcan Packaging to US flexible packaging supplier Bemis Company."
"Faber-Castell Cosmetics: the pencil, nothing but the pencil (for the time being)!","The German city of Nuremberg is the hometown of Faber-Castell, where are located its headquarters and the main production centre for cosmetic pencils, of this family owned group. Right in the city, in the middle of a park of several hectares stand together the century-old castle and the factory with its state-of-the-art production tool that produces each year some 100 million cosmetic pencils. Faber-Castell is actually an ""institution in writing instruments"", directed by Count Anton Wolfgang von Faber-Castell who has been chosen ""eco manager of the year 2008"" by the World-Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the German business magazine Capital. For Eberhard Brandes, managing director of WWF Germany, puts it: ""Faber-Castell is an outstanding example of how a globally active company can set far-reaching standards in social and environmental matters, despite growing market pressures"". The group, which will be celebrating 250 years of existence in 201, produces over 2,000 articles: black-lead and colour pencils, cosmetic pencils, artists' pencils and crayons, wax crayons and fibre-tip colouring pens, ball-point pens, highlighters and other office supplies, superior writing implements and desk accessories. 80% of the wood for the pencils grows in their own FSC-certified forests, run on environmentally and socially compatible lines. There has long been constructive cooperation between Faber-Castell and the WWF. The subject of biodiversity also gets increasing attention: the company's forests in Brazil are home to a growing number of indigenous endangered species of flora and fauna, in the areas left as natural woodland that now make up roughly 30% of the total afforested area. The company is also a pioneer in the field of environmentally compatible water-based paint for pencils. However, ""social and ecological commitment must also pay off"", points out Anton Wolfgang von Faber-Castell. The company's forests in Brazil are not only exemplary in matters of conservation; they also render the company independent of variations in the price and quality of wood from outside suppliers. The group's headquarters are heated partly with wood waste, while a water turbine provides 25% of their electrical needs. The savings in raw materials and energy, and the use of waste as part of the company's ISO certification, have contributed to continual improvements in the manufacturing processes and thus led to a containment in costs. Headed by Countess Mary von Faber-Castell and by Stefano Castelletti, the cosmetic business unit accounts for about 10% of the group's total turnover (some 450 million Euros). Faber-Castell Cosmetics has also widely communicated on its environmental commitment by launching last year the 'Truly Natural' range, a holistic ecological make-up concept for eyes and lips that puts high demands on contents and outward appearance. Apart from the formulation with up to 95% natural ingredients which is suitable for sensitive skin and meets the conditions of Ecocert, perfumes, preservatives, and talcum are not used. Moreover, the cosmetic pencils are made from FSC-certified wood and their protective cap is made from biodegradable materials. At the last Cosmoprof in Bologna, the German company was very prolific in showcasing quite a few novelties. With the Touch range Faber-Castell presented a highlight in decoration technology: the 3-D elevated graphics. This special technology rounds up products and their marketing concept: Whether Zen Deluxe with its bamboo design for liner or crystal lacquered with prism design for Pure Prism Lipglass. The 3-D elevated graphics add uniqueness and brand recognition to pencil design – visible and touchable. The Look range features several products to create a glamorous make-up: Pearlpower, an eyeshadow range with sophisticated iridescent shimmer. Lightweight, long-lasting and waterproof. Glitterpower with its diamond sparkles leaves a high luster and long-lasting effect on eyes and cheeks. While Powderliner is a non-oily, powdery and lightweight eye and brow texture with a silky smooth glide and long-wearing properties. Punk your eyes features a range of chubby liquid liner in a modern, provocative design and application. Under Care Faber-Castell united convenience in formula and packaging with smart solutions for a perfect complexion and for neat summer nails: The Skin-retouch specialist rejuvenates and illuminates the skin. The Advanced line smoother is enriched with wrinkle smoothing Dermaxyl® and vitamin E for a visibly smooth complexion and exceptional skin feeling. Lip Triple combines a lip plumping base with skin priming properties and colour with satiny shimmer. The 2-step nail prep with its integrated file combines innovation in packaging and formula and conditions the nails to be ready for manicure. The Flip-Flop Feet concept consists in 3 different products: a Luminous Nail Brightener, Nail Renewal Oil and Refreshing Nail Care which provide pedicure in a flash for neet summer nails. Also, and more recently, the Quick Eye Styler - a liquid Eyeliner with carbon black. This water-based formula glides on perfectly creating an intense, crease-proof line. The slim and soft brush tip provides a precise lining in one easy stroke. Not to mention Minerals, an eyeliner formulated with waxes and oils of natural origin for sensitive eyes and contact lens wearers. It contains minerals salts that act like cell energizers and Bisabolol that helps nurture and care the skin. And finally, Diamond Lashes, a fine mega-shine glitter gel to create a jewel-like effect. A multifunctional styling polymer provides hold and silky, lightweight feel. Dries fast, raises lashes optically when applied above the lash. With factories in Germany and Brazil, Faber-Castell Cosmetics offers pencils as well as cosmetic applicators.""We have a wide range of products and packaging options"", explains Stefano Castelletti, ""and what is important is our reactivity to market requirements. We make life easy for our customers by supplying the finished product ready for distibution out of one hand"". Eyes, lips, face…., the group is also active on the nailcare segment. ""Nothing says we won't go any further"", admits Stefano Castelletti, ""capitalising on the know-how and versatility of the writing instruments technology. At the same time the opportunities in new applications in the colour cosmetics segment are also very attractive … "". In all cases, the group does not exclude external growth strategies and partnerships to conquer new markets."
"""Full service just cannot be improvised"", Laurent Dodet (Fareva)","It has been nearly 2 years now that Farevacolor, Fareva's business unit specialized in production of makeup, left the nest. A logical step in the development of the Fareva group explains Laurent Dodet, its Vice-President: ""We were already very active in the cosmetic industry, in a broad sense with not less than eleven production plants in France at Tournon (aerosols, aerosols with a pouch, bottles, perfumery, toilet waters, eaux de cologne), Neuvic sur l'Isle and Bergerac (aerosols, tubes, sticks, rolls-on, jars, bottles), Quetigny, St Quentin Fallavier and Gemenos (hygiene products in bottles, sachets, wet wipes), Nontron-en-Périgord (effervescent bath products in the form of tablets, beads, crystals, pebbles...), Bernay (hygiene products in bottles, perfumery, aerosols), Savigny-le-Temple (personal care products in tubes and bottles, and for make-up, lipsticks, compact powders, foundations, mascaras, gloss, nail polishes). Follow our factories overseas: in Saint Petersburg (hygiene products in bottles, rolls-on), in Turquey (hygiene products in bottles, aerosols, aerosols with a pouch), in Wales (hygiene products in bottles, personal care products in tubes, bottles and jars) and in Ukraine at Uzhgorod (bottles, aerosols, tubes, jars. Perfumery, toilet waters, eaux de cologne)"". This industrial tool helps Fareva group display for this year EUR 300 million in turnover in the cosmetic segment, for a global turnover of EUR 750 million achieved by the group if all the other activities in the pharmaceutical, household products and industrial sectors are included.. On the site of Tournon, this month, Fareva is inaugurating a brand new laboratory with a staff of 3, fully dedicated to the development of natural and organic cosmetic products. ""Formulating..., producing..., filling..., has always been our vocation, underlines Laurent Dodet, and we have always taken the necessary steps to serve the best way we could our customer markets. With Farevacolor, we have added yet more strings to our bow as we offer to begin from a brief or even sometimes from a blank page to design the product from A to Z, from the marketing concept to the development and final delivery of products. We must constantly be a source of proposals"". According to Fareva's Vice President, the face of the beauty industry has changed dramatically over the past five years. ""Total outsourcing has made its way in all minds and we were able to adapt. But it is a mistake to think you can simply improvise on the Full Service market. Quality and service must be faultless. We are not entitled to make mistakes. This is one of the reasons why we invest a lot in research & development (50 employees in R&D at Savigny le Temple) and certification. Regarding the later subject, I must point out that two of our sites will be certified by the FDA later this year"". A point of view that probably gives an answer to the question whether Full Service is synonymous with offshoring in low costs countries, Laurent Dodet answers clearly: ""No. If we were to produce in the future in more distant countries, we would do this without having to relocate"". The Farevacolor unit is composed of 42 people and will achieve a turnover of about EUR 36 million in 2009. ""The Cosmoprof show, April last, was a chance for us to present more than 20 formulations and collections created by our Makeup Artist, Ice and Illusion. The work of our R & D laboratory is paying off in terms of prospective. We have showcased real product innovations on the Lips, Eyes and Complexion segment. These innovations where very much appreciated by customers, several of them were requested for an application of exclusivity. Products originating from these innovations are to be launched in 2010 and 2011 but I can't say more as these projects are confidential,"" confides Laurent Dodet. After a range of sun makeup unveiled in June, the Fareva team will organize a home presentation of new products. To be continued..."
"Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics: ""Colour is a means of expressing its individuality""","EUR 183 million in turnover last year in the cosmetic segment, 2000 staffs around the world, and over EUR 9 million spent each year in R&D, this is the quite impressive business fact sheet of Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics, a division which accounts for 49% in the total of the group. ""Undoubtedly we are today the world leader in the cosmetic pencil production, with a global market share that can be estimated to 40%.,"" insists Jörg Karas, Executive Vice President Research and Product Development. Six million Euros! This is the investment implemented end of 2008 in Weißenburg (Germany) for a brand new facility housing about 50 plastic injection moulding machines meant to improve the company's know-how in these techniques and to develop new products. Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics GmbH & Co. KG recently finished the official registration and setup of its Representative Office in Shanghai, which is in full operation since July 1st, 2008. The office is conveniently located in the heart of Shanghai's business district on West Nanjing Road, and with its fully equipped showroom makes for an ideal meeting point for customers in the Asia Pacific region. ""Development"", for over forty years the German group has made it its trademark. It all started with a ""marker"" used by surgeons to delineate on the skin the various points of the operation area. Schwan-STABILO cosmetics, in a few years, is going to built a reputation as an ""always copied creator,"" explains Jörg Karas. ""Opening up new market segments requires not only sophisticated products, but also user-specific positioning. That is why Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics develops product concepts for individual consumer groups over and above simple contract manufacturing. Our customers are inspired to open up growth areas in the cosmetics market through targeted product benefits and design based on our comprehensive understanding of the consumer. Globality means variety. After all, every culture has its own aesthetics and way of expressing itself. Colour as a means of expressing individuality is in this respect a source of inspiration for us. In Western Europe, Japan or the USA – the objective ageing of society contrasts with a subjective spirit of youthfulness,"" he details. From the pencil to the mascara there was really only one step, that Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics took two years ago. ""We manufacture mainly formulas and we buy our bottles and brushes on the global packaging supplier market"", explains Jörg Karas. The Group's offering includes the following ranges: - Colour Cosmetics, a make-up line that provides the right pencil for every application and every market in decorative cosmetics. Four different product categories and close to 40 basic shapes are combined with over 10,000 colours, more than 200 different textures and various caps, applicators and designs. - Colour Plus stands for decorative cosmetic pencils with added value, a variety of clearly defined additional benefits – for example, a plus in terms of care or in terms of ecology or in terms of function. - Skin Treatment is a range of integrative active-agent cosmetics for the most diverse applications in facial skin care, and is also available in a special men's line. ""For each optic the fitting nuance: our standard program offers with its 10,000 colours almost every desired shade,"" Jörg Karas explains. ""With the eyeliners alone, the colour black is available in more than 50 different gradations"". Just as colours are decisive for the appearance and effect of every make-up, its wear and application are strongly influenced by the texture. Whether creamy smooth or precisely contouring, whether densely coating or naturally translucent, whether waterproof or heat resistant, whether extra long-lasting or especially non-changing: the substantial attributes of cosmetic pencils depend on their constitution. Above and beyond their primary attributes, the effect of textures can be increased in terms of both appearance and function with various additives. Whether for today's surface effects like glossy, pearly, metallic or matt or for functional product enhancement through the integration of conditioning ingredients, innovative additives give the classic make-up pencil multifunctional added value. Cosmetics pencils have developed from simple leads encased in wood into complex products: innovative packaging and application systems make it possible to use fluid ink, water, oil or viscose-based textures. The more challenging the texture, the higher your packaging requirements are. ""Technologically advanced solutions and our experience with a wide variety of application systems ensure that intelligent contents are suitably packaged at Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics,"" Jörg Karas says. Packaging at Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics refers not only to the individual cosmetics pencil casings; it also encompasses their transportation and outer packaging. The in-house Design and packaging development department also specialises in developing and creating individual packaging concepts to meet customers' wishes, including blister packs for Point of Sale, dispatch pack samples and special labelling. If desired, our cosmetic pencils can be equipped with a whole range of user-friendly application add-ons. For blending, dotting or shaping, application-oriented mini-sponges and brushes make applying makeup that little bit easier and more convenient. The range of caps is just as individual: different shapes, colours and materials ensure a cap that is tailor-made for the pencil. Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics also aims to lead the race on the environmental side. At the basis there's the responsible handling of energy and natural resources: – cut back on peak power consumption, thanks to a relevant organisation of the manufacturing process, – intelligent recovery of energy, using for instance the waste heat resulting from the production of compressed air to produce hot water. – 94 % of the company's waste are recycled or used, while the rest is disposed of using environmentally-friendly methods. – waste air containing solvents is almost 90 % purified using a combination of biological processes that is virtually unique worldwide, and exceeding legal requirements. – waste water is 90 % purified using a three-stage physical process, without any addition of chemicals, and can then be fed into the local waste water treatment plant. Regular independent analyses confirm the water quality. Eventually, as a manufacturer of wooden pencils, Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics, also minds about the sourcing of this material. The company is a member of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and only use certified timber."
Luxury Lips : red is forever,"Did you know that gloss was invented in 1928 during a film shooting in Hollywood? Did you know that in the aftermath of Second World War the diameter of the lipstick itself, became identical in size to 12.7mm cartridges? Did you know that the colour of lipstick worn by elegant women in Versailles, was an indication of their rank in court? You will learn about all these facts going through the 200 pages of the soon-to-be-published book, Luxury Lips, written by Jean-Marie Martin-Hattemberg, expert in the 20th century Perfume Industry heritage, the preface of which will be written by Serge Mansau and the editorial coordination will be managed by Anne Camilli. With a collection of over 400 lipsticks, Jean-Marie Martin-Hattemberg, unveils for us the extremely wealthy life of lipstick, intensively developed and commercialized thanks to the Hollywood stars, during the interwar years. According to Jean-Marie Martin-Hattemberg, ""Hollywood being the sounding box, of women's emancipation and liberalization, lipstick remained one of the most stunning examples"". Luxury Lips will enchant you with pictures of mythical, strange or rare lipsticks, shaped like matchboxes, or dressed with gold and precious stones, or picturing Marylin Monroe and many others. From then on, lipstick will keep on developing, transforming and adapting itself as for instance, the market launch of the first lipstick for men created by Jean-Paul Gaultier. And then there is the ""lipstick index"": barometer of cosmetics consumption. According to the ""lipstick index"" the steady increase in sales of lipsticks tends to reveal recession periods."
Let cosmetic pencil sharpeners become iconic!,"With a turnover of about EUR 8 million, half of it coming from the cosmetics sector, Eisen, which was founded in 1921 is the epitome of German SME. Eisen employs 60 staffs at the German factory and 100% owned daughter company in China with hundred more, hundred in producing solely for the Eisen stationary range. ""Today, creating a pencil sharpener, explains Christian Eisen, is primarily mastering the art of manufacturing the steel blades: our factory in Baiersdorf fproduces some 200 million units annually. Then it is to have a significant number of injection appliances: we have 8 machines in total working for the cosmetic line. And foremost to be creative and inventive in order to design the cosmetic pencil sharpener that will suit the customer but also the end user! If you don't have the pencil sharpener..., you don't have the market. It is the indispensable tool for any woman using cosmetic pencils, be they wood-clenched or plastic-clenched pencils"". ""A perfect pencil comes from a properly designed and functioning pencil sharpener,"" he adds. Indeed, different pencils demand a different sharpener with one common goal: perfect application time after time. ""The final customer will be able to apply a precision line with a fine point. Our second blade system gives the final customer the chance to smudge, apply smooth or broad lines and fuller coverage. And remember, each time you sharpen the pencil you create an anti-bacterial surface"". ""What we say to our direct customer is ….,When you have a special requirement Eisen has the special solution. Want a pencil with an oval tip? Eisen has the sharpener to form an oval tip every time. You never can find the sharpener when you need it? Eisen has a sharpener in your pencil cap, airtight, and right where you need it to be every time."" According to Christian Eisen, ""quality comes from ideas and making a perfect beauty tool"". From this point of view, its company offers plenty custom packing options, custom colours, custom logos or even a custom sharpeners, that are just different means to communicate the brand's message to the customer. ""We offer a full range of diameters from 6.3mm to 16mm in a single style. Once the diameter is selected, the customer decides if he wants a pencil to have a rounded tip or a fine tip."" ""Then let's move on to the design. Covers or bases or both can be added and don't forget the all important cleaning stick. Eventually, the aim is to create a product that enhances the brand and catches the final customer's eye,"" he concludes."

"Bormioli invests in ""green"" plastics","During the first semester of this year, Bormioli Rocco Plastics has produced nearly 500,000 PET recycled bottles for a brand of shampoo. The Italian designer of plastic bottles and caps is also investing in the development of bioplastic materials, in particular in bio-based PE and PP. According to William Hitchon, Bormioli Plastics' cosmetics sales manager ""in the future, brands claiming a natural positioning for their formulas will have to think using innovative packaging derived from agriculture, in particular as a significant production capacity of non GMO materials will be available by 2010. Provided that marketing departments make some concessions regarding aesthetic related concerns"". Regarding the current crisis, ""the dermo-cosmetic segment is more resilient to the consumption crisis, explains William Hitchon because it suits in a better way the needs for well-being and health than selective beauty does. Nonetheless our turnover should shrink back a little in 2010 but the loss will be stronger in the prestige segment. We are holding back our investments until we see clear signs of a market rebound. Marketing teams are working on the simplification of sizes. This is why you see more studies on standardisation and harmonisation, than a year ago"". Last year in France, the main industrial investment of Bormioli Rocco Plastics concerned an extrusion blow line with a 4 colours integrated serigraphy."

The folding box and the inner liner are produced from the same material and shipped together, ready to be filled in with fine fragrances thus actually reducing secondary packaging and production costs. ""Innovation has always been our focus. Due to the current economic crisis, some of our innovative products aproducts perfectly address the new needs of the market; creative while offering cost reduction.

"""The markets moves towards shorter delays and environmental quality,"" Peter Karell (M-Real)","Premium Beauty News - What was the outcome of the year 2008 for your company? What was the impact of the crisis on your business? Peter Karell - We had a good year in turnover including the 3rd quarter, but the effects of the global financial crisis were visible in the last quarter and affected the whole year. The high expectations turned out into a very moderate increase in turnover. Premium Beauty News - What is your vision for the first next 6 months of 2009? Peter Karell - Crystal balls are covered with dust at the moment, making any predictions very difficult. It is clear that the demand is weaker. Currently the biggest change in the market is that everything is required very urgently in the supply chain. Converters do not know when they will receive the next order and when it comes, as everything is very urgent, you must be able to get the raw material in very short delays. The demand for our Express Board service has increased. Nobody wants to carry any stocks and cash-flow is the key word for all. I expect this situation to continue throughout the year. Premium Beauty News - How does your company intend to overcome the recession? Peter Karell - We have already started a cost saving program, which includes stopping the operation of inefficient machines. We also increased our prices last year. It is essential that we keep them at the current levels since we have not yet been able to cover entirely the inflation from earlier years. As a responsible producer we are also cutting capacity where the demand is low. The programme was started last year and it is unavoidable to carry on with it. At the same time we have rationalized our ranges, reducing the number of products thus being able to improve the service. Premium Beauty News - So, what about innovation? Peter Karell - We are in the top league of producers and we intend to stay at this level. We have invested a lot in developing BCTMP as a raw material for GC boards. We can offer whiter boards with good stiffness properties at a lighter weight. This means improved economy throughout the supply chain. Premium Beauty News - Environment and sustainable development are new buzzwords in the industry. How do you address this challenge? Peter Karell - Environmental criteria are becoming more and more important, in particular concerning packaging waste reduction. With our light weighting concept we can help brand owners and converters to meet future requirements regarding packaging reduction. The carton must still protect the product. Forest certification is also an important issue regarding the raw material and we are working hard to constantly improve the emissions."
Arjowiggins Security is on a roll,"The Security division of the Arjowiggins group is in a period of steady growth. Arjowiggins Security employs 1,300 staff, and runs six plants around the world, manufacturing banknotes, official documents such as passports, visas, and tax stamps. The division proposes a large palette of products designed to fight against counterfeiting, forgery, theft and grey markets. Arjowiggins Security is benefiting from the surge in the demand of brand protection and anti-counterfeiting devices. The company proposes a wide range of solutions suiting to all product categories in any industry: watermarks, invisible fibres, iridescent planchettes, security threads and holographic foils, tracers (binary, analogic, DNA, RFID), Synthetic Tamper Evident Substrate (in order to provide a guarantee to the user that the purchased product has never been opened or altered before), Spot Tag. Among Arjowiggins' lastest innovation, the Xtrack system allows creating of a new code from the""biometric"" characteristics of a product. No need to print or engrave anything else on the product. ""X Track"" starts from products inner specificities (the position of fibres in a cardboard packaging, for instance), then codifies and records them. An affordable, unforgeable and undetectable solution that can be applied on any kind of material and product."
Full service becomes trendy among designers,"Premium Beauty News - Packaging suppliers paved the way to full service. Are designers taking the same direction? Thierry de Baschmakoff - Yes, there are more and more design agencies offering a full range of services. Actually, there is no alternative. Most of the agencies that did not opt for diversification do no longer exist. Today, Aesthete can address both specific design issues and more global brand positioning issues. Premium Beauty News - How did you start developing these new business areas? Thierry de Baschmakoff - The diversification of the agency's business happened naturally, from one contract to the other, just by answering our customers' requests. From the design of perfumes and beauty products, we were progressively asked to provide design services for other categories of luxury items: leather goods, luxury watches, pencils, and sunglasses… Bulgari and Fred greatly contributed to our diversification. Another of our customers, London's jeweller Asprey, consulted us about the design of the boutiques. That's how we started to develop our know-how in interior design. Aesthete's offer now covers a broad range of design-related services. We have created two new departments, ""Interior design"" and ""Communication"" in addition to the already existing ""Product design"" and ""Graphic design"" departments. Our range of services now features design, communication and merchandising. We can therefore create a whole and consistent graphic and 3D universe around the products that we design. However, we can also get in touch with customers at later steps, directly through our ""Interior design"" and ""Communication"" teams. Premium Beauty News - What are the advantages of full service design? Thierry de Baschmakoff - There are obvious advantages for brand owners. The first one is time saving. Working with a single agency help to avoid wasting time with briefs, brand and product understanding, … As far as we are concerned, we work in 3D from the very beginning of a design study, meaning that once the customer has selected the shape, we can immediately start working on the communication, the 3D animations, or the POS material. The other advantage, is money saving. Of course, working with a single supplier is less expensive than splitting a budget between several companies. Eventually, full service design also helps to maintain the consistency of a project. It's a kind of art direction. Premium Beauty News - Did this broader activity help you to serve new customers? Thierry de Baschmakoff - We're still working with many manufacturers of perfumes or luxury items, but also with an increasing number of industrial suppliers, in particular for their communication or their website. Suppliers have a double interest in our services. First of all, we have a strong knowledge of the luxury business, in particular the perfumery and beauty business. Then, we are also able to help them in their relation with their customers' marketing teams. Since we are used to work with marketing departments in relation with product design, we speak their language and we know how to interest them."
"""Innovation and customization are the main drivers of our growth,"" Franco Luca (Geka)","Premium Beauty News - What was the outcome of the year 2008 for your company? Franco Luca - As far as products are concerned, we were able to increase our sales by 4.5% compared to 2007. The main drivers for our growth were our innovations as well as our capability to customize products in a very competitive timeframe. To be able to continue to launch successful innovations we need to improve further our service and presence in the French market. Therefore we decided to put in place our own sales organization in Paris before the beginning of July 2009. We took that decision because the French market is a clear target for us. In order to be able to provide our clients with new products we need to understand better their needs and requirements. Our team in France will be led by Thomas Sirot. Mr. Sirot has already gained experiences in the industry. He has been working for Airsec Industries and Aircos in the past. His last position was at Toly, where he was General Manager of Toly France. In his team, Mr. Sirot will be assisted by a technical person, which will be linked with the customer and the factory in Germany. In paralell, we decided to change the name of our commercial office in the US to Geka USA Corporation, from former Geka-Toly USA Corp.. Jerry Sapienza continues as president of Geka USA Corp., the staff and contact information remains unchanged. Geka has also begun packaging production for the US market, and set up a manufacturing site in Elgin (Illinois), with the first customer specific items shipping in December, 2008. The facility will continue to ramp up production throughout 2009, with a commitment to existing customers to supply the market locally. This step will help both, Geka and customers to absorb the dollar's fluctuations. We share with our customers the will to shorten lead times and to influence positively the entire supply chain. Premium Beauty News - What about innovation? What are the new products you are working on? Franco Luca - Innovation is very important. It's Geka's philosophy and success. Our focus remains on mascara. This is where our main expertise lays in, and this is what we keep improving. We are working on new generations of moulded and twisted brushes, testing new materials, technologies and shapes. We will present our second generation of moulded brushes by the end of 2009. At the same time, we are working on a new development for innovative lip applicators and packaging concepts that we will present at the Cosmoprof show in Bologna. By expanding and optimising our Building Block System, we will offer our customers a range of additional, personalised and yet non-exclusive packaging solutions. This eliminates the need to invest in own tools, while still enabling the customers to differentiate themselves in the market. Also there is to mention our cooperation with a famous make-up artist from Hollywood. Michele Burke has already won two Oscars and we are very proud to team up with her. Michele, as an expert, evaluates our applicators, and in parallel, she designs her own innovative applicator line which is exclusively available from Geka. Her expertise brings Geka closer to the end consumer and helps us to understand more in detail the needs on the market. We have invited Michele to some of our shows, such as in New York or in Monaco, and the customers' feedback was impressive. Premium Beauty News - Environment and sustainable development are the new buzzwords in the industry. How do you address this challenge? Franco Luca - With a manufacturing site in Germany, we have always been confronted with demanding laws and regulations. Our factory is located in a water protection area, all our plastics are 100% recycled or reused, we produce approx. 59% of our energy in Geka´s own gas-run thermal power station, etc. . We do not see this topic solely as a buzzword. At Geka, we ""live"" that topic, because it's much more than using bio-based or biodegradable materials. It's the entire supply chain which has to be considered. Premium Beauty News - As a consumer packaging solutions provider, in a context where your customers tend to externalise most of their production with a massive use of subcontractors, what is your opinion about ""full service"" ? Franco Luca - We understand ""full service"" as being entiely devoted towards customers' satisfaction, so they can gets everything from one source with no need to coordinate with different suppliers. During the next five years, we'll focus our investments on the value chain. We are working on agreements with customers as well as with partners that will enable us to increase our expertise and of course to add value to our customers and partners as well. We believe that in today's situation, our customers are looking for more added value and we try to invest in that direction. Premium Beauty News - What about counterfeiting? Are you impacted by the phenomenon and how do you fight it? Franco Luca - When it comes to the packaging, we realised that especially in Asia, a lot of companies are copying us. When it comes to our moulded brushes, the material, shape and the precision of our brushes (especially the bristles), we are very proud, that no company has succeeded in copying our brushes. Our technologies and tools make counterfeiting difficult. We keep our eyes always open and try not to give counterfeiters any chance. We monitor the market on a regular basis and whenever we believe that their might be an infringement we contact our customer as well as our competitors to find a solution."
RPC launches new decorative techniques,"HotFix is a decoration process developed in partnership between RPC and the famous jewellery brand Swarovski. HotFix enables patterns of Swarovski stones to be affixed to plastic cosmetics packaging. This technique has been developed to offer brands a cost-effective way to add value to cosmetic packaging. Until now, the only available technique required applying each individually by hand, ""which was significantly expensive and limited its use to special editions,"" explains Gérald Martines, Business Development Director at RPC. ""HotFix represents the first time that the placement of gemstones into plastic has been achieved on an industrial basis,"" he adds. The technology can be applied to 'plain' plastic (in any classic cosmetic polymer), lacquered or plated parts, and can be overmoulded or combined with other decoration and finishing techniques. RPC is offering HotFix for a wide variety of cosmetics packaging types, including lipsticks, mascaras, glosses, compacts and closures. RPC is convinced that the automation opens the technology to mainstream cosmetics packaging as well as high-end luxury applications. ""By using HotFix, capacity can match typical production outputs for million-unit 'blockbuster' launches as well as limited series,"" says Gérald Martines. EcoCoat, RPC's other new launch, offers an environmental-friendly alternative to varnishing through the overmoulding of a thin coat of transparent polymer on top of a plastic component. ""The technique has been developed to respond to the demand for luxury packaging that is more sustainable and ecologically friendly,"" says RPC. The objective here is to achieve a coating using only an extremely thin skin, of no more than a few tenths of a millimetre to achieve high gloss and depth of finish without the inconvenience of varnishing. ""Logistics and handling are significantly simplified and reduced, while EcoCoat avoids the emission of greenhouse gases associated with varnishing,"" claims Gérald Martines. The thin coating can be specified in a number of styles, including clear, tinted, or incorporating metallic or pearlescent pigments. EcoCoat can also be applied over any standard decoration technique. For example, the application of EcoCoat over traceability marking or holographic labels protects these devices from tampering."
"""An innovative dispensing system can reinvent a product,"" D. Saksik, MWV","MeadWestvaco (MWV) provides packaging solutions to many of the world's most-admired brands in the healthcare, personal and beauty care, food and beverage. With 22,000 employees worldwide, MWV operates in 30 countries and serves customers in more than 100 nations. Premium Beauty News - What is the outcome of the year 2008 for MWV, in particular regarding personal and beauty products? Daniel Saksik - MWV's recently announced 2008 earnings results and reported annual sales of USD 6.6 billion. In our personal and beauty care segment, MWV generated USD 350 million. MWV recently appointed industry expert Thomas Jonas to lead our Beauty and Personal Care strategic business unit. Before joining MWV, Thomas served as general manager of Alcan Beauty Solutions. We also continue to benefit from the acquisitions of two trusted and innovative brand builders in the world of dispensing solutions - Calmar and Keltec - and they are fully integrated into MWV. MWV acquired Calmar in 2006 and Keltec was acquired in 2007. These moves have enabled MWV to strongly position itself in the primary packaging market, along with innovative products such as Pearl Airless, which utilizes our patented Rolling Bellow technology. We are continuing to strengthen our leadership in dispensing solutions, which differentiate brands and also support more efficient manufacturing. MWV offers state-of-the-art laboratory and testing facilities that can help brand owners optimize their formulations to work with our range of products and deliver the needed consumer experience. We understand that an innovative dispensing system can re-invent a product and open an entirely new market to customers. Premium Beauty News - What are last year's best achievements in terms of new products launches? Daniel Saksik - One of our most transformative products launched in 2008 was Clikit IP, a resin-injected version of the company's market-leading Melodie Clikit pump. Clikit IP was developed to offer prestige fragrance brands a cost effective, high performance pump that provides the look and feel of traditional luxury packaging. In terms of functional advancements, one of the driving trends we've seen is that product formulations are becoming more viscous. MWV developed a new approach to support thicker formulas, and these innovative sprayers are part of our high viscosity product pump and sprayer line. Our Mark VII-HV product is a great example - it can spray higher viscosity products such as lotions and gels. Another area of focus in dispensing functionality is spray performance. In the fine mist category, MWV is engineering new ways of spraying to deliver at a higher predictable velocity to deliver a consistent spray pattern with finer particle size. The end result is a formulation that can dry faster with the intended product efficacy. Premium Beauty News - Forecasts for the year 2009 are not very optimistic. Within such a context, what is your message to the rest of the industry? Daniel Saksik - The personal care market, like every other market segment, is not immune to the challenges posed by today's economic downturn. Some of the effects in the personal care industry are through lower consumer demand, de-stocking inventory or the postponing of launches of new and enhanced products. However, before and during this difficult economic period, MWV has taken bold, proactive steps to secure its position in its targeted markets. We have unique capabilities and end-to-end solutions; and we have strong global positions in this market - especially in dispensers and pumps - which helps provide stability in an otherwise grim environment. We also know that this market will turn around; eventually customers will launch new products and they'll want to do so with the help of a packaging partner - like MWV - that has a strong innovation pipeline, a broad global footprint, and the design capabilities to help their brands stand-out. Premium Beauty News - Is there a risk that environmental concerns do not survive difficult economic times? Daniel Saksik - Sustainability is more often linked to near- and long-term environmental, social and economic benefits. While many are focused on driving costs out of their business in the short term, which is definitely a critical issue today, they may overlook the broader benefits of sustainable solutions to their business and brand. Also, it is important to understand the lifecycle of products in order to accurately analyze costs throughout the entire supply chain. At MWV we integrate sustainability into our packaging solutions in the way we source raw materials - including the use of recovered materials - and design, manufacture and transport our products. Sustainability also influences our business practices - from the research behind our innovative and market-relevant products, to the ethical business conduct of our employees, to our many initiatives to help communities grow and prosper. In the area of dispensing, MWV has increasingly focused on continuing to reduce the number of parts and the number of materials while enabling greater design flexibility. Take for example our Rolling Bellow technology, which is a 100% thermal plastic component that replaces four other parts. This allows us to have a true non-venting airless dispenser that is metal-free, has the lowest number of components in the industry, and can support high viscosity products."
"""We must focus resources"", Pierre Sabatier, Promens","Premium Beauty News - What is the outcome of the year 2008, and what is your vision of the next six months? Pierre Sabatier - The least I can say is that 2008 was a contrasted year. The first quarter was well oriented, but sales started to decline progressively on the next months and the fourth quarter was much more affected by the slowdown as the economic crisis was succeeding to the financial crisis. Eventually, it was a flat year for us, marking a halt in our continuous growth over the last 10 years. In spite of the economic context,we carry on the same level of investments in R&D. As far as industrial development is concerned we acquired new industrial 1,7000 sqm premises in order to relocate our manufacturing facility of Bellignat (France). The move was completed at the end of 2008. We now enjoy the benefit of an optimized unit, ready to host our future developments, with our European research platform under the same roof. Concerning 2009, we'll focus on addressing ""bad news with good answers""; with the aim to mitigate the effects of this unavoidable economic slowdown. Achieving this goal, we'll imply to progress continuously in the field of operational processes, and to aim at the ""operational excellence"". Success will also depend on our ability to propose innovations adapted to customers' needs. Premium Beauty News - What about innovation in the health and beauty industry? What are the new products you are working on? Pierre Sabatier - Actually, innovation is one of the keystones of our development. Our research is organised around three main fields: technologies, materials and products. Our aim is to propose ""useful"" innovations. I mean innovations that do facilitate the use of products, or do help to protect their contents, but also improve the product's performance. Our development process is consumer-centred, with regular studies of consumers' needs being at the very heart of product development. We regularly gather consumer panels in order to analyse their behaviour in front of a beauty packaging, and the way they use the products, from the initial purchasing intention to the product's end-of-life. Furthermore, as an expert on an ever-changing market, we carefully monitor fashion and technological and societal trends, thus enabling us to advise and help our customers in the development of tomorrow's packaging. Our understanding of market's needs helps us to propose relevant solutions. In 2008 we carried on the development of our airfree (a patented airless system) ranges, and we launched several ranges of products using glass-polymer (a material with a similar thickness than glass, but without its fragility). During the year 2009, innovations in the field of content protection, as well as new caps, are expected. Premium Beauty News - Environment and sustainable development are the new buzzwords in the industry. How do you address this challenge? Pierre Sabatier - Protecting our environment, in order to preserve natural resources and the planet's equilibrium, is our priority today. Promens is aware of its responsibility and is already implementing an ethical scheme with the aim to reduce the environmental impact of its activities and products. This scheme is mainly based on the harmony between the environment and our products' life cycle: from the choice of the material to the design, through production and transport, to final use and recycling. Promens is among the very first operators in the rigid plastics industry to train its own staff to carbon footprint assessment. Thus, Pascal Henenmann, Promens' Research Director was officially accredited by the French environmental agency, ADEME, to audit and assess the carbon footprint of our facilities and products. Furthermore our three French facilities (Bellignat, Géovreisset and L'Aigle) have been ISO 14001 certified. Eventually, as far as products are concerned, we recently launched our first airless system in recycled material: the Green airfree. Premium Beauty News - What is your position regarding the development of ""full-service"" in the industry? Pierre Sabatier - Our goal is to offer full packaging solutions to our customers and to the markets, innovative ""out of the box"" solutions. Our aim is to concentrate our energy, our investments, on our core business, which is to offer packaging solutions, advices and productions. We're not going beyond that point, in particular if you think about filling. It is an illusion to believe that one's can excel in any fields, and today more than yesterday. We must ""focus"" the use of our resources. Premium Beauty News - And regarding counterfeiting? Pierre Sabatier - We are actively protecting our know-how through patents and models registration, nevertheless we have to cope with fakes from Asian countries. Jurisdictional means are usually long, costly and inefficient. The best way to fight that phenomenon is to always be ahead of them and to shorten marketing delays as much as possible."
Airlessystems takes care of formulations without parabens,"""Our first concern was to find a packaging which enables us to propose to medical aesthetics practitioners a ready-to-use gel administrable by electroporation, while guaranteeing the formula's stability and integrity"" says Paul-Albert Charpentier, Export Manager at Guna. Eden's airless piston system permanently prevents air from entering the dispenser, hence protecting the product from contamination making the use of preservatives unnecessary. For Guna, that resulted in the removal of parabens in the formulation of its new gel, with advantages at several levels. ""This airless packaging technology enables us to anticipate a future regulation prohibiting parabens and to take one step ahead on a niche market"", underlines Paul-Albert Charpentier. ""It costs more than conventional solutions, however, its advantages in terms of image in particular, are much more important. For instance, the product is marketed in a higher range and the absence of conservative is more coherent with its naturalness."" After this first and successful collaboration with Airlessystems, Guna intends to go further. ""Our objective is to use the Airlessystems technology to gradually eliminate preservatives from the formulation of all our creams"", Mr. Charpentier concludes."
Heinz Glas aims to offer the best of finishing,"With manufacturing facilities on three continents, in Germany, in Poland, in Peru and in China, and with a production capacity around 465 tons of glass per day, German glassmaker Heinz Glas already has strong industrial assets. ""These assets are reinforced by our ability to innovate,"" states Nicolas Lejeune, development manager at Heinz Glas. ""Our strength lies in our ability to continuously improve the appearance of glass, to optimise industrial processes, to offer more than just glass (in particular through environment-friendly technologies), and to propose the full range of possible finishes (serigraphy, pad printing, hot stamping, glass etching, vacuum metallization, etc.)"". Actually, within ten years, Heinz Glas operated a dramatic and successful upmarket shift. Considered as a ""middle market"" company during the 1990s, the German glassmaker is now renown as one of the best manufacturers of high-end and luxury glass. An achievement based on the group's massive investments in its production tool, in particular in finishing techniques. ""Of course, it's not by chance that we reached this position,"" says Yann Lefrancq, Heinz Glas France. According to her, the success of the company is mainly due to ""the permanent search for technical excellence and the optimization of our production tool"". ""It's true that finishing soon appeared as a key factor of success of Heinz Glas' strategy,"" Nicolas Lejeune explains. ""Since the end of 2000, our German manufacturing unit has been equipped with production lines using eco-friendly water-based lacquers. Five years later, in order to go beyond the limits of serigraphy, we chose to develop pad printing and started a new high-performance machine. Eventually, in 2007 and 2008, we have increased our finishing capacity with two additional lines."" Indeed, Heinz Glas is convinced that pad printing is a key technology for the future and has the potential to answer the weirdest customer demands. Heinz Glas even developed enamel inks, and most recently, golden and platinum inks, and adapted them to its equipment. Heinz Glas is now able to place a four-colour image, or gold or platinum or enamel, everywhere on a bottle."
Fusion launches new Kurve packaging for skincare,"""You've never seen an airless bottle with curves as sexy as these. We are excited to present something completely original to the skincare market,"" says Derek Harvey, co-founder of Fusion. ""I am constantly asked by skincare companies why all airless bottles and acrylic jars are either round or square. Kurve is the answer they've been searching for,"" he adds. The Kurve line includes an airless bottle in 15 ml and 30 ml and an acrylic jar in 30 ml and 50 ml. Additional sizes will be available soon: a 50 ml airless bottle and 15 ml acrylic jar. Eventually, there will be 6 stock items in the complete Kurve line. The product is fully customizable and can be combined with a range of decorative options such as custom colours, silk-screening, hot stamping, UV metalizing and offset printing."
Rexam's Prodigio pump reaches European retail shelves,"Bottega Verde's Uomo Energy Power anti-wrinkle, anti-stress formulation, and Kelemata's Victor anti-fatigue cold cream both recently reached European retail shelves utilizing Rexam's Prodigio standard airless lotion pump. The Bottega Verde product was customized with matching electric-blue actuator and tank, while the Kelemata entry was created with a black actuator and green-labelled tank. ""Prodigio is designed with a large decoration area, for optimal point-of-sale impact and profitability,"" comments Virginie Lemeunier, Product Manager - Lotion, Rexam Personal Care. ""The Prodigio looks great on the retail shelf, and offers true consumer benefits, through elimination of drips, clogs and product contamination,"" she adds. Actually, the Prodigio features most of the interesting characteristics of airless pumps plus series of innovations proposed by Rexam. For instance, Rexam's proprietary, air-proof CleanPoint dispensing technology features a mechanically-closed actuator channel that keeps the lotion exit-point neat, clear and free of messy build-up. The mechanism primes and pumps flawlessly, slides back after every actuation, and prevents product return after air or skin contact. The Prodigio can dispense precise dosage of today's fragile, viscous formulations, thanks to wider internal channels, and is designed to withstand high-speed atmospheric filling and other processes. Furthermore, to ensure the neutrality of this 100 percent recyclable lotion pump, the Prodigio pump is fitted with polypropylene and polyethylene components. There is no elastomer or metal contact with the lotion. New launches are expected in 2009 Rexam says."
"Stéphane Tondenier, Alcan: ""Being a worldwide manufacturer is our main asset!""","""Each day brings its own demonstration, Stéphane Tondenier states, and for all the technologies we are supplying. Indeed, the market requires the possibility of simultaneous launches on several continents. And once the product is launched, permanent flexibility is still needed between various production sites, allowing to optimise the activity on the base of currency rate variations and adjust the production schedule to the demand"". Alcan Packaging Beauty's worldwide industrial network perfectly addresses these needs, for each segment of the perfumery and cosmetic business and for tubes. ""As far as the lipstick business is concerned, we are recording significant sales increases. This dynamic may be explained by our state-of-the-art industrial organisation and our unrivalled global presence, with manufacturing plants in Spain, Mexico, Indonesia and Brazil, all of them being able to produce our standard mechanism according to the same process. Thanks to this competitive advantage we have the possibility to focus on the product's external parts, and to facilitate production transfers"". For the last two year, Alcan Packaging Beauty has been extending to other segments, such as perfumery and personal care products, this successful ability to launch the initial production at a multi-regional scale. Mascaras enjoy the benefits of the same competitive advantage: an important asset concerning a product that remains a best-seller. ""We can satisfy consumers' demands from every part of the world and for our entire range,"" explains Stéphane Tondenier. ""We are also intensifying investments and the quest for innovation, on this segment, with the aim to help our customers to stand out from the mass"" ""Actually, we are permanently sharing with our customers the various competitive advantages of the regions where we are producing allowing them to choose the best option available,"" he adds."
Quadpack: sustainable solutions for prestige packaging,"""The sustainability trend affects all market segments: mass, masstige and prestige brands are all eager to find solutions for this challenge,"" explains Muriel Lesbros, marketing consultant for Quadpack, one of Europe's fastest growing, independent packaging groups supplying prestige packaging solutions to the cosmetics and beauty markets. To address sustainability challenges and bring satisfaction to a growing number of concerned consumers, Quadpack is exploring various solutions and already offers innovative Earth-friendly options. ""Post Industrial"" recycled packages, for instance, were launched on the market last summer with Nude Skincare, a new range of eco-friendly, all natural face and body products. Quadpack worked with their strategic manufacturing partners based in Europe and Asia to develop the exciting range of packs. The collection of 7 packs comprises bespoke bottles and closures (30 and 200ml), personalized jars (10, 75 and 200ml) and sophisticated customized airless packs (15 and 40ml) for sensitive formulas. As a result Quadpack and Nude won the Gold Award for Best Cosmetics and Toiletry Design earlier this year at the Starpack Awards…. ""These beautifully effective and minimal packs reflect the natural beauty product"" and ""a significant effort has been put in to delivering a unique look and feel including materials development and finishes"", commented the award's judges. A result that was achieved while Quadpack and Nude have been working towards increasing the content of recycled raw materials in the products' packaging. After this great success, Quadpack has been working on various Recycled or Post Consumer Recycled packaging options which were presented at Cosmeeting and Luxepack this year, such as Yonwoo's natural package collections in polypropylene and carton board, as well as various ways of using recyclable materials, and a new dual chamber pack made of polypropylene for easy recycling purposes, and packaging eligible to the Ecocert finished product certification. Post Consumer Recycled (PCR) packaging is one of Quadpack's main sustainability assets. PCR is an end product that has completed its cycle as a consumer item and would otherwise have been disposed of as a solid waste. Most PCR items are recyclables collected in commercial and residential recycling programs such as office paper, cardboard, aluminium cans, plastics and metals. Quadpack standard or custom PCR range originated from a self managed closed loop recycling operation is composed of various pack options: bottles and jars out of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) material from 10 to 100% PCR with functionally results comparable to virgin material, and cylindrical and oval tubes out of polyethylene (PE) with 30% PCR content and functionality results comparable to virgin material. Other ways of reducing environmental impact include reducing pack weight, minimising leftovers of product in the pack and reducing the amount of preservative in the formula. Sustainability therefore concerns all products and packaging categories, including sophisticated airless packs, a segment where Quadpack can also offers green alternatives, thanks to its commercial partnership with Korea's Yonwoo."
Rexam's technical know-how in Gothic mood,"For those who were involved in the project, John Galliano's first-ever fragrance was a demanding challenge. In terms of visual appeal, the package had to convey Galliano's singular design aesthetic and love of textiles and textures. It also had to project the sense of exclusivity and drama carefully cultivated by the couturier. On many occasion this implied to develop complex and innovative techniques. Selective Beauty, the brand's licensee, chose Rexam for manufacturing the intricate closure and pump assembly that dresses the vial. ""No doubt – this perfume package was a challenge and we needed a technical tour de force to make it work,"" says Elisabeth Benoit, Cosmetic Closures Sales Director, Rexam Personal Care. Rexam's so-called ""Center of Excellence"" in Simandre, France had to offer world-class expertise in technologies to address the challenge. For example, a great lacquering ability was required so that the deep rich black of the Gothic ""G"" over-actuator, crafted of weighted PP, perfectly matches the collar. ""The degree of detail of the collar and the rose, and the actual depth of the relief, underscores our skill in complex injection,"" adds Elisabeth Benoit. Eventually, Rexam's SP6 compact pump, with its excellent pre-compression characteristics, is adapted to this kind of deluxe fragrances where designers develop bold, creative bottle shapes. European distribution of the products is now underway and will continue, worldwide, in 2009. The three SKU line includes 40 ml, 60ml and 90 ml."
Toly and Geka gear together toward innovation,"At Geka Brush, Franco Luca has just been appointed as new Chief Executive Officer. As far as the German company is concerned, the main buzz is about that ""weird little mascara brush"" looking as a ball and developed for Givenchy. Is it a big seller or not? Considering the fact that Geka has been working on new orders sooner that expected, it seems that women do really like the product. The German producer of mascaras does not intend to rest on its laurels. Its latest ""innovation show"", organised during HBA in New York in a photograph workshop, the Splashlight in Manhattan, perfectly illustrated this strong will. On this occasion, Geka unveiled a new range of innovative brushes to a selection of five American customers per day. Flexible and soft plastic brushes (one of them with not least than 1248 extremely thin plastic hairs), as the one made for Avon's SuperShock, a brand new metallic brushes specially designed for the short eyelashes of Asian women, or a double function applicator comb, were under the spotlight. For Geka, this special event was also an opportunity to announce the opening of its new American factory, located in Elgin, Illinois, which should eventually employ 145 staffs. As far as Toly is concerned, innovation seems to be a second nature. In the wake, of a joint-venture agreement with two Korean companies, creating Toly Airless Packaging (TAP), the company is presenting a set of new products, featuring an airless cream jar with a mini-pump allowing a very precise product dosage. Toly also invested in innovative designs for its two lines of round double walled dispensing systems, TAP-1-R and TAP-RFW featuring an inner airless pouch that collapses within the rigid tube along with the utilisation of the product. Another interesting novelty, the Slimline range of dispensing packs with their set of various applicators corresponding to the desired function. ""Airless, as we consider it, must help to offer new shapes and a bigger variety of designs,"" Toly managers say."
Actipack proposes new standard containers,"Actipack makes an annual turnover of EUR 14 million, employs 60 staffs and runs two manufacturing units, one in France and the other in the Czech Republic since 2001. This year, the French plant was equipped was two new injection machines, bringing up the total to twenty machines in operation in the company's two production units. The health and beauty market contributes to 70% of Actipack's turnover. Actipack's sister company, Loire Plastic Industrie (a turnover of 60 million EUR and 50 staffs), specialised in the manufacture of plastic boxes and caps, was also presenting its novelties during the Emballage tradeshow, featuring a brand new dosing pills-bottle and future green plastic (polylactic acid, PLA) product developments. The cooperation of Actipack, Loire Plastique Industrie and Packinov (builder of hot sealing machines) within the Axium group enable them to propose full packaging solutions."
"Solev: ""from innovation to audacious innovation""","""In the business of luxury, innovation, audacity and durability rule,"" Mathieu Pivaudran, Solev's General director explains. ""These values sound perfectly match with our own ethics and strategy. That's our culture."" The French company, specialised in finishing techniques, is implementing and illustrating this particular attention to ""innovation"" and ""audacity"" through its latest launches. Among the most recent illustrations: John Galliano's new fragrance, No 1, on which Solev's team applied its so-called MSD technology, for Selective Graded Metallisation: a technology allowing to position metallic spots on glass surfaces for a better control of the gradation between glass transparency and metallic reflections. Another wondering illustration: Burberry's famous tartan, which was reproduced on the glass bottle using aluminium metallization. A world's premiere using laser technology that produces a delicate lace allowing the light to play with the perfume's golden colouring."
Sleever brings metal differentiation to Coty's Playboy fragrance,"With the aim to obtain an original and strongly differentiated packaging that would make a bold statement immediately, Sleever International used its Skinsleever® technology. A first in the perfume world, the matt-shiny embossed effect reproduces a ""metallic"" feel. The quintessence of masculinity, the Playboy perfume is presented in a glass bottle reminiscent of a whisky flask. The Skinsleever® technology reproduces on a ""brushed metal"" background, the brand's emblematic visual codes, the bunny and bowtie, whilst leaving a transparent window that reveals a woman's silhouette. ""The decision to work with Sleever International was a logical result of the group's vertical integration that gives it an undeniable competitive edge. The embossed texture effect on the film and the perfect integration of the sleeve against the glass bottle were a challenging task. In the final count, this has been a win-win collaboration, as our product has hit the market with the right timing and the right quality,"" explains David Lopez-Bonnet, Director of Cosmetic Product Development at Coty Beauty Europe. Launched one month ago in the USA, Canada and Western Europe, and rolling out globally next year, the initial sales of Playboy are ""very promising"" in the words of Coty's top management."
Cosfibel Group: enhanced creativity,"Cosfibel, the group chaired by Alain Chevassus, its founder, and managed by Ilan Schinazi, presented its new boxes, primary packaging, Christmas coffrets and promotional items during a special event in Paris (France) and on the occasion of Luxe Pack Monaco. The company highlighted Crystal sharp, its new line of make up and skin care featuring eleven references (lipstick, mascara, and gloss primary packaging, blush, powder and eye shadow boxes…) and P-R-O, a line devoted to make-up professionals and aestheticians. The P-R-O lines includes a ""click-pen"" with five different brushes. Cosfibel also displayed a series of new boxes and coffrets, such as the Bombox, which is stackable thanks to its thermoformed bubble shape, or the Origami Box, the Magic Box and the Spring Box, with their original opening systems. Additionally, the group showcased shopping bags mixing paper and thermoformed materials for the decorative finishing. With a turnover of USD 100 million, the Cosfibel Group employs 240 staff, and runs three manufacturing units in Europe (two in France and the other one in Spain). Cosfibel also works with a several suppliers and subcontractors around the world. In 2000, the group chose to open offices in every city where there is a demand for its packaging, giving this ""Urban network"" the mission to trade its products and to monitor local markets. This original strategy brought almost ten branch offices to the group. Most recently, it has opened Moscow, London and Freiburg offices. The group's managers tell they are focusing their action around three main strategic axes: – to bet on a their capacity to serve several sectors with different types of materials, – to specialise the company in special products, – to invest in creativity, quality of their manufacturing and sourcing processes, along with the proximity to the group's clientele through the ""Urban network""."
Emballage aims to help decoding trends,"Premium Beauty News - The first Emballage tradeshow was inaugurated in 1947and for many years now it has been recognised as a must-go-to event. What about the very next edition? Juana Moreno - Actually Emballage is a world-class event, which is established and recognized as such. Once again, it will be the unavoidable event of the finishing year for the packaging business. One of the reasons for such a success being the show's ability to respond to new market demands and to focus on innovation. Emballage 2008 enables visitors to opt for a world-class event covering and segmenting several sectors addressing the needs of the whole spectrum of packaging users and consumers. As usual, the 2008 edition proposes a large variety of sectors and events. Pack Vision, the International Packaging Design Symposium, for instance, will be the opportunity to exchange views on forecasting topics for the packaging business and on the latest innovations in everything related to packaging, from marketing, to technical and financial considerations. It is a real added-value event for all professional visitors that are keen to upgrade their products, to anticipate new trends, and to enter new markets. The Art & Packaging exhibition, for instance, will propose an in-depth look to the close links and multiple influences between art and packaging, and will offer an alternative point of view on the aesthetics in packaging, how it helps generating value, in particular in the beauty and cosmetics industry. Here are all the reasons why so many operators from the packaging industry once again chose to participate in this year's edition and let us expect it will be one of the best shows ever. Premium Beauty News - An entire area of the show is dedicated to the health and beauty business. Including for the machinery and equipment. Juana Moreno - Our records show that every year, each Emballage edition is hosting almost 13% professionals from the cosmetics, beauty and health sectors, with more than 60% being executive managers. Once again, from November 17 to 21, the show will match the expectations of these visitors and will offer them unrivalled innovations. To date, exhibiting companies have already registered more than 200 new products. Emballage 2008 will offer unique opportunities to decode the main trends in the cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and luxury businesses. Among these trends, let's already mention a kind of ""instrumentalization"" of the cosmetic science, with the aim to increase cosmetics' efficacy and usefulness, and also the increasing importance of packaging and aesthetics, and the very important safety issue. Innovation is illustrated on almost every stand of the show, in which 45% of our exhibitors are offering equipment, packaging, containers or solutions for pharmaceuticals, 42% for cosmetics and 16% for luxury goods. It's really an opportunity to discover the latest news of these industries. The show is also an opportunity to optimize one's benchmark. In my opinion, three halls are unavoidable for a full coverage of the market: Hall 3, with B&L (beverages & liquids) in order to find the packaging solutions for liquid products. Hall 5, where are gathered the equipments for the packaging of health and beauty products. And eventually, Hall 6, which is an area devoted to containers for the health and beauty sectors, including a luxury sub-area to address the specificities of this segment. Premium Beauty News - The area devoted to the luxury segment was created 15 years ago. How does it evolve? Juana Moreno - France is the World leader of the luxury industry (haute couture, jewellery, cosmetics…), and packaging will enhance the product. It's mere logic that the World Packaging Exhibition reflects the importance of the packaging in the luxury segment. From every sides of the World, the main decision makers come to Paris to get inspiration from the French touch. And our show will always support these French best achievements as they are illustrated in the Art & Packaging and the Trends area. Premium Beauty News - How does a multisectorial show as Emballage does respond to the development of targeted and specialised tradeshows? Will you create additional events and animations within your show? Juana Moreno - Beyond trends and fashions, Emballage succeeded to preserve its double identity: as a multisectorial show, it provides a panoramic view over all packaging markets; as a well organised show, it provides targeted and in-depth answers to the specific needs of the different actors in the industry. Specialised areas have been created within the show, in particular entire halls have been devoted to specific sectors, such as B&L. It's clear than 2010 will see new projects emerging. But the main issue now is the very next opening of the 2008 edition with big news to discover too."
Coster steps into India,"Premium Beauty News - What is the outcome of the year 2008 so far? Claudio Contini - More or less the same as 2007. However, it is important to consider the impact of foreign currency rates, because our sales in the dollar zone are under evaluated. Should the US dollar be our reference to calculate our turnover, we would see a dramatic increase, as per the previous years. I must also add that this year was a very good one for our sales of aerosol filling machines. Premium Beauty News - What is your vision of the next six months? Claudio Contini - We expect weaker sales for the next six months, it's no surprise. The reasons are the downturn of retail sales, the world financial crisis, and the slowdown of extra-European markets, combined with the recession in Europe. There are signs already that are not very positive about future orders. Premium Beauty News - Nevertheless, you are still making important investments? Claudio Contini - As per the group's tradition, we carry on important investments in our various facilities, with the aim to upgrade their automation level, and also the quality and flexibility of the production. Furthermore, we recently made a huge investment in India, by taking over the biggest producer of perfumery pumps in the country. Now we're working at improving the equipment of our Indian production units in order to bring them at a similar level than in Europe. We plan to supply, from India, pumps designed for the mass-market, with the same quality and same service than in Europe, but with the advantage of a best-cost country sourcing. Indeed the ""right price"" remains the first concern for the type of market we're serving. That's the main reason for our investment in India. Premium Beauty News - What about innovation? What is your strategy in this field? Claudio Contini - It's hard to talk about ground-breaking innovation for the kind of products we are working with. We can consider innovation as per the shapes or the colours, but actually the market is reluctant to all functional innovations that do not help to decrease prices. Existing products already cover consumers' needs, so there is hardly any real need for new functionalities. Actually, price remains the most important factor. Premium Beauty News - Environment and sustainable development are the new buzzwords in the industry. How do you address these challenges? Claudio Contini - Our products rely on processed materials such as plastic, an oil derivative, and steel. These materials are becoming less abundant and more expensive. Furthermore, there are increasing concerns linked to solid wastes, with more and more consumers becoming aware of the necessity to reduce packaging volumes. Nevertheless, we are convinced that in order to address our customers' need we must carry on with containers and pumps. In such a context, the only winners will be those producers being able to reduce material inputs to the minimum required, while giving access to simple and low cost recycling schemes. All our facilities are built so as they do not impact the surrounding environment: no pollutant emissions of chemical products. All our products use FDA approved materials, and are harmless to consumers' health. Premium Beauty News - What about counterfeiting? Are you impacted by the phenomenon and how do you fight it? Claudio Contini - As far as we are concerned, the problem is limited to Chinese goods. But copycat producers have failed to approach our quality and reliability standards. Eventually, the outcome of the latest years, is that Chinese producers have not been able to enter our main markets. Premium Beauty News - There is a strong trend to reduce pumps' size. They are always smaller and smaller, but what's the limit? Claudio Contini - There are physical limits, of course, that are linked to the minimum dose size and that cannot be overstepped. Furthermore, size reduction necessarily induces quality loss. That's not an option acceptable to Coster, as our goal is to supply our customers with the best quality available."
"""Full service is a major market trend"" - Gérard Perrin, MWV","Premium Beauty News - What is the outcome of the year 2008 so far? What is your vision of the next six months? Gérard Perrin - The beginning of the year showed a very dynamic growth of ""Health and Beauty"" markets, and the growth of ""Household Products"" was just a bit slower. As the economy is becoming a global issue, cost efficiency will be top of mind among everyone in every industry however MWV is well positioned with a broad range of products and our integrated global platform to deliver extremely efficient and cost effective solutions to our customers. Premium Beauty News - What about innovation in the health and beauty industry? What are the new products you are working on? Gérard Perrin – As we have done in the past in personal and beauty care, we will continue to push the boundaries on design flexibility, materials reduction and delivery of both ultra-luxury and mass market packaging solutions that enable maximum creativity and cost efficiency. Packaging is a critical component of our customers' marketing mix and continued innovation is a key to delivering value-added propositions to the market. We design, develop and manufacture innovative packaging solutions that deliver on a wide range of needs and benefits—standing out on store shelves; providing strength and durability; delivering on key brand equities such as sustainability; and, most importantly, functionality. MWV's Center for Packaging Innovation (CPI) is a catalyst for next-generation packaging innovation, and provides us with the ability to truly partner with our customers on a global basis throughout the packaging development process. Premium Beauty News - Environment and sustainable development are the new buzzwords in the industry. How do you address these challenges? Gérard Perrin - Sustainability is part of MWV's DNA. We continually improve and enhance processes and products with sustainability in mind which is why we have been named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for five years in a row. We work directly with our customers to set and achieve sustainability goals for their products throughout the supply chain from sourcing, to manufacturing, design, shipping, consumer use and end of product life. It represents a focused, ongoing commitment to make responsible business decisions that benefit our people, our society and our environment. We recently conducted an in-depth study to uncover how sustainable packaging influences consumer purchasing decisions. We are leveraging this insight to help our customers develop solutions that will meet their branding objectives and their consumers' needs. Premium Beauty News - As a consumer packaging solutions provider, in a context where your customers tend to externalise most of their production with a massive use of subcontractors, what is your opinion about ""full service"" ? Gérard Perrin - Our goal is to simplify the process for our customers by being their full service provider of packaging solutions. Our global footprint, range of capabilities, areas of expertise and market knowledge enable us to partner with our customers on every level of the packaging process. As many of our customers find themselves entering new and emerging markets, this global capacity continues to serve us, and our customers well. Premium Beauty News - What about counterfeiting? Are you impacted by the phenomenon and how do you fight it? Gérard Perrin - Product counterfeiting for one has become a significant issue, costing brand owners valuable time and money to combat, as well as to regain consumer trust. Counterfeiters strive to replicate this ""intimate connection"" between a consumer and a brand for illegal profit. Through the power of security packaging, brand owners can protect their product as well as their brand with authenticity and anti-counterfeiting features. One such example, for premium products and product lines at high-end, luxury outlets, is anti-divergent packaging technology. This covert packaging solution uses barcodes and serial numbers (also known as serialization) for brand-owners to track their product shipments to ensure they arrive at their predetermined destination. In other words, this technology helps avoid products from diverging off their planned shipping and delivery paths. The high-end fragrance market, where licensing agreements specify exclusive logistics and sales partnerships, is known to invest more in this technology because its well-known products have a higher potential for counterfeiting. Tamper evidence solutions are another way that MWV enables its customers to distinguish their products from counterfeits. MWV has identified a trend towards tamper evidence solutions for pump, sprayer, closure, and dispenser applications that assure customers their products are legitimate and will arrive for their use in their original state. Consumers are more inclined to purchase a product that has visible tamper evidence features which provides assurance that the product was untouched or unused by someone before. In the personal care and cosmetics industry for example, product tampering, such as for body lotions, liquid soaps, hand creams, fragrances, lip balms, and other items, is costing distributors millions of dollars due to lost sales revenue."
"Alberto Bormioli: ""I invest my money in industrial equipment rather than in a bank"".","Bormioli Luigi's success story could almost be summarized with two dates and two figures: in 1999 the company's turnover was EUR 81 million, while it should be around EUR 175 million in 2008! A rise that helps to understand the huge work the Italian glassmaker made over those years. Such a remarkable achievement, is partly due to the ""perfumery boost"" of the early 2000s, when the turnover of its high-end glass bottles division grew from EUR 60 million in 2001 to EUR 136 million in 2008. The family company also demonstrated its ability to cope with its own success. In 2004, for the first time in its history, the company named a general director, with the aim to rationalise the organization and better coordinate the activities of the company, now a major player in the European luxury glass industry. The man for the job was found in the person of Vincenzo Di Giuseppantonio, an experienced insider of the glass industry. Alberto Bormioli, CEO and heir of the family glass tradition knew the choice was the good one. ""We chose each others,"" he's used to say. Vincenzo Di Giuseppantonio entirely reorganised the Parma-headquartered company. From 1,200 staff, the company decrease to 850, within three years. A slimming diet during which the whole company, and all the manufacturing equipment were reviewed and all undue costs eliminated. However, at the same time, the demand was particularly high and production facilities appeared to be undersized. It was urgent to increase production capabilities. In 2007, Bormioli Luigi seized the opportunity to acquire a manufacturing unit sold by another leading Italian glassmaker, Bormioli Rocco (don't mix them!), which was specialised in the production of glass bottles. The investment totalled EUR 30 million: EUR 10 million for the plant acquisition, to which ""it has been necessary to add EUR 20 million in order to upgrade the equipment at the level required for manufacturing high-end vials,"" Alberto Bormioli explains. Eventually, the refurbished factory is now equipped with a new oven with a 80 tons a day capacity, heated with gas, which is new and also less expensive for Bormioli Luigi as it's electric power that heats all the other ovens in Parma. The factory also comprises four brand new I.S. production lines, with a potential of 29,000 tons of glass a year. The new factory was just inaugurated last week, with events in both Milan and Parma. ""It will help us to restore our flexibility and the reactivity that forged our reputation, Vincenzo Di Giuseppantonio explains, while preserving what has always been the strength of Bormioli Luigi, quality and service"". However, ""quality and service are principles that are increasingly hard to achieve,"" staff at the company's headquarters in Parma admits. Indeed, the company had to cope with high pressure from customers to decrease its costs and give up its ""quality has its price"" policy. ""But we're still holding on, Alberto Bormili insists, and will hold on!"" France is the first market for Bormioli Luigi, 41% of sales are shipped on the other side of the Alps. The USA with 21% of the sales and the United Kingdom (17%) follow. ""I am not in favour of reaching the full capacity of our production lines at any price,"" Alberto Bormioli insists. ""This would inevitably lead us to decrease prices and quality"". The right production tool for supplying the right market at the right moment… It's an obsession for this visionary native of Parma, who states: ""I'd rather invest my money in industrial equipment than in a bank"". A wise thought by a wise man! Alberto Bormioli has the sense of entrepreneurship, but remains cautious. The choice to acquire the plant of its colleague Bormioli Rocco, in Milan, was carefully analysed. ""The choice to have a part of the activity in a city that is 100 km away from our headquarters is perfect for me, Mr Bormioli says. Even if, for me, it's already a kind of delocalisation."" However, the company is already present outside the Italian peninsula, through a finishing factory bought in 2005 and located in Coulommiers, France. ""Finishing is an interesting topic"", Alberto Bormioli insists. ""Do not be surprised if we launch an operation on this segment… And sooner than you're expecting."" Otherwise, plastic is also a hot topic currently at Bormioli Luigi's. Yes, your read well, plastic… So far, Bormioli Luigi's staff in Parma remains proud to claim making the ""most beautiful glass in the World""."
"""We're not anxious for 2009,"" Michel Cochet, Codipack","Premium Beauty News - What is the outcome of the year 2008, so far, and what is your vision of the next months? Michel Cochet - As far as Codipack is concerned, 2008 is a positive year in the packaging for cosmetic and make-up products, in particular with our main partner, the Italian manufacturer of plastic bottles, Pibiplast and its subsidiary Bomal. In parallel, Agatech (plastic tubes) and Regi (formulation and private labelling of make-up products) have been continuing their regular growth. Eventually, the only discordant factor is in the perfumery activity, with the closure of the Spanish automatic glassmaker Crisbisbal in 2007. However, we have maintained the development of standard models and we are launching two new 100ml vials made in Europe on the beginning of October (""Losange"" and ""King"" models). What's positive, in this sector, is our new partnership with Eurocap, a plastic injection factory located in Dubaï, specialised in Surlyn and polypropylene caps and in standard products, with the creation of a range of 15 original models with a 15mm diameter ring. For the next 6 months, we may see a slowdown in the creation of new models. In my opinion, the problem is also with the media that have been repeating the same information: ""recession in the autumn""… So far, our order backlog is still very healthy and we're not excessively anxious for 2009. Premium Beauty News - Full Service appears to become a major market trend for packaging suppliers. What's your offer in this area? Michel Cochet - Full Service is a very attractive concept, both for customers and for suppliers, however it requires a very specific organization, in particular for cosmetic and make-up products, indeed it implies to address several new issues in addition to production, such as acceptable claims, regulations… As far as perfumery is concerned, Full Service is more accessible, there are new brands in the business who are only dealing with a single partner… we are currently working on two new projects for foreign markets. We try to offer them our know-how, Codipack has been existing for 20 years, with our network of flexible suppliers, who are able to supply small and medium quantities."
Verreries Brosse to double production capacity,"Actually, the executive team at Verreries Brosse is expecting a great ""leap forward"" for the company. Their new automatic oven, with a production capacity of 55 tons a day, will start production in April, pouring the first glass drops in each of the company's four brand new I.S. machines. The French glassmaker, which joined Italian group Zignano Vetro in 2001, will double its production capacity, thanks to an investment of EUR 30 million. ""It will be a major step of the company's history,"" Marc Cooper, General manager, told Premum Beauty News, ""and the conclusion of a long process, initiated with the acquisition by Zignano Vetro, to restore the company's positioning. By the way, I'd like to seize this opportunity to honour Giuseppe Breviari, who is the person at the origin of the company's revival, and who passed away prematurely last year."" Actually, the company had difficult times at the beginning of the decade. Indeed, Verreries Brosse were on the verge of bankruptcy. The industrial equipment was not matching the demand and the staff was depressed and unmotivated. ""Hopefully, the brand image and the company's reputation, were not excessively impacted by the poor financial situation,"" Marc Cooer insists. At this time, Zignano Vetro invested EUR 20 million in the building of an automatic oven with a 35 tons a day capacity, and chose to keep almost all the staff. Within a short period, the perspective of a successful outcome became tangible, and orders skyrocketed. ""Our turnover reached EUR 45 million in 2007,"" Marc Copper says, ""50% of which is made on foreign market, and we hold a 4% share of the world's market"". Flexibility, shortened development delays, and a glass quality that everybody acclaims… are the main assets of the French glassmaker, who recently supplied vials for Cartier's Roadster (100 ml) and the latest Lanvin's launch. ""Belonging to the Zignago Vetro group is important regarding the investment capacity which is required in our industry, Marc Cooper underlines, but it is also a great opportunity and a necessity in the search for new markets. Indeed, when a customer orders series exceeding ou production capabilities, we can forward the order to our Italian colleagues. That's exactly what happened with the 'Polo Adventure' line. We therefore aim to reinforce connections between our two production units""."
M-real gets prepared to the future,"M-real, one of Europe's leading producers of high-end cardboards and papers, recently sold its Graphic Papers Business Area, which gathers products designed to quality printing in the press and media sectors, to South African group Sappi Ltd. The transaction of a total of EUR 750 million comprises 4 mills in Finland, Germany and Switzerland. M-real's net debt should subsequently decrease approximately by EUR 630 million. The operation should also provide the company with a new leeway to prepare the coming decade. Actually, M-real does not appear to be short of ideas to get prepared to the future, whether it is about its own future or the planet's one. It's probably a chance for the company, considering the numerous challenges the paper industry might have to face. Top of the list are challenges linked to customer satisfaction, in a context of price increases. Obtaining from suppliers to reorganize themselves and to adapt their production standards is another challenge, as the paper industry will have to reduce costs. Last but not least, the industry must become more eco-friendly to address the growing demand from the general . M-real Consumer Packaging's response is based on a new concept aiming at upgrading the overall performance of its cardboards: LITE4U: – ""L"" stands for ""lightweightening"" of products, one of the areas where M-real made the heaviest investments over the latest years, with the aim to obtain lighter cardboards offering the same properties than heavier ones. – ""I"" stands for the ""innovative"" external aspect and the performance of M-real's cardboards. – ""T"" stands for ""time"", as M-real's new organisation and manufacturing processes help saving time. – ""E"" stands for ""environment"". – ""4"" refers to the group's 4 manufacturing sites. – ""U"" stands for M-real's unique cardboard offering. LITE4U is a concept that aims to provide a consistent response to concerns expressed by the group's environment. M-real applies the concept to its five product ranges (Carta Integra, Carta Solida, Carta Prima, Simecote) and, of course, to the latest one, Carta Elega. Showcased for the first time at the Drupa 2008, the world's most important event for the print media, Carta Elega is a range of lightweight fully coated folding boxboards, ideally adapted to the beauty industry's requirements. The range offers very good printing results as well as very good surface properties, a superior visual smoothness, high brightness and equal bluish-white shade on both sides. Carta Elega is available in 200-380 gsm. As far as environment protection is concerned, Carta Elega continues the lightweighting theme of M-real cardboards. Lighter weight boards bring both cost savings and create less waste throughout the value chain. M-real's sales totalled EUR 4.4 billion. The company will participate in the Luxe Pack tradeshow in Monaco, from October 28 to 31, 2008."
Five key ingredient launches spotted at in-cosmetics Global in Paris,"With Sensory Apple Pomace, Codif Technologie Naturelle introduced its very first functional ingredient. This upcycled alternative to PMMA (small particle size, oil absorption capacity, good spreading surface) is fully biodegradable. It is a micronized sensory powder with mattifying, smoothing and covering properties sourced from apple pomace. It can be used for powder, fluid and compact products. To create its new moisturizing active ingredient, Mibelle Biochemistry was inspired by the concept of pine cone scales, which open and close depending on weather conditions! Derived from the recycling of pine cones that are hand-collected in selected French forests PinoPlex [1] penetrates the hair, retaining water and flattening the hair cuticle, leaving hair smoother, shinier and more resistant to breakage. It improves the hair fiber integrity and prevents split ends. PinoPlex is derived from pine cones that are hand-collected in exceptional and carefully selected French forests. The new eco-friendly active developed by Laboratoires Expanscience is based on the regenerative cultivation of lin. Obtained using a green process, it is designed to protect, regenerate, and strengthen the skin and hair against daily aggressions. With a protected and reinforced barrier, skin can ensure its regeneration. But that is not all: the way it is grown is also good for the soil and biodiversity. Gaïaline is made from lin grown according to the principles of certified and regenerative conservation agriculture. Obtained by molecular distillation, the liposoluble active is a linseed oil concentrate enriched with unsaponifiables. On the occasion of in-cosmetics global, Roquette Beauté has introduced its latest ingredient, Beauté by Roquette ST 730 [2], a water-resistant film former with a clinically proven lifting effect. Derived from pea starch, Beauté by Roquette ST 730 at 5% showed higher water resistance compared to industry benchmark film formers, such as pullulan and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), at the same concentration. In an in vivo study on 40 volunteers to analyze its tightening power, Beauté by Roquette ST 730 at 4% significantly decreases fine lines and wrinkles. 82% of the study participants said that fine lines and wrinkles were diminished. For sensitive skin prone to atopy, Solabia debuts Serenibiome, a 100% natural, COSMOS-approved and twice patented active ingredient. The active design was bioinspired by an epiphytic fungus that protects its host by releasing a powerful glycolipid. Serenibiome bio-selectively inhibits Staphylococcus aureus colonization of the skin to tackle the itch-scratch vicious cycle."
Perfumery: Producers of natural ingredients join forces at the WPC show,"Premium Beauty News - What unites these companies that are offering a strongly diversified palette of fragrance ingredients? Virginie Gervason - For the very first time, seven major natural ingredients' producers, coming from the four corners of the planet, will join forces to share their values and commitment. Evolving in different contexts, they are small or medium sized, responsible entrepreneurs, committed on the long term to their customers around the globe and all actors of their value chain, taking risks and investing every day to improve their practices every day and managing demanding third parties certifications. They know perfectly the communities they work directly with, they act for nature and biodiversity preservation in their regions, they invest in state of the art industrial facilities and produce the highest quality of natural ingredients that make the most sustainable perfumers' creative palette. They share the same passion, same willingness to embark actors to preserve these resources, raise the same challenges regarding the future and elaborate multiple solutions to share. This unique ""momentum"", imagined and organized by Resperfuma, in close collaboration with each of the producers and with the support and expertise of Dominique Roques, will bring together: Agroforex Company, a producer of benzoin and aquilaria from Laos; Enio Bonchev (damascena rose from Bulgaria); Jacarandas (ylang ylang and pink berry from Madagascar); Jasmine CE.Pvt.Ltd (vetiver and Indian flowers); Nelixia (guaiac wood from Paraguay, cardamom from Guatemala, etc.); SCA3P (lavenders and aromatic plants from France); Verger Naturals (cinnamon, black pepper and Sri Lankan spices). Premium Beauty News - Natural resources used in perfumery are highly diversified, some of them come from crops, others from wild plants, but all are very sensitive to climate change and environmental shifts. Are the consequences already visible? Do small producers have the means to adapt? Dominique Roques - Climate and environmental shifts obviously impact aromatic perfumery products. Climate change mainly impacts water resources, which are disrupted by changing rain patterns. Thus, significant, long and costly investments are required, the profitability of which can be questioned. For examples, Lavandin producers in France, rose producers in Bulgaria and, in India, small jasmine farmers must also entirely rethink water management on their farms in order to adapt to new rainfall regimes. As far as the environment is concerned, one of the major recurring problems is deforestation. It threatens several important perfume trees such as Styrax or Balsam Peru in Central America and especially guaiac wood in Paraguay. However, even in the Chaco forest, that has been heavily deforested to expand livestock areas, initiatives are beginning to emerge to demonstrate that the value of a perfume ingredient like guaiac can be instrumental to slow down the spiral of damages, in particular through sustainable management plans and by providing owners with a financially attractive alternative. Small producers are the key players behind these initiatives and the future of many of these products is in their hands, as long as they are supported by the industry."" Premium Beauty News - A panel discussion on the sustainability of the natural ingredient supply chain is also at the educational agenda of the WPC. Can you unveil its main outlines? Dominique Roques - I will moderate a debate with three panellists, Elisa Aragon (Nelixia), Filip Lissicharov (Enio Bonchev) and Raja Palaniswamy (Jasmine CE PVT) on the following question: ""Naturals: what does it take to source sustainably?"" Indeed, the sourcing of natural perfumery ingredients has been going through major changes for the past ten years. The growing awareness and expectations of a significant part of perfume consumers have driven our industry (F&F companies and brands) to question former producers' practices and drive improvements at source. This has led to significant demands and move towards third party certifications. A few years down the road, our panel will discuss the situation of leading producers from America, Europe and Asia. What is their vision and experience of this new trends? Are certifications well suited to the social and environmental realities of their countries, and is the market ready to bear the extra cost resulting of such requirements?

Eurofragance adds a new captive to its palette of fragrance ingredients,"Developed within Eurofragance Innovation Center in Barcelona, this third captive ingredient (only for the use of in-house perfumers) is a synthetic molecule designed to for us convey a sensation of natural freshness in Fine Fragrance, Home Care and Personal Care compositions. Named after its ability to exude fresh, invigorating and energizing notes, Euphorion evokes a euphoric breath of fresh air. According to Eurofragance, Euphorion's most remarkable attribute is a compelling green scent that confers a deep identity to fragrance formulas, even at minimal doses. Perfumers on the project team noticed that as well as imparting a feeling of natural freshness to compositions, Euphorion amplifies the freshness of other key ingredients and can: intensify the freshness of aromatic notes like rosemary and sage; accentuate the greenness of fruity notes like tropical fruit, blackcurrant and grapefruit; blend gracefully with woody and spicy notes like pepper and nutmeg. Furthermore, Euphorion brings out a greener tone in fougère notes and adds aromatic intensity to leathery notes. Beyond freshness, certain perfumers noted another olfactive attribute, more reminiscent of salty foods and umami, that blends perfectly with spicy, fruity, toasted hazelnut, green and lemony notes and conjures the aroma of oil-rich seeds and cured ham. The profile has sparked the interest of creative perfumers, who see an original alternative to sweet gourmand notes. ""In Western societies, the idea of freshness is expressed through a wide range of olfactive associations, including the outdoors, natural landscapes, citruses and other fruits, roots, spices and aromatic plants, all of which provide inspiration for perfume designers. The occasional difficulty of sourcing and replicating such natural ingredients have prompted many perfume houses in recent decades to develop synthetic raw materials that evoke similar feelings of freshness,"" said Eurofragance in a statement. According to Eurofragance, in addition to its olfactive features, Euphorion offers several advantages in terms of sustainability: it is produced using little energy; it generates little waste; and it offers maximum impact at minimal doses. The new captive will be presented at the in-cosmetics Global trade fair held in Paris on April 16–18, 2024."

"Focusing on upcycling coffee grounds, Cabeco launches two cosmetic ingredients","Cabeco (standing for ""Cascading of Benefits of Coffee"") was born from the inquisitiveness of a coffee producer and a scientist and their concern about the ""economic, ecological, and human waste"" of coffee farming and its industrial processing. Thus, the company focused its researches on coffee grounds derived from the production of freeze-dried coffee. Alone, European producers of instant coffee alone 2 million tons of industrial coffee grounds, which are currently burnt or methanized. A characterization study of the components of coffee grounds recovered from the instant coffee production process unveiled a series of interesting molecules, from caffeine to less expected substances, such as a series of oligomer, oligoglucan and oligopeptide managers of skin health and the microbiome. In order to create high value active ingredients from this resource, which used to be seen as waste, Cabeco has developed and patented a sustainable extraction process. ""This green process uses no solvents, emits no CO2, and creates no waste,"" highlights the company. This process allows for the upcycling of 100% of the coffee grounds that Cabeco transforms into two 100% natural cosmetic raw materials: Cofoil, a semi-liquid lipid, highly regenerative/reparative active ingredient with several benefits for cutaneous tissues; and Cofex, an ultra-soft exfoliant powder. Cofoil is a new 100% upcycled lipid. This semi-liquid active ingredient, golden yellow to dark orange in colour, offers a slightly perceptible hint of coffee aroma that can be masked easily, if required. Tested on distressed skin explants, Cofoil demonstrated its capacity to enhance the healing process and unveiled key cell behaviour during the restoration of youth. According to Cabeco, Cofoil acts on the main factors of skin youth (support fibres, immune-protectors, defensins, aquaporins, oligomers and precursors) to boost skin regeneration and reparation. It increases layering of the stratum corneum and densifies the epidermal neocollagen. When at ambient temperature, Cofoil does not become rancid over prolonged storage and no preservatives are needed. Antibacterial activity has been proven versus a wide range of germs including multi-resistant Staph. Usage rate is typically 2 à 5%. The Cofex range of exfoliants is produced simultaneously with Cofoil. Cofex designates a natural insoluble coffee powder, that is soft and supple in feel and completely devoid of unpleasant abrasiveness. The structure is that of thin leaflets of supple woven fibres, which gently roll over the skin and are non-abrasive. Ice brown chocolate in colour, leaving no stain, it is virtually odourless, with a barely perceptible hint of coffee. Several ranges are available: – Cofex Extra offers particul sizes from150-300µm. It is a gentle, active and stimulating exfoliant; – Cofex Ultra Active Powder is a refined version (less than 50 µm); – Cofex, for all other fine grades available on request. Cofex powders can be used in all formulae, water and oil based, emulsions and dry preparations. They are never ionized. Cabeco recommends using Cofex Extra at a concentration of 5 to 15%, as an exfoliant, and 1 to 5% for soaps. With these two new cosmetic actives, Cabeco aims to be part of a transformative process for the coffee sector. Indeed, coffee is the most consumed beverage on earth after water. Two third of humanity drink coffee every day, a total of 2.5 billion cups a day! However, smallholder growers (100 million families- Brazil, Vietnam, Mexico, Ethiopia, Columbia…) are hardly benefiting from global coffee trade. Undergoing financial pressure, extreme weather and climate conditions, and reduced yields of a demanding crop, many growers have begun to uproot plants in favour of other cash crops. Actually, for many of them, coffee growing is no longer viable nor profitable. This is why Cabeco has chosen to join a Regenerative Agriculture program and to create new revenue streams throughout the coffee sector by returning part of its profits where most needed, as part of an approach framed and validated by Gold Rainforest Alliance membership."

Silab combines hygiene and skin care in deodorants with a meadowsweet extract,"For their new development, Silab sought to combine the effectiveness expected by consumers of deodorants against malodors, with the growing quest for products of natural origin that are respectful of the skin. In order to better address the mechanism leading to the generation of odors, Silab developed an original modeling study that demonstrated quantitative (increased abundance) and qualitative modifications (increased enzymatic activity) of Staphylococcus hominis strains sampled from the axillary microbiota of malodorous volunteers subjected to physical activity, compared to a non-odorous panel. In response to this problem, Silab has shown that their new ingredient limits the excessive abundance of S. hominis in the axillary cutaneous microbiota and targets the enzymatic activity of this bacterial species. Deolya thus targets the source of perspiration odors while leaving the microbial diversity of this skin zone unaffected. The effectiveness of Deolya against odors was tested on a Caucasian panel of both sexes participating in a physical activity. The study showed a reduction of perspiration odors by 58% as of the first application of the product containing the active ingredient. This deodorant efficacy, assessed by an olfactory evaluation from a qualified expert panel, is confirmed at the molecular level by a significant 76.3% reduction of the malodorous 3M3SH thiol. According to Silab, these effects are also observed after seven days of daily use and without having applied the deodorant Deolya in the morning before the physical activity session, underlining the immediate and long-term effect of the deodorant. In addition, according to Silab, Deolya reduces inflammation, thus significantly decreasing the frequency of unpleasant underarm sensations appearance, daily but also after shaving or epilation (after 28 days of use). In particular, the active ingredient strengthens the barrier function, resulting in vivo in an improvement of Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) of underarm skin. Thanks to this multifunctional benefits, Deolya is a natural deodorant solution providing comfort and soothing to the axillary zone. For this development, Silab research beneficially used the tellimagrandin-type ellagitannins and proanthocyanidols found in meadowsweet, giving Deolya its unique polyphenolic profile. Obtained from French suppliers certified for organic agriculture and traced back to the harvest site, this raw material complies with Silab's criteria for traceability and sustainability. Deolya is a patented active ingredient recommended in all deodorant care products at a dose of 0.1 to 1.0%. Available in aqueous solution, it complies with biodiversity regulations and has a natural origin content of 99.2% (ISO 16128). It complies with international cosmetics regulations (Europe, USA, China, Japan, etc.)."
"Givaudan debuts Nympheal, a fragrance ingredient with a white floral profile","Givaudan's latest fragrance ingredient builds on the company's expertise in muguet aldehydes. According to Givaudan, Nympheal combines the best olfactive and technical qualities of other molecules in this category. It provides a fresh and opulent muguet fragrance with a hint of linden blossom, adding volume, floral creaminess, and excellent diffusion to fragrance compositions. ""Nympheal is an outstanding fresh and opulent muguet ingredient, with a linden blossom accent bringing tremendous volume and creaminess,"" said Dominique Lelièvre, Ingredients Research Perfumer at Givaudan. The new molecule [1] is a colourless liquid that can be used by perfumers in water applications. Its versatility will enable to bring a robust white floral note in various cross-category applications including shampoos and antiperspirants. Givaudan also identified an interesting synergy of Nympheal and patchouli oil that creates a particular effect, since they do not overlay, but interact to bring a unique signature. In alignment with the Givaudan's sustainability goals, Nympheal is a biodegradable molecule that follows the guidelines set by the OECD. It was developed according to the principles of green chemistry, and in line with the company's Safe by Design approach with the aim to match the sustainability expectations of consumers' today. ""It is a delight to share this molecule with customers, as it opens up new possibilities for creating memorable and long- lasting fragrances. Nympheal is the result of collaboration between Givaudan's researchers, perfumers, and regulatory experts, showcasing their dedication and expertise in developing ingredients that make a difference to fragrance compounds,"" said Paul-Erwan Camenen, Head of Fragrance Ingredients Business at Givaudan."
"""Perfume innovation comes from new ingredients"", Isaac Sinclair, Symrise","Premium Beauty News - You worked for 12 years in Brazil, as part of the Symrise team of perfumers-creators in São Paulo. What do you think are the specificities of perfume in this country? Isaac Sinclair - Brazil is the largest global market in terms of volume and is very well ranked in value, although the latter fluctuates according to exchange rates. Brazilians are clearly big fans of fragrances. Compared to other countries, studies show that they spend a very large proportion of their income on perfumes. Brazilians buy several perfumes and decide which one to wear depending on their mood or on the circumstances. In Brazil, people perfume themselves a lot, several times a day, because due to the climate, they generally shower between three and five times a day. This provides an opportunity to change fragrances, for example, in anticipation of a romantic moment. In Brazil alone, 4,000 stores have opened under the name of O Boticário, and one of their blockbusters can sell millions of units. It is quite exciting for a perfumer to recognize ""their"" perfume on their way to a restaurant! In Brazil, the perfumes that sell well share one feature: their ""lasting power"". It determines the quality/price ratio in the eyes of consumers. In concrete terms, whether you are creating a fresh or oriental fragrance, it has to be a ""bomb"" and last on the skin, otherwise consumers feel cheated. Perfumers need to master this skill, and we sometimes use patchouli for this purpose. Therefore, we are not confined to a few appealing styles or specific olfactory families to meet this demand. Another peculiarity of this vast market is that women ignore marketing categories and can choose so-called men's fragrances simply because they like them. And this was well before the gender-fluid trend. Many women wear very fresh, but also long-lasting ""fougere"" fragrances, such as Kaiak Aero by Natura. Premium Beauty News - Which of the locally-produced raw materials did you particularly enjoy working with? Isaac Sinclair - Brazil boasts one of the richest biodiversities in the world. Many ingredients originate from this continent, even if we are not aware of it. For example, the classic tonka bean and rosewood come from the Amazon rainforest, as do cocoa and cashew nut. This country's riches are endless. Symrise has been developing a special programme to help communities grow aromatic plants which no longer renewed themselves, such as priprioca. Its tubers produce an amazing scent reminiscent of cypriol and vetiver. There is also palo santo: its wood is not cut, but the fruit is harvested to obtain essential oil. At first, it evokes blackcurrant, before returning to the wood smell itself. It is a very stimulating environment for perfumers. In addition to perfume plants, Head Space can be used to capture new scent profiles from fruit. Cashew is generally known as a nut, but it is actually part of a whole, sublime fruit that can be used for perfumes. Its flesh reminds of a slightly acid tropical guava. Usually, we just use the cashew nut, but in Brazil, perfumers also use the fruit. In fact, it is featured in a delicious recipe of the national cocktail, the cashew fruit caipirinha. Thanks to the Head Space technology, we were able to recreate the smell of this delicate fruit in a laboratory. Therefore, Symrise has a Vitessence associated with it. There is also cupuaçu, a white-fleshed fruit whose taste is similar to cocoa, and which can be used as an alternative to chocolate in milkshakes. Brazil's biodiversity is fabulous. Plants like patchouli, vetiver, and oranges managed to adapt to the climate, although oranges remain green in the absence of cool nights, as can be seen in Spain. Premium Beauty News – Is this botanical diversity inspiring for a perfumer-creator? Have any of your creative ideas stemmed from one of these ingredients? Isaac Sinclair - Being exposed to new smells in Brazil opened my mind. Anything new stimulates the creative process. Without Brazil, I would not have got that far with certain fruit smells. When you go to Brazil, you realize there is a whole world of different tropical fruits, because at the end of the day, guava does not smell like cocoa, which does not smell like cashew apples... There are real nuances that we are not aware of in Europe or New Zealand. Over there, a whole universe opens up. Personally, in my perfume creation process, I did not really start with an ingredient specific to Brazil, but I was able to use these materials for structures I had in mind. In my case, I would rather say I added Brazilian ingredients to my palette. Generally speaking, there are not many perfumes built around one ingredient. For example, even if a perfume is created around vetiver, it has to be dressed up with citrus fruits or other ingredients. Premium Beauty News – How do you feel about Garden Labs, the 100% natural vegetable extracts offered by Symrise since late 2020? Isaac Sinclair – It is exciting because, just like with Brazilian ingredients, we did not use to have access to all this potential. Ten years ago, we did not have the technology to capture these plant extracts. Before Garden Labs, if you wanted to create an artichoke, you had to create a chord which gave the impression of an artichoke. But we did not have a real artichoke or cauliflower. With theGarden Lab technology, the playing field has become bigger. In my opinion, a large part of perfume innovation comes from new ingredients. For example, when Calone arrived, this molecule opened up a new path. Fragrances like L'Eau d'Issey (Issey Miyake) and Escape (Calvin Klein) were only possible because of it. Now we are seeing the same phenomenon with natural ingredients. At first, new ingredients are used very little. Then, over time, they gain more importance. In the future, we might see more ""savoury"" or even ""salty"" scents. The Garden Lab range extends beyond vegetables. Symrise already has passion fruit. We did not have natural passion fruit before, so we had to use a combination of molecules. It is a great step forward, especially as it involves upcycling. Thanks to this technology, it is possible to recycle artichoke waste from the food industry to extract its smell. Or onion or cauliflower waste. In the case of passion fruit, we work with juice residues. We could consider developing a tomato Garden Lab by stepping in the juice or gazpacho production cycles... Unlike with the Head Space technology, these are entirely natural products. Premium Beauty News – You recently joined the Symrise team in Paris. Could your experience and the use of ingredients from Brazil be transposed here and appeal to the French and global markets? Isaac Sinclair - Why not? Innovation is always welcome. Everyone wants innovation. So, I think any of the ingredients that grow in Brazil could be very well accepted. We know that blackcurrant or passion fruit can play a decisive role in an olfactory structure. So, why not cashew apples, if certain techniques are used? I am also thinking about cupuaçu, with its chocolate flavour. The diversity of Brazilian fruits is not limited to coconut. Generally speaking, I think that when you create successful perfumes, whether for Europe or Brazil, you have to show your skills and know how to combine the creative and technical aspects. If you are satisfied with the technical aspect and do not take into account the creative factor, you are really just a technician. You do not do anything new. But in our industry, new products also have to pass the tests of potential consumers. I think lots of proposals created in Brazil would also work here in terms of structure, if we refer to the tests that have been carried out. Premium Beauty News – In your opinion, how will perfume creation evolve and innovate over the next few years? Isaac Sinclair – The world is constantly changing and consumers change too. They are much more educated about perfumes than they were 20 years ago. They are increasingly aware of what they are buying. In the perfume industry, we are now seeing greater transparency, as a result of new technologies capable of revealing the ingredients found in a formula, when they used to remain secret. I am thinking of GCMS (Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry), for example. Niche brands help raise the cultural level of perfume consumers, who show increasingly sophisticated needs. It is a real challenge for perfumers. This article was published in our special issue Fragrance Innovation, to read here."
Evonik launches skin-identical biotech-based vegan collagen ingredient,"Vecollage Fortify L [1] leverages Evonik's competencies in biotechnology, collagen, and skin care to meet the demand for vegan collagen for applications such as anti-aging and hydrating creams. Evonik said the launch of Vecollage Fortify L brings a step closer to generating a platform of non-animal and sustainable collagen. This platform will consist of several types of vegan collagen developed by Evonik and together with partners. Vecollage Fortify L was developed in partnership with the company Modern Meadow Inc., which specializes in fermentation-based protein development. Made using fermentation technology, the new ingredient thus meets increasing market demand for vegan collagen. ""For decades, collagen has been a sought-after ingredient in cosmetics and dermatology for its ability to improve firmness, elasticity and hydration in the skin. Traditionally, collagen comes from animal and marine sources, but consumers are increasingly looking for ethical and sustainable alternatives, while brands are concerned about supply security issues,"" explains Evonik in a statement. Collagen is challenged by both intrinsic factors, like aging, and extrinsic factors, like sun exposure. Through in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies, Vecollage Fortify L is demonstrated to sustaining and reinforcing the skin's collagen. According to Evonik, it provides dual benefits to fortify collagen in the skin by preventing age-related degradation and stimulating the skin's own collagen production. ""The future of skincare is all about biotech-based collagen! Brand owners can now offer consumers sustainably sourced, skin-identical collagen,"" said Yann d'Hervé, head of Evonik's Care Solutions business line."
Perfume ingredients: towards more sustainable extraction techniques,"Naturalness is no longer an option for consumers, whose ecological awareness and need for transparency are growing by the day. 68% of consumers say they would like to see more responsible perfumes, according to the Firmenich Hub Global Study conducted in 2021. Now, all perfume brands – and not just specialist niche brands – want to highlight their ""green"" ingredients. For example, in December 2023, the advertising campaign for Guerlain's Aqua Allegoria Forte clearly featured the statement ""More than 90% natural origin."" And yet, natural ingredient extraction does not always rhyme with sustainability. On the one hand, conventional distillation processes for natural ingredients require water and high energy consumption in order to reach the temperature of 100°C required for condensation (the vapour takes the odorous components out of the plants). On the other hand, extraction with volatile solvents can be polluting. Therefore, perfume companies seek to give up on these two processes. At the end of 2023, the L'Oréal group announced an exclusive partnership with Cosmo International Fragrances to deploy a new approach to natural ingredient extraction based on green sciences. ""Cosmo International Fragrance worked for five years to develop this new extraction process. It is a green innovation in that it is petrochemical- and heat-free. This slow technique involves capturing the volatile fragrant molecules using the air flow,"" explains Alexandrine Demachy, Managing Director France of Cosmo International Fragrances. Initially, this new technology was applied to tuberose, a legendary perfume flower. ""The idea is to let the flower express itself. When you close your eyes, you are on the flower,"" adds Alexandrine Demachy. ""The partnership with L'Oréal's Green Sciences department opens up new possibilities for us, in particular that of processing silent flowers, the grail of perfumers. It is also very rewarding for our research and development team."" This process differs from Head Space, which requires laboratory recreation after analyzing the olfactory spectrum of flowers in their natural environment. Here, picking is a necessary operation. ""The advantage of our system is that it is very agile and mobile. We can process the flowers directly in the field to capture their volatile molecules. The flowers remain intact throughout the process, they can have a second life and be processed differently, offering a second olfactory profile. This way, no waste is generated,"" points out Alexandrine Demachy. ""Traditional processes still exist. We are not replacing these ingredients (essential oils, extracts, essences, etc.), because we do not capture the flower in its entirety, just its fragrance. On the other hand, we add a new product to the perfumer's palette: the smell of the fresh plant characterized by its volatile molecules."" Symrise, for its part, has been communicating since 2018 on the SymTrap process, which reduces the extraction carbon footprint, while recovering residues from the agri-food industry. These residues are mainly in the form of aqueous solutions (e.g. residual juice from fruit extraction). This upcycling model has a very low impact, because it is a cold process free from chemical solvents. SymTrap ingredients substitute natural fruity notes, which perfumers previously lacked, for synthetic molecules such as C14 aldehyde (for the scent of peach) or Laire Prunol base (for plum). Since 2019, SymTrap vegetables (artichoke, asparagus, leek, cauliflower and onion) have been added, bringing new sharpness to the perfumer's palette and opening up other creative perspectives. ""Before the arrival of Symrise's Garden Labs, we had to use our olfactory memory to recreate a scent close to the vegetable. So, this new collection of natural ingredients is very disruptive and rewarding,"" says Alexandra Carlin, Perfumer at Symrise. At dsm-firmenich, naturalness is also a key issue. The company promotes its Firgood technology, which works with electromagnetic vibrations, mainly using the water already contained in the biomass as the extraction vector. The benefits are diverse: lower water and energy consumption and reduced heat exposure time for the raw materials, which preserves the integrity of heat-sensitive olfactory molecules. ""Firgood opens up new olfactory territories for perfumers, with different facets and premium profiles,"" says Mélanie Verhille, Sustainable Perfumery Marketing & Communication Director / Sustainability Strategy at dsm-firmenich. Firgood also makes it possible to process new plants or silent flowers that have not yet been exploited in fine perfumery. These advances in impact reduction also have a concomitant effect: that of broadening the creative palette of perfumers. In this quest for naturalness, virtuous methods combine to improve the environmental performance of the final fragrance. At dsm-firmenich, the Protopia base for fine perfumes combines an extract of Firgood Pear, several over-cycled materials (Geraniol 60 RC, Romandolide, a cedar of Virginia), and captive molecules obtained with biotechnology (Ambrox Super and Pulpanat). At the Fragrance Innovation Summit 2023, Robertet, an expert in natural ingredients, took stock of its CleanRScent programme launched ten years ago. This continuous improvement programme is aimed to develop green technologies and solvents with a high degree of biodegradability and recyclability. This innovation is based on the use of Dimethyl Carbonate, an alternative solvent whose extraction performance is comparable to that of hexane, only without any impact on health, and with a low environmental footprint. ""This process, which led to two patents, is now cost-effective on an industrial scale"", says Céline Louis Ughetto, Head of Product Management – F&F ingredients at Robertet Group. Today, the CleanRScent collection includes absolutes (Maté, Toasted Tonka Bean, Bourbon Vanilla) and a bleached cypress wood. These high-quality ingredients provide olfactory profiles that are very close to nature. Mane's E-Pure Jungle Essences offer a responsible alternative to absolutes and are considered natural according to standard ISO 9235. They are based on perfume plants and flowers, using a process combining enfleurage in a first phase (with a neutral vegetable oil as a solvent) and supercritical CO2 extraction in a second phase. Mane's E-Pure Jungle Essences are extremely faithful to what nature offers and are intended for the fine perfume industry. Used in a second stage, supercritical CO2 extraction requires the temperature to be reduced to as low as 30°C in order to bring the carbon dioxide to a liquid state. What's more, once depressurized, this alternative medium leaves no residual elements. It should be noted that CO2 can be obtained by recovering organic waste, in particular during methanization processes, which themselves generate green energy. For its part, Maison Lautier 1795 – which brings together Symrise's collections of perfume ingredients – provided insights on the enfleurage processes it has been testing since 2020 at various production sites, using locally-produced fats such as cocoa butter and jojoba oil. The results are also very convincing in terms of the aromatic spectrum and quality of the extracts. Beyond responsible sourcing, which is aimed to preserving both the lives of farming communities and biodiversity, environmental concerns also relate to the increasing scarcity of natural resources. At the end of 2023, Grasse-based Robertet became the first perfume group to install a BioPod designed by the start-up Interstellar Lab. The aim of this AI-managed greenhouse is to grow crops with a high added-value using the least resources possible, while generating a reduced carbon footprint. The Interstellar Lab start-up has since joined the L'Oréal Green Sciences Incubator programme as part of the L'Oréal for the Future programme. Biotechnology is also one of the avenues being explored by perfume companies to reduce the use of fossil fuels. Fermentation using enzymes, natural proteins or other micro-organisms can be an effective replacement for chemical reagents. In 2019, Givaudan announced a new technique based on the fermentation of organic cane sugar to produce Ambrofix, a fully biodegradable alternative to ambergris. This product, in which all carbon atoms in the base material are recombined in the final product molecules, generates no carbon waste or pollutants. It is in line with the company's FiveCarbon Path vision. For its part, Takasago is doing white biotechnology research based on the living world. Biocyclamol is produced from fully renewable resources and is biodegradable. This new ingredient has a tenacious floral note similar to that of lily of the valley, both pure and abstract. ""At the end of the day, we are all trying to be more sustainable in our approaches, products and raw materials"", says Alexandrine Demachy. ""As manufacturers, we all need to advance our research on natural products and synthesis. We need to challenge ourselves. We all have the same brief (less solvents, less energy, etc.). Everyone, whether in industry or research, interprets this brief in their own way, with their own ideas and discoveries, and all solutions are complementary. The products released are all different, and that is to the benefit of perfumers, who have an ever-larger choice for their compositions.""

How to make sustainable perfume alcohol?,"Manufacturers wishing to achieve a high ecodesign index have been paying particular attention to ethyl alcohol, or ethanol, which can account for up to 95% of a fragrance composition. 'Green' alcohol can help reduce their products' carbon footprint and demonstrate a strong commitment. Various solutions and technologies are emerging to meet these expectations. Developed by LanzaTech, the technology for recycling the carbon emitted by factories to make ethanol caused a stir when, in 2021, Coty announced they had chosen this alcohol for their fragrances. In spring 2023, this decision led to the launch of the first Gucci fragrance to contain 100% of ethanol derived from recycled carbon. This technology offers two advantages. It captures the carbon emitted by industrial steel mills, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, and then converts it into sustainable raw materials or fuels using biotechnology. A natural bacterium ferments the carbon contained in the gas released by the factories to produce a predetermined raw material. ""We have a whole portfolio of biocatalysts selected for their potential to ferment the carbon contained in the emissions into about a hundred different raw materials"", explains Babette Pettersen, Vice President Europe at LanzaTech. These include ethanol, which, once purified, is used for perfumes. The production is based on the CO2 emitted by four plants located in China: to date, it represents 200,000 tonnes of ethanol, most of which goes to the sustainable fuel market. ""For each plant, we manage to reduce CO2 emissions into the atmosphere by 150,000 tonnes a year"", notes the vice-president. The ethanol purification phase for the perfume industry takes place in Europe. It involves demanding requirements specific to each brand. And in response to growing customer demand for 100% European sourcing, LanzaTech has just inaugurated its first biocatalysis unit in Belgium. ""This European project launched in 2015 is now up and running. We are going to capture the carbon emitted by the ArcelorMittal plant in Ghent and ferment it to produce ethanol for various European everyday product markets, including perfumes and cleaning products"", explains Babette Pettersen. The ethanol production capacity of 64,000 tonnes opens up new supply possibilities for the perfume industry. ""We expect to have access to around 600,000 tonnes of 'Carbon Smart' ethanol over the next 5 years,"" she adds. CristalCo, a subsidiary of the Cristal Union group and one of France's leading sugar beet cooperatives, now offers the first range of agro-ecological, low-carbon sugars and alcohols, thanks to the Amplify™ programme. The project is based on regenerative agriculture practices applied by some of the cooperative's farmer members. Regenerative agriculture involves preserving soils from erosion in the long term by various means, including covering them with plant varieties that have not been collected, so they are protected from climatic hazards, or limiting their work in order to protect biodiversity. Out of the cooperative's 4,630 growers assessed to date, 1,116 meet the criteria for regenerative agriculture quantified by the RI regeneration index. ""The beetroot produced with regenerative agriculture are pooled with the others, and we then establish a mass balance. This principle is fully accepted by our customers and by the brands"", explains Audrey Taffin, CristalCo's Marketing Manager BtoB. Three major brands of the LVMH group – Parfums Christian Dior, Givenchy Parfums and Kenzo – are also interested in this approach. These three companies have financed a project to support the agro-ecological transition of 380 hectares of beetroot in north-eastern France, in order to produce the equivalent of 45% of their alcohol needs using the mass balance approach. ""Brands usually do not claim they adopted this approach specifically for their fragrances, but rather for their overall commitments,"" notes Audrey Taffin. The second part of Amplify™ is focused on carbon emission reduction. Cristal Union committed to a large energy transition towards renewable resources, which helped reduce its CO₂ emissions by 18% between 2019 and 2022. With this plan, the group now offers decarbonated sugars and alcohols. ""We can make products derived from regenerative, low-carbon agriculture,"" she concludes. Currently in the production phase, Intact Regenerative has been working on a different strategy based on the regenerative cultivation and processing of leguminous plants. This approach promotes sustainable perfume alcohol by reducing its impact on the carbon footprint, water footprint, and preservation of biodiversity. ""Through our technologies, we will reduce production-related emissions by more than 80%, consume 75% less water, and act on biodiversity through plants"", says Alexis Duval, co-founder and Managing Director of Intact Regenerative. The patented technology is based on the choice of leguminous plants, peas, or horse beans. ""Legumes have a positive impact on soil life, unlike conventional crops. They are regenerative. Also, their pollen is gathered by bees, and they help reduce the use of pesticides, because they have a preventive effect on parasitism"", he explains. The main advantage of these plants is that they fix nitrogen in the soil, reducing the need for fertilisers, and therefore reducing the emissions associated with their production. Finally, unlike the crops usually used to produce perfume alcohol (beetroot, maize, sugar cane), legumes make it possible to carry out dry extraction with less water, as well as low-energy fermentation and distillation. ""Taking into account all phases, the sum of several innovations helps us achieve significant results in terms of sustainability. We can also reuse the pea shells in biomass boilers to provide almost all the energy we need"", adds Alexis Duval. The alcohol offered by Intact Regenerative won this year's Special Cleantech Prize at the Cosmetic 360 show. The company made its first investments in a production line based near Orléans, south of Paris. It should be operational in early 2025. A pre-booking system will make it possible for interested brands to position themselves and identify needs. Specialized in helping cosmetic and perfume ingredient suppliers recycle agricultural waste, La Fabrique Végétale has developed sustainable plant-derived alcohol which is 100% upcycled from a French agricultural source. ""We cannot reveal the nature of the co-product now, as it will shortly be launched in collaboration with a major French perfumer, but its performance is much similar to that of beet and maize alcohol, with fruity notes,"" explains Antoine Piccirilli, Technical and Scientific Director. Just like for all upcycled products, this solution avoids competing with agricultural food production and is part of a circular approach. The current supply capacity approaches 400,000 litres, with a large organic volume and a potential of at least 5 million litres in the long term.

Lubrizol launches sensory-enhancer natural film former and thickener,"Lubrizol Life Science Beauty (LLS Beauty) has officially launched its new Sensomer Tara polymer [1], a multifunctional, biodegradable natural film former and thickener, which was previewed at in-cosmetics 2023 in Barcelona. According to the manufacturer, at a concentration of 2%, the new ingredient can reach viscosity of 40,000 mPa∙s, enabling creation for a thicker, creamier and silkier feel in beauty formulations, including moisturizers, sunscreens, hair conditioners, styling products and color treatments. When used in skin care applications, said Lubrizol, Sensomer Tara has a silky feel with no drag or stickiness, while its creamy texture provides good pickup with no stringiness. A blind test [2] revealed a perception of the polymer being softer and less sticky during application, with reduced pilling in afterfeel. According to Lubrizol, Sensomer Tara also has a synergy with Kelco-Care diutan gum that increases the yield value, leading to robust emulsion stabilization and an even higher viscosity. When added to conditioners and hair treatments, Sensomer Tara polymer brings conditioning benefits to the fiber, while providing a smooth and easy to spread texture. In styling applications, it shows better curl retention and better smoothness feel than guar gum. In addition, it has anti-pollution properties, protecting the fiber against particle adhesion. Finally, in coloration it enables no-drip rheology for a better consumer experience. Obtained by a 100% mechanical process undertaken on the Tara (Caesalpinia Spinosa or Tara Spinosa) seed endosperm, Sensomer Tara polymer is COSMOS approved, vegan suitable and microbiome friendly. It is also readily biodegradable (according to OECD 301F), with a natural origin index of 100% (according to ISO16128)."
Silab relaunches Nutripeptides as a repairing concentrate for hair beauty,"At a time when hair care is becoming more sophisticated by adopting skin care strategies, Silab has decided to capitalize on the nourishing and protective benefits that its active ingredient Nutripeptides offers to the skin to care for the scalp and hair. Initially launched, 10 years ago, as a comprehensive anti-aging active ingredient for the skin, Nutripeptides is now finding a new position at the heart of the Skinification of the hair care offering. ""The scalp is exposed daily to multiple factors (mechanical, thermal, chemical, even environmental) causing redness and irritations. These aggressions are not without consequence for the hair: it becomes dull and loses volume. The hair is thin, dry, and brittle. With awareness of this situation, hair care routines are changing in order to simultaneously consider the state of the scalp and quality of the hair,"" explains Silab in a statement. Tests shave shown that Nutripeptides provides a hydrating and soothing action to the scalp after two months of treatment. Redness is significantly reduced, and the active ingredient has an anti-inflammatory effect, demonstrated in vitro by reduced IL-8 secretion. In addition, Nutripeptides improves hair quality thanks to its repairing action on the hair fiber, as demonstrated by Silab through digital imaging. The hair's shine, density, and volume are restored. These effects are significantly perceived by volunteers from the first month of application and intensify over the months of use. Nutripeptides is a patented active ingredient recommended in all hair repair products at the amount of 0.5 to 2.5%. Available in aqueous solution, it displays a natural content of 99.4% (according to ISO 16128). It meets with international cosmetic regulations (Europe, United States, China, Japan, etc.)."
Roquette Beauté unveils a high sensorial performance plant-based thickener,"Introduced on the occasion of the Cosmet'Agora trade show, which took place in Paris on January 16 and 17, 2024, Beauté by Roquette ST 320 [1] is a plant-based versatile thickener and stabilizer designed for gels and emulsions. Sourced from non-GMO maize [2], the new ingredient is vegan suitable and biodegradable. According to Roquette Beauté, it is an easy-to-use thickener, allowing high flexibility in formulating stable cosmetics in a variety of applications and viscosity ranges. Different tests were performed to demonstrate the benefits of the new ingredient. Easy to disperse in cold or warm water, Beauté by Roquette ST 320 strongly enhances viscosity after cooking and is very stable over time in both emulsions and gels. A stabilizer of W/O emulsions (reduction of size droplets), it also has a synergistic thickening effect with emulsifiers and cationic agents, and allows an easy viscosity adjustment by modulating the concentration. Beauté by Roquette ST 320 also acts as a sensory enhancer bringing comforting and cocooning textures to cosmetic formulations. Roquette Beauté explains that as consumers become more mindful of the impact of their beauty routines on their overall well-being, the trend towards holistic beauty continues to gain momentum in the beauty and personal care market. With Beauté by Roquette ST 320, cosmetic formulators can tap into this trend by creating cosy and soft textures. ""This addition to our product range is a great demonstration of our pledge to bring plant-based solutions to the cosmetics industry that meet consumers' expectations for safer products with the right balance of nature and technology, no more no less! At Roquette we focus on high-quality, versatile, and sustainable plant-based ingredients and develop multifunctional solutions providing high performance and amazing sensorial experiences,"" says Bénédicte Courel, Roquette Beauté General Manager."
PAT debuts its Exudactive line with an ingredient to repair the skin barrier,"The French company specialized in the discovery and production of rare – usually inaccessible – active plant compounds for cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and fine chemicals markets is launching HydraQueen Exudactive, a new moisturizing active ingredient dedicated to the restoration of the skin's barrier function and the protection of sensitive skin. It has also demonstrated antioxidant and anti-radical activities, as well as antipollution and energizing benefits. Extracted from meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) roots, a traditional European medicinal plant known for its many biological properties, HydraQueen Exudactive was developed using PAT's aeroponic growing and plant optimization techniques. According to the company, this multiplied by 82 the active ingredient's content in secondary metabolites. In vivo and in vitro efficacy tests have demonstrated the numerous benefits of this natural active ingredient for the skin. According to PAT, HydraQueen Exudactive helps to: restore the fragile balance of the skin's barrier function (+52% on D14); to defend the skin against pollution (TEER +17% on stressed mature skin), dehydration and environmental stress; to maintain internal hydration (+60% on day 14) and to protect against external irritants; and to repair and strengthen sensitive skin. HydraQueen Exudactive is manufactured in France, with a fully controlled production chain traced from seed to active ingredient on the PAT site. All of the company's operations are ISO9001-2015 certified, and their horticultural activities and aeroponic cultivation in France have been awarded a High Environmental Value (HVE) level 3 seal. The aeroponics production method saves cultivated areas helps to save natural resources through a reduction of cultivated areas (and 4 annual harvests and a life expectancy of at least 3 years for plants), the reduction of water consumption by recycling 100% of the culture water (closed cycle), a zero pesticide cultivation process in a natural greenhouse, and by multiplying by 96 times the quantity of molecules collected compared to in open fields cultivation. HydraQueen Exudactive is COSMOS compatible and 100% of natural origin (as defined by ISO 16128). With the launch of HydraQueen Exudactive, PAT also debuts its new Exudactive range, the new name of the ""Plant Milking"" process developed by PAT. A series of other pre-launch ingredients is scheduled to add to the new range. Extracted from plants such as Rhus chinensis and Equisetum hyemale, they are also concentrated in highly active root molecules and offer different cosmetic benefits, such as anti-aging, radiance, and protection. ""At PAT, our commitment to sustainable innovation is at the heart of what we do. We are committed to offering superior quality ingredients for the cosmetic industry while preserving the environment,"" highlights Jean-Paul Fèvre, President of PAT. The launch of this new range is part of PAT's new commercial strategy which is striving to resolve a significant liquidity crisis with the aim of returning to a cash-generating activity from 2025."
Berg+Schmidt launches natural thickener for transparent oils in cold-process,"At the Cosmet'Agora trade show, taking place in Paris from January 16-18, 2024, Berg+Schmidt will premiere BergaCare FG Gel – a new solution designed to thicken transparent oil formulations. The new rheology modifier can be used for both leave-on and rinse-off products. The main advantage of the new ingredient is that it is cold processible. Berg+Schmidt says its natural thixotropic properties enable BergaCare FG Gel to optimally convert liquid oil in Jello-like textures. ""While formulators can already choose between different oil thickeners on the market, none of them is cold-processible,"" explains Sabrina Paltian, Manager Application Technologies at Berg+Schmidt Care Ingredients. In a context of high energy prices, ""this is clearly a huge advantage,"" she adds. BergaCare FG Gel can be used to create transformational textures and a variety of viscosities such as gel-to-oil products. However, to ensure that BergaCare FG Gel together with the selected oil creates a homogeneous mixture, a certain amount of shear force is required for the manufacturing process. ""It is up to the formulator to decide which tool is used to generate this force. BergaCare FG Gel is highly compatible with numerous stirring devices,"" says Berg+Schmidt. BergaCare FG Gel is compatible with commonly used vegetable oils and emollients. It has the ability to create different viscosities depending on the use level. This opens up a broad range of formulating options. In particular, visual appearance of the finished product can be adjusted from a transparent oil gel to dense, yet light, cream, or from fluid oil to solidified gel. ""Only a few natural oil thickeners can actually create transparent systems,"" highlights Sabrina Paltian. Compatibility with different plant-based emollients also helps ensure a well-received sensory experience that supports luxury skin care. ""En vogue concepts like luxurious gel-to-oil textures in anhydrous, nourishing body care applications promise smooth and silky skin both during and after application. Unlike other oil products, thickened oil gels can be applied where they are needed without evaporating or becoming runny,"" concludes Berg+Schmidt."
"Silab launches Myoline, an anti-stress ingredient for sublimated skin","The effect of our emotions on health, and in particular on the condition of the skin, is now well known. ""As a mirror of our emotions, the face is particularly stressed and reveals stressful situations. The tension of facial muscles and the secretion of stress mediators in the skin are responsible for the premature appearance of expression wrinkles and a dull complexion,"" explains Silab. In order to meet the needs of stressed skin, Silab has chosen to investigate the properties watercress, a plant highly concentrated in minerals. The result of these researches is Myoline [1], a new natural active ingredient that targets the behavioural and biological consequences of stress. Myoline has a myorelaxing action in vitro by acting on the neuromuscular junction. This efficacy is reflected in vivo by a ""botox-like"" effect. According to Silab, as of five days of treatment, the first expression lines of young skin are smoothed, and the wrinkles of mature skin are blurred with an effect comparable to that obtained with a retouched photo (""soft focus"" effect). Myoline also influences the secretion of well-being mediators: the oxytocin and endocannabinoid pathways of the skin are stimulated to improve skin homeostasis. The volunteers' perception of stress is reduced, and the quality of their skin is improved: the barrier function is thus restored, hydration increased, and the radiance of the complexion enhanced. For this new launch, Silab has favoured local, traced, secure and environmentally friendly sourcing. The sourcing is part of an upcycling approach by processing watercress of a quality not used for the food sector. Furthermore, Silab is committed to supporting the watercress farm supplying the raw material in the construction of an industrial dryer, thus making it possible to control the quality of the raw materials and to diversify the farmer's activities. The authentication of the raw material was carried out using the molecular barcoding technique, thus securing the supply. Myoline is a patented active ingredient recommended at the amount of 0.5 to 2.0%. Available in aqueous solution, it is easy to formulate. It complies with regulations on biodiversity, displays a natural content of 99.2% (ISO 16128) and meets with international cosmetic regulations (Europe, United States, China, Japan, etc.)."
Evonik to boost natural cosmetic formulations with sustainable baobab oil,"Evonik is launching a sustainable baobab oil sourced from the near Sahel region of Ghana. Named Ecohance Soft Baobab [1] the oil is refined from the non-edible seeds of the baobab fruit and can be used as a botanical emollient in a wide range of natural cosmetic formulations such as hand creams, hair conditioners and body butters. According to Evonik, Ecohance Soft Baobab has a ""well-balanced composition"" with an optimized low amount of triglycerides with cyclopropeonic fatty acids beside a high ratio of tocopherol. For this launch, Evonik has built a brand new supply chain, with the help of local and international partners. The seeds used for the production of the oil come from the collection of wild fruits. To guarantee the sustainability of the entire supply chain, Evonik cooperates with the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and supports the Great Green Wall Initiative. In addition, Ecohance Soft Baobab was recently certified by the FairWild Foundation to ensure that the sourcing of the baobab oil protects the local ecosystem and supports social and economic projects in the region and that the wild harvest baobab fruits are traceable down to the collector [2]. Baobab trees grow on poor soil, and tolerate heat and drought, making them essential vegetation for the Sahel and helping to prevent desertification. ""Sustainability drives us and collaboration defines us! Ecohance Soft Baobab is a perfect example of how we uphold our core values of environmental and social responsibility. We've partnered with strong allies to build a brand-new supply chain, which allows our cosmetic customers to meet the growing demand for sustainable, high-performing natural products,"" highlighted Yann d'Hervé, head of Evonik's Care Solutions business line. Ecohance Soft Baobab is the latest addition to Evonik's Ecohance program, which offers circular feedstocks to help the cosmetics industry move its operations and solutions into a more sustainable space through the reduction of the carbon footprint and an improved ecological and social impact along the entire value chain. Evonik's Ecohance program was started in 2019. The launch of Ecohance Soft Baobab follows the launch of Ecohance Care PS3, an emulsifier based entirely on olive oil residues, and Ecohance Remo XP, an eco-friendly multifunctional thickener."

"Eurofragance launches Verdenix, an upcycled ingredient to fight malodour","When used with other perfumery ingredients, Verdenix acts as a booster in hand and body wash applications, as well as in dishwashing liquid products to quickly chemically eliminate foul smells. This new raw material, which was launched at the in-cosmetics Asia trade show in Bangkok earlier this month, comes hot on the heels of L'Âme du Bois, Eurofragance's first captive ingredient dedicated to perfume creation. Actually, the two substances are closely related! ""To understand Verdenix one must go back two years to the launch of L'Âme du Bois,"" explains Eurofragance in a press release. L'Âme du Bois was made by upcycling the discarded sawdust of western red cedar wood (Thuja plicata), which grows in western Canada. In the process of upcycling the cedar wood oil into L'Âme du Bois, 60% of material was set aside. The R&D scientists at Eurofragance decided to take a look at this unused fraction of material. Through an eco-friendly process, they were able to transform the leftover liquid into a new ingredient. This is how Verdenix was born: an ingredient upcycled from the manufacturing process of another upcycled ingredient! Tests have shown that in just over two minutes, Verdenix renders half of the malodour molecules (of certain compounds) undetectable by GCMS analytical equipment, and that in under six minutes the malodour is virtually gone. These findings were corroborated in sensorial panel tests conducted in the company's labs. According to Eurofragance, Verdenix controls foul smells in two complimentary ways: elimination and harmonization. In contact with certain compounds known to smell bad, Verdenix boosts their chemical elimination. In other cases, Verdenix harmonizes olfactively with the source of the malodor to reduce its perception. ""Verdenix works on two fronts, rendering it effective across a broad spectrum of malodors, and it produces its desired effect at extremely low dosages. A low dosage and a naturally agreeable olfactive profile, makes it easy for Perfumers to incorporate it in their fragrance compositions,"" highlights Marina Melendo, R&D Scientist and leader of the Verdenix project at Eurofragance. ""The most promising attribute of Verdenix is its ability — in conjunction with other ingredients — to quickly eliminate precise types of malodors. This is what consumers want; they want to restore a sense of purity to a situation that is unpleasant to them and potentially embarrassing."" The upcycled ingredient is designed to be used in any type of product application that is positioned to combat disagreeable smells; this includes personal care products, including deos, soaps, and shower gels, as well as home care products such as cleaners, laundry detergents, or dishwashing liquids... Eurofragance plans to create scents for its customers' with Verdenix already embedded in the fragrance formula. ""This means that there are no extra steps for the manufacturer—Verdenix offers a turnkey solution,"" the company concludes."
Expanscience to lead cosmetics industry towards positive impact,"As people at large have grown aware of the current environmental issues, cosmetics players – retailers, brands, ingredient suppliers and packaging manufacturers – have also been working to respond to the climate emergency. Driven by consumer demand, research and development projects are now massively focused on designing more resource-efficient, easily recycled, and readily biodegradable solutions, CSR programmes have become more elaborate, and the number of companies committed to a certification process has grown exponentially. It does not mean this will be enough, though! There really is a lot to be done. ""Some companies with very interesting projects are struggling to deploy them on a large scale"", explains Armelle Le Peniec, Director of Cosmetic Actives and Ingredients at Laboratoires Expanscience. During a conference at the clean-beauty-oriented I Feel Good show held on September 19-20, 2023, in Paris, she put forward the need for collaboration towards a cosmetics industry with a positive impact. To her, the CSR approach remains extremely competitive, as can be seen with the label EcoVadis Sustainability Rating: the level obtained by companies is based on their relative environmental performance. Those that reach the top 1% with the best practices get the Platinum level, while those among the top 5% with the highest performance get the Gold level, and so on. There is no doubt this approach is efficient: making progress and keeping your level requires constant effort! ""But we believe that today, CSR policies should no longer only be a differentiating element. If we want to speed up the industry's transformation pace, we definitely need more cooperation!"" emphasizes Armelle Le Peniec. ""We think it will help do even better."" A few concrete inter-industry examples show the collaborative turn can be taken. The ""Ferments of the Future Grand Challenge"" is a programme which gathers most varied stakeholders as part of a public and private partnership, like brands in the food industry, research bodies, ingredient manufacturers, professional unions, and laboratories. Some of them work in different industries, like the Carbios consortium involved in the development of PET enzymatic recycling, which got together giants like Nestlé, Pepsico, Suntory Beverage, and L'Oréal. As for raw materials, cooperation efforts to structure responsible chains that can respond to sensitive issues are far from rare. The Sustainable Coconut Partnership and the Responsible Mica Initiative can be mentioned, among others. Some projects can also help set up good practices shared by cosmetic ingredient manufacturers, like the Traceability Alliance for Sustainable Cosmetics (TRASCE), designed to pool a platform for traceability, or the ERI label (Eco-Responsible Ingredient). Brands also cooperate! As part of the Pharma-Recharge consortium, Laboratoires Expanscience (with their brand Mustela), Garancia, La Rosée Cosmétiques, Bioderma (NAOS) and dermocosmetics specialist Pierre Fabre have decided to unite their strengths to reduce the impact of packaging with a refilling solution in pharmacies. The consortium's brands had long got involved in the ecological transition, and some of them had even already tested their own refill solutions. Developing a sustainable, large-scale solution required going beyond a competitive approach and cooperating to agree on a refill system, a shared bottle... Projects like Pulp in Action, which is aimed to replace plastics in packaging with cellulose fibres, or the EcoBeautyScore Consortium designed to develop an evaluation and scoring system for the environmental impact of cosmetic products, are also based on the brand collaboration approach. As for the B Corp Beauty Coalition, it gathers 40 B-Corp-certified companies, including Laboratoires Expanscience, looking to implement deep changes to improve the social and environmental footprint of the cosmetics industry. ""These projects involve rather different targets, structures, and governances. Some of them make progress faster than others, but they do show we are more efficient united than on our own"", adds Armelle Le Peniec. ""Large-scale initiatives can even be considered on the global scale."" These collective dynamics are all the more essential since consumer demand is very strong: 86% of consumers expect brands to make commitments beyond their own products and businesses, in particular by supporting local communities, driving positives changes in society, or giving money to good causes. New generations are not content with words, they want evidence! [1] To Armelle Le Peniec, brands, distributors, and suppliers have everything to gain by developing such cooperation systems and working hand in hand for a cosmetics industry with a positive impact. And there are quite a lot of issues to work on! ""It is all about final packaging, but industrial packaging will also fall into the scope of strengthened recycling regulations. Reuse could also be a solution. In the field of cosmetic actives, order volumes are usually small. Storage and transport could be pooled, and we could think about greener logistics and alternatives to air transport. Most companies have developed their own purchase charters: maybe they could be harmonized to take up best practices. Even in fields like communication or Human Resources, measures could be pooled or practices harmonized, in everyone's interest, without jeopardizing competition, because we do need it"", she explains. With their CSR strategy and ImpACT commitment programme, Laboratoires Expanscience decided to become a regenerative company with a positive impact. As a B-Corp-certified company with a mission, Expanscience has adopted an approach based on constant progress for its different businesses, and on setting up collective dynamics within the industry. ""In the field of cosmetic actives and ingredients, we have been a small, highly committed supplier for over 20 years, in particular thanks to the company's and its brands' impetus. Under our ImpACT programme, which we co-set up in-house with inter-branch teams, every activity has its own roadmap to 2030, which is shared and followed up by the management. We would like to obtain the Organic or Fair For Life certificates for our cosmetic actives: we aim for 50% of our ingredients, and 80% of upcycled or biomimetic ingredients. This programme goes beyond product development: it involves objectives on biodiversity preservation and on the impact of our plants, as well as HR commitments. And of course, we have a key target as regards our stakeholders, which is cooperation. It is definitely a way to lead the whole industry towards a positive impact"", she concludes."
L'Oréal and Cosmo team on low environmental footprint extraction process,"In search of more sustainable solutions for the manufacture of natural fine perfumery ingredients, Cosmo International Fragrances has developed a new method for extracting fragrance molecules from botanicals. This patent-pending technology is a waterless, low-energy, slow extraction process that ""reveals the exact smell of an ingredient while preserving its integrity,"" claims the company. Using only air, the new extraction technology harnesses the volatile fragrance molecules of flowers, fruits and other natural ingredients without the need for heating, cooling or chemical solvents used in conventional scent extraction. Flowers thus retain their integrity and at the end of the process, can be recycled and re-used in a second extraction, helping reduce waste. L'Oréal Groupe has secured exclusive access to this Green Sciences-based extraction process that, according to the two companies, promises to open the door to new fragrance frontiers and enlarge the fragrance-maker's scent library to include ""100% natural and pure scent extracts."" ""Through this Green Sciences extraction process, we can experience the olfactive power of flowers in an authentic way, as if walking in a garden, field or forest,"" said Barbara Lavernos, Deputy Chief Executive Officer in charge of Research, Innovation and Technology, L'Oréal. To kick off the collaboration, L'Oréal Groupe and Cosmo International will focus on a new tuberose floral extract for a fine fragrance to be released in 2024. ""Our brands will take fine fragrance crafting to new heights by offering unprecedented olfactive authenticity, allowing natural ingredients to express their full olfactive identity like never before,"" said Cyril Chapuy, President of L'Oréal Luxe. The partnership between the two companies is in line with a major trend of the fragrance market: the quest for new and unique accords obtained from methods low environmental footprint. ""As the world leader in fine fragrances, embracing sustainability throughout the whole fragrance value chain is not just a choice: it's our conviction. From ingredient sourcing to refill adoption, we are innovating at every step to reduce our impact and shift towards a more responsible fragrance model,"" added Cyril Chapuy. The development of environmentally friendly extraction methods capable of providing access to new odorous molecules is one of the main fields of current research and innovation in perfumery. For instance, dsm-firmenich recently debuted new extracts from its Firgood electromagnetic extraction technology, launched in 2021, while in 2019 Symrise unveiled SymTrap, a process for capturing odorous molecules in aqueous solutions. Agenda: The main trends in the global fragrance market will be among the topics discussed at the next edition of the Fragrance Innovation Summit.

Prickly pear seed oil: a high potential ingredient?,"Grown on a large scale in North Africa - mainly in the Maghreb (Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria...), southern Europe (Portugal, Spain, Italy...) and certain South American countries (Mexico, Chile, Brazil...) the prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica), also known as nopal, has become, in just a few years, a star ingredient in natural cosmetic formulations! In this era of global warming, this low-water consumption plant, which grows on soils that are not always suitable for other crops, offers many advantages. ""Except for its spines, from which nothing can be obtained for the moment, the entire plant can be used and valorised: fruit, seeds, flowers, etc,"" explains Lémia Chekir Thabet, National Coordinator of the Pampat Project, implemented by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). ""More than half of our producers export, and 95% of these exports involve prickly pear seed oil: 95% in bulk and 5% in the form of packaged products. 70% of this production is sent to Europe, mainly France, to the cosmetics industry. The ever-growing success of prickly pear seed oil lies in its many anti-ageing properties, which we have demonstrated in a clinical study [1]. Prickly pear oil has long been used by North African women on their skin, hair and nails,"" she points out. For Émilie Jolibois, Head of Cosmetic Ingredients & Plant Extracts at Aroma-Zone, prickly pear seed oil is ""one of the best vegetable oils for combating skin ageing."" In fact, this ingredient has been available for years in the brand's boutiques and has significantly contributed to its popularity in France. ""Prickly pear seed oil has been hailed as an excellent moisturiser and anti-ageing ingredient because of its beneficial nutrient content for the skin. It is rich in linoleic acid (omega-6), tocopherols (vitamin E) and, in particular, phytosterols and polyphenols,"" explains Elisa Louveau, R&D Project Manager at Typology. ""That's why at Typology we offer an organic vegetable oil that we receive from a Moroccan producer. On its own, it already gives very good results. We combine it with other actives in two other anti-ageing formulas,"" she adds. But the elixir comes at a price - an average of EUR 350 per litre when it leaves the Tunisian factories - because the production process is ""long and complex,"" explains Sandy Boget, founder of the Sand Rarity brand, which uses it - in its organic version - as the flagship ingredient in its four products. ""It takes an average of thirty kilos of prickly pear seeds, or almost a tonne of fruit, to extract a litre of oil. What's more, to retain all the goodness contained in the seeds, it's essential to extract them cold and not to add any solvents,"" she points out. Fruit, seeds, flowers, cladodes (also known as pads), young leaves, the skin of the fruit... everything can be used from the prickly pear, with the exception of the spines and the inedible part of the pad. Weleda uses the young shoots in its 24-hour Hydrating Cream for their polyphenol, sugar and mineral content. Aroma-Zone is also interested in the cladodes. ""Our dietary supplement Organic Fat Catcher is made from cladodes powder, known for its high fibre content and its action on the absorption of fats and sugars,"" emphasises Émilie Jolibois. ""Producers use the fruit and flowers to make different liquids with varying virtues. It's important not to mistake prickly pear seed oil for oily macerate. The latter is obtained by macerating the flowers and/or fruit of the tree in a neutral oil, usually refined sunflower oil, while the seed oil is obtained by pressing the seeds. The essential oil, on the other hand, is obtained by chemical extraction, when the powdered prickly pear seeds are pulverised and then added to a solvent such as hexane,"" details Lémia Chekir Thabet. The field of possible applications therefore still seems very wide! Particularly as Opuntia ficus-indica, which thrives on poor soil and is highly resistant to heat and drought, is also of interest to the agri-food and pharmaceutical industries."

"Inclusium, Silab's new multifunctional active ingredient for all skin types","The French manufacturer of natural cosmetic active ingredients has strived to meet consumers' common expectations in terms of skin beauty. To sketch the outline of this universal beauty, Silab identified the main skin characteristics of consumers around the world based on their ethnicity, gender and age. This study made it possible to identify three main expectations: – a beautiful skin quality, characterized by skin hydration and fine skin texture for a smoothed microrelief; – an even and radiant complexion, free from spots related to post-inflammatory scars and skin aging; – reduced signs of aging thanks to firmer skin and faded wrinkles. And Silab claims to have found in alfalfa what it takes to satisfy these demands. To develop the new multifunctional patented active ingredient, the company has used the seeds of alfalfa, sourced from selected certified organic farms in France, to extract their galactomannans and create Inclusium [1], an active ingredient offering hydra-smoothing and complexion perfecting benefits. Silab leveraged its expertise in tissue engineering and in transcriptomics to explore the transversal activity spectrum of Inclusium on the biological pathways essential for epidermal and dermal functions. A large-scale exploratory study established that Inclusium stimulates epidermal functionalities by modulating the biological pathways related to the physical and water barrier, the immune barrier, and the anchoring of the epidermis to the dermis. Furthermore, according to Sliab, it reinforces the dermal matrix quality by boosting the synthesis of collagen I and reducing the synthesis of MMP-1. The efficacy of Inclusium has been demonstrated on various panels, including mixed gender groups with young and mature, Caucasian, Asian, Latin-American, and Afro-American panels. Five clinical studies were therefore conducted, showing a hydra-smoothing, complexion-perfecting and anti-wrinkle effect as of 7 days of application. Available in aqueous solution, Inclusium is recommended at a dose of 0.5 to 2.5%. The patented ingredient complies with biodiversity regulations and has a natural origin content of 99.2% (ISO 16128). It complies with international cosmetics regulations (Europe, USA, China, Japan, etc.)."
Perfumes: dsm-firmenich expands its palette with new Firgood extracts,"Firmenich, which merged with the Dutch company DSM in May 2023, is continuing to explore more environmentally friendly processes. After pioneering SFE extraction in 1995, a technique that uses CO2 compressed to a supercritical fluid state, the company has been developing a different approach since 2021, using the water contained in biomass as a medium to extract its odorous components. Firgood was born out of a simple idea. The technique consists of two phases. In the first stage, the biomass from the collection of flowers or other types of plants (vegetables, fruit or even spices) is moistened beforehand. It is then heated briefly by electromagnetic vibrations. ""Under the action of electromagnetic waves, water molecules come into friction and explode, releasing their aromatic notes,"" explains Fabrice Pellegrin, Senior Perfumer and Director of Innovation and Development, Natural Products at dsm-firmenich. ""The time of exposure to the waves is reduced, avoiding prolonged thermal shock, which preserves the plants' fragile components while respecting their naturalness,"" he adds. In a second stage, this extract undergoes another technological process to separate the water from the aromatic molecules. ""Today, dsm-firmenich can offer more than twenty fully developed Firgood extracts,"" says Fabrice Pellegrin. ""These new products open up a whole new world of possibilities. This technique can be applied to fragile ingredients such as flowers, which until now were considered ""silent"", but also to fruits and vegetables, such as green peppers. It can also provide perfumers with new olfactory profiles coming from classic raw materials but with new facets."" So, compared to the traditional absolute, jasmine grandiflorum pays Firgood is given a new airy lightness free of animalic notes, as if it had just been placed in the basket at harvest time. Lavandin pays Firgood is reminiscent of the freshly-picked flower rubbed in the palm of your hands, and loses its camphorated note, while ginger Firgood reveals its fresh, lively facets. Fame by Paco Rabanne is the first fragrance to include jasmine grandiflorum pays Firgood in its composition. The brand describes it as ""a jasmine of exceptional purity."" The extracts prepared at the plant are submitted to the perfumers for approval at ""Masters' meetings."" Honorine Blanc, Olivier Cresp, Nathalie Lorson and Alberto Morillas then meet at the Villa Botanica in Grasse, recently inaugurated by dsm-firmenich. By expressing their expectations as they work to create a fragrance, the master perfumers are directly involved in the research and development process. ""For instance, we decided to develop a green pepper Firgood. This extract is very interesting because it complements the palette of ingredients by developing a green, attractive and modern olfactory profile, which is not the case with all natural green ingredients, which can often be harsh,"" details Fabrice Pellegrin, who is at the origin of these regular meetings. The Firgood innovation was born out of a desire to avoid the use of volatile solvents, which are used in conventional extraction techniques. ""Electromagnetic extraction uses no petrochemical solvents, simply water. The residues from the extracted biomass are easier to reuse because they contain no solvents. They can be recycled or extracted again to produce extracts with a complementary olfactory profile, reinforcing the sustainability of this revolutionary technology,"" emphasises Fabrice Pellegrin. What's more, the use of electromagnetic waves reduces the amount of time perfume plants are exposed to heating, which saves energy. In the case of lavandin, its extraction takes just 15 minutes, instead of the 55 minutes needed for a traditional distillation process. A Firgood presentation is scheduled at the Fragrance Innovation Summit on 30 November 2023. Details and registration: www.fragranceinnovation.com."
"Calybiota Bio, Expanscience's prebiotic active ingredient fights body odor","Previously known for rebalancing intimate flora, Calybiota® Bio reinforces its ""well-being"" focus with new results for the axillary flora. The deodorant market is booming. It is forecasted to reach USD 119.24 billion by 2030, growing by 5.58 % over the period 2023 to 2030 [1]. The ""skinification"" trend in deodorant is real, with differentiation based on ingredient quality, naturalness and, above all, efficacy. Globally, natural claims in deodorants have been rising year on year. With the emphasis on natural ingredients, another point to consider is sustainable sourcing and the impact on biodiversity when cultivating and processing such ingredients. That is why Calybiota Bio meets market demand: a 100% natural and COSMOS-certified active ingredient, with sustainable sourcing and, above all, proven efficacy in vitro & ex vivo. Calybiota Bio is the perfect opportunity ingredient to develop natural deodorant formulations that respect and support a healthy equilibrium of the axillary microbiome. The skin is colonized by billions of bacteria that participate in the regulation of immunity and barrier functions, preserving the microbiota homeostasis are essential to maintain a healthy skin. The number of bacteria and their diversity guarantee this balance and proper functioning of the skin's microbiota. When these parameters change, dysbiosis (imbalance) occurs and undesirable bacteria can colonize the skin, reducing its barrier function against aggression. This imbalance is at the root of a number of well-known dermatological problems and pathologies, such as perspiration odours, acne, atopic dermatitis… Concerning the human axillary region, the two predominant bacterial species presents are Staphylococci (such as S. epidermidis), known as mostly skin-friendly species and Corynebacteria (in particular C. xerosis and C. striatum), which are responsible for unpleasant odors [2]. In-vitro studies showed that Calybiota Bio reduces the unpleased axillary odors, with a significant inhibition of the C. xerosis adhesion to a skin explant surface, and the reduction of the sweat odors produced by C. striatum. This beneficial effect has been confirmed by a clinical study with 1.5% of Calybiota Bio (vs placebo) conducted on 27 men with a perspiration odor (intensity 4 or more on a 0-10 scale). A microbiome analysis on the axillary flora allows to demonstrate the beneficial prebiotic effect of Calybiota Bio by increasing the ratio of Staphylococcus over Corynebacterium after 27 days. Moreover, the presence of Calybiota Bio in the deodorant did not impact the bacteria diversity and/or quantity over the study, preserving the integrity of the microbiome. According a national ""What Makes America Sweat"" survey [3] in 2023, that uncovered the nationwide impact of sweating on people's well-being: of the 68% Americans who experience heavy sweat, 75% say it affects their self-confidence, and 80% would live their lives differently if they didn't have to worry about sweat. But, contrary to popular belief, sweat is naturally almost entirely odorless. Axillary odors development is linked to the transformation of odorless secretions into volatile odoriferous molecules by the flora microorganisms. Different factors can influence the secretion's quality & quantity and the bacteria present: age, sex, genetic factors, environment, hygiene, cosmetics... Analysis of a T-shirt worn 24 hours by the men revealed that Calybiota Bio reduces the total quantity of VOCs by -56.8% [4] compared to the placebo. By taking a closer look at the results, Calybiota Bio decreases acetic acid (odor of vinegar) by -50.9% [5], butyric acid (odor of vomit/rancid) by -58.2% [6] and valeric acid (odor of smelly socks or feet) by -65.2% [7]. As a microbiome-friendly and prebiotic active ingredient, Calybiota Bio is able to rebalance the axillary flora for an anti-bad odor effect. Calybiota Bio is a unique opportunity ingredient to develop natural efficient deodorant. By protecting microbiota flora, Calybiota Bio helps women & men feel good and comfortable in their intimacy.

Eco-designed hybrid polymers combining sensoriality and naturality,"Today's consumers want their lifestyles and the products they use to reflect their values: 30% of them are ready to pay more for an environmentally-friendly cosmetic product (Mintel). The clean beauty trend was born to meet this growing need. However, 46% of consumers do not understand the difference between a natural and a ""clean"" product (Mintel), pointing to the subjectivity and lack of standardization of the definition of ""clean beauty"". This is how ""conscious beauty"" gradually came into being. Based on criteria similar to those of clean beauty, it also integrates the dimension of minimalism, multi-functionality of ingredients, renewable, natural and biodegradable resources. 47% of consumers claim to use fewer cosmetic products to achieve a more sustainable effect, and 29% are even prepared to buy multifunctional products to consume less but better (Mintel). To meet this growing demand, the cosmetics market has therefore worked on its offer with more natural ingredients, while guaranteeing respect for the skin and the environment, as well as a pleasant sensorial experience. To meet the expectations of conscious beauty, Seppic offers a range of eco-designed hybrid polymers: SEPILIFE™ G305 (INCI: Acrylamide/Sodium - Acryloyldimethyl - Taurate Copolymer - C15-19 Alkane - Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate - Polyglycerin-10) et SEPILIFE™ NUDE (INCI: Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer - C15-19 Alkane - Polyglyceryl-6 Laurate - Polyglycerin-6) The SEPILIFE™ range offers alternatives to synthetic polymers, possessing a high percentage of naturality (according to ISO 16 128) and guaranteeing thickening properties similar to those of synthetic polymers. They are also inherently biodegradable (OECD 301B). They belong to a new generation of rheology modifiers based on inverse emulsion polymerization. To guarantee high technical performance, the petrochemical polymer backbone has been retained. At the same time, the other components have been selected for their natural origin, with the aim of meeting the need for a more eco-conscious formulation, while maintaining the desired efficacy and sensoriality. In addition to naturalness and biodegradability, the range of hybrid polymers also enables energy savings. Thanks to their ability to be cold processable, the heating step is no longer necessary during formula preparation. Energy savings of up to 93%, as well as time savings of 73% compared with a formulation requiring a heating step, have been measured with the use of SEPILIFE™ G305. Finally, Seppic's range of hybrid polymers offers multiple properties, facilitating the formulation of ""multifunctional"" products and thus meeting consumer expectations in the conscious beauty market. In addition to their thickening properties, which make it possible to obtain sprayable, fluid to thick formulas, they possess emulsifying-stabilizing properties, helping to formulate and stabilize vegetable oils in emulsions. In fact, vegetable oils are often used as emollients in formulas with a high naturality index. These properties make them highly valued ingredients in formulations for all kinds of applications: hair care, skin care, sun care and make-up. A multitude of possible applications and textures, to meet every need. Seppic's hybrid polymers offer differentiating sensorial properties to meet the varied needs of consumers. SEPILIFE™ G305 offers easy spreadability, excellent pick-up as well as a soft finish after application. In the EU07737 formula, SEPILIFE™ G305 adds texture and stabilises the cream gel without emulsifiers and provides a soft touch to the skin. As for SEPILIFE™ NUDE, it offers a nude sensation, with a natural finish. The presence of SEPILIFE™ NUDE in the formula also activates positive emotions, for sensory benefits after the formula is applied. It enables the formulation of a wide variety of textures, such as a thick cream, with the AS40154 formula. It offers a quick-break effect during the application, and a natural, fresh, non-sticky finish on the skin."
Algaktiv: Upcycled microalgae for collagen boost and skin transformation,"Presented this week at the in-cosmetics Latin America trade show, in São Paulo, Algaktiv Collage was crafted from Vegan Collagen Peptides and Spermidine derived from resilient extremophile microalgae named Hematococcus pluvialis. This microalgae, which thrives in the harshest environments of Iceland, has the remarkable ability to change its own biochemistry when subjected to strong environmental stress, producing Astaxanthin, a red nutraceutical antioxidant. In Iceland, the purest and most sustainable Astaxanthin is obtained through the cultivation of Hematococcus pluvialis in enclosed photobioreactors powered by 100% renewable geothermal energy. The oil-soluble nutraceutical Astaxanthin is extracted from the stressed microalgae, leaving a water-soluble fraction behind that was previously considered waste. Algaktiv has developed in Barcelona an innovative process to upcycle the Astaxanthin-depleted Hematococcus pluvialis ""waste"", giving it new life. Algaktiv Collage harnesses the power of vegan, upcycled peptides, standardized in glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline. These peptides serve as the building blocks for native collagen production, promoting skin firmness and elasticity. Additionally, Algaktiv Collage features Spermidine, a natural booster of collagen synthesis in the skin, further enhancing its rejuvenating effects. ""At Algaktiv, we are driven by a passion for developing high-performance skincare solutions that deliver remarkable results while prioritizing sustainability,"" states Jordi Ayats, Product Development Director. ""Algaktiv Collage represents the culmination of our deep understanding of skin biology and the evolving needs of consumers worldwide."" In vitro tests demonstrate that Algaktiv Collage boosts native collagen production in the dermis, resulting in a remarkable increase of up to 27.96% with Collage 0.5% and 40.37% with Collage 1%. Algaktiv Collage delivers hydration benefits comparable to hyaluronic acid, with a significant boost of 34% at 0.5%. According to Algaktiv, the combination of 0.5% Hyaluronic acid +0.5% Algaktiv Collage increases hydration by almost 60%. The clinical evaluations also showcase the transformative effects of the new active ingredient on the skin. A study conducted with 1% Algaktiv Collage revealed its ability in restructuring the skin from within and shaping the 3D matrix. After 7 days, firmness and plumping improved by 2.2 and 3.4 times, respectively, while moisturization showed a remarkable threefold improvement after 28 days. The reduction in wrinkles was visually significant. A study conducted at 2% demonstrated Algaktiv Collage's ability to provide full-day hydration. Within just 1 hour of application, hydration levels increased by nearly 30% compared to a placebo's 7%. This superior performance was maintained for 24 hours. The third clinical evaluation, conducted at 3% Algaktiv Collage, showcased unprecedented results, with a remarkable hydration increase of 35% after only 10 minutes, a significant improvement compared to the placebo. Inner skin images depicted intense and long-lasting hydration lasting up to 24 hours. The amino acid's rapid binding capacity with key skin elements, such as Hyaluronic acid does, and its ability to reshape the inner structure, were instrumental in reducing wrinkles by an impressive 14% after just 10 minutes. Certified by Cosmos, Algaktiv Collage is vegan, sustainably sourced from upcycled microalgae grown in Iceland, GMO-free, and China listed. It boasts high stability and ease of formulation, with all toxicological assessments successfully completed.

"Silab launches Revilience, a new active ingredient for skin radiance","For this new patented natural active ingredient, dedicated to the vitality of deficient skin, Silab took advantage of the adaptation capabilities of a bacteria living in symbiosis with ginseng. Indeed, Ginseng is known to cause numerous changes and deficiencies in its environment, impacting the availability of nutrients, especially nitrogen. To survive in this hostile environment, the Sphingomonas panaciterrae bacterium, present in the ginseng rhizosphere, deploys protective mechanisms via the production of sphingane-type Exopolysaccharides (EPS). It exhibits for itself and its host bio-protective and bio-stimulant properties, granting it an incredible ""vitality capital."" These are the characteristics that Silab has chosen to enhance in its new active ingredient, Revilience. The French company has developed a biotechnological process of controlled nitrogen deficiency applied to Sphingomonas panaciterrae, which doubled its EPS production compared with a non-deficient process. ""Coupled with a specific enzymatic hydrolysis, this unique bio-inspired approach resulted in an active ingredient composed of oligosphinganes of interest, capable of improving the metabolism of skin lacking vitality,"" said Silab in a statement. To highlight the pathways of action, Silab relied on transcriptomics and, thanks to an unprecedented modelling study, the manufacturer has established the gene mapping of skins subjected to nutritional deficiency (growth factor depletion) or physiological deficiency (aging). These two deficiency conditions revealed a common degradation of epidermal cell metabolism and protection mechanisms. According to Silab, by reactivating these biological pathways in deficient skin, Revilience restores the skin's ""vitality signature"". Cellular metabolism is thus stimulated, and the quality of the cutaneous barrier reinforced. Tested at 2.5% on young and mature Caucasian volunteers, the active ingredient enhances complexion radiance and improves hydration as early as seven days after treatment. Silab recommends Revilience in all skincare products for skin lacking vitality at a dose of 0.5 to 2.5%. Available in an aqueous solution, it has a natural origin content of 98.8% (ISO 16128)."
Givaudan debuts ScalpSure to combat hair and scalp malodours,"According to Givaudan, 61% of people across the globe are concerned by sweat or scalp malodour [1]. To answer this prevalent demand, the company has developed ScalpSure, a new technology that has been added to its Zap portfolio (their cross categories solutions platform addressing malodour). Givaudan explains that the development of ScalpSure included consumers from the earliest stage of the research. Indeed, Givaudan's malodour research teams, which are based in the group's Health & Well-being Centre of Excellence in Ashford, UK, have collected samples from consumers' hair to perform a headspace analysis and develop a realistic scalp malodour model. With this odour reconstitution serving as an accurate framework from which Givaudan's perfumers screened the behaviour of perfumery ingredients and fragrance formulas, to ascertain the best solutions to efficiently counteract the build-up of malodours on the scalp. ""The highly consumer-centric approach of ScalpSure ensures an enhanced understanding of the malodour challenges on the scalp and improved awareness of how best to design solutions,"" said Jessica Jiang, Personal Care Senior Creative Fragrance Manager at Givaudan. The efficiency of ScalpSure in counteracting malodour has been assessed through a ""holistic validation methodology"" that involved olfactive experts, sensory panellists, and consumers themselves, through home-use tests led on a cross-regional level. ""The challenge in designing an effective hair care fragrance is to create a beautiful scent that both delights consumers while simultaneously addressing their concerns. The fragrance should provide an impactful and enjoyable fragrant experience while effectively suppressing scalp malodour. The ScalpSure design aid supports perfumers in shaping tailor-made fragrances capable of successfully banishing unwanted smells on the scalp. By combining hedonic and performance criteria, ScalpSure fragrance guidelines offer perfumers an innovative tool to ensure consumer satisfaction,"" concluded Sophie Rhodes, Personal Care Senior Perfumer at Givaudan."
Plant-powered performance in deodorant application,"Roquette Beauté is emphasizing its leading position in the sustainable beauty sphere and focusing on its range of high-quality, versatile, 100% plant-based ingredients in the deodorant category combining high performance and amazing sensorial experiences to match consumers' expectations! Body odors make us all uncomfortable, and let's be honest, we all face it! They are caused by natural bacteria that are present all over the body, including the armpits. Some people naturally sweat more or less than others, but it is not the secretion of sweat that causes the smell; it is when the odorless sweat mixes with bacteria. Once the bacteria on your skin mixes with the sweat, the creation of volatile malodorous compounds causes an odor. Body odor also can vary from person to person with specific organoleptic properties; one person can sweat excessively but not smell, whereas another because of the type of bacteria on his skin can generate bad odors (sweet, sour, tangy, or like onions). Deodorants are designed to effectively absorb sweat and mask odor while providing a pleasant sensory experience. Roquette Beauté Solutions in Deodorant Answer Consumers' Demand for Safe and Plant-Based Ingredients. Absorption of Sweat It is important to absorb sweat to limit the sweat to mix with bacteria. For this, our ingredient Beauté by Roquette® ST 005 zea mays starch can absorb sweat and is as efficient as talc while being COSMOS approved with a natural index of 1 (ISO 16128) offering consumers a safe and natural alternative.

Scent of luxury in India: Madurai's jasmine infuses global perfumes,"Heady scents fill the air as skilled pickers in India pluck white jasmine before the still fresh buds are rushed for processing into a valuable ingredient for global perfumes. Jasmine only issues its powerful scent when it blooms at night, and pickers must select only the ones yet to open. ""We know which one to pick,"" said Malarkodi, who gave only one name, as she snapped her fingers carefully to pluck the buds, tucking into her hair a few flowers that had already bloomed. ""There is no use of these... but I like the smell,"" she said. Jasmine's fragrant flowers have been used for millennia in India to honour the gods, but now the scent is an also key part of world-famous perfumes. In the ancient city of Madurai in southern India, jasmine is omnipresent — attracting buyers from some of the world's most recognisable perfumes, including J'adore by Dior and Mon Guerlain by Guerlain. ""It is one of the most expensive oils in the world,"" said Raja Palaniswamy, a director of Jasmine Concrete, which squeezes vast quantities of jasmine to create a few precious drops of delicious-smelling essence. The women picking the buds earn around USD1.50 a day per day for about four to five kilograms — with each kilogram made up of around 4,000 buds. Once picked, the jasmine is rushed to market, selling for anything between 200 and 2,000 rupees (USD 2.40- USD24) a kilogram on special days. The jasmine of Madurai, an Asian variety with the scientific name Jasminum Sambac, was given a ""geographical indication"" tag from the World Intellectual Property Organization in 2013, which noted its ""deep fragrance"". ""It is lush, it is rich, it is vibrant,"" said Thierry Wasser, perfumer at French beauty house Guerlain, speaking to AFP while visiting the jasmine operators. The jasmine in Madurai has a ""smoothness... and something floral which is immutable,"" Wasser added. Wasser sources the jasmine oil he uses from Palaniswamy's company. As well as Guerlain, Palaniswamy said his company sells jasmine oil to companies including Bulgari, Dior and Lush. In Madurai, the bright, white flower can be found in the homes of the city's residents, as strings fastened by women to their hair — and in the sprawling 14th-century complex of the Hindu goddess Meenakshi, considered the guardian of the city. Meenakshi is depicted holding a parrot, a bird associated with love. Every night, people surround a shrine of the goddess with fragrant jasmine flowers as she retires with her husband Shiva in a grand, symbolic ceremony. ""When you understand that the purpose of this flower is the celebration of love and brotherhood and family and friendship; when you smell it, it takes another dimension,"" Wasser said. ""And to me this flower is the expression of love."" The women who pluck the jasmine — be it for their deity, weddings, funerals or expensive perfumes -– have no time to romance its appeal. In a jasmine field on the outskirts of the ancient city, women tenderly move the branches of the bush, looking for the perfect bud. Once jasmine has been harvested, the process to extract the oil requires long hours of labour. The processing factory runs around the clock in harvest season, with workers raking out fresh-picked flowers and waiting for the oblong-shaped buds to bloom. ""The minute it starts blooming, it starts emitting its fragrance,"" Palaniswamy said. Late in the night, as the jasmine's sweet scent fills the air, workers collect the blooms and load them into extractors. The freshly picked jasmine is immersed in a solvent to absorb the fragrance molecules to give a waxy extract called concrete. The concrete is further processed with alcohol to remove the waxes carefully, which then results in a potent absolute. This absolute becomes the ingredient in perfumes. Around 700 kilograms of fresh jasmine is reduced to just one kilogram of oil, selling for around USD4,200, Palaniswamy said. But Amsavalli Karuppuswamy, who runs a stall outside the flower market where she threads flowers into garlands, said the fresh jasmine will always outweigh any oil. ""I will continue to do this job till I die... women like jasmine, so that is why we are doing this,"" she said. ""The scents are not worth as much as the original jasmine flowers — nothing can match the real fragrance of the jasmine."""
Lubrizol launches new rheology modifier Carbopol SC-800,"Carbopol SC-800 polymer [1] is a polyacrylic acid designed to make thickening and stabilizing cleansers. It has been balanced with crosslinker levels, hydrophobic content and surface modification to increase its efficiency and ease of processing for challenging surfactant systems. According to Lubrizol Life Science Beauty (LLS Beauty), Carbopol SC-800 polymer has the best thickening efficiency, clarity and suspension properties in studies comparing it to other hydrophobically-modified polymers. ""This allows formulators the versatility to create unique aesthetics in their skin cleansing formulations, including suspending natural beads, scrubs and other cleansing elements with ease and confidence,"" said the company in a statement. Foam generation studies also showed that the new polymer doesn't negatively impact foam quality, both in the foam volume generated and its foam morphology. As a result, formulations have the lather quality consumers look for in rinse-off beauty solutions. Lubrizol's new rheology modifier solution is therefore ideal for shower gels, shampoos and facial cleansers."
BASF upgrades its pore-tightening cosmetic active ingredient Laricyl,"Laricyl [1], an extract from the Fomes officinalis mushroom, has been a staple in BASF's portfolio of cosmetic active ingredients for pore refinement for 20 years. In an effort to align its actions towards more sustainable practices, the company has developed a new production method for this tried-and-tested substance. Thus, BASF now produces the mycelium, the vegetative part of the fungus, by solid-state fermentation. This more sustainable method replaces the harvesting of the mushroom from the wild. The production of the mycelium, that is now organic certified, is carried out in Europe on solid medium within a controlled incubation room. The new version of Laricyl is 99.7% from natural origin according to ISO 16128. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, split-face and randomized study with 25 female subjects, the revised version of Laricyl showed its ability to improve the appearance of pores in size and number at a concentration of 3%. Image analysis showed that it minimized the appearance of visible pores immediately after application 2.8 times better than the previous version of the ingredient, with an astringent effect. According to BASF, the active ingredient also helped to remove excess oil from the skin, making it less shiny without drying it out. ""We continuously revise our portfolio to produce even more sustainably. Of course, this should not be at the expense of performance,"" said Lucilene Veira Nunes, Head of Business Management for Bioactive Ingredients, EMEA. ""With Laricyl, we have now succeeded in making cultivation of the raw material more sustainable, while at the same time improving the results of the ingredient on immediate pore tightening, skin mattifying and moisturization."" This new development is part of BASF's Responsibly Active program for its bioactives portfolio. Among other things, the program seeks to have 100% of botanical supply chains traceable to the source and sustainably sourced as well as 50% organic certified by 2030. The programme also includes measures to reduce climate impact."
100% plant-based rheological modifier for highly-sensorial formulations,"Anticipating the future of beauty more than 10 years ago, Seppic has designed the SOLAGUM™ range to allow formulators to create natural and sustainable beauty concepts to answer the demand for a better living and a conscious beauty. Among the range, SOLAGUM™ TARA (INCI: Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum) is a natural and sustainable solution to thicken and boost the sensory experience of more natural formulation SOLAGUM™ TARA is a high-purity polysaccharide derived from renewable and secured Tara seeds, non chemically modified that is 100% natural and readily biodegradable according respectively to ISO 16128 and OECD 301F. It is obtained with a mechanical process by grinding the seed tissue, that guarantees an unaltered food grade quality ingredient and enables COSMOS and NATRUE certifications. The Seppic's Tara gum is in essence a non-microplastic polymer that widens the field of possibilities in cosmetics at a time of strong regulations and high-challenging formulation. SOLAGUM™ TARA is a polymer of choice for medium to thick consistencies in natural formulas, for boosting viscosity effect and very nice sensory. On one hand, it is a suitable solution to design natural, unctuous creamy consistent textures with elegant and comfortable skin-feel. In addition, it delivers a more satisfying sensory with no sticky nor stringy effect compared to the Xanthan gum, a reference ingredient among gum-based thickeners. On the other hand, from a performance point of view, it is more than a simple alternative to common natural thickeners as SOLAGUM™ TARA offers a high viscosity in emulsion and aqueous gel compared to other gum-based thickeners. SOLAGUM™ TARA also displays very stable viscosity over pH variations, allowing to formulate in very acidic media, as well as in basic media. In addition, Seppic's Tara gum provides a decisive advantage to formulators: a high resistance to electrolytes, making it particularly suitable for chassis formulas. Even when enriched with active ingredients, the formulas maintain a constant viscosity (tested with up to 2% NaCl). Finally, thanks to its non-ionic profile, SOLAGUM™ TARA is widely compatible with the majority of cosmetic ingredients enabling the design of versatile cosmetic applications. SOLAGUM™ TARA is a polymer of choice as texture enhancer for many kinds of cosmetic application. For example, taking advantage of the well-known agrofood interaction between Xanthan and Tara gums, Seppic offers advanced synergy when combining SOLAGUM™ TARA with SOLAGUM™ AX (INCI: Acacia Senegal Gum and Xanthan Gum) to lower the total dose of polymer whilst enhancing the texture and stability, regardless of the type of formula : aqueous gels, cream-gels or emulsions. This combination is also easier to disperse than a mix of xanthan gum and Seppic's Tara gum, making the formulation easier. Moreover, SOLAGUM™ TARA is a great ally for hair care products. With high thickening power, it demonstrates equivalent performance to Hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) - inherently biodegradable polymer commonly used in hair with a low naturality degree - while offering a better profile in terms of naturalness and sensoriality. In a more minimalist formulation approach, SOLAGUM™ TARA is also an ally of choice for hair formulas because, in addition to thickening, it plays a role in controlling volume and frizz in curly hair care. In this way, at Seppic, offering solutions to design conscious formulation and sensory experience is key. Seppic continually expands its portfolio of ingredients meeting the expectations of tomorrow's beauty through conscious innovation."
Seppic: A biomimetic and eco-designed active ingredient for skin firmness,"Seppic completes its anti-aging offer for mature skin with a new biomimetic anti-sagging ingredient: Sagacious [1]. To create this innovation, the French manufacturer took its inspiration from nature; more precisely from the behaviour of plants in the international space station. Indeed, to maintain their integrity in zero gravity, plants growing in the station synthesize specific molecules from the glycolipids family, SQDGs (sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerols). Seppic has successfully extracted this family of molecules from Himanthalia elongata seaweed [2] using an eco-designed and patented process dubbed ""Coeur d'algue"" (French for ""heart of algae""). According to Seppic, Sagacious acts on all skin layers. ""The skin becomes significantly firmer and the signs of facial sagging are less visible,"" said the company in a statement. Clinical tests have shown that Sagacious improves skin firmness, eight times more than the placebo and decreases the visibility of nasogenian folds (efficacy clinically proven after 28 days of application). Its mode of action has been evaluated in vitro also, demonstrating a restoration of mechanical properties of fibroblasts close to the value of a fibroblast 28 years younger, thanks to a stimulation of key molecules at the level of the different layers of the skin: – At the dermo-epidermal junction for a better cohesion between epidermis and dermis; – In the dermis for a better biomechanical and tensile properties of fibroblasts; – At the dermo-hypodermal junction for a better cohesion between dermis and hypodermis. With Sagacious, Seppic thus propose to adopt a new approach for a global anti-aging strategy. ""Sagacious is an innovative active ingredient, thanks to its biomimetic sourcing and its eco-designed process patented by Seppic which allows for the first time to extract glycolipids from Himanthalia elongata seaweed. All this for proven and visible effectiveness from one month on the signs of facial sagging,"" concluded Audrey Bonnard, Active Product Manager at Seppic. Sagacious complies with Chinese regulations. It is also Cosmos and Natrue approved with a 100% naturalness rate according to ISO 16128."
Holistic beauty: Clariant launches mood-boosting skincare innovations,"As consumers focus on mental health and solutions that can help inspire them to relax and feel happy, Clariant addresses this quest for holistic wellness with two formulations using its latest ingredient launches under the concept 'The Joyologist'. Thus, the 'Feel-Good Magic Stick' and the 'Forget It All Relaxing Mask' promote inner wellness and can be used complementary in a daily routine ""to bring joy to the skin and the mood."" Clariant's new skincare concept was named after the findings of a Beautystreams report titled Joyology 2021-2026. ""Self-care is hugely important, especially in a world full of troubling news that affect our mental well-being,"" says Amandine Werle, a marketing specialist for Clariant Actives & Natural Origins and one of the minds behind The Joyologist. ""Consumers look for ways to take better care of themselves, and beauty rituals are big part of that. Treating your skin with products that provide sensations of comfort can help improve the mood by stimulating the release of feel-good molecules such as serotonin and melatonin. This, in turn, positively impacts the skin and starts a virtuous cycle."" The two formulations created by Clariant to promote inner wellness include: – The Feel-Good Magic Stick, an aqueous gel stick to use at any moment of the day for a well-being push. It provides a cooling sensation to the skin thanks to its water-based formula and has a lightweight, non-greasy texture that absorbs quickly into the skin. The formula is based on Clariant's new active ingredient Rootness Mood+ that reproduces the natural benefits of light to revitalize the skin and enhance the mood. Sourced from Sanguisorba officinalis, a plant used in traditional Chinese medicine, it is derived from environmentally friendly plant-milking technology. The stick contains additional actives such as B-Circadin, which helps re-synchronize the skin cell's biological clock, and HerbEx Curcuma Extract, which increases the skin's stress resilience. – The Forget It All Relaxing Mask, a face mask to apply on the skin at the end of the day, to take a moment just for oneself, to get rid of negative thoughts and enjoy the present time. Clariant has chosen to offer it in a multi-sensorial relaxation set, which includes a scented candle and relaxing playlist. Its key active ingredient is Beracare CBA, a complex blend of Amazonian oils that can be used as an alternative to Cannabidiol (CBD). Rootness Mood+ and Beracare CBA were both awarded the BSB Innovation Award 2023. Plus, Rootness Mood+ won an award in the technology category at this year's Cosmetic Ingredients & Technology Exhibition Japan (CITE)."
Yifixia develops natural excipients based on plant-derived co-products,"Based in Montpellier, in the south of France, young company Yifixia was founded in 2022 by two researchers, Nicolas Gaboriaud-Kolar, PhD in Chemistry specialized in natural molecules, and Rémi Przybylski, PhD in Process Engineering, to recover agricultural co-products in the French southern region of Occitanie and turn them into molecules of interest. ""Thanks to our specialisms, we can combine eco-extraction technologies and white chemistry, so we manage to use enzymes or micro-organisms to keep creating molecules until the source co-product is completely drained, and obtain the best added value,"" explains Nicolas Gaboriaud-Kolar. Yifixia's approach involves the cascading recovery of waste considered as a potential source for developing several ingredients. ""If we carefully choose the technologies we use, we will be able to generate two or three ingredients with the same single raw material,"" says the founder and CEO of the company. The developments are mainly formulation ingredients: the first excipient will be marketed in late 2023. ""The choice of natural excipients is limited right now on the market, and yet there is a rising demand from consumers for natural and healthy products. So, we aim to offer manufacturers natural ingredients derived from renewable raw materials, so that they can formulate cosmetic products with alternative solutions,"" adds Nicolas Gaboriaud-Kolar. The company aims to develop five to eight extracts by 2026. Yifixia works directly with its suppliers, who are transformers in the Occitanie region's food industry. ""This way, we get to know our suppliers, understand how they work, and give them advice, so that the co-product is not too damaged and we can retrieve it in the best conditions,"" explains the Director. In addition, this company aims to make a difference: they do not only aim to make a profit, but also to have a positive impact on the environment or society. In fact, they made their commitments with their suppliers official in their statutes and purchase raw materials at the highest price possible. ""It is a way to value their work, highlight a regional product, and create an incentive. It is costly for transformers to remove a co-product. So, we aim to transform costs into revenues,"" he says. To support its partners with this strategy, Yifixia offers a service to companies willing to recover their waste. ""We have also been considering providing this service the other way round, by developing an offer based on cosmetics manufacturers' needs in terms of actives or ingredients derived from co-products. The idea is to use our diverse expertise to build a bridge between the farming and cosmetics industries,"" concludes Nicolas Gaboriaud-Kolar."
Fragrances: A Lebanese village at the heart of the Damask rose tradition,"On a gentle slope looking out over Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, villagers work their way across pink-dotted terraces, gathering perfumed Damask roses that are used for essential oils, sweets and cosmetics. The rose harvest ""gives you a bit of hope, it makes things beautiful, it calms you down — it gives you strength to carry on"", said Leila al-Dirani, picking the flowers from her family's land in the village of. A soft bag tied around her waist and her hands scratched from the thorns, the 64-year-old plucks the small, pink buds from their bushes as their rich and heady scent wafts across the hill. The oil derived from the famed Damask rose --- named after the ancient city of Damascus located just across the mountain range separating Lebanon and Syria — is a staple of perfumers. Rose water derived from the flower is also used across the Middle East both as a refreshing drink, in sweets such as Turkish delight, to scent mosques and even to bestow luck at weddings. After a morning collecting roses, the workers in Qsarnaba drop their fragrant bundles at a warehouse in the village. At the facility carpeted with pink petals, Zahraa Sayed Ahmed — whose first name means ""flower"" — buys the raw materials to produce her rose water, syrup, tea and jam. Around four years ago, she set up a small workshop at her house, using a traditional metal still that ""belonged to my grandfather"", said Sayed Ahmed, 37. With a kilogramme (2.2 pounds) of rose petals, she said she can make up to half a litre of rose water. She then also bottles and labels her modest production by hand, putting it on limited sale locally. ""The production of rose water is a part of our heritage,"" said Sayed Ahmed. ""In every home in Qsarnaba there is a still, even if it's just a small one."" The rose season only lasts a few weeks, but it is a busy time for Qsarnaba's residents. ""This year is the first year that we didn't bring workers to help us because the production is low and we couldn't afford it,"" said Hassan al-Dirani, 25, who has been picking the flowers alongside his mother, Leila. Since late 2019, Lebanon has been grappling with a devastating economic crisis that has seen the local currency collapse and pushed most of the population into poverty. ""The rose harvest and all other harvests have lost about 80 percent of their value... because of the economic crisis,"" said local official Daher al-Dirani, who hails from the extended family that is the biggest in Qsarnaba. ""But the roses help people put food on the table,"" he added. Exported from Syria to Europe for centuries since the time of the Crusades, the ancient Damask rose is also cultivated in countries including France, Morocco, Iran and Turkey. ""Our village produces the most roses out of any village in Lebanon"" and more than half of the country's rose water, Sayed Ahmed claimed proudly, as the captivating scent lingered in the air. ""Qsarnaba is the village of roses."""
"SpruceSugar, an antioxidant ingredient upcycled from the wood industry","Dubbed Metsä (the Finnish word for ""forest""), Ole Hyvä's new line features three products: a shower gel, a shampoo and a liquid hand soap. Developed in partnership with Montinutra, a start-up developing forest based ingredients and a Metsä Spring's portfolio company, the new line utilises Montinutra's Boreal Bioproducts SpruceSugar as a key ingredient. This is the first time that SpruceSugar has been used in an application for consumers. SpruceSugar is a 100% natural hemicellulose extract, obtained from sustainable spruce sawmilling side streams. It substitutes analogue chemicals and polysaccharides, with the potential to increase the antioxidant capacity of personal care products. All products in Ole Hyvä's new range are vegan, biodegradable, and contain SpruceSugar. ""Our goal is to develop and offer consumers high-quality and environmentally friendly cleaning products based on nature's biocapacity. We are particularly happy that we can support a domestic innovation that promotes the responsible use of natural resources and respects the well-being of nature. We believe that the cooperation helps us to offer our customers even better and more environmentally friendly products in the future as well,"" commented Elli Unger, Managing Director of Ole Hyvä Luonnontuote Oy. Thanks to this partnership with Ole Hyvä Luonnontuote, Montinutra was able to place its Boreal Bioproducts SpruceSugar on the market at a record speed – it went from testing phase into consumer product in just 14 months. ""With the successful launch of the first product range, Montinutra is ready to sell the product to other natural cosmetic players in Europe,"" says the start-up in a statement. Montinutra bets on a rising global demand from consumers for natural and sustainable cosmetic products, as well as on the consumers interest for upcycled ingredients. ""SpruceSugar is a prime example of how underutilised side streams can be upcycled into a novel product that has a large variety of usage cases,"" says Katariina Kemppainen, SVP, Group R&D at Metsä Spring, Metsä Group's innovation company, which mission is to seek and support sustainable innovations and technologies that find new purposes and higher value for Nordic wood. In addition to SpruceSugar, Montinutra's Boreal Bioproducts range features two other products: SpruceLigno, a sulfur free, natural anti-oxidant and UV-absorbing lignin extract; and SpruceFiber, a thermally treated dry lignocellulose."
"Epionine Bio, a holistic active ingredient for skin and mind well-being","Extracted from Camellia oleifera, a small tree native to China, known for the oil extracted from its seeds, Epionine Bio [1] is an active ingredient rich in sterols. Responsibly sourced in the province of Hunan in China and obtained by molecular distillation, Epionine Bio protects the skin from internal and external stress by acting on the skin-brain axis. In vitro and in vivo tests have demonstrated its anti-inflammatory, moisturizing, pain modulation and self-esteem benefits. ""Skin health and well-being are inextricably linked. The symptoms of dry or sensitive skin can affect a person's well-being, causing stress and having a negative impact on their emotional state. This can create a vicious circle, as stress can in itself be a source of skin problems. Indeed, around 40% [2] of persons with skin problems also have mental health issues, which are often linked to their skin condition,"" explains Armelle Le Peniec, Director of the Cosmetic Active Ingredients division of Laboratoires Expanscience. Two clinical studies – the first concerning the improvement of the skin condition between D0 and D28, the second comparing the benefits of Epionine versus placebo after 28 days of use – were performed alongside specialists in psychology and neuroscience. According to Expanscience, several benefits have been highlighted: physical benefits, by strengthening the skin barrier and moisturizing the skin; and mental benefits, since this active ingredient is able to improve an individual's emotional state (+18%), quality of life (+21%) and self-esteem (+35%), as well as reduce their psychological stress (-11%).

"The shea butter sector, a real instrument of economic development in Africa","According to the Global Shea Alliance (GSA), 16 million African women living in the region from Senegal to South Sudan live or survive on its harvest — mainly in rural areas. Mali is one of the world's leading producers along with Nigeria and Burkina Faso. Strong growth in demand Demand for the product – used in the production of food (85%) and cosmetic products – has exploded in recent years, driven by consumers in developed countries who increasingly want to buy products presented as organic and natural. According to Transparency Market Research, the global shea butter market could reach USD 3.5 billion in 2028. The United States, The Netherlands, Denmark and France are among the top shea butter importers. While the cosmetics industry only represents a small fraction of the global shea butter market, it is a key ingredient for the sector, which plays a major role in increasing the global demand. The fatty acids present in shea butter are used as opacifying agents and surfactants . Shea butter is also used as emollient in various cosmetic products, due to its smoothening properties for dry skin. Beyond skin, body and hair care products, shea butter is increasingly used in colour cosmetics. Mainly harvested by women, shea nuts play an important role in the economic development of African rural communities. However, the sector needs to structure itself to take better advantage of the windfall constituted by the resource. In the cooperative of women producers of shea butter at the rural community of Siby (COOPROKASI), near Bamako, Mali, the organization of work has become more professional since its set up in 2003. There are nearly 1,000 women working there. Permanent salaries earn them the equivalent of minimum wage each month, or around 45,000 CFA francs (70 euros). There are also temporary workers who are paid by the task. ""One of the advantages of the cooperative is that it has allowed women to have jobs"" over all seasons, when their activity was previously limited to the rainy season, said Filfing Koumare, the cooperative's sales manager. Once the nuts have been harvested, women at the cooperative peel them to extract the kernel. This is then crushed, washed and dried several times before being cooked in a pot to produce a dark liquid, which is filtered and cleared of impurities, resulting in the final oil, shea butter, which is used for making soaps and creams and sold in the village, the capital Bamako and to clients around the world, according to Kamissoko Kinimba Niara, accountant for the cooperative. ""When women make their sales, they get an income that allows them a bit of financial autonomy,"" said Assitan Kone Camara, president of the cooperative. ""But one of the difficulties is the lack of support and the lack of means,"" she added. For Daouda Keita, mayor of the town, ""It is crucial to support this structure in order to modernise it."" Managers are demanding training and financial support, particularly for sales and marketing."
"BASF debuts Kerasylium, a plant-based alternative to animal keratin","BASF's new hair care ingredient is a micro-complex, rich in peptides and nutrients. Dubbed Kerasylium, the plant extract is the result of upcycling from milk thistle (Silybum marianum) seed cakes, a by-product of Silybum marianum oil production. Kerasylium's peptides exhibit an amino acid composition similar to that of keratin, a protein naturally present in the hair, which ensures its resistance and elasticity. ""Many cosmetic manufacturers rely on keratin for their hair care products because it helps to repair the hair from the inside out. However, the keratin-based ingredients that are usually used in hair treatments are of animal origin. We wanted to change that, so we developed Kerasylium, a plant-based alternative,"" said Cécile Kalem, Launch Manager Europe, BASF Beauty Care Solutions France S.A.S. Kerasylium expands BASF's growing portfolio of active ingredients produced via circular models to conserve resources. The milk thistle used is grown in France for oil production and is based on a traceable and sustainable supply chain. Thanks to its high peptide content (50-70% of the active matter), Kerasylium helps to prevent breakage, especially of weakened hair, through the stabilization and repair of hair keratin, making hair stronger, shinier, and softer. Moreover, comprehensive studies have shown that Kerasylium decreases keratin denaturation by protecting the structural proteins of the hair against oxidative stress, while helping to maintain its color for longer.

"Vertical farming, innovative sourcing for cosmetics and fragrances","When Lindsay Azpitarte launched Ulé, a brand of natural products, with the Shiseido Group in 2022, she chose a novel concept in cosmetics: ultra-local plant sourcing from vertical farming. The three flagship ingredients of the Ulé range, chosen for their ability to improve the skin's resilience, are extracted from exotic plants grown at Tower Farm, a vertical farm located a few kilometres from Paris. ""I wanted to launch a brand centred on the values of conscious beauty. I combined my passion for urbanism and the way cities adapt, with what I wanted to do with the botanist Patrice André, which was to create a slightly different kind of naturalness where nature is closer to people,"" explained Lindsay Azpitarte. Indeed, this principle of indoor cultivation, based on the precise control of all the parameters of the plant's development is meeting in France, the expectations of brands and ingredient suppliers. ""The cosmetics industry is increasingly interested in this trend because it provides both an environmental and an innovative benefit. This technology allows us to create the perfect environment for plants, and to study them in real-time to optimize them for cosmetic purposes,"" added the creator of Ulé. The first advantage is that the biomass required for plant extraction is readily available. ""We can produce any plant all year round with no seasonal constraints. A dozen cycles are possible, whereas, in the natural environment, there is only one season. Then, the fact that the plant is fresh and can be processed within hours of being harvested also allows to obtain a cocktail of molecules that is all the more interesting,"" observed Alexandra Crème, Tower Farm's R&D Director. Vertical farming, therefore, allows controlled sourcing, the optimization of plant resources, a reduced land area and more arable land available. Another environmental benefit is that closed-circuit watering reduces water consumption by 95% compared to traditional crop watering, which is increasingly impacted by recurrent periods of drought. Due to its proximity, vertical farming also secures sourcing. ""The sourcing of naturals comes mainly from emerging countries where there can be supply issues related to climate change, the use of pesticides and herbicides at odds with clean beauty, not to mention complicated logistics routes..."" detailed Gilles Dreyfus, the founder of Jungle, the first vertical farm in France. The company, which has been in operation since 2019, generates half of its turnover from the cosmetics and perfume sector and has set up an exclusive partnership for perfume plants, with ingredient supplier Firmenich. ""Together we have launched a research programme on about twenty plant species to see whether it would be interesting for Firmenich to grow them on our farms,"" explained Gilles Dreyfus, the founder of Jungle. ""There are two types of plants of interest, those from which we can obtain a higher yield of fragrance or active principle, and those from which we can extract equivalent quantities but at a lower cost,"" he added. From this ""cultivation/extraction"" partnership emerged, among other things, a new ingredient in perfumery, the very first natural extract of lily of the valley. Considered a silent flower, the lily of the valley does not generate an essence. ""This flower had never been used in its natural state before in perfumery because its flowering cycle is too short in nature to carry out an extraction campaign. The first fragrance based on this natural lily of the valley extract will be released in June by a major French luxury brand,"" revealed Gilles Dreyfus. In total, eight varieties were selected by Firmenich to be cultivated in the Jungle vertical farm, including violets, another silent flower of the perfume industry. ""These are either plants that are difficult to source, or plants that express themselves better olfactively thanks to the advantages of the controlled environment. Our mastery of the three main parameters, which are nutrition, photosynthesis and climate, allows the plant to express itself in the best possible way,"" added the founder. Optimising the plant's growth conditions by controlling its cultivation parameters opens up new fields of research. ""Rather than producing biomass in quantity, Tower Farm's objective is to harness the potential of this technology, which allows carrying out so-called precision agriculture, to improve the ability of plants to produce certain molecules,"" also asserted Alexandra Crème. At its new sustainable cosmetics production facility in Austin, Texas, Capsum, a contract manufacturer serving the European and US markets, has relied on the integrated installation of its precision vertical farm in collaboration with specialist startup Orius. ""We have equipped ourselves with technology and equipment to optimise the production of active plant ingredients. By controlling climate parameters - water, light, CO2 - we can recreate the conditions in which the plant will produce certain molecules. The idea is to be able to offer our customers a 'seed to bottle' concept,"" explained Laurie Dewandel, Capsum's Communications Director. The tests carried out by Capsum show a threefold increase in the content of total polyphenols produced by the plant, compared to standard growing conditions, the company said. ""The plants are grown to order for cosmetic products. We know the cultivation time needed to provide the highest level of active ingredients, which will then be extracted from fresh plants,"" added the manager. Capsum has already developed an active from sunflower micro-pods and is working on other plant sources. ""Our aim is not to develop a specific active for a client but rather a range of actives from which our clients can choose,"" specified Laurie Dewandel, who sees this as an opportunity to provide differentiating solutions. While the technological model of vertical farms is attractive to the industry, the energy consumed is often criticised. ""This solution contributes to reducing the carbon impact and water consumption while promoting local cultivation..., but we must consider the energy cost of intensive lighting,"" explained Pascale Brousse, Director of Trendsourcing. This is a central issue in the minds of the main stakeholders. ""Energy consumption will be optimised and therefore reduced. In future farms, 80% of the energy will be renewable and will come from solar energy. We also have to compare this with the energy costs of traditional farming, and anything that helps hamper imports is beneficial for the environment,"" noted Gilles Dreyfus. ""Our CSR approach is paramount, Tower Far is B Corp certified. We have set up a co-generator with other startups for greener electricity. We are also working hard on the quality of our LEDs and our air conditioning systems. In just two generations of LEDs we have already halved our electricity consumption,"" added Alexandra Crème. Still little known to consumers, vertical farming is nonetheless making sense in today's cosmetics industry and is part of an intelligent product development approach. ""This must be well explained to the consumer, who needs a lot of information, but also transparency. Also, is it not certifiable as organic in Europe because it is an off-farm crop, which can pose a problem. But it is a model that will be developed because it fits with the strategies of brands reflecting on futuristic scenarios and climate change. Rooftop cultivation is another solution to consider,"" concluded Pascale Brousse.

Global Bioenergies launches a first natural and renewable Isohexadecane,"Isohexadecane is a branched alkane with a medium volatility property which confers a dry and silky finish on the skin. Historically, this molecule comes from the oil industry. The biosourced isohexadecane launched by Global Bioenergies is a 100% natural (according to ISO 16128), which is 100% made and sourced in France. For the first time, the ingredient was synthesized from French sugars. Global Bioenergies will launch this first natural and renewable isohexadecane at in-cosmetics Global, which will be held from March 28 to 30 in Barcelona. ""Our ingredients are made from sugars. We source our raw material in France thanks to sugars manufacturers located closely to our production unit. We are an actor for maintenance of industrial and agricultural jobs in weakened areas in France. In the long run, Global Bioenergies is aiming at cutting CO2 emissions thanks to its innovative process. Indeed, our process will help to significantly decrease the CO2 emissions in comparison with the oil-based ingredient,"" said the company in a statement. The launch of Isonaturane® 16 comes on the heels of the introduction last year of Isonaturane® 12, the first bio-based isododecane. In partnership with Clariant, Global Bioenergies also launched a bio-based rheology modifier in 2018. ""Our technology consists of feeding reprogrammed bacteria with sugars so that they produce isobutene, a hydrocarbon which is at the heart of petrochemicals and makes it possible to manufacture fuels (for sustainable air transportation), but also cosmetic ingredients, and aromas. This is the first time this gas has been produced by fermentation, but it was necessary to build suitable industrial equipment, it is a major industrial investment,"" Marc Delcourt, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of the company, told Premium Beauty News. Global Bioenergies recently received state support from the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME) as part of the ""Biobased products and industrial biotechnologies"" call for projects. A funding of €4.4 million was allocated to Global Bioenergies in the form of 60% subsidy (non-repayable) and 40% repayable advances, subject to the achievement of technical and commercial milestones, to be paid in several instalments over the duration of the project, including an initial 15% instalment.

"Feel good beauty: Me, My skin, and My statement beauty","The quest for ""in-and-out"" beauty is gradually gaining ground in Europe, North America, and Brazil. This form of holistic beauty is meant to be global and more sustainable. It is a learning that can be acquired over time: harmony with yourself takes time. Beyond perfection, it is a search for peace of mind through a new lifestyle. And cosmetic products only make up one part of the allies in this quest for positive, more inclusive beauty. Our skin mirrors our own emotions, but also our health. Contrary to young women looking for instantaneous perfection – the ones that advocate Filtered Beauty and do not hesitate to use cosmetic surgery as soon as they spot a fine line or the tiniest flaw – others choose a completely different approach: that of plural beauty and self-acceptance. The 2023 edition of in-cosmetics Global, which will be held in Barcelona from March 28 to 30, 2023, will reflect these trends. For more details, read our special issue: Cosmetic Ingredients - March 2023.

Solvay introduces a new bio-based thermoprotection in hair care,"Solvay introduces Polycare Heat Therapy, a new functional active ingredient that protects hair from thermal damage due to repeated use of hair styling appliances operating at very high temperatures. Indeed, heat is a powerful hair styling tool, but it can also cause severe damage, such as dehydration and delipidation, brittleness, porosity, reduced surface and loss of softness. When hair is damaged by heat, restoring its healthy physical integrity and sensory qualities is difficult. Thus, it is advisable to protect it when using high-heat styling appliances by providing a thermal shield and minimizing its thermal stress to avoid further damage. According to Solvay, the double-derivatized cationic guar active ingredient advances the global trend of bio-based, non-ecotoxic and silicone-free solutions in hair care and delivers excellent thermal protection in transparent formulations. ""Our new Polycare Heat Therapy addresses the challenge of protecting hair against thermal damage caused by high-heat devices such as flat or curling irons and hair dryers,"" explains Stephanie Neplaz, Global Innovation Marketing Director, Hair care, at Solvay. ""As the market's best naturally-derived performer in this segment, it helps brand owners in the industry replace incumbent silicone and other synthetic polymers, and complements our broad portfolio of bio-based beauty care ingredients."" In hair care formulations, Polycare Heat Therapy forms an invisible and imperceptible barrier on the hair surface. According to Solvay, this multi-functional ingredient adds discipline, straightens effect and softness, and also improves detangling and wet combability without build-up in multiple applications. Comprehensive testing at Solvay has demonstrated that this silicone-free solution can reduce thermally induced hair damage by up to 30%. As a result, the hair is less exposed, less damaged and more protected. Polycare Heat Therapy extends the range of Solvay's active ingredients promoting hair health, which also include Polycare Split Therapy to repair and care and Polycare Frizz Therapy to style and protect. Polycare Heat Therapy is ethically sourced from renewable sources through the company's Sustainable Guar Initiative program in India and serves as a role model of sustainable development in line with the Solvay One Planet roadmap. Solvay will present Polycare Heat Therapy during in-cosmetics in Barcelona from March 28 to 30, 2023, at booth V10."
Clean beauty and sustainability set to lead the fore at in-cosmetics Global,"Taking place at the Fira Barcelona Gran Via, in-cosmetics Global will host more than 800 personal care ingredient suppliers, including companies such as Arxada (formerly Lonza Specialty Ingredients), BASF, Clariant, Codif, Croda, DSM, Evonik, Expanscience, Exsymol, Greentech, Lubrizol, Mibelle, Momentive, Nouryon, Roquette, Silab, Solvay, Shin-Etsu, Symrise, Stepan Europe, and Wacker. Meanwhile, almost 60 new comers will exhibit for the first time, including AntalGenics, Cellugy ApS, Escruder, Gravel AI, Innomost and Sequential Bio. In line with the current transformation of the cosmetics industry, ingredients that respond to the clean beauty trend will take centre stage at this year's edition. Anticipated to grow at a robust CAGR of 40.1%, the global clean beauty market is expected to reach USD 37.65 billion by 2028, according to Research & Markets [1]. Despite a lack of definition, clean beauty has rapidly gained momentum as conscious consumers look for products made from ingredients that are safe, non-toxic and have the lowest possible impact on the environment. According to Soil Association Certification, 2022 was its 11th consecutive year of growth based on the progression of certified organic beauty and wellbeing products. The Association's Organic Beauty and Wellbeing Market Report revealed that nearly half (48%) of consumers are now more concerned about the environment than prior to the pandemic, and 55% are more likely to purchase environmentally friendly products. Also, part of the clean beauty trend, sustainability is now top of mind for personal care and cosmetic ingredient suppliers. The organizers have therefore decided to create a Sustainability Zone, hosting exhibitors who can support suppliers and manufacturers in becoming more sustainable. Sponsored by FarmForce and in partnership with Ecovia Intelligence, the zone will cover every step of the supply chain from product planning, formulation and ingredient sourcing to packaging, manufacturing, and transportation. ""With a growing emphasis on sustainability and the continued efforts of consumers to make more conscious choices of the products they consume and dispose of, it is unsurprising that clean beauty continues to dominate,"" said Roziani Zulkifli, Event Director, in-cosmetics Global. ""As the conversation continues to expand, we're delighted to announce the launch of our new Sustainability Zone at this year's event. It will further expand the opportunities for attendees to discover solutions to every challenge facing their business."" Other key trends at the show include personalisation and CBD, and exhibitors will unveil series of innovations to match with brands and consumers expectations. Active Concepts S.r.L, for instance, will respond to two of this year's biggest trends – clean beauty and CBD. Its 20829-ProCutiGen Bond is a lipopeptide derived from chia seeds. It can be utilised for hair strength and protection thanks to its rich source of protein, helping to prime hair cuticles and prevent damage. The supplier will also highlight its AC Hemp Oil Liposome PF, which capitalises on the potent anti-inflammatory benefits associated with hemp oil and CBD. It uses encapsulation technology to enhance activity and stability, while the inhibition of Interleukin-6 activity is thought to alleviate the chronic inflammatory process, which is linked to skin ageing. Fellow exhibitor, Laboratoires Expanscience will demonstrate its skin and hair sebum regulator, made from upcycled avocados. 5α-Avocuta T is an oil-based natural active ingredient that helps regulate sebum secretion by inhibiting 5 α-reductase activity. According to Expanscience, in a haircare application, it is proven to reduce dandruff by 67%, and greasy hair appearance by 78% in just three weeks. When used in skincare, it can reduce the greasy appearance of the T-zone by 78%. For its part, Microcaps will introduce attendees to its novel microencapsulation technique, which enables the fabrication of highly uniform and microplastic-free beads to enhance the sensory and visual qualities of cosmetic products and to deliver water and oil-based actives. And Selco Wirkstoffe Vertriebs GmbH will profile its 18-ß-Glycyrrhetic acid, which is obtained by hydrolysis of Glycyrrhicinate from the roots of Liquorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra). It will also welcome attendees to see and try Bromelain (100), a natural plant protease that is derived from pineapple strains."
Lubrizol's Actizyme helps darker skin types to maintain glowing appearance,"Actizyme advanced botanical ingredient [1] is a natural [2] exfoliating and moisturizing agent. It is a botanical extract rich in an acid protease that mimics the effect of endogenous cathepsin D (the skin's own desquamating enzymes) to produce a controlled and effective peeling, without side effects. According to Lubrizol, this funghi-derived extract improves the overall appearance of the skin by increasing clarity without compromising barrier function. ""For skin to maintain its glowing appearance, it goes through a natural process of renewal called desquamation. In desquamation, the skin cells go through a complete life cycle – from the base layer of the epidermis to the skin cells maturing and eventually flaking off at the surface. When this process doesn't happen fully, dead skin cells can remain on the skin, making the skin look rough and dull,"" explains Lubrizol Life Science Beauty in a statement. When it was launched in 2015, Actizyme advanced botanical ingredient was thus presented as a gentle alternative to alpha hydroxyl acids (AHAs) or lactic acid in face and body care formulations. Most recently, Lubrizol investigated the benefits of Actizyme advanced botanical ingredient for darker skin types through new in vivo tests. Indeed, according to Lubrizol, skin dullness and lack of radiance linked to the accumulation of dead cells is increasing concern for consumers, especially those with darker complexions. In vivo efficacy testing with Actizyme advanced botanical ingredient was conducted on volunteers with darker complexions. Participants reported visible lightening effects and that their skin appeared more luminous. Actizyme advanced botanical ingredient can be used in a large array of exfoliating products, from rinse-off masks to leave-on daily creams. Its activity can be modulated by dosage and time to achieve the required exfoliating effect."
"Givaudan unveils Gravityl, a new marine ingredient to lift the face contour","With the launch of Gravityl, Givaudan Active Beauty aims to fight the effects of gravity on ageing skin. A 100% natural ingredient crafted by marine biotechnology from a red macro alga, this new active ingredient offers a powerful lifting benefit against visible signs of ageing by reducing skin sagging on face contour and double-chin volume. ""With the skin ageing process, loss of firmness and elasticity is inevitable,"" says Givaudan. When the skin gets older, gravity plays its role and significantly contributes to many signs of ageing, especially on the lower part of the face. According to consumer insights study conducted by Givaudan on 4,100 consumers in 10 countries, 54% [1] of female and male consumers globally develop sagging skin, double chin or loss of face contour. Most of them also consider their jawline structure important but have never had nor would have surgery to deal with it. To respond to this relevant cosmetic need, the Givaudan Active Beauty team looked for the best solution to relaunch the production of key structural constituents of the skin, while fighting against the effects of gravity. ""Thanks to an exclusive multistep and eco-friendly process, we have crafted an enriched extract of Gigartina stellate [2], able to relaunch key processes linked to the extracellular matrix and elastic fibre protection, and reorganising fibres in the dermis. Its specific mode of action and spectacular performance make Gravityl the ideal ally to fight against visible signs of ageing, skin sagging and double-chin, bringing back suppleness to the face, with a demonstrated 30-year rejuvenation of the skin's biomechanical properties,"" says Mathias Fleury, Head of Category Actives for Givaudan Active Beauty. Two clinical tests versus placebo, on a total of 84 female volunteers from 35 to 75 years old, established that Gravityl is able to relaunch the production of collagen fibres in mature skin and to increase collagen content by 3.4 times [3] while improving firmness and elasticity by up to 7 times [4] versus placebo. This new active ingredient also offers a significant lifting effect as it drastically reduces double-chin volume in just one month (by more than 27 mm3), visibly reshaping and reinforcing the structure of facial skin. In order to illustrate the efficacy of Gravityl in a face care, Givaudan has formulated a 4-in-1 firming cream that was named S3D Jawline Reshape. The effect of Gravityl is strengthened by two additional cosmetic ingredients known for their well-ageing efficacy, Agefinity and Acerola LG to boost skin elasticity, regenerate cells, reorganise collagen and provide antioxidant benefits. Gravityl and S3D Jawline Reshape were introduced at the PCHI trade show in Guangzhou, China, from 15-17 February 2023."
"Senevisium, Silab's new anti-aging active ingredient derived from Ginkgo biloba","Senescence [1] is usually controlled by the immune system, that effectively locates and eradicates cells that are harmful to the cutaneous environment. Over time, however, some senescent fibroblasts implement immunoevasion strategies to avoid being eliminated. That precisely the immunoevasion mechanism that is targeted by Silab's new anti-ageing active ingredient. Thanks to in vitro and in vivo modelling studies, Silab says they have shown the accentuation of the immunoevasion mechanism at the level of the skin after the age of 60, inducing profound changes (wrinkles, dull complexion, loss of elasticity and senescence spots). ""Through its targeted action, Senevisium is able to restore the natural elimination of immunoevasive senescent fibroblasts by the immune system by circumventing their two immunoevasion pathways,"" claims the company. According to Silab, by allowing deleterious immunoevasive senescent fibroblasts to be recognized again and eliminated, Senevisium protects the skin from their harmful effects on matrix synthesis and epidermal renewal. ""Tested at 2% in Caucasian volunteers, Senevisium enables the skin to restore its density and elasticity. The stage of wrinkles is reduced, and complexion radiance is enhanced,"" details the company. After 28 days of treatment, 100% of the female volunteers said they found their skin firmer, and their complexion lighter and more uniform. Silab extracted Senevisum's active molecules from leaves of Ginkgo Biloba, a tree known for its powerful immune system. Two French farms, certified for their organic and biodiversity-friendly processes, were selected for the supply of the green leaves. The company recommends to use Senevisium in skin care products dedicated to mature skins at a concentration of 0.5 to 2.0%. Available in aqueous solution, it complies with biodiversity regulations and has a natural origin content of 98.8% (ISO 16128). It meets international cosmetic regulations requirements (Europe, United States, China, Japan, etc.)."
"Givaudan unveils RetiLife, a biotech alternative to synthetic retinol","RetiLife, Givaudan Active Beauty's new active ingredient, is a molecule designed to fight skin ageing. It is, according to the company, the first 100% naturally sourced retinol. This sustainable alternative to synthetic retinol was produced through the use of micro-organisms. First, pure retinol is produced in a natural carrier during a fermentation process from plant sugars. It is then combined with natural antioxidants to ensure its protection, even at a very high concentration. ""RetiLife is the first of its kind to offer a sustainable alternative to synthetic retinol with similar anti-wrinkle efficacy"", claimed Givaudan in a statement. With 100% natural-origin content, including sunflower oil as a carrier, the composition of RetiLife avoids synthetic ingredients such as BHT/BHA or polysorbate. Its molecule is identical to its chemical counterpart. ""Retinol is widely used in skincare applications for its well-known efficient anti-wrinkles properties. After years of research and development, we are thrilled to offer the most innovative and sustainable retinol on the cosmetic market and therefore open the door to new cosmetic applications. RetiLife is a game- changer in the beauty industry that responds to consumer demand for cleaner beauty products,"" highlighted Romain Reynaud, R&D Director of Givaudan Active Beauty. RetiLife will be introduced during in-cosmetics Global taking place in Barcelona, Spain, from 28-30 March, 2023. ""Throughout the years, Active Beauty has broken cosmetic boundaries by launching active ingredients that outperform competitors. With the launch of RetiLife, a unique hero cosmetic biotech innovation, we focus on creating consumer-preferred products that leverage our capabilities in line with our purpose,"" highlighted Maurizio Volpi, President of Givaudan Fragrance & Beauty. Retinol – one of the forms of vitamin A – is widely used by the cosmetics industry, due to its stimulating action on the skin's natural defences. Indeed, Vitamin A maintains homeostasis of epithelial tissues and mucosa through its metabolite, retinoic acid. Retinol has demonstrated its benefits on wrinkles, stretch marks, skin blemishes and scars and is one of the most popular cosmetic ingredients, alongside aloe vera and vitamin C. As such, it is the subject of much research. In November last year, Givaudan Active Beauty announced the launch of Siliphos, a natural alternative to retinoids with a very high tolerability profile. For its part, Serderma has launched ReVitAlide — a lipid submicron particle carrying 3% active retinol. According to the Croda Personal Care subsidiary, this high-tech capsule provides enhanced stability, protecting retinol from degradation and making it easy to store and formulate. Note also the launch of NovoRetin by Mibelle Biochemistery, a plant-based active ingredient that can increase naturally occurring retinoic acid in the skin and thereby induce retinol-like effects without the need to apply retinoids topically on the skin. All these different approaches contribute to place retinol as a cornerstone of the fight against skin ageing."
Algafiller: Agrimer's marine origin wrinkle filler,"Algafiller [1] is extracted from Codium tomentosum, a chlorophycean macroalgae with a coenocytic structure consisting in a single giant cell with a strong capacity healing and regeneration. Algafiller contains sulfated mannan and arabinogalactan, two polysaccharides that are recognized for their moisturizing properties. This 100% natural ingredient, free from preservative and compatible with a vegan claim, is obtained by ""auto -hydrolysis"" of the polysaccharides contained in the seaweed. This process patented by Agrimer enhances the solubilization and bioavailability of polysaccharides by reducing their size. This new generation filler addresses lipoatrophy, a loss of adipose tissue that occurs with age. The decrease in the number and size of adipocytes linked to aging leads to a loss of volume in the face: dark circles and cheeks become hollow, the facial oval sags, and wrinkles looks bigger and skin folds. The benefits of Algafiller (filler effect, lipofilling, improved firmness, increased in dermal density, reduction of wrinkles and fine lines of crow's feet) have been objectified by a series of in vitro and in vivo tests. Tested in vivo on human adipocytes Algafiller has shown its ability to increase the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes: – Lipogenic effect: +130% at 0.3% Algafiller (compared to the control); – Increase in adiponectin synthesis: +212% at 0.1% Algafiller (compared to the control). An ex vivo test on human skin explants has shown that Algafiller (at 0.1%) boosts the synthesis of the extracellular matrix (neosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans - GAGs) by +29% in the skin's tissues (compared to the control). Several in vivo tests [2] have made it possible to objectify different claims: – Crow's feet smoothing (LifeViz Micro image analysis), -12.3% of wrinkle volume; – Smoothing of the nasolabial fold (LifeViz Micro image analysis): -22.2% of the nasolabial fold; – Plumps up the cheek volume (LifeViz Micro image analysis), +6% plumping effect; – Increase in skin tonicity (measured by cutometry), +15.2% skin firmness; – Redensification of the dermis (ultrasound measurement), +17.3% dermal density. Agrimer recommends using Algafiller for anti-aging and post-menopausal care applications in concentrations of 1% to 3%."
"Will bamboo, apple, chebula be the natural beauty ingredients to star in 2023?","The cosmetics industry's enthusiasm for natural ingredients does not seem to be weakening! After prickly pear and rice — two of the essential beauty allies of 2022 — here are three new ingredients poised to become next year's essentials. Bamboo is not unknown in the cosmetics sector, but interest in this plant is growing as we head into 2023, and for many reasons. Bamboo — and, more precisely, the natural silica it contains — has multiple benefits for the skin. It can be found in beauty as a hydrolat or hydrosol to deeply nourish dry and dehydrated skin, and is also favoured for its regenerative power. This property makes it a must in anti-aging treatments, whether to help preserve skin firmness or fight against wrinkles and fine lines. Bamboo is a major beauty partner thanks to is its ability to meet the needs of almost all skin types, since it is also beneficial for combination to oily skin thanks to its mattifying power. It's even good for damaged hair and nails, and in powder form, it can help fight excessive perspiration. The many health benefits of the crunchy fruit are well known. Recently, the apple has made a foray into fashion, emerging as a potential alternative to animal leathers. And it's now finding its way into cosmetics, ready to land in 2023, thanks to its anti-aging virtues and other skin benefits. Rich in polyphenols and quercetin, apples promise to act on the various signs of skin aging, starting with loosening, reduced firmness, and wrinkles. But that's not all. Apple could also act on skin renewal, and protect it against future aggression from external factors, such as pollution, for example, while nourishing dry skin. As in many cosmetics, the fruit, used in association with other natural ingredients, could even be an ally for combination skin suffering from excess sebum. Known in Ayurvedic medicine, chebula can have many names, such as chebulic myrobalan or haritaki, and is considered a miracle ingredient in some countries and regions, including India and Tibet, because of its countless benefits. According to Ayurveda, it has anti-inflammatory virtues that are beneficial for the skin as well as for the body, not to mention anti-aging properties that make it effective in smoothing and firming skin, and making it more elastic. This is due to its high antioxidant content. In addition, this all-purpose ingredient could contribute to strengthening and rebuilding the skin barrier, helping it to protect it against certain external factors, while moisturizing the skin in depth. These virtues are already winning over people around the world, according to the latest report from the online cosmetics specialist, Beauty Pie. It reports that chebula is one of the strongest trends in skincare in 2023, with an unprecedented jump of 922% in Google search volume over one year. Watch out for this essential beauty ally in the coming months."
Tick tock: Seppic regulates skin clock genes with Centella asiatica,"Sleep disorders constitute a global problem that threatens health, but also skin quality. Seppic addresses consumers' sleep-related issues with TALADVANCE™: an extract of Malagasy leaves of Centella asiatica that regulates skin chronobiology and has significant effects on skin radiance and suppleness, thanks to an action during both day and night. Healthy skin has its own rhythm, with defense and repair mechanisms renewing skin like clockwork. This rhythm is circadian and follows a 24-hour cycle, during day and night times. Skin circadian rhythm results in specific molecules that interact with cells throughout the body and whose synthesis is controlled by biological clock genes. Sleep deprivation can greatly influence skin health and disrupt our circadian rhythms, resulting in increased signs of skin aging (fine lines, uneven pigmentation, reduced elasticity, signs of fatigue), with much slower recovery rates after skin barrier disruption and lower satisfaction with appearance. An in vitro model in chronobiology developed by Seppic highlights that TALADVANCE™ regulates skin clock genes and resynchronizes fibroblasts. In this way, TALADVANCE™ participates in the restoration and maintenance of the skin homeostasis, and so restores the skin circadian rhythm when deregulated. Clinically, TALADVANCE™ showed a significant effect to reach a healthy skin, thanks to an action during both day and night. Indeed at 2%, after 28 days, it improves skin suppleness tested at night and skin luminosity and radiance tested during the day. Additionally, in only 30 minutes, TALADVANCE™ at 5% visibly improves skin radiance, uniformity and tone. Easy to formulate, TALADVANCE™ can help to formulate trendy cosmetic products and in particular to target pre-bed occasions with skin care products."
Tunisia: Prickly pear producers predict cacti cosmetics cash-in,"""This is the capital of the Barbary fig,"" said Mohamed Rochdi Bannani, one of the North African country's first producers of cosmetic oil from the seeds of the fruit — better known as the prickly pear. He is hoping the oil, with its rich antioxidant properties and a price tag of some 350 euros (around USD 360) a litre, can bring wealth to the marginalised province of Kasserine, Tunisia. ""This fruit has changed my life and the life of the region. It's created wealth in the district, even though the fruit used to be a symbol of poverty,"" the 52-year-old said. He was standing on his 420-hectare (about 1,000-acre) organic-certified farm in the parched Zelfen district. Every year, Bannani produces 2,000 litres of oil from the plant, which is native to Mexico but has been cultivated in North Africa, South of Spain and Sicily for generations. Used in moisturising and anti-ageing products, it is a much-needed cash cow in a region where one third of people live in poverty and unemployment runs at 20 percent. The cactus plant's ability to weather extreme drought is another advantage. Some 30,000 hectares of land are dedicated to the crop in Zelfen, close to the border with Algeria. Around a tenth of that is organic-certified. The industry employs some 5,000 people, says Boubaker Raddaoui of the United Nations-backed Market Access Project for Agrifood and Local Products (PAMPAT). ""This oil has become a catalyst for an inclusive local economy,"" he said, praising the cactus for its ""ability to adapt and produce in difficult conditions, as well as its industrial potential"". ""It's really a miracle plant,"" added Mr. Raddaoui. Tunisia ranks fifth in the world in terms of land devoted to prickly pear production, behind Brazil, Mexico, Ethiopia and Morocco. While some of the 550,000 tonnes of fruit it produces every year are sold in markets and from street carts known as ""hindi"", most goes to oil. Some 8,000 litres were exported in 2021, bringing in five million euros in revenue, according to PAMPAT. The organisation has been helping farmers with training and business advice since 2013, and has seen rapid growth in the sector, Raddaoui said. ""Exports jumped by 50 percent between 2019 and 2021,"" he told AFP. ""This shows the attractiveness of the sector and the increase in demand from one year to the next."" Since the start of the millennium, the country has gone from having five processing plants to 55. Zelfen alone has 11, run by cooperatives. ""Before, everyone just wanted to emigrate, but today that's ancient history — thanks to the oil,"" said Hamza Rochdi, a young farmer with 40 hectares of land. Hanane Messaoudi, who harvests the fruit for the minimum wage of just USD 125 a month, says demand for the fruit has improved her working conditions. Yet the high price of its oil is not the prickly pear's only asset. In a dry country where access to water is already far below the 1,700 cubic metres per resident per year the United Nations defines as ""water stressed"", the drought-tolerant cactus is a safer bet compared with thirstier crops. ""The prickly pear is undemanding, adapts to lots of soil types and doesn't use much water,"" Raddaoui said. The success of the crop in Zelfen has prompted farmers in other regions such as Nabeul and Kairouan to take an interest. But there is only so much demand for the product, and Bannani says ""marketing problems"" mean he only processes around a fifth of his harvest — some 20,000 tonnes of fruit — for oil."
Is chebula the new trendy anti-aging ingredient?,"Connoisseurs may know the ingredient under the name of 'chebulic myrobolan,' the fruit of the Terminalia chebula or Haritaki, especially followers of Ayurveda, the ancient traditional Indian medicine. Rich in luteic acid and gallic acids called chebulin, it is starting to make a name for itself in the cosmetics sector in the United States, under the name 'chebula'. Well known for its anti-inflammatory, detoxifying, regenerating, chebula could easily be described as a multifunctional ingredient in some countries and regions, including India and Tibet. But that's not all, thanks to is antioxidant virtues, the chebula is becoming a go-to in antiaging skincare routines in recent years, since it would help to smoothing and firming skin and making it more elastic. Paired with other moisturizing ingredients, it would also provide deep nourishment to the skin and help protect it against external aggressions. Among others, it can be found in True Botanicals' Chebula Active Face Serum and Renew Chebula Extreme Skin Barrier Cream, in the Super Hydrate Overnight Mask by Paula's Choice, and in Derma MD Skincare's Chebula Skin Renew Antioxidant Serum. Highly coveted in the skincare realm, chebula is starting to appear in many beauty players' trend predictions for the coming year. According to the latest report from online cosmetics platform Beauty Pie, chebula is making its way into the top 10 skincare trends of 2023, with a dramatic 922% increase in search volume on Google over the course of a year. The beauty specialist even expects a boom of some cosmetics based on the natural anti-aging ingredient within a few months."
Berkem upcycles French kiwi leaves to create a new active skincare ingredient,"Ki'Leaft is a 100% natural COSMOS-certified extract of kiwi (Actinidia chinensis) leaves. The new active ingredient is upcycled [1] from crop by-products from farms located near the Berkem Group's extraction plant, in Dordogne, in the south-west of France. According to Berkem, Ki'Leaft meets market needs in new naturel active ingredients offering antioxidant, firming and regenerative properties, while also reinforcing the skin's barrier function. The culmination of 10 years of research and development Ki'Leaft is an active ingredient rich in sugars and containing polyphenols [2]. Clinical studies have shown that Ki'Leaft provides an immediate tightening effect, contributes to skin regeneration, and strengthens the skin's barrier function and structure. It also shows a high antioxidant capacity. ""Ki'Leaft meets the cosmetics market's expectations by offering benefits for the facial care market (serum, face treatments, etc.) which has experienced annual worldwide growth of 10% since 2020, [3]"" highlights Berkem. Located near the main French kiwifruit farms, the Berkem factory in Gardonne, in the south-west of France, benefits from an easily accessible source of raw materials from controlled and certified organic cultivation. Indeed, the Nouvelle Aquitaine region accounts for 75% of French kiwi production. While the leaf picked with the fruit is mostly discarded during harvest, the new active ingredient developed by the Berkem Group brings this renewable resource to a second and high-value life. ""With 30 years of experience in plant extraction, Groupe Berkem, a developer of plant-based chemistry solutions, constantly seeks to be a pioneer of innovative solutions in the field of health, beauty and nutrition sectors. The development of this new active ingredient with remarkable benefits by upcycling meets the demands of our customers in the cosmetics industry, both professionals and major brands, while also illustrating our Group's CSR commitments,"" says Charlène Martin, Marketing Manager, Groupe Berkem."

Merck: A trio of marine skincare ingredients to boost skin renewal,"Presented at the latest in-cosmetics Asia trade show, that took place in Bangkok, Thailand, from November 1-3, 2022, Merck's new cosmetic active RonaCare JouvaMer and RonaCare ReviMer, have been designed to boost skin vitality and to be used within a wide range of topical products, from daily skin care to dermocosmetics. The products were recently launched in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The two products have been developed from brown seaweed endemic to the Breton coast in France. RonaCare JouvaMer [1], an extract of Pelvetia canaliculata brown algae, is an anti- aging booster that reduces wrinkles by stimulating collagen synthesis. Additionally, it protects and supports the extracellular matrix for denser, smoother skin. RonaCare ReviMer [2], an extract of Fucus serratus brown algae, shows preventive anti-pollution effects while enhancing the skin's biomechanical properties. It also protects hyaluronic acid that helps provide firmer, more elastic skin, and reduces wrinkles. Complementing the already launched RonaCare RenouMer [3], the new ingredients form a marine trio that offers potent solutions for skin renewal. Indeed, according to Merck, RonaCare RenouMer, an extract of Polysiphonia elongata red algae, is highly effective in replenishing skin and counteracting the signs of aging. This skin moisture booster strongly increases skin's moisture levels, promotes collagen build-up and its protection from degradation, which results in a re-densifying effect for visibly smoother, less wrinkled skin. ""Algae have been used for centuries as very nutritious food ingredients because of their important minerals and vitamins for the body,"" explained Carsten Plueg, Head of Innovation and Application within the Surface Solutions business unit of Merck. ""Today, also the cosmetic industry is using those algae substances and the benefits they have on human skin. These marine actives are indeed particularly attractive for consumers as they combine the desire for naturalness and sustainability with proven efficacy in boosting well-aging and skin vitality."" According to Merck, all three products are efficacy proven and meet the current requirements of sustainability, traceability, and respect for biodiversity. Merck has established mutually agreed terms with France to financially contribute to and collaborate with the regional Fisheries and Aquaculture Committee of Brittany (CRPMEM) as part of the Nagoya protocol. RonaCare JouvaMer, RonaCare ReviMer and RonaCare RenouMer are Halal certified and vegan. They also fulfill the COSMOS-standard, which defines the requirements for organic and/or natural cosmetics."
Symrise stretches the boundaries of naturalness in perfumery,"Obtaining 100% natural fruit extracts and extracting odoriferous compounds from the fruits, known for their high water content, is a real challenge since distilling water is very complicated and traditional extraction methods do not work. This is where Symrise's SymTrap extraction technology comes into play. Derived from the synergy between the Food and Fine Fragrance Symrise Divisions, SymTrap is used to extract odorant compounds from an ingredient in its aqueous state. This includes rinse water or residual juices produced by the extraction, distillation and freeze-drying of plants, fruits and vegetables. The technology can therefore be used to upcycle those waters and juices that will no longer go to waste. As it requires only a small amount of energy, SymTrap also has the advantage of a reduced carbon footprint. After a preview in July at the World Perfumery Congress in Miami, Symrise showcased at Beautyworld Middle East a range of fruity alcoholates that add up to the Garden Lab collection to form a range dubbed ""Supernature"". ""After the successful launch of our Garden Lab range, we continued our constant exchanges with our Taste, Nutrition and Health colleagues. They introduced us to their banana food production line from Ecuador and mentioned the resulting water phase side stream. We immedialtely saw the opportunity to develop a Banana SymTrap,"" said Jennifer Buffalo, Laboratory Manager Natural Ingredients at Symrise. This creation was completed by three other alcoholates: Apple SymTrap, which offers a crunchy Granny Smith facet evolving into black tea and floral undertones, Strawberry SymTrap, and Blackcurant SymTrap, reminding the notes of blackcurrant liqueur from the Burgundy region and blackcurrent ice cream. Many other creations are possible and Symrise already has a Maracuja SymTrap, made from passion fruit, and a Cranberry SymTrap. ""The history of perfumery has always been about exploring new and original notes. As explorers we are at the forefront of driving circularity through sustainable ingredient innovation,"" highlights Ricardo Omori, President Global Fine Fragrance at Symrise. The Supernature range, as well as Symrise's other fragrance ingredients - in particular the Madagascar and Artisan collections - are now gathered within Maison Lautier 1795, named after the Grasse-based supplier who had merged over the 1990s with the German company Haarmann & Reimer, which became Symrise in 2003. New generations of fragrance ingredients from green chemistry, white chemistry, and biotechnologies will be presented, among many other topics, at the next edition of the Fragrance Innovation Summit on December 1, 2022 in Paris .

Seppic creates hybrid foundations using hydrophilic pigments,"According to Seppic, the make-up market is in the midst of a revolution, the buzzword of which is ""skincarization"", a trend where the logic of skincare extends to new categories. As a result: consumers now expect makeup products that take special care of their skin. The influence of skincare on make-up not only reflects in the use of skincare active ingredients in formulas, but also in the creation of innovative textures. ""To create sensorial textures, inspired by skin care (O/W foundation, cream gel, ...) involving external water phases, formulators need Hydrophilic Coated Pigments to optimize foundation coverage and achieve good make-up performance,"" says the company in statement. Therefore, Seppic has challenged its polymers and emulsifiers to obtain compatibility data with hydrophilic pigments in powder form and in dispersed liquid form. ""The results will help formulators to choose the suitable products and build nice textures with this kind of pigment,"" deems the subsidiary of the Air Liquide group. Among the polymers that were tested, Sepimax Zen (Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6) has proven to be the best performing polymer, while Solagum AX (Acacia Senegal Gum and Xanthan Gum), emerged as the best natural polymer. According to Seppic, various other polymers give good performance results too, such as Sepinov EMT 10 (Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer), Sepiplus S (Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer and Polyisobutene and PEG-7 Trimethylolpropane Cononut Ether), Sepiplus 400 (Polyacrylate-13 and Polyisobutene and Polysorbate 20) & Simulgel NS (Hydroxyethylacrylate/Sodium AcryloyldimethylTaurate Copolymer and Squalane and Polysorbate 60). Of course, it is possible to adjust the percentage of polymers and emulsifiers for a wide range of viscosities. For emulsifiers, several ingredients are performing depending on the requested sensoriality: Sensanov WR (C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate and C20-22 Alcohols), Montanov 202 (Arachidyl Alcohol and Behenyl Alcohol and Arachidyl Glucoside), Fluidifeel Easy (Lauryl Glucoside and Myristyl Glucoside and Polyglyceryl-6 Laurate) ... Thus, Seppic can offer solutions ranging from comfortable to high natural foundations, from thick to fluid textures. As consumers are increasingly looking for no-transfer and high coverage efficacy, Seppic has done some measurement in emulsion chassis. ""Our simple formulas are non-transfert like a W/Si market benchmark and obtained better results than a water based foundation benchmark,"" claims the company."
Silab's Lightskin: a new depigmenting active from natural origin,"Lightskin is a natural depigmenting active ingredient obtained from biotechnological processes, rich in sulfur-containing peptides known for their capacity to limit melanogenesis. ""Pigment defects are thus attenuated, complexion is lighter and more uniform, and radiance is revived in Caucasian and Asian skin,"" said Silab in a statement. For this new active, Silab tapped into the potential of sulfur-containing peptides, a series of molecules known for their transversal ability to limit melanogenesis. Thus, Silab has selected the yeast Ogataea siamensis, whose natural capacity to produce sulfur-containing molecules constitutes a considerable selective advantage for its development in the phyllosphere of the medicinal plant Ervatamia coronaria. Building on its 15 years of expertise in biotechnologies, the French manufacturer was able to develop a unique process for bioguiding this yeast, specifically stimulating the production of large quantities of these molecules of interest. According to Silab, this richness in bioguided sulfur-containing peptides enabled the global depigmenting action of Lightskin to be doubled on Caucasian and Asian melanocytes, significantly limiting tyrosinase activity and melanin production. This efficacy was also demonstrated in pro-pigmenting contexts of pollution (receptor related to pollution (AhR) inactivated) and glycation (expression of the receptor for AGEs inhibited), the company highlighted. Lightskin was evaluated in volunteers selected on the presence of pigment spots, and more specifically on their high level of AGEs (Caucasian panel) or their history of living in polluted environments (Asian panel). ""The results showed that the active ingredient at 2.5% reduces the appearance of spots after 56 days of treatment on both panels. Uniformity of the complexion is thus improved, and radiance is revived. 91% of Asian volunteers stated that their complexion was more uniform and brighter, and their spots less visible,"" claimed Silab. With its targeted performance, Lightskin is a patented active ingredient recommended in all depigmenting care products at the amount of 0.25 to 2.50%. Available in aqueous solution, it complies with biodiversity regulations and has a natural origin content of 98.8% (ISO 16128). It meets international cosmetic regulations requirements (Europe, United States, China, Japan, etc.)."
Givaudan adds Scentaurus Melrose to their range of biodegradable fragrances,"Scentaurus Melrose is the latest addition to Givaudan's palette of biodegradable fragrance precursors. This class of fragrances are designed to release fragrant molecules upon exposure to a natural external trigger such as oxygen, light, or humidity in the air. Using this technology for fragrance creation allows to bring long lastingness to fragrances in products such as fabric or home and personal care products. ""It is a novel way of formulating that reinvents fragrance architecture by delivering some notes at later stages in order to satisfy consumer needs for performance and long lastingness,"" explains Givaudan in a statement. Scentaurus Melrose adds to the existing family of fragrance precursors first introduced in 2006 with Scentaurus Tonkarose, the first light cleavable precursor in the perfumer's palette, and the first to release two different odorants. The palette has grown to currently include Scentaurus Tonkarose, Scentaurus Clean, Scentaurus Juicy and Scentaurus Berry, each with a versatile olfactive profile that expands and enhances the cross-category creative range of Givaudan's perfumers. Each Scentaurus ingredient is exclusive to the company. Scentaurus Melrose was developed according to the principles of Green Chemistry using Givaudan's proprietary FiveCarbon Path where all carbon atoms in the bio-based starting material end up in the final product, resulting in zero carbon waste. ""This exclusive research and development process brings an eco-minded approach to continuously improve the palette of fragrance ingredients by using materials based on renewable carbon while improving processes to reduce carbon and energy input,"" adds the company. Scentaurus Melrose expands the company's variety of scents with a long-lasting floral green effect with honey and linden blossom facets, and floral fresh rosy signals with powdery anisic undertones. ""The first time I smelled Scentaurus Melrose, I found myself back on the French Riviera where I grew up, amidst the mimosa fields with their delicate combination of green, floral and powdery notes. In addition to its obvious green and honey notes, Melrose has a soft, powdery floral facet, making it an amazing precursor for adding a natural green floral character to any creation,"" commented Paolo Andriollo, Givaudan Perfumer."
"Afyren launches industrial production of biosourced, low-carbon molecules","Fermentation is most definitely a remarkable source of alternative solutions to petrol-based chemistry! Initiated as soon as 2012 by PhD in Biology and Chemistry Jérémy Pessiot, Afyren's strategy is aimed to replace the petroleum-based molecules essential to a wide variety of industries for their antibacterial, olfactory, and preservation properties with their biosourced equivalent. On September 29, the company reached the industrial phase of its project with the inauguration of its first biorefinery, Afyren Neoxy, which is meant to produce biosourced carboxylic acids. ""This way, we will combine profitability and environmental protection with a zero-waste plant and very low CO2 emissions, since they are divided by five, compared to conventional solutions. And all this is done following circular economy principles"", explains Joachim Merziger, Afyren's Marketing Director. The Afyren technology is based on the biomimetic fermentation of GMO-free co-products of the sugar industry. It helps produce a family of seven fully biosourced, very high-quality, extremely pure organic acids with between two and six carbon atoms. The Afyren acids meet the definition of natural aromas under Regulation (EC) no. 1334/2008 and are Ecocert- and Cosmos-certified. It is a short-channel European offering with a very satisfactory traceability. The acids produced can be used as such, as ingredients, or transformed into derivatives for the cosmetics and perfumes industries, for example. The Afyren propionic acid, which is only available as a petroleum-based product for now, will help create esters used as fragrances or aromas. As for acetic acid, it is used to produce nail varnish ingredients. ""This family of acids is a toolkit for new, fully biosourced derivatives. The acid market in general is estimated at 13 billion euros, so it offers a huge potential for substituting substances derived from fossil resources with biosourced ingredients"", says Merziger. ""Many cosmetics and perfumes players have set up very ambitious programmes to make their products more sustainable, and we offer them solutions and tools"", adds the Director. Since it became a publicly listed company in 2021, Afyren has been able to raise 70 million euros, finance R&D work, and start building this first industrial unit. They are now considering the possibility to implement this production in other geographical areas (North America and South-East Asia) for openings in 2026/2027. ""The idea is to meet the demands of our global customers in the three major industrial hubs, i.e. Europe, Asia, and North America. Biomass supplies will be local: it is a key element of Afyren's strategy. We aim to keep the benefits of a short channel and a reduced carbon footprint, and to secure our customers' supplies,"" explains Merziger. Afyren received support via the AFTER-BIOCHEM project, a skill pool of 12 European companies which validated the industrial project and the relevance of the products use. ""It is a project in the project"", emphasizes Merziger. ""Launched by Afyren, AFTER-BIOCHEM gathers participants from five European countries to strengthen the whole upstream-downstream chain around this first biorefinery. These players come from different sectors, like Südzucker, the main sugar leader and our co-product supplier, cosmetics expert Fiabila, Firmenich, for aromas and perfumes, representatives of human and animal nutrition, industrial chemistry…,"" he concludes."
"""Sustainability is a full part of TechnicoFlor's DNA,"" Bérengère Bourgarel","When did the question of sustainability arise at TechnicoFlor? Bérengère Bourgarel - The group has been developing 100% natural products for 15 years and is one of the pioneers in this field. Sustainability is deeply ingrained in our DNA. We launched a CSR approach in 2013, which led to the creation of fair trade channels, the launch of natural formulations, and the integration of fair trade materials in our compositions. Today, we can say that we are experts in natural and sustainable formulations. We took an even bigger step in terms of sustainability two years ago with the launch of numerous initiatives, including a tool that calculates the biodegradability of our perfume formulas, a responsible purchasing policy, and an eco-score that evaluates the impact of our formulas on the entire production chain, from creation to delivery of the perfume to our customers. What solutions has the group implemented in order to move in the direction of ever more natural and sustainable formulas and compositions? Bérengère Bourgarel - When we think of perfume, we often think of the bottle and cap, but the perfume itself, the juice, must also become more environmentally sustainable. To do this, we have to make shorter formulas and use ingredients — raw materials — that are increasingly sustainable. So for that we had to get informed, conduct research, and try to understand alongside suppliers how we could proceed, knowing that this is as much about naturality as it is about the process. This year, we managed to launch a collection from upcycled raw materials, and we realized that some materials were already upcycled, such as clementine peel, without being considered as such. We now have about 30 upcycled raw materials, both synthetic and natural, and this collection also meets a very strict environmental specification. Each of the perfumes had to be composed of one of these materials, have a biodegradability index of over 80%, and include a maximum of fair trade ingredients. How does upcycling work in the world of fragrance? Bérengère Bourgarel - At TechnicoFlor, we do not produce raw materials. We buy them from our suppliers, either in powder or liquid form, and then we create our compositions from what we have sourced. The challenge is to only source raw materials from our suppliers that are upcycled. And they can come from different industries; this has allowed us to discover different olfactory facets that we didn't know. There are, for example, wood shavings that are recovered from woodworking, white wine lees from the deposit collected in barrels, and cocoa pods which, surprisingly enough, have odorant molecules. In the long run, we will inevitably find other raw materials to use. Today, there is a huge waste problem, and upcycling allows us to try to propose solutions. Is there some difficulty in combining the art of conventional perfumery with techniques or solutions that are less harmful to the environment? Bérengère Bourgarel - Creating a perfume with strict specifications is necessarily a challenge, but that's also what's interesting about this job. You have to dig deep, push your creativity, and find a new way of working. It just takes a little more time. There are going to be more and more constraints, so you just have to adapt and be creative. Waste is at the centre of attention these days, becoming the raw material of choice in many sectors. Is it really a sustainable solution? Bérengère Bourgarel - We'll find out in the future. We are inevitably moving towards this, because thanks to biotechnology we can obtain almost anything we want. As natural resources are gradually depleted, the perfumery sector, like other industries, could in the future rely on biotechnology. In any case, there is true awareness in the perfumery industry, and things are evolving very quickly in terms of environmental responsibility. This can only be a good thing. Would you go as far as saying that you bottle waste? Bérengère Bourgarel - I don't know if I would go that far. The word 'waste' is so pejorative... We have the image of something that is not engaging, that does not smell good, the opposite of perfumery finally. But it's undoubtedly the future. We are going to run out of space one day on Earth, and waste takes up a lot of it, it's problematic, so upcycling is inevitably part of the future of perfumery. What's the next step in perfumery in order to adopt an even more responsible model? Bérengère Bourgarel - As I said earlier, the next step will be biotechnology. This is the ultimate in environmental responsibility."
Lubrizol offers exposome protection with multifunctional biotech ingredient,"LLS Beauty's new Xpozuki [1] active ingredient has been designed to protect the skin, scalp and hair against exposome-induced stressors, defined as the totality of exposures to which an individual is subjected throughout its life, including from the sun, pollution and climate change, as well as chemical and physical aggressions. These factors, combined with the body's response to each, can lead to premature signs of aging. This multifunctional, biotechnological ingredient is sourced from organically farmed azuki beans or red mung bean (Vigna angularis). They are rich in a category of natural peptides - that LLS Beauty has named Azukides - which have shown to be responsible for the antioxidant effects of the ingredients. Thanks to proprietary biotechnological processes, LLS Beauty has been able to enrich the content of Azukides in the ingredient.

Givaudan Active Beauty launches radish-based purple pigment for make-up,"Givaudan Active Beauty is launching New Purple 2364 [1], a vegan pigment designed for use in make-up formulations. Extracted by green fractionation from red radish (Raphanus Sativus L.), this new pigment complements Givaudan's range of sustainable alternatives to synthetic pigments initiated in 2020 with the launch of New Red 1805, a vegan red pigment. ""For centuries, purple has been valued in different cultures as a colour representing elegance, consciousness and power. Named colour of the year 2022 by Pantone, purple has earned a place as one of the hottest shades in make-up formulation and among those that go best with all skin tones,"" explained Givaudan Active Beauty in a statement. According to the company, new Purple 2364 shows exceptional stability to temperature exposure and light radiation when formulated at 10%. Clinical evaluations on three different complexions (African, Asian and Caucasian) have also showed the pigment offers a vivid, intense and homogeneous colour when applied on lips, lids or nails. Givaudan Active Beauty conducted a consumer study in France with regular makeup users aged 18 to 50, and found that 88% of respondents considered New Purple 2364 as a trendy shade. Moreover, 84% of them felt that the colour went well with their skin tone. [2] Givaudan also designed the new pigment to meet the current craze for multifunctional ingredients.

"Takasago unveils a range of pure, intense materials","Last June, Takasago opened its doors to the press to reveal a range of new products: the series of captive molecules – for its exclusive use – and specialties – designed for the market – was focused on three main principles: green tech, the beauty of purity, and the olfactory signature (long wear, diffusion). To perfumer Aurélien Guichard, ""Green chemistry and ingredient purity have been two major pillars for Takasago since the 1970s. But sometimes, this purity is counterbalanced by a lack of power. By offering materials with more impact, the new palette sharpens perfumers' creativity."" Takasago's care for the environment includes synthesizing ingredients both derived from natural resources (biobased) and biodegradable. Pine trees and upcycled materials, which can be obtained by distilling orange, for example, like limonene, make it possible to create biobased molecules with at least 50% of renewable carbon. These include biomuguet, an intense floral and ozonic note which results in a thrush scent that does not fall under IFRA's restrictions on lyral and lilial. Other ingredients are derived from white biotechnologies based on the ancestral Japanese expertise in fermentation. Sugar cane is transformed into aromatic molecules thanks to enzymes like yeast and bacteria. This highly environmentally friendly, energy-efficient process does not require petroleum derivatives. A result of this technique, biocyclamol offers a long-lasting, rose floral note whose freshness and transparency add a modern touch to thrush. Minimalism and purity Takasago's creativity is also guided by the Shibui aesthetics, i.e. the beauty of purity: a minimalist creative style for simple formulas with fewer ingredients, since they are purer and have more impact. That is where the secret of Takasago's expertise lies: creating pure materials thanks to chiral chemistry. This process, which won a Nobel Prize in 2001, is aimed to replicate a biobased or natural fragrant body in its purest state. This technique offloads the ingredient from its roughness to only keep the most interesting part, olfactory-wise, and the closest to nature. That is how they obtained L-Citronellyl Acetate (84% of natural origin), a complex, faceted, addictive note with fruity, floral, metallic hints. The other innovation concerns the creation of CX ingredients, purified versions of already-known molecules. Originally in the form of crystals, these materials undergo a second crystallization aimed to beautify them. Stripped of their least refined facets, they reveal new olfactory undertones. Ambroxan CX, the purified version of this very popular amber wood, puts an emphasis on mineral and animal tones with an intensity which makes it even more addictive. The third creative principle of this new palette is the creation of concise formulas with ingredients with more impact. Synthesis is no longer about mimicking nature, it is about exceeding limits. Cutting-edge technologies help obtain materials which offer higher performances in terms of long wear and trail, as well as molecules with innovative facets. The latter are a real breath of fresh air for perfumers, who draw creative ideas from them. Pamplefix, a captive molecule whose freshness reveals an astonishing persistence, given the category (green, citrus), perfectly combines with woody notes. In addition, these molecules do not necessarily fall under restrictive regulations, for example if iconic materials are replaced. Sakura Salicylate, a soft floral note, can replace the benzyl salicylates recently limited by IFRA, to create a solar scent. All in all, about fifteen ingredients were created to offer perfumers a new playground. This palette results from a long development process, since it takes at least five years, starting from the discovery of a molecule, to assess it, possibly industrialize it, and register it. Among several thousand proposals, only a few get through all the validation steps. This long, hard work should eventually be completed with the expertise of neurosciences to measure the emotional and holistic impact of the molecules on consumers."

"Aqua Natco, the very first technology for perfumes of natural origin in water","The Aqua Natco technology is introduced as a first technique on a market driven by consumer demand for alternative, alcohol-free perfumes of natural origin with a low environmental impact. Expressions Parfumées aimed to meet this demand and their customers' by developing a new technology adapted to 100% COSMOS compositions. ""When you work with perfumes of natural origin and water, you encounter two major issues. The main one is solubility, since a perfume is mainly composed of lipophilic raw materials. The second is solvation [1], to obtain an even, transparent liquid perfume,"" explains Jennifer Buzzi, Development & Innovation Director. Until recently, the charge in water of a perfume composed of materials of natural origin was limited to low doses from 1 to 3%. Now, the Aqua Natco system allows for a high perfume dose of about 10% – a standard concentration in fine perfumery. By solving solubility and solvation issues, Aqua Natco also makes it possible to work with an unlimited olfactory palette and get perfectly transparent aqueous solutions. Since perfumery raw materials are not always in the liquid form – they can be powders, resins, or crystals – it is necessary to use solvents to get even, transparent perfumes. In addition, some raw materials of natural origin, in particular citrus essential oils, are hardly compatible with the existing solvents of natural origin. ""There are very few solvents in COSMOS-certified perfumery. The most efficient in terms of water solubilization are also the least efficient as regards solvation with these raw materials,"" explains the Manager. The solution developed by Expressions Parfumées consists of a mixture of two solvents, one of which is widely used in cosmetics, but very little in perfumery, together with a new solubilization system. ""There is a real synergy between the two solvents which helps solve solvation and solubilization problems. And everything is COSMOS-certified: perfumes, solubilizing agents, preservatives, and solvents,"" adds Jennifer Buzzi. The product derived from this technology is named AquaBoost Natco. It should be diluted at a concentration of 30% in water. In these 30%, there are 10% of extract and 20% of technology. ""We are the first to have developed a solution to charge up to 10% of perfume of natural origin in water. It is also a turnkey technology. We sell a perfume ready to be diluted in water. Either the customer buys it to make their own dilution and add the preservative themselves, or we offer to do it all,"" adds Jennifer Buzzi. According to the tests carried out by Expressions Parfumées, the Aqua Natco technology offers equal or even better olfactory results than alcohol-based versions. ""We carried out tests on perfumes of different olfactory families and observed very high stability performance. 93% of the intensity was preserved after 4 hours, 85% after 24 hours. In addition, compared to alcohol, the intensity was the same or even better at the application, depending on the perfume references,"" says the Director. As regards turbidity (measurement of cloudiness levels), the Aqua Natco perfumes offer a maximum index of 7 FNUs on a scale from 0 (transparency) to 200 (opacity). Lastly, according to a life cycle assessment carried out by the Evea agency, which took into account 16 environmental indicators from raw material extraction to end-of-life, the Aqua Natco technology offers a 6% reduced impact, compared to alcohol-based eaux de toilette."
Clariant launches online tool to calculate percentage formulation naturality,"Powered by standardized data on the Renewable Carbon/Natural Origin indices of over 800 Clariant and non-Clariant ingredients for personal care applications the new tool offers formulators and brands the chance to calculate the percentage natural content of a large array of formulations. In addition, the tool is designed to showcase the individual impact of specific ingredient choices on formulation naturality. ""BeautyForward is always about understanding and addressing needs in personal care. There is evident increasing consumer preference for natural, specifically plant-based ingredients, as well as a growing expectation for brands to understand and communicate on naturality with transparency. Our calculator equips them to do this, by providing the necessary personal care ingredient data in an intuitive, digital format. We're proud to support the creation of more sustainable personal care products,"" said Hermann Bach, Global Head of Strategic Marketing and Innovation at Clariant. As the industry's focus on developing lower impact beauty grows, Clariant steps up to standardize, quantify and share the naturality of personal care ingredients - including that of over 300 ingredients stemming from their own portfolio. The new tool calculates personal care formulation naturality according to the ISO 16128 [1] methodology and offers two options to aid research. First up, users can create their own new natural formulation from scratch, adding constituent ingredients in their respective quantities by INCI or trade name. Based on this, the individual ingredient's naturality is provided, following the Renewable Carbon Index (RCI) for carbon-based ingredients, and the Natural Origin Index (NOI) if non-carbon-based. The tool continues by calculating the total formulation naturality based on each ingredient's contribution. Alternatively, the users may opt for a more guided approach; the BeautyForward calculation tool comes equipped with a series of exemplary and customizable skin and hair care formulations, with up to 99% naturality. Users can copy the formulations and edit them, playing around with ingredient selection by adding and removing products to find the ideal fit for their needs and percentage natural content targets. Formulations can be saved within each user's personal accounts for access and reference at a later date. To support with ingredient research, the tool also makes it possible for users to access more detailed ingredient information, as well as to request samples. The BeautyForward 6 tool is accessible on ClariHub personal care, Clariant's free and customer-exclusive platform. Register is required to use all functionalities."
Oysters reveal their benefits and enter into cosmetic formulations,"Oyster-based cosmetics? The idea may seem far-fetched, even if the cosmetics industry already use a bunch of unusual ingredients. Indeed, much like broccoli or onions, oysters offer many interesting benefits for the skin. Brands interested in oysters use absolutely every part of it, from the flesh to the shell, claiming varied and diverse benefits, including anti-aging, purifying, remineralizing and cleansing for skin, hair and even dental health. Natural cosmetics brand Perlucine (created by the Aquatonale Group) is one of the brands that has been embracing the virtues of the oyster, more precisely the shell of the white oyster. Harvested by hand on the beaches of Brittany, France, oyster shells are carefully cleaned before being made into powder to enrich the formulas of different products, from facial cleansing powder to body scrubs, artisanal soaps, shampoo powder and even powdered toothpaste. The range is Ecocert Cosmos certified. Meanwhile French brand Edulis has recently released a range of cosmetics formulated with the extracts of patented oyster oils encapsulated in clay, in order to take advantage of the mollusk's unique properties all day long. Created at Cap Ferret, this innovative line is more interested in the properties of the European flat oyster from the Arcachon Basin, called Ostrea Edulis. ""We have extracted natural active elements that are nourishing and stimulating, for a firmer, fresher feel and an immediate tightening effect that's safe for skin,"" explains the brand. Currently Edulis has three products on offer — a serum, a day cream and a night cream — combining all the benefits of oyster extracts with those of ulva lactuca seaweed from Brittany, desert date palm oil, kokum butter and frankincense resin, all natural ingredients. Not content with only attracting attention in the cosmetics industry, oysters can also be transformed into a number of materials in order to reduce waste — and to also take advantage of its numerous benefits. Through upcycling, they can be transformed into natural fertilizer and even descaling material for household appliances. The calcium carbonate from the shells can also be used as a basis for creating alternative sustainable materials."
Gattefossé to build its first North American production site in Texas,"A specialist in lipid chemistry and plant extraction for the personal care and pharmaceutical industries, Gattefossé has settled its presence in North America in 1987. At that time, it was the Group's first affiliate created overseas. To better address the needs of its customers, the French group opened a Technical Center of Excellence in 2017 in Paramus, New Jersey. The works of Gattefossé's very first North American manufacturing facility in Lufkin, Texas, will be officially launched on Wednesday June 8th, 2022, during a ceremony with Gattefossé teams and officials of the city. This new asset will manufacture lipid-based specialty ingredients for the personal care and pharmaceutical industries and will enable to grow the global production capacity of the Group. Dubbed Gattex, the plant is expected to be up and running in 2024. ""Building a new production site in North America will enable the Group to respond to several strategic challenges. First, increasing our global production capacity and offering a back-up on three continents. Second, managing our ecological impacts thanks to reduced lead time in deliveries and to the eco design of the facility. This major investment of 50+ million dollars is the most important project that the Group ever led in its history. This move is in line with our evolution from a medium sized company to a global industrial group established in its major markets,"" explains Eduardo De Purgly, Gattefossé Group CEO. The Gattex project is in line with the CSR roadmap of the Group, known as Gatt'Up & Act. The production site will primarily service regional customers, thus limiting negative environmental impacts linked to intercontinental transportation. The plant will be LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified, a widely used green building rating system. ""The presence of Gattefossé in North America started with the creation of Gattefossé USA in 1982. Since then, the organization has strongly grown. A significant milestone was the opening of the Technical Center of Excellence in 2017 in Paramus, New Jersey. The building of a brand-new manufacturing unit in Lufkin, Texas, is a milestone in line with our strategy to better penetrate North America, leading market for the pharmaceuticals and personal care industries. It will improve customer intimacy while contributing to the local economy thanks to the creation of new jobs. Moreover, it will satisfy our customers' demand for the 'Made in the USA' label,"" says Éric Brun, President and CEO of Gattefossé USA and Canada. In addition to the main production site located in Lyon, France, Gattefossé currently operates two production lines in Singapore and Spain. Three Technical Centers of Excellence have also been created in India, China and the United States – in addition to the main lab in France - to offer an essential interface with both pharmaceutical and personal care customers worldwide, by providing formulation troubleshooting, inspiration and technical support."
Cosmetic textures: how IMCD plays with appearances,"Solid textures in all forms, waxes, powders, oily or aqueous emulsions… as naturalness and the search for more sustainable solutions became central to product development, cosmetic galenics gained much importance on the market. Indeed, if consumers look for natural and sustainable products, they are hardly willing to compromise on sensoriality, efficacy, and ease-of-use, which they got used to with modern cosmetics. ""The natural origin index defined by standard ISO 16128 is one of our customers' main criteria today. The percentage of ingredients of natural origin in a product has become a reference in cosmetics formulation"", confirms Anne-Sophie Gardes, EMEA Regional Technical Director Beauty & Personal Care at IMCD. To play this game, cosmetic formulation laboratories have to prove extremely creative in combining ingredients that offer both high levels of naturalness and the efficacy and pleasure of use expected. And there is a segment where you can definitely not make any compromise: sun protection! ""When it comes to formulation, it is one of the trickiest categories today. You need to offer high protection levels, while meeting legitimate expectations as regards environmental protection and naturalness,"" the scientist adds. Choices need to be made between the various filters available, depending on the protection spectrum wanted, the potential environmental impact, in particular on corals and marine organisms, local regulations, and brands' ""black lists"". A sponsor of the Sensory Bar at the last in-cosmetics Global show in Paris, IMCD Beauty & Personal Care had chosen to put forward this creative challenge with two sun care formulas boasting both innovative and astonishing textures: Extra Fluid Sunscreen, a waterless fluid sunscreen, and Hydra Sun Pearls, solid pearls containing 33% of water to spread on the skin. ""We wanted to show that there can be a real gap between the look of formulas and their actual compositions. The former is milky, so it evokes an aqueous emulsion, and yet it is waterless. The latter is composed of small beads, so we expect an anhydrous formula with a lot of wax, but it actually contains water,"" explains Anne-Sophie Gardes. For Extra Fluid Sunscreen, a body and face sunscreen with a 93.34% natural origin index, IMCD used the NIKKOL Nikkomulese WO-NS emulsifier, an optimized mixture of two emulsifying molecules and a structuring agent to obtain particle dispersion, while boosting the SPF. The silky texture was worked with emollients and a mattifying powder (GRANPOWDER BBP-700) to reduce the oily effect of oils. Beeswax and a gelling rheology modifier (MIGLYOL GEL) also help maintain the zinc oxide (UV Cut ZnO-65-CC) in suspension. This mineral filter offers good UVB and UVA protection, so it makes it easier to create short formulas. The SPF value obtained in vitro reaches 51.4 (47.8 in vivo) for a UVA PF of 25.3. ""With this fluid formula, you get a sunscreen that is easy to apply and ideal for both the face and body. Zinc oxide provides excellent protection without leaving white traces, thanks to quality dispersion and to the synergy it creates with a specific association of ingredients."" The Hydra Sun Pearls SPF 25 sun beads were designed to offer a monodose of protective hand care. Each bead melts in the hand to always deliver the same quantity of cream. Despite their solid form, these beads contain 33% of water, which provides them with a light, low-oil sensorial texture far from heavy butter- and wax-based formulas. ""Hand creams are increasingly claimed to offer an SPF. Here, it is a water-in-oil emulsion. The outer phase is oily, which makes the skin feel comfortable. The aqueous phase offers freshness and lightness,"" emphasizes Anne-Sophie Gardes. ""The monodose bead form helps reduce waste by delivering the right dose required for each use."" Here, again, the main emulsifier is NIKKOL Nikkomulese WO-NS. It is completed with rice bran wax to provide structure and a zinc oxide dispersion (UV CUT ZnO-65 CC) to obtain the sun protection needed. The formula is free from chemical filters and titanium dioxide and the natural origin index reaches 99.35%. This is outstanding evidence of the creative possibilities offered by the great variety of cosmetic ingredients now available on the market – even when trying to reach the highest naturalness percentage possible for formulas as sensitive as sunscreens!"
Fragrances: Eurofragance gains momentum in sustainable innovation,"At the in-cosmetics Global trade show in Paris, Eurofragance has introduced three key innovations: a collection of vegan, sustainable and eco- certifiable fragrances dubbed Ecoconscious; Sensolab, a collection of fragrances designed to upgrade the sensorial level of solid and anhydrous formats; a first captive perfumery ingredient dubbed L'Âme du Bois. The Sensolab collection has been designed to meet the sensory requirements of new solid and anhydrous formats while being in line with their environmental-friendly approach. The set of products showcased during the show included: a body lotion stick fragranced with bergamot and cannabis notes; a water-free coffee and white flower scented solid conditioner; and a powder shampoo with hints of apricot and carrot. Other highlights of this collection are: a pocket deodorant in a compact powder format with notes of moringa flower, which absorbs body odours and leaves a silky sensation on skin; a bath confetti soap that brings playfulness to the shower, in a format that diffuses olfactive notes of mandarin. The company also introduced Ecoconscious, a collection of vegan, sustainable fragrances with natural ingredients, formulated with floral-fruity, citrus and woody, fruity- sweet and fruity-aqueous notes, some of them being eco-certifiable. In addition, Eurofragance unveiled various applications created with L'Âme du Bois, the first captive perfumery ingredient launched in October 2021. These new series of applications was an opportunity to show a first olfactory range based on the innovation in the form of fine fragrances, a shampoo and a scented candle. ""Our presence at in-cosmetics illustrates our particular desire to accelerate our growth in personal care. We have a palette of high-quality raw materials and an excellent level of customer service along with valuable market knowledge that make us ready to respond to new consumer demands,"" highlighted Olegario Monegal, Global Business Unit Director of Home and Personal Care."
TechnicoFlor illustrates the potential of upcycling with eight fragrances,"As far as perfumery and cosmetic ingredients are concerned, upcycling is one of the most powerful trends of the moment. The growing interest in these new generation of sustainable materials, led the way to the launch of several ingredients resulting from this ""creative reuse"" at the last edition of the in-cosmetics Global show, which was held in Paris at the beginning of April. In perfumes, this desire to bring new value to previously neglected resources was illustrated by Cosmos's Golden Berry, an ingredient made from the dried calyx of physalis, and by Eurofragance's L'Âme du Bois, a captive fragrant ingredient derived from wood chips. TechnicoFlor perfumers saw in this trend a new olfactory playground and at in-cosmetics Global presented a collection of eight responsible fragrances developed from upcycled raw materials, in compliance with stringent environmental specifications. The challenge was to highlight an upcycled raw material within formulas that would be ""free from skin sensitizing danger"", 100% vegan, with a high percentage of biodegradable ingredients, a controlled environmental impact, and with fair trade materials. Within their palette of upcycled raw materials, TechnicoFlor perfumers selected white wine lees (resulting from the deposit generated during the aging period of wine and champagne in barrels), oak wood (resulting from woodchips of wine barrels upgraded by CO2 extraction), carrot seeds (derived from seeds with low germinative potential), cocoa absolute (derived from cocoa pods), tangerine (extracted from the peel of the fruit), cypress absolute (derived from waste from the wooden furniture industry), or rose essential (derived from the distillation of petals that have already been used to create rose absolute). The selection process led to the creation of eight new, original and responsible fragrances — Raisin Divin, Up To Wood, Bois Tonic, Purple Fiction, Cacao Rosso, Sorbet Corse, Cypress'tige, Rosylicious — thus demonstrating that it is possible to transform ""waste"" into small olfactory treasures! An ingredient can be considered upcycled when it is obtained by recovering by-products from industrial or agricultural transformation processes. Upcycled ingredients can be of natural or synthetic origin. By giving new life to materials that are often intended to be discarded, upcycling helps to decrease the waste of resources and is part of the circular economy movement and the regenerative culture. It also contributes to add unexpected materials to the perfumers' palette. This initiative from the French fragrance house is in line with its strategy of becoming a key expert in natural and responsible perfumery, which includes the creation of 100% natural ranges that comply with COSMOS Organic requirements (NatFlor perfumes), a committed purchasing policy, the sourcing of eco-responsible raw materials (BetterTomorrow®), a tool for measuring the biodegradability of perfumes (BioD-Scent®)."
Rootness Awake: Clariant's new botanical active ingredient for the eye area,"Rootness Awake is the latest from the partnership between Clariant and Plant Advanced Technologies PAT, a French start-up well known for their exclusive technology that allows to cultivate plants in aeroponic and optimized conditions in order to boost the production of large quantities of highly interesting compounds. Rootness Awake is an enriched extract of inflammation-fighting compounds obtained from sustainably-grown Ipomoea batatas (sweet potato) roots. Based on PAT's patented technology, the soil-free cultivated roots were submitted to gentle exudation. The living roots are thus delivering phytochemical profiles in high concentrations. In that case, the target compounds were Dicaffeoylquinate esters (DCQE), a range of molecules that are very difficult to source through other processes and already known for their remarkable antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Rootness Awake offers efficacy in reducing discoloration and ensuring firmness, promoting a revitalized more youthful eye contour. Indeed, the new active ingredient focuses on several physiological aspects: decreasing the release of inflammatory mediators, helping reduce the microvascular network, and ensuring skin thickness, integrity and firmness are strengthened. All of these combine to reduce under-eye pigmentation and edema (fluid build-up). The extract's activity is demonstrated in in vitro, ex vivo and also clinical evaluations. According to Clariant, in tests over 28 days on women aged 18-35 years showing constant signs of fatigue, Rootness Awake is shown to improve and smooth out dark circles, reduce puffiness, and strengthen eye contour stiffness. The overall result is a lightened, more ""awake"" eye contour. The eye contour area is one of the first places where signs of fatigue and aging appear. The skin here is exceptionally thin which means the bluish-red hue of the vascular network is easy to see. Low contents of collagen and elastic fibers also make the area more sensitive to shadowing due to skin laxity and sagging. Inflammation in cells caused by pollution and UV radiation, stress, chronic lack of sleep, and an unhealthy lifestyle is known to exacerbate disruption to this area and the visible effects. ""Dark circles and puffiness accentuate a tired appearance and are common beauty concerns regardless of gender and age,"" comments Julie Droux, Senior Technical Marketing Specialist, Clariant Natural Ingredients. ""Plant Milking Technology has enabled us to use an eco-friendly process to discover active molecules with potent properties in sweet potato roots, and to create an enriched extract with high efficacy in tackling many of the biological pathways responsible for alteration of the eye contour. Rootness Awake gives formulators new, unique opportunities to develop effective targeted care and eye contour products that contribute to progressing sustainability in skincare."" The new active ingredient adds up to Clariant's Premium range, which already includes Prenylium and Rootness Energize, which were launched in 2020."
"Myralys, an eyelid lifter and under-eye rejuvenator by Greentech","Introduced at in-cosmetics in Paris, Greentech's new active ingredient is a COSMOS-certified organic active ingredient, sourced from organic wild yellow gentian roots. Sustainably harvested in France by by gentian-pickers trained in good harvesting practices, Myralys is highly purified in gentiopicroside to lift upper eyelids and reduce dark circles and eye bags of lower eyelids for a time-defying look. ""Our new organic active ingredient Myralys, formulated at 0.5%, has shown remarkable effectiveness in smoothing wrinkles and reducing the appearance of puffiness after 14 days of twice-daily use on volunteers with older-looking eye contours. A lifting effect is clearly observed on slackened upper eyelids (smoother, less wrinkled) and a regenerating effect on the entire lower eye contour,"" explains Sébastien Hameury, Marketing Director at Greentech. Myralys reduces lipid peroxidation, activates the Nrf2 antioxidant defense pathway and stimulates the expression of Glyoxalase-1 (a major detoxifying enzyme), to limit oxidation reactions and carbonyl stress leading to the formation of AGEs. It also limits the formation of AGEs accelerated by UV while promoting collagen synthesis, thus preserving and strengthening the skin's support structures. Myralys limits inflammation and angiogenesis, both of which are promoted by AGEs and carbonyl stress. Another new development announced at in-cosmetics was the repositioning of the Cannabidiol isolate from hemp grown sustainably in South America and processed locally, obtained by supercritical CO2 extraction. This high quality active ingredient, titrated to a minimum of 98% CBD, has a very strong anti-inflammatory power. It also has a very marked action on sebo-regulation, for anti-imperfections/acne and radiance-boosting actions.

"Seppic presents Cosmetic Mixology, a duo of robust and sensorial formulas","Premium Beauty News - How did you get the idea to work on the theme of home cosmetics? Lorraine Denois - Our role as a supplier of cosmetic ingredients is to help our customers decipher current trends and propose formulation concepts and ingredients that meet current and future market demands. During the pandemic, we observed a renewed interest in the homemade trend, especially in cosmetics with a wellness dimension. Blend It Yourself, or BIY, consists in letting the consumer mix ingredients provided by brands with precise instructions, tips and precautions for use, to create a product that perfectly reflects their own needs. That's the ideal solution for those who want to personalize their beauty care but lack the time or knowledge to make their own beauty recipes. It's seductive also by its image both ecological and ""transparent"": the BlY has become a mode of consumption. Premium Beauty News - How does Seppic help its customers to respond to the Blend it yourself trend? Lorraine Denois - In response, Seppic launched, during in-cosmetics Global in early April 2022, a duo of formulas called COSMETIC MIXOLOGY. The marketing and innovation teams have pooled their expertise to come up with a ""Blend it yourself"" concept that is safe and fun for consumers. With these two bases, Seppic offers a simplified and safer customization solution for consumers who are not always aware about the risks and constraints of home-made cosmetic formulation. These two formula bases can be customized with active ingredients that are easy to find at home to meet various applications (face care, hair care, body care). To ensure the robustness of the final formulas, the two chassis were tested with ten home-made active ingredients with different profiles (viscosity, pH, presence of electrolytes, solubility). Among them: lemon juice for a radiance face mask, coffee grounds for a body scrub and pomegranate vinegar for an all-in-one hair care. In addition to responding to a current market trend, our two formulas have been designed taking into account the need of consumers for minimalist formulas and their requirements for high naturalness and safety for human health. Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us more about these two bases? Lorraine Denois - COSMETIC MIXOLOGY includes two formulas with different sensory characteristics: – A creamy base to customize: a strong emulsion base combining softness and creaminess. Emulsion stability and robustness are provided by an emulsifier MONTANOV™ 202 and two polymers, SOLAGUM™AX & SEPIMAX ZEN™, to enhance the formula's resistance to electrolyte-rich actives. This minimalist formula also contains EMOGREEN™ L15, an emollient for sensory comfort and AQUAXYL™, an essential sugar-based moisturizing agent. – A gel-cream base to customize: a solid pebble to rehydrate forming a fresh gel with a light touch. The SOLAGUM™TARA & SEPIMAX ZEN™ polymer pairing forms a fresh, watery gel-cream and strengthens the formula's resistance to electrolyte-rich actives. Three additional ingredients have been added: EMOGREEN™ L19, an emollient for sensory comfort, SEPIFINE™ BB, a texturizing agent to provide softness and AQUAXYL™, an essential sugar-based moisturizing agent. These two formulas allow our customers to offer the final consumer two different experiences in terms of sensoriality and customization. Premium Beauty News - Do you think this trend will continue in the coming years? Lorraine Denois - This trend toward active consumer participation is becoming increasingly digital. Some companies rely on personalized online questionnaires to develop formulas and beauty programs with the help of artificial intelligence, while others allow the individual to take control of the mixing process. Applications, connected machines, mini cosmetic formulation laboratories, are multiplying, allowing to customize cosmetic care according to one's desires or needs. This customization goes as far as the packaging. Consumers can express their own personality and create their own designs on the packaging. It is likely that this type of service will continue to develop with the evolution of increasingly intuitive and complete internet interfaces that will seduce consumers looking for personalization and unique solutions. Home blending, cosmetic devices, digital beauty analysis, packaging customization ... are clearly an important part of the future of personalized beauty, focused on inclusiveness, precision and sustainability."
Codif creates a bio-inspired active from marine algae collected in Normandy,"This alga is able to protect itself by building a calcite armour (called coccolith) through the absorption of huge quantities of atmospheric carbon. This is why it is commonly referred to as ""a green lung for the planet"". Each year, ocean plankton absorbs 2 billion tonnes of CO2. This ultra-resistant micro-alga has the particularity of having 15% of its genome dedicated to resistance to stress, and is therefore of high interest for the skin. Inspired and extracted from Emiliania huxleyi, Codif's Idaskin concentrates the properties of 50,000 algal cells in a single drop. According to Codif TN, this active ingredient boosts the skin's resilience to the stress caused by environmental factors (exposome) and improves cell vitality, for a fresh and revitalized complexion. This water soluble ingredient is to be used at 1% in anti-pollution mists and daily creams. Actually, samples of Emiliania huxleyi were collected near Étretat cliffs, in Normandy, France. The samples were then grown in France, in bioreactors using the Bioth-Ecology technology from Codif TN. Idaskin is available two versions: – Idaskin PDO- CH, which is China compliant (INCI: Sea water (and) Propanediol (and) Arginine (and) Lysine) – Idaskin PDO, which is not China compliant (INCI: Sea water (and) Propanediol (and) Emiliania huxleyi extract) Both versions are COSMOS approved.

Sustainable personal care ingredients take centre stage at in-cosmetics Global,"Innovation was at the top of the agenda throughout the three-day event held on April 05-07 in Paris, where natural and sustainable cosmetic and personal care had hardly any rivals. The trends associated with holistic beauty were also a key feature of the event. Among the exhibitors announcing their latest launches, Gattefossé, for instance, revealed its new plant-derived active ingredient, Solastemis. Designed to offer brands, particularly dermo-cosmetics, a powerful active ingredient to protect the skin against UV rays, it responds to the growing needs of consumers concerned about the health of their skin. Meanwhile, Symrise debuted its latest innovation in modern product protection in the form of its Hydrolite 8 green - the first high quality 100% bio-based, neat caprylyl glycol launched in the cosmetics market. Elsewhere on the show floor, Clariant Natural Ingredients introduced Prunizen - a new natural, 'feel good' active that helps to fight stress-induced hair loss, improve hair vitality and density, and restore hair and scalp wellbeing. While Vantage Personal Care introduced a brand-new formulation platform focused on providing formulators with a broad combination of highly traceable, sustainable, and deeply impactful ingredients – highly relevant for conscious consumers. Dow also unveiled five new technologies alongside its ECOllaboration Concepts Collection to address growing consumer demand for sustainable and inclusive solutions. Of the new product announcements, four covered skin and hair applications. The group also showcased a series of six new products including MaizeCare Clarity Polymer – a unique corn-based ingredient that enables the formulation of crystal-clear hair styling formulations; Dowsil 979 Emulsion for use in conditioners, leave-in and shampoo formats; and EcoSmooth Rice Husk Cometic Powder, an upcycled white silica powder designed to be added in a wide range of common skin care, colour cosmetics, and hair care formulation types. With an overarching focus on sustainability, this year's in-cosmetics Global demonstrated the steps being taken by the beauty and personal care industry to reduce its environmental impact through ingredient choices and formulation methods. The event's Sustainability Corner, sponsored by AAK, returned to offer attendees a snapshot of the latest advancements and accomplishments in sustainable personal care. Visiting the Sustainability Corner at in-cosmetics Global, Hélène Villecroze, Eco Design Manager, Chanel Parfums Beauté, said: ""As environmental concerns increase, it's better for consumers to have another perspective on sustainability and a point of view for ingredients. The Sustainability Corner offers a summary of the best products that exhibitors are presenting, giving examples, and proposing more sustainable ideas."" Fellow attendee, Agatha Bernedot, Product Development Manager, Fresh added: ""The Sustainability Corner has made me realise there are some good solutions to sustainability which I plan to use to challenge our formulation development team. This is a tricky area, and it is hard to keep the consumer happy whilst being natural and sustainable."" Other interactive product features pulled in crowds throughout the duration of the three-day event, included the newest raw ingredients to hit the market in the Innovation Zone, sponsored by Ashland; new and invigorating sensations in the Sensory Bar, sponsored by IMCD; and innovative pigments and technologies in the Make-up Bar, sponsored by Lubrizol Life Science. Speaking about the product areas, Florence L'Alloret, Innovation Project Leader, L'Oréal said: ""The interactive features at in-cosmetics Global are a great way to get a global overview of the latest innovations across a wide range of topics. I'm particularly interested in finding ingredients sourced from nature and I've been able to find lots of interest."" Next year, in-cosmetics Global will take place in Barcelona from 28-30 March 2023."
Seqens Cosmetics launches a bio-inspired ingredient to heal inflamed skins,"""We have known since the end of the 1970s [1] that certain animals are able to find substances in their environment that allow them to heal themselves,"" explains Aïna Queiroz, Head of Innovation & Scientific Communication at Seqens Cosmetics. Despite the immense potential of this discovery, it had so far gone unexploited in the cosmetics industry. After the launch of several platforms dedicated to the Exposome, Longevity and Emotional Glyco-intelligence, Seqens Cosmetics is highlighting biomimicry as a way to discover new active molecules through its new Etho-Phytology innovation platform. It is therefore by studying models and strategies that have been proven in nature for millions of years that Seqens found the avenue that led to the creation of Phyt'Anim Grains of Paradise. In this case, the source of inspiration of the cosmetic ingredients manufacturer were some particularly fascinating doctors: gorillas of Africa's western lowland! Thanks to a database of plants used by animals to treat themselves, Seqens Cosmetics has indeed identified the consumption by gorillas of seeds of the paradise plant (Aframomum melegueta) [2] as a means to protect themselves from myocardium inflammatory disorders. ""This plant protects the myocardium of the gorilla by fighting against certain inflammatory disorders (via the COX-2 pathway) that cause fibrosing cardiomyopathy (Dybas and Raskin, 2007). Research has shown that for the captive primates, lack of access to grains of paradise led to a sharp increase in this pathology (Ilic et al., 2014),"" said Seqens Cosmetics. Aware of the importance of this same COX-2 pathway at the level of skin inflammation, Seqens Cosmetics thus studied the effects of this seed on a new skin model to extract the most effective anti-inflammatory fraction, enriched with 6-gingerol. The active ingredient developed makes it possible to relieve irritated skin and accelerate the resolution of chronic inflammation, whether on an in vitro, ex vivo or clinical scale. ""By readjusting the balance between pro-inflammatory mediators (COX-2, IL-22, FPR2) and anti- inflammatory mediators (IL-10, TGF-β), Phyt'anim Grains of Paradise helps to reduce the visible signs of skin inflammation,"" claims Seqens. The double-blind clinical study, carried out vs placebo on irritated skin, thus highlights a significant effect of the ingredient both on transepidermal water loss (TEWL) after 24 hours, and on redness and vascular intensity after just 5 days. The company also wanted to understand how primates select plants in their environment. Taste receptors are crucial in signalling to the animal the presence of useful molecules. This is particularly true for the gorilla whose diet is essentially herbivorous. Noting the surprising presence of these same taste receptors on the skin, Seqens Cosmetics has therefore evaluated the impact of Phyt'anim Grains of Paradise on this relatively unexplored skin axis. According to the company, the results obtained prove that the active ingredient modulates the expression of a G protein associated with a taste receptor during inflammation. ""These new data open the way to understanding the role of these receptors at the skin level and demonstrate the importance of considering them in dermo-cosmetics,"" concludes Seqens. Other cases of self-medication behavior, in species other than primates, are currently being explored at Seqens in order to give birth to a new generation of bio-inspired cosmetic actives."
BASF's Care Creations® launches the Responsibly Active sustainability program,"""Caring is in our nature and deeply rooted in our DNA. That's why we are committed to protecting the world in which we all live and work. Our vision is to align our actions in a sustainable way – to protect our planet and its resources, and to make an active contribution to all of the people along our bioactive ingredients value chain. To turn this vision into reality, we launched our Responsibly Active program which includes clear commitments and action plans,"" says Lucilene Veira Nunes, Head of Business Management for the active ingredients business of BASF in Europe. Together with the team, she is responsible for setting up the program. For companies and their stakeholders in the beauty and cosmetics industry, sustainability is no longer a ""nice option"". It has become a necessity and therefore a decisive success factor for the survival of our planet and each company's own long-term development. Consumers are increasingly demanding sustainable products and choosing brands and companies based on ethical aspects, including their initiatives towards the environment and climate. Business customers also choose suppliers according to their contributions along the entire value chain. ""With Responsibly Active, we foster and channel our contributions in our respective fields of action to help curb climate change and make our world a better place. We also support current and potential customers in achieving their own sustainability goals,"" explains Veira Nunes. With its special focus on botanical sourcing for BASF's bioactives portfolio, the program is based on three pillars to connect the innovative bioactive solutions with consumer needs while protecting natural resources for generations to come. Preserving natural resources and ecosystems is essential to the company since plants are at the core of BASF's bioactives portfolio and biodiversity is the company's reservoir to innovate. Therefore, BASF's Care Creations® maximizes the use of renewable resources and fosters organic farming practices. Dedicated initiatives respect and protect local biodiversity and avoid land degradation and deforestation within the supply chains. They also aim at making each botanical traceable back to the source, and thus creating trust and freedom of choice for BASF customers. People who are far away from where the raw materials are produced are also taking responsibility to protect natural resources. One example is Philippe. As the Raw Material Sourcing & Extraction Manager at the BASF site in Pulnoy, France, he has been working for years on smart ideas such as upcycling waste from the moringa oil extraction process to obtain highly effective bioactives. He is only one example of many within the company about how employees are contributing to the sustainability of the business. The second pillar stands for BASF taking responsibility for people and the conditions in which they live and work. Everyone should be treated with fairness and respect. Adamantly committed to human rights and proper working conditions, BASF also recognizes and values traditional knowledge and indigenous rights. Promoting diverse and equitable work, BASF actively supports the inclusion of women and small holder farms. Take women like Fadna, who work in the Targanine cooperative, BASF's Moroccan fair-trade partner and sustainable argan oil supplier. Thanks to a literacy program and other benefits, she can lead a life of self-sufficiency for herself and her family. However, making a positive impact is not only limited to the individuals directly involved. Strong partnerships with botanical suppliers are also designed to foster long-term local development and raise communities' livelihoods. The third pillar of Responsibly Active is about impact on climate and the environment. This is where central fields of action have been defined to reduce the environmental and carbon footprint by consuming less water and energy while minimizing waste. Another topic at the core of the program is making packaging more sustainable by reducing it and using recyclable and recycled materials. Making the company's operations climate neutral while reducing the environmental impact involves ongoing teamwork and the understanding that everyone has the power to drive change. A notable example is Farid, an EHS Engineer at BASF, and his team. They came up with a process to valorize botanical wastes, which can be used by farmers as organic fertilizers or to produce more than 18 MWh of green energy for local purposes. To ensure that action really speaks louder than words, concrete targets and key actions have been set up for all three pillars. Ambitious goals, to be achieved in the spirit of fairness, trustworthy partnerships and mindful cooperation help to create efforts that are worth embarking on together in every way. And BASF's Care Creations® is willing to go the extra mile towards greater sustainability – together with customers, employees, suppliers, partners, and everyone involved along the entire bioactives value chain. And this is exactly what is meant by stating ""Together we are Responsibly Active"". Join BASF's journey and learn more about Responsibly Active: www.carecreations.basf.com/responsibly-active"
in-cosmetics Global: naturalness and upcycling as recovery ingredients,"As determined as they are to meet the crucial traceability needs evoked in brands' marketing content, suppliers keep focusing their efforts on the search for natural ingredients. Starting from a fruit species cultivated and harvested by hand on Reunion Island according to zero waste principles, Gattefossé developed the new Solastemis active whose molecules are extracted from chayote, also known as Christophine. Solastemis promotes protection against photoageing by preserving keratinocyte DNA from the damage induced by UVAs. Greentech used yellow gentian roots sustainably handpicked in France to develop the Myralis active, which targets problems on the eye contour area, the upper eyelids, the Valley of Tears, dark circles, and bags. Robertet showcased their range of natural actives for nutricosmetics and cosmetics, including flagship ingredients Lipowheat, a source of phytoceramides, and Keranat, a millet extract which prevents hair loss. It was also an opportunity for the Grasse-based company to highlight the ActiScent range, playing on the duality of olfaction and the physiological properties of the perfumer's natural raw materials. These active perfumes can offer firming benefits, like ActiScent Aqua Criste, or fortifying virtues, like ActiScent Lovely Flower. Beyond naturalness, upcyling seems more and more desirable as a proven means to prevent resource and energy waste. Cosmo Fragrance developed the Golden Berry natural ingredient based on dried chalice of physalis, a fruit sourced from an ethical Columbian farm. ""It is a really common fruit consumed in South America. Its envelope had not yet been exploited. Consumers definitely need authentic rhetoric. Today, they do want natural products, but they want them to come from traceable chains with well-identified producers,"" explains Alexandrine Demachy, General Manager France. Extracted with supercritical CO2, this ingredient offers anti-ageing cosmetic properties as well as floral, fruity notes for perfumes. Eurofragrance drew inspiration from wood to develop its first captive. The Barcelona-based composition company showcased L'Âme du Bois, which is obtained from chips from a particular essence. L'Âme du Bois is meant to create premium perfumes of all categories: fine perfumery, home care, and personal care. ""It is a multifaceted innovative ingredient, it seems to act as a bond between all kinds of woods,"" says senior perfumer Angéline Leporini-Poubeau. As for Lucas Meyer IFF, they upgraded perfumery by-products to create the Wastar collection using the residues obtained from the extraction of the natural olfactory compounds of the LMR Naturals by IFF range. At the show, they introduced pink peppers, with Wastar Pink Berry, which soothes scalp irritation, helps reduce redness, and calms itchiness, but also lavender, with Wastar Lavender, which protects the skin from indoor pollution by strengthening the skin barrier function, reducing inflammation, and enhancing the skin's brightness for a radiant, healthy appearance. Mibelle also produced a new active derived from upcycling: SLVR'Coffee, a coffee silver skin extract, is a by-product derived from coffee bean roasting which hydrates and comforts dry skins. Directly inspired from the holistic beauty trend, the skin's brightness and ability to reflect joy of life and health constitute a recurring theme of the search for cosmetic ingredients. Solabia associated two new natural actives in relation to this issue. Sealight beautifies radiance with an eye contour action on dark circles, bags, wrinkles, and crow's feet. This new, organic-certified ingredient is rich in sulphate arabinogalactans exclusively contained in the Codium fragile algae and sustainably harvested on the Portuguese coast. It reactivates microcirculation to offer cells optimum nutrition and enhances elasticity for a global anti-ageing action and a brighter gaze. Derived from kale, a detox superfood cultivated in an organic cooperative in Brittany, the Neoglow plant-derived active offers gentle organic exfoliation suitable for dry and sensitive skins. Combined with a generous quantity of isothiocyanates, this exfoliating effect boosts the cell metabolism needed for skin detoxification and epidermal renewal. Neoglow provides a global revitalizing effect. Also banking on the ability of living organisms to repair themselves, Silab launches the Regenixir anti-ageing natural active of biotechnological origin. Due to its global action, Regenixir promotes the regeneration of mature skins. Solid, powder, leave-on cosmetics, substitution with floral waters… all these approaches are in line with the major current expectations related to water preservation. Solabia put this issue forward with the Waterless box which offers various face, body, and hair care solutions formulated accordingly, using only two teaspoons of water for all eight products showcased. A renowned specialist in the natural perfume segment, Expressions Parfumées showcased their NatCo perfume range designed for the organic market. The Touch Natco technological innovation now makes it possible to offer a solid version of these natural perfumes. In addition, the AquaBoost NatCo technology developed three years ago to substitute alcohol with water in perfumes is now available for natural perfumes, known for being more difficult to solubilize. This patented technique consists in diluting a concentrated natural perfume at a concentration of 30% in water for a final dose of 10% in the perfume. With this aqueous base, the final Cosmos-certified result offers an olfactory intensity estimated at 93% after 4 hours and 85% after 24 hours.

Givaudan grows vetiver in the sand for olfactory and eco-friendly benefits,"Since 2018, Givaudan has been relying on the expertise of agronomists to reduce the ecological impact of its materials and fragrances. Upstream extraction techniques, plant cultivation methods are, indeed, essential means for the preservation of natural resources. The fragrance house is therefore considering the creation of alternative supply chains, thanks to regenerative and planet-friendly practices, in the image of its rosemary, patchouli and vetiver crops. Vetiver, an age-old root, native to India, has crossed many borders, with 60% of production now coming from Haiti. Givaudan participated in vetiver cultivation program in India through an innovation partnership with Synthite. A new material, ethically sourced, by working alongside local partners and producers directly in the country of origin. As most of arable land in India is used primarily for food crops, Givaudan has chosen unused arid lands to grow its vetiver. A strip of sand in south-eastern India, opposite Sri Lanka, was selected. Although it is the same variety of vetiver as the one grown in Haiti, the new ingredient obtained presents other olfactory facets; a characteristic linked to the soil, to specific cultivation practices, but also to a shortened distillation process. Where Haitian vetiver is very ""nutty"" and oily, Vetiver des Sables is more mineral. With its intense and soaring properties, this essential oil also features hints of ambergris and cypriol. It blends well with ambery woods that are very much in vogue at the moment. Sand vetiver and Haitian vetiver thus complement each other perfectly and find a place of their own in the perfumer's palette. With this new natural material, Givaudan demonstrates the worth of agronomy in preserving fragrance crops for the future. Taking an interest in soils offers a unique opportunity for achieving a triple purpose: olfactory, environmental and societal."
Expanscience: a prebiotic active from kapok tree to boost sexual well-being,"Officially launched during the latest edition of the in-cosmetics Global show, Calybiota Bio [1] is a natural extract rich in polysaccharides, obtained from the calyx of red kapok tree (Bombax costatum) flowers, sustainably sourced in Burkina Faso, West Africa. Calybiota Bio is particularly recommended for the intimate area hygiene and care. A clinical study has demonstrated its protective role on the vaginal flora, revealing a prebiotic effect on this flora's lactobacilli, together with a reduction in inflammation and in discomfort sensations. It helps soothing and moisturizing the intimate area and improves women's sexual life. The new ingredient is also recommended for acne-prone skin, skin prone atopy/eczema or hypersensitivity, as well as for deodorant formulas. Calyxes - the part located at the base of the flower - of the red kapok tree are traditionally used in African dishes to bind sauces. Flowers are collected in the classified forest and biosphere reserve of the ""Mare aux Hippopotames de Balla"" in the Satiri district, which is part of the UNESCO's ""Man & the Biosphere"" program. Local communities have been trained in good harvesting practices and a field study has been performed in order to assess the environmental and social impact of the supply chain. Laboratoires Expanscience also participated in the construction of the cooperative's headquarters (warehouse, office, and meeting room) in the Balla village. From an environmental point of view, enhancing the local value of the red kapok tree is of high interest. Indeed, the red kapok tree is an oxalogen tree, meaning that it has the ""oxalate-carbonate pathway"" in its metabolism allowing it to form calcium carbonate in the soil, ""one of the most sustainable forms of carbon sink,"" highlights Expanscience.

Transparency: One of the main COVID-19 legacy when it comes to beauty,"Consumers want to be reassured about the composition of products, especially those they ingest and apply on their skins almost on a daily basis. Naturally, they have grown increasingly mindful of the composition of the products they buy and curious about how they are produced: a trend that the pandemic has only reinforced. ""These days, consumers are buying with a conscience and brands need to be transparent about their ethical impacts, displaying them in clear and tangible ways,"" said Mintel following a trends analysis undertaken for the in-cosmetics Global show, which was held in Paris last week. According to Mintel, in order to be ahead of the game, companies must ensure they are transparent in communicating measurable metrics about their ethics and sustainability credentials. While sustainability claims in beauty products have become mainstream and still remain at the top of the agenda, customers are also looking at brands' commitments to diversity and equality, as well as ethical supply chain practices. As a result, brands and manufacturers have to be more cautious as regards sourcing: at the forefront, producers and raw material suppliers are expected to get involved. Indeed, for the sake of traceability, supply chains need to comply with brands' new constraints, while innovating.

Seppic offers DIY solutions and a sustainable alternative to heavy silicones,"On the occasion of the in-cosmetic trade show, Seppic presented a new alternative to synthetic silicones as well as a concept suiting the growing trend of home-made products. The Emogreen HP40 ingredient is the first natural alternative to heavy silicones. 100% vegetable and biodegradable, its properties will find applications in haircare, skincare, make-up and suncare products, with the same sensory profile and performance as silicones commonly used in formulas (Polybutene, Dimethicone/Dimethiconol, Cyclopentasiloxane/Dimethiconol, synthetic film-formers...). Particularly suitable for hair applications, it preserves keratin integrity despite thermal stress and protects the hair. In addition, in response to the growing popularity of ""home-made"" cosmetics, Seppic has come up with a ""Blend it Yourself"" concept based on a duo of minimalist ""chassis"" formulas to customise at home. These two Cosmetic Mixology formulas, developed using Seppic ingredients, have different sensory characteristics: a cream emulsion and a solid pebble to rehydrate. The stability and robustness of the emulsion base is provided by the emulsifier Montanov 202 and two polymers, Solagum AX and Sepimax Zen to enhance the formula's resistance to electrolyte-rich actives. This minimalist formula also contains the emollient Emogreen L15 and Aquaxyl, an essential sugar-based moisturiser. The solid pebble to rehydrate forms a fresh, light-touch gel cream composed of a pair of polymers Solagum Tara & Sepimax Zen. Three other ingredients were added, Emogreen L19, for sensory comfort, Sepifine BB, a texturizer and Aquaxyl. These two bases were tested with ten active ingredients that can be found at home with different profiles in terms of viscosity, pH, presence of electrolytes, solubility. These include lemon juice for a radiance face mask, coffee grounds for a body scrub and pomegranate vinegar for an all-in-one hair care."
Global Bioenergies starts commercial production of its renewable isododecane,"The first batches of biosourced isobutene have been manufactured at this unit in March 2022. This new and fully French production chain, using raw materials sourced locally, was established thanks to developments in the manufacturing process, which now relies on subcontractors both upstream (industrial fermentation) and downstream (green chemistry). All of that fully on schedule according to Global Bioenergies. The commercial launch of the first renewable isododécane will take place under the ""Isonaturane 12"" brand at in-cosmetics in Paris from 5 to 7 April, 2022. ""The in-cosmetics show is a great place to showcase innovations and the ideal venue to launch a new ingredient on the market. It will represent a new milestone for Global Bioenergies: Isonaturane 12 has cleared all the regulatory hurdles. It has been validated at market scale with our LAST make-up brand, the first in the world to combine longwear, waterproof and no transfer properties with natural origin. Our aim is now to distribute this innovative ingredient to players in the field, in order to help them convert their make-up ranges to naturalness without any compromise on performance. The start-up of the new unit will enable us to respond to sampling requests from numerous prospects, and complete referencing procedures prior to the commercial delivery of material in the second half of 2022,"" said Daphne Galvez, Global Bioenergies Head of Sales. According to Global Bioenergies, the success of the unit's start-up without any major difficulties means that the scale-up schedule can be accelerated: the Company now expects to reach full capacity by the end of 2022, rather than over 18 months as initially projected. That will take the unit's isobutene annual production capacity to 100 tonnes. The isobutene will then be converted into isododecane for the make-up ingredients market. The scale-up to 1,000 tonnes, planned for late 2024 or early 2025, is starting to look like a realistic prospect. The aim will be to target the broader dermo-cosmetics and hair care markets. Beyond personal care products, Global Bioenergies continues to target the much larger aviation biofuels market by 2026 or 2027. Using the ingredient in this sector will bring a significant environmental impact (CO2 reductions), while at the same time helping reduce Europe's energy dependency. ""The fight against global warming and the quest to achieve Europe's strategic challenges have become central concerns across the board, and remind us of the relevance of the Company's strategy and investments since its creation in 2008. Our target markets, cosmetic ingredients in the short term and aviation biofuels in the medium term, are booming: the number of potential customers is increasing rapidly, as are the potential competitors for our Company. We can now state that our process, patiently developed over more than 10 years, is unique and offers specific and decisive advantages that will enable us to compete in the cosmetic ingredients market. In the aviation biofuels market, it will be necessary to improve performance further, but we believe that to be achievable within 12 to 24 months. We will then boast the best fermentation process in the world to decarbonise air transport,"" concluded Marc Delcourt, Chief Executive Officer of Global Bioenergies."
Ethical sourcing is becoming the norm for natural ingredients in cosmetics,"A wide range of natural ingredients are now used in cosmetic and personal care products. Vegetable oils, fats, and butters are highly established, however many functional ingredients like surfactants, emollients, and thickeners are now made from natural raw materials. The trend is for operators to ethically source raw materials of natural origin. Palm kernel oil is the most widely used vegetable oil in the cosmetics industry. About 20 percent of palm oil is now produced according to RSPO or related sustainability schemes. Large cosmetic firms, including Unilever and L'Oréal, have committed to source only sustainable palm oil. Over 20 operators have joined the Action for Sustainable Derivatives, an industry-led collaboration that encourages responsible production and sourcing of palm oil derivatives. The number of sustainability charters and certification schemes for vegetable oils is increasing. The Sustainable Coconut & Coconut Oil Roundtable introduced its first charter in 2020. A similar scheme for sustainable castor been oil has been in place since 2016. Croda recently adopted the ISCC Plus certification to show transparency and traceability in its vegetable oil supply chains. Organic ingredients are also gaining popularity. The move is partly driven by the success of the leading certification schemes COSMOS and Natrue. Almost 40,000 cosmetic products are now certified according to these standards. Initially launched in Europe, the certification schemes have expanded to the Asia-Pacific and the Americas. Fair trade standards are being adopted by suppliers of agricultural-based raw materials. Coconut oil, olive oil, shea butter, cocoa, tea tree and essential oils are some of the certified ingredients making their way into cosmetic & personal care products. Cosmetic companies are brandishing the Fairtrade mark on products containing such ingredients. Some certification schemes are crossing over from the food industry. The Vegan Society trademark, initially launched in 1990 for vegan food products, now has over 24,000 certified cosmetic products. The Body Shop is one of its largest backers, declaring all its products will be certified by the end of 2023. In the USA, the Non-GMO Project Verified certification scheme is the fastest growing. Also initially introduced for food products, the scheme has been adopted by almost 70 cosmetic & personal care brands. In Asia, the Halal label is becoming increasingly evident. It is most popular in Indonesia where the government introduced mandatory halal labelling for cosmetics last year. Ecovia Intelligence expects the number of sustainability schemes and standards to continue to grow. The increasing use of natural raw materials puts pressure on cosmetic & ingredient firms to ethically source and take the certification route. Some operators will opt for organic, fair trade, or sustainability schemes like RSPO to prove they meet high environmental / social standards. Others will focus on traceability to show their raw materials are deforestation-free, GM-free, vegan, and / or halal. Whichever direction they take, ethical sourcing is becoming a permanent fixture in the cosmetics industry. Ecovia Intelligence will give a seminar on ethical sourcing at in-cosmetics Global (5-7th April, Paris) and 11-22 April (virtual). Register here."
Givaudan adds Patchoul'Up to their collection of upcycled active ingredients,"The Supplier of active ingredients for the beauty industry is introducing a 100% upcycled extract that is able to rebalance sebum production, eliminate dry flakes and normalise the scalp microbiome. The new ingredient was designed to support demand for solutions that preserve precious natural resources while delivering efficient benefits. Dubbed Patchoul'Up, the new eco-designed ingredient is crafted through green fractionation from distilled patchouli leaves - responsibly sourced in Indonesia - after their use as a raw material in fragrance creation. Since 2013, Givaudan has been working closely with local producers on the Island of Sulawesi (Indonesia) to develop a sustainable smallholder patchouli business. Hundreds of producers and local suppliers are involved in the production of patchouli oil for perfumery, and now for scalp-care ingredients. ""The Givaudan Foundation is working hand in hand alongside this initiative to combat illiteracy and nurture a love of reading among local children by establishing school libraries,"" explained the company in a statement. With Patchoul'Up, Givaudan Active Beauty aims to meet the growing demand for result-oriented functional hair-related products, including hair and scalp treatments. The new ingredient addresses the ""skinification"" trend, reflecting consumer demand for products powered by an active ingredient able to treat hair and scalp issues just as they do for skin. According to the company, 85% of consumers have previously experienced dry flakes, with 40% mentioning dandruff and dry flakes as their main scalp issue. ""It's interesting to note that consumers are increasingly educated on this topic, with 44% of those who have experienced dry flakes believing the cause to be an unhealthy scalp microbiome,"" Givaudan added. Givaudan claims Patchoul'Up offers a solution by acting at 6 synergistic levels to: – rebalance sebum production by 39%, – smoothly reduce scalp dry flakes by 31%, – normalise scalp microbiota, – regulate stratum corneum desquamation, – improve scalp condition in 100% of volunteers, – provide well-being benefits. ""We continually push the boundaries to offer new sustainable and responsibly sourced ingredients to the cosmetic industry, a 'must-have' to satisfy today's customer and consumer demands. For us, upcycling is not just a trend but a true path to success on our journey as a sustainable business. Patchoul'Up now adds to our collection of upcycled ingredients first introduced in 2018 with the launch of the skincare ingredient Vetivyne, and Koffee'Up Grade in 2020,"" concluded Fabrice Lefevre, Innovation and Marketing Director Active Beauty at Givaudan."
"""We are anticipating more than 7,000 visitors,"" Roziani Zulkifli, in-cosmetics","Premium Beauty News - What are the prospects for this first in-person European event since 2019? Roziani Zulkifli - Indeed, after a long-anticipated wait, in-cosmetics Global is returning to the Paris Expo Porte de Versailles from 5-7 April, offering the industry the chance to reconnect in person. Since the last face-to-face show in 2019, hundreds of R&D professionals from all around the globe have expressed their excitement to finally return to the show floor, ready to reveal the latest innovations and developments in the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industry. With that in mind, we are expecting more than 650 exhibitors at this year's event. With the pandemic still preventing travel restrictions, footfall will inevitably be less than in previous years, however, we still stand in good stead in terms of expected visitors. We are anticipating more than 7,000 visitors to the show, of which 75% are from Europe. Premium Beauty News - What will be the main highlights of the show? Roziani Zulkifli - After what has been a challenging time throughout the pandemic, I am certain that the dominating factor shared amongst all of the exhibitors and visitors attending will be the excitement of reconnecting and reuniting face-to-face at a physical event. Equally, as one of the most popular and vibrant areas of in-cosmetics, another highlight of the show will be the Innovation Zone which is set to showcase the latest raw materials ready to hit the market. The Sustainability Corner is always a show favourite, offering an interactive space for this year's stimulating educational programme to take place, featuring the latest advancements in sustainable personal care. The R&D Tour is also something formulators can look forward to year-on-year, especially with the 2022 edition honing in on topical areas such as natural products, skin protection and personal care, all of which are good for the body and mind. Premium Beauty News - What trends do you anticipate to be showcased on the show floor? Roziani Zulkifli - In terms of trends, we can see that sustainability, naturals and anti-ageing will be high on the agenda for everyone at this year's show. Within sustainability and naturals, microbiome and biotech will be the main focus, meanwhile, for those interested in anti-ageing trends, we can expect to see an emphasis on cellular repair. UV and blue light protection are also an area of focus this year. As more and more people are increasingly spending considerable amounts of time in the digital world, therefore exposing themselves to HEV light (High-Energy Visible Light) that is damaging for the skin, it is not surprising that blue light protection continues to be a topic of interest. Anne Schrötter will be leading a Technical Seminar on blue light, demonstrating how natural bioactives meet the latest consumer needs and market trends when it comes to skin barrier repair and global protection. Premium Beauty News - You announced a hybrid event. Can you describe how the virtual event will be articulated with the physical one? Roziani Zulkifli - After listening to feedback from attendees at online in-cosmetic events throughout the pandemic, we are very excited to extend the in-person event by offering attendees the chance to continue conversations via a new hybrid approach post-show. Our exhibitors and visitors will be presented with further opportunities to network, giving them the best of both worlds. Our new, online platform will be open from 11-22 April where it will be available for both exhibitors and visitors to arrange virtual meetings, as well as being able to access a comprehensive range of on-demand and live content to continue their show journey. The platform will not only provide access to those who cannot attend due to travel restrictions, but it also allows a wider audience to participate and benefit from the networking opportunities that in-cosmetics has always offered to our in-person attendees. Planning and using all of the show's resources to their full extent is key. The online connections are not just limited to our visitors and the exhibitors they've discovered online. It can also be used to continue those conversations started in Paris or to follow up with leads that exhibitors have collected from the smart readers and apps used at the show. Premium Beauty News - Will all exhibitors participate in both events (in person and digital)? Roziani Zulkifli - Absolutely. All of our main stand-holders will be participating both in-person and online, and we are also expecting those exhibitors who are experiencing continued government travel restrictions to be joining us on the virtual platform, providing everyone with an equal chance to connect, inspire and learn. Either way, our emphasis for this year's in-cosmetics Global is firmly set on ensuring everyone has a safe and secure environment to conduct business. This includes three exciting days of busy, in-person networking, and for the first time in the show's history, a follow-up virtual event that is designed to maximise every opportunity to collaborate and learn. That is why we're very much looking forward to welcoming our exhibitors, attendees and speakers, both in-person and online next month at in-cosmetics Global 2022. Registration is now open.

BASF launches four patented biomimetic peptides for dermocosmetic products,"BASF's newly launched Peptovitae range includes four patented peptides developed in Asia through an exclusive relationship with Caregen, a Korean-based company specializing in biomimetic peptide research and development. According to BASF Care Creations, the Peptovitae series represents a new generation of scientifically developed biomimetic peptides, addressing a wider range of skin concerns than are traditionally associated with the use of peptides. Each of the four new peptides is associated with specific personal care skin benefits: – Peptovitae Matrix addresses the signs of aging; – Peptovitae Bright enhances the brightness of skin; – Peptovitae Derma soothes skins that are prone to dryness and itching; – Peptovitae Clear calms and moisturizes the skin. The double-layered, liposome-based encapsulation system used in the Peptovitae series allows finished products to deliver the benefit of these biomimetic peptides to skin appearance. ""BASF has adapted these peptides to ensure they meet cosmetic industry standards, thereby making these products available to our customers and consumers,"" said Viju Jose, Vice President, Personal Care Solutions, Care Chemicals, BASF Asia Pacific. According to BASF, consumers - both in Asia and in Western countries - are increasingly looking for safe and effective skin care-regime-based solutions with high efficacy as an alternative to procedure-based treatments to address their personal skin needs. In this context, the company thinks these new peptides will enable skincare brands to develop innovative products with enhanced benefits. ""The strong growth of dermocosmetics in China and the doubling of the share of dermocosmetics in the global beauty market over the last 15 years are evidence of the robust growth in products containing peptides and the shift by consumers towards biomimetic skin care regimes,"" added Eunice Jeong, Head of Regional Market Development, Personal Care Solutions, Care Chemicals, BASF Asia Pacific."
Clariant transitions towards renewable carbon with bio-based surfactants range,"With the introduction of 100% bio-based surfactants and PEGs, Clariant significantly expands the number of ingredients in its Vita range. Vita products are based on renewable feedstocks and have at least 98% Renewable Carbon Index (RCI) thus providing low carbon footprint solutions to manufacturers. ""As our climate gives us increasing and alarming signals of change, individuals and industries are looking for ways to reduce their environmental footprints, and the demand for bio-based chemicals is set to grow strongly in the coming years,"" Clariant explains in a statement. Designed for natural formulations targeting a high Renewable Carbon Index (RCI), the new Vita products support manufacturers in maximizing the bio-based carbon content of consumer goods such as detergents, hair and body shampoos, but also paints, industrial lubricants, and crop formulations. To create these new surfactants and PEGs, Clariant uses 100% bio-ethanol derived from sugar cane or corn to create the required ethylene oxide. The bio-based material is fully segregated along the value chain from the field to the final consumer product. Because only bio-based feedstocks are used, the new ingredients have significantly lower carbon footprints than their fossil-based counterparts. According to Clariant, the Vita surfactants can help save up to 85% of CO₂ emissions compared to their fossil analogues. These new solutions are chemically equivalent to fossil versions, the company explained. They offer the same performance and efficiency to formulators and brand owners. The range currently includes more than 70 bio-based products, and the range will continue to be expanded to meet evolving market needs. In Q1 2022, double-digit kilotons of the bio-based surfactants and PEGs will be available for the worldwide business segments from Clariant IGL Specialty Chemicals (CISC), a Clariant joint venture. ""From the packaging to the many ingredients, a typical consumer product in coatings, personal care, home care, industrial, and agricultural applications still uses petrochemicals and therefore fossil carbon,"" said Christian Vang, Global Head of Business Unit Industrial & Consumer Specialties, Clariant. ""Switching to bio-based carbon chemistry remains a big challenge for manufacturers and by launching the Vita surfactant and PEG range we are offering them an important new solution to achieve this."""
"Mustard, broccoli, oysters: When age-old remedies come to beauty routines","While the kitchen and the bathroom were once two very distinct spaces, this no longer seems to be the case. The foods we're used to seeing on our plates are now making their way into beauty kits, taking on a variety of forms, from oils to skincare creams to shampoos, serums and facial cleansers. That's nothing new, certainly. The cosmetics industry has long been drawing from our kitchen cupboards to exploit the virtues of natural ingredients such as honey, olive oil, sugar, eggs and lemon. But age-old remedies and recipes are more than ever inspiring new beauty players. Let's take a look at some of the latest contenders. Broccoli, for instance, would be packed with benefits, including countless cosmetic virtues still little known to many. Broccoli oil would have moisturizing and nourishing properties, both for skin and hair. Dry, damaged or even dull hair will therefore appreciate the ability of broccoli to make it shinier and silkier. This brassica would also naturally tame frizz, and help make detangling easier. As such, it's an ideal partner for shampoos and/or conditioners. The vegetable can be found in this form at Unbottled — a brand known for its responsible solid cosmetics — which combines broccoli, argan and green clay to promise shinier hair. The Compagnie des Sens chooses an organic virgin vegetable oil, while Freshly Cosmetics opts for a facial mask made of charcoal, seaweed, clays and broccoli enzymes. In the past, the hair benefits of mustard have been applied in hair masks. There are now vegetable oils, or even shampoos, leveraging on the age-old ingredient. But mustard seeds would also have skin benefits. Brands such as WAAM Cosmetics, My Mira and MyCosmetik therefore offer mustard oils for hair and skin. Essentially offered in the form of oil, the onion - and, in particular, the red onion - is an object of growing interest from the cosmetics industry. As soon as this year, we could start seeing creams, masks and serums formulated with its extracts. If red onions are the beauty industry's most coveted variety, it's because they appear to be the richest variety in sulfur compounds. These are beneficial for hair, promoting its regrowth. But onion can also be a top ally for problem skin, thanks to its purifying virtues, helping fight against acne and reduce scarring. Still relatively little marketed, natural onion oil is proposed by certain retailers and specialized brands, as well as by the brand WAAM Cosmetics, which evidently has a taste for unusual natural ingredients. But how far can this phenomenon go? It's hard to say, as consumers are now very fond of natural cosmetics, relegating long-winded formulas to the back of their beauty kits. And, as we know, the riches of nature are virtually infinite. In fact, a French brand called Perlucine now even offers a whole range of cosmetics — for face, body and hair — with white oyster shell powder. They may not be crunchy, but they're no less indulgent!"
"After CBD, cosmetic science investigates the benefits of CBG","The sale of cannabis derivatives is still a subject of debate, with different countries taking different views of and approaches to the marketing of cannabidiol (CBD) products. In spite of that, cannabidiol — one of the compounds contained in hemp — is proving a hit around the world, with a market that could reach $13.4 billion by 2028, according to Grand View Research. But this active substance could now be joined by another, even less well known compound called CBG, which stands for cannabigerol. Like cannabidiol, CBG is one of the hundred or so cannabinoids present in cannabis. It's just that, for the moment, it's much less known than CBD. That said, it's starting to interest scientists and manufacturers who are currently exploring its potential in order to introduce this compound to the realms of wellness and beauty. Non-psychotropic, like CBD and unlike THC, it is, in a way, the basis of its counterparts since it transforms into other cannabinoids — including the latter two — during the growth of the plant. This can explain why it is found in relatively small quantities, and in low concentrations. But its properties are no less useful. Just as CBD has now found its way into many bathrooms — in forms as diverse as oils, serums, creams, cleansers, scrubs and even deodorants — we could soon see the same lines of products enriched this time with CBG. Some players are already working on the virtues highlighted by scientific studies — namely anti-inflammatory, soothing, antibacterial and antioxidant properties... Note too, that since 2021, CBG has been included in the European Union's database of cosmetics ingredients (CosIng). CBG oils are already available in specialist stores, promising relaxing virtues that can help combat stress and fatigue. But the cosmetics industry could quickly seize on this new ally to offer a wider range of products for the skin. For its part, the France-based network of specialist CBD boutiques, Purple Store, this week announced that it is ""embarking on the development of CBG-based products,"" which could range from wellness products to cosmetics. In any case, it's a trend to follow closely."
"Sensoriality, wellbeing, emotion: Seppic's vision of cosmetics and happiness","In order to respond to the quest for well-being and happiness that emerges after the successive lockdowns linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, Seppic relies on highly sensorial cosmetic textures, a source of pleasure and precious moments of relaxation. But also on ingredients that bring well-being and positive emotions. On the occasion of Cosmet'Agora, Seppic therefore created formulas dedicated to happiness and well-being. The transforming formula Cosmos Skin Bliss thus offers a rich initial texture that releases an aqueous film after spreading. Its quick absorption leaves a refreshing bare skin effect. This multifunctional product adapts to all needs. This formula uses the patented Geltrap technology, an emulsion with an extra water-rich gelled internal aqueous phase, appreciated by all geographical areas. On the anti-ageing side, the formula boosts self-esteem with Aspar'Age, an active ingredient that helps consumers feeling younger (the benefit was confirmed by personal, instrumental and observer evaluations). According to Seppic: ""It's a dose of good mood in a tube!"" Always on the lookout for immediate well-being, consumers are looking for skincare products that suit their needs and desires. The refreshing Fresh Water Drop provides immediate pleasure thanks to the quick break effect of the Sepinov Weo polymer. Moreover, it contains Antileukine 6, an oily active ingredient named ""golden algae"", soothing and protecting the skin after sun exposure. A dose of freshness and well- being that brings a boost! And for consumers who are interested in a holistic approach to body and mind, the Happy Skin Inside & Out kit is ideal. It contains a ""pro-ageing"" skin care that stimulates hearing, smell, sight with the appearance of a pink foam and a soft and comfortable touch thanks to the combination of Emogreen, Montanov 202 and Sepimax Zen for a unique multi-sensory experience; and for taste, it is accompanied by nutritive gums containing Ceramosides, an hydrating and anti-aging active from Seppic's nutrition expertise. The cosmetic care contains the cosmetic grade Ceramosides HP. This ""inside & out"" beauty routine is thus global. Three other formulas combining cosmetics and emotions are also available in Seppic's Cosmet'Agora kit. ""At a time when consumers are looking for a sensory and emotional experience in cosmetics, Seppic innovates by inspiring its customers through its 'Happy Cosmetic' collection and invites them to rediscover its ingredients that 'boost' positive emotions,"" highlight the company."
Cosmet'Agora 2022: Happy Cosmetics as a post-COVID perspective,"Nomadic, regressive, fun to use, melting, solid, anhydrous, yet often daring, the formulas presented at Cosmet'Agora, on January 11th and 12th in Paris, tried their best to combine ecology and ethics with sensoriality and pleasure, without which there would be no cosmetic industry. For stress-free travels and light luggage, many single-dose formats, with different technologies, were on display. In the form of multicoloured beads, IMCD's Hand Cream to Share (NOI of 99.2% [1]) combines 40% water with a duo of waxes (sunflower for the shape and candelilla for the sensoriality), in a W/O emulsion. At Gattefossé, the combination of Geleol MB and Emulium Kappa MB allows obtaining the black pebbles of Magma Mask (NOI of 98%). Mixed in the palm of the hand with either the Everything Balm or warm water, each pebble delivers the desired amount of product. Another remarkable formula in the Escapism collection is the Slide n'Foam (NOI of 92%), a cube offering a new face cleansing gesture. Unlike soap, it can be applied directly to dry skin, to start melting just enough thanks to Lipocire A SG. Activated with water, the film turns into a foam, boosted by Acticire MB, before being rinsed off. DIY fans will be able to travel from home thanks to the ritual proposed by Lavolée: ""5 days, 5 Pearls of the World"". The products (100% natural and water-dispersible), after being crushed in a mortar will deliver a moisturising face and body cream. Each day/pearl is associated with a colour and an active ingredient coming from a different continent, represented by a dream beach. After the Zanzibar pearls, the Venice Beach pearls, the Maya Bay pearls and the Palombaggia pearls, the Copacabana pearl will surprise its user with a two-step ritual. After opening it in two, the user will collect a face and body scrub before preparing his or her skin moisturiser. For trips to sunny destinations, Stéarinerie Dubois has concocted Smile Protect, a solid SPF30 O/W sun emulsion (in vitro measured). The association of the self-emulsifying base DUB Base Expert + and the waxy ester DUB Cire H1 adds smoothness and comfort to the application, while the dispersing base DUB Helioptima allows reducing the number of UV filters, without compromising on the SPF. Some exhibitors invited their visitors to take a trip back to childhood, such as Azelis, whose Wonderland Paris formula kit celebrated the 30th anniversary of Disneyland Paris. The ultra-melting and fresh Lie l'eau et Stick eye serum is not stearate-based but formulated without soap, thanks to a combination of three hydrocolloids: A carrageenan (Genugel CG-130) and a gellan gum with a low degree of acylation (Kelcogel CG-LA) help to ensure the staying power and transparency, as well as the suspension of flakes, while a lambda grade of carrageenan (Genuvisvo CG 129) delivers the necessary smoothness for application. The Reine des Perles hand cream combines two gellan gums (Kelcogel CG-LA and CG-LA) in a soft and melting solid foam texture. Each pearl includes antibacterial and nourishing agents to meet today's market expectations. Back to childhood games again with Anjac, whose modelling pastes (NOI of 99%) offer a double transformation texture. Each modelling gum will serve for 2 or 3 uses: Mixed with water, it forms an exfoliating cream with an adjustable consistency. And for an indulgent scrub, Lessonia's Choco Soap bar combines the richness and softness of cocoa butter and powder with the exfoliating properties of coffee grounds. This exfoliating soap (100% of natural origin) for the hands, body and face, proposed in single-dose packages, can be easily slipped in a handbag. In its solid emulsion Rise and Shine Eye Lotion (NOI of 100%) in the form of a coffee bean, Hallstar combines coffee oil and butter with LOOK Oleoactif and LIFT Oleoactif for global action on the eye contour. On the side of delicacies, candies have given rise to many interpretations. This is the case with Daito Kasei's Candies Day Cream, to rehydrate before application, with each colour corresponding to a care routine to select according to the mood of the day. Cargill's Solid Cleansing Jellies, formulated with carrageenans, can also be chosen according to one's early morning mood, and envelop the skin with a sweet gourmand fragrance, even after rinsing. Taking the concept to the extreme, Greentech created Mask'ambar CBD, a bar with an ultra-regressive chocolate-caramel scent. Once rehydrated and applied as a mask, it only takes a fun gesture to remove the formula after spraying the peel-off solution. Each bar contains soothing CBD Isolate 1 and Circalys 2, which are believed to work on the brain-skin axis to reduce signs of fatigue and negative emotions. Beyond solid formulas, many of the innovations presented offered (more or less) new perspectives regarding water preservation. For example, PolymerExpert presented Heureux Événement, a skincare product (99.5% of natural origin) containing three preservative-free oil jellies packed in a single bottle. This care softens and moisturises the skin of expectant mothers during the last two trimesters of their pregnancy, and restores skin suppleness in the first months after childbirth. Solabia has also looked into different ways of reducing water consumption in cosmetic formulas: Solid formulas, no-rinse products, or simply by replacing demineralised water with vegetable water with a cosmetic benefit. Its Waterless Beauty Box for instance contains a shower gel in tablet form, a body butter, a restructuring stick for the face, a handmade solid shampoo, but also a two-phase hair care product (95% natural ingredients) with cascara extracts (Oleat Osun Cascara and Cascara Water) rich in polyphenols, in which cascara water replaces part of the demineralised water to increase the cosmetic benefit. Along the same lines, Quimdis offers Pow'deo, a powder deodorant to dilute in a reusable roll-on pack. The minimalist formula (only 10 ingredients, 96% of which are of natural origin) combines starch powders with bicarbonate and an active ingredient derived from zinc to regulate the skin pH and ensure sweat absorption. Another formula to rehydrate is Osmosand by Lucas Meyer, a hair care product in powder form to rehydrate before rinsing it off after application. Ecogel, an emulsifying-gelling agent binds the texture and adds creaminess. To make the most of water in its formula, the Osmomist milky mist, another innovation in the Osmosys collection, is formulated with Hamamelis water, stabilised with Heliofeel 22 MB. Making it very easy to apply, Saci-CFPA's Milky Sand Radiant Body Serum can be applied directly on the skin after showering, which means it does not need to be rehydrated. On contact with damp skin, this 100% natural powder is activated in a moisturising and illuminating serum for a healthy glow. A formula which received the 1st prize in the formulation contest organised, as every year, on the occasion of the show. FORMULATION AWARDS COSMET'AGORA 2022 - WINNERS – 1st Prize: Saci-CFPA for ""Milky Sand – 2nd Prize: PolymerExpert for ""A happy event"" – 3rd Prize: Givaudan for ""Happy Mask"" – Jury's favourite Award: Azelis for ""Pearls of the World"""
Olfactory reformulation: a creative practice for timeless perfumes,"Reformulation is an integral part of the perfumer's job. The main reason for it is the need to adapt fragrances to the changeable availability of raw materials. In addition to regulatory restrictions, in particular in Europe, there are ""shortages of both natural and synthetic ingredients for climatic or geographic reasons, or because plants are shut down, for example,"" explains Suzy Le Helley, perfumer at Symrise. Trained at the technical reformulation division of the fragrance composition company, she gradually learned to complete the reformulation work with literature search and olfactory analyses. It is a demanding experience, in particular with old perfumes, ""whose fans know all notes by heart."" This practice can prove extremely complex with De Laire Bases, some of whose materials are now banned. For these combinations much useful to perfumers, the olfactory outcome can be very tricky to reproduce. ""My greatest challenge was to rework a 1950s 'formula à tiroirs' comprising several De Laire Bases, i.e. almost 500 raw materials. This huge work took me over a year,"" recalls the young woman. And yet, recent perfumes, which should also be made compliant with IFRA standards, do represent a challenge. ""For example, short, readable formulas created by Jean-Claude Ellena, Michel Almairac, or Maurice Roucel, in which every ingredient has its own place, require refined, very precise substitution work."" The phase of evaporation on the skin, which is essential, also requires much attention and creativity. Reformulation of old perfumes without archives is yet another issue. The rebirth of old brands (Teo cabanel, Jovoy, Houbigant, Lubin, Le Galion, or, more recently, Marcelle Dormoy, Maison Violet, Cherigan, Bienaimé) increased this phenomenon, although some of them were able to keep their documentation. Cinquième Sens recently tried to take up this challenge. ""We had to recompose a 1930s perfume based on a sample which dated back to the 1950s, without the original formula,"" explains perfumer Alice Dattée. If chromatography is a precious help, it is not enough. ""The sample was old, the top notes had evaporated,"" she explains. It is a real balancing act to harmonize creative middle and back notes. This long-term work combines olfactory analyses, culture, and strategy. For once, the IFRA directives were favourable to perfumers. ""With IFRA 48, the coumarin assay would not have been viable, whereas IFRA 49 helped position the perfume as a mixed fragrance to take advantage of more flexible standards."" The most difficult with these old perfumes is to transcribe the nitrated musk effect with today's ingredients, agree Alice Dattée and Suzy Le Helley. Indeed, another major issue has to do with the use of natural ingredients which have become very costly: it can involve reducing their dose. ""Then, you need to get as close as possible to the original's spirit, while remaining up-to-date,"" analyzes Alice Dattée. ""It is almost improvisation to reformulate old perfumes which have disappeared,"" confirms Patrice Revillard, of Laboratoire Maelstrom. The perfumer won the competition organized by Panouge to recreate L'Iris Gris by Jacques Fath (1947), a fragrance that has become mythical. ""It was tricky to get as close to the original version as possible, because this perfume is known based on vintage versions that have changed and macerated over time,"" explains Patrice Revillard. Without the original formula, he worked on the version kept by L'Osmothèque and enriched his olfactory analysis with well-preserved vintage fragrances. The biggest issue lied in the use of the eugenol note, which is very limited by European Directives. ""That is why our formula is a little less spicy, less 'eyelet' than the original,"" says Patrice Revillard. ""Luckily, since the writing style of L'Iris Gris is quite modern, we did not have to replace notes like nitrated musks, liliales, or oak moss."" This illusionist work consists in reinterpreting the perfume rather than technically reproducing the formula. ""We were lucky enough to work with an unlimited budget, because the natural fragrances of that time have become very costly,"" adds Patrice Revillard, who will soon take up the challenge of working with a more restricted budget, since Panouge aims to launch a more affordable version of L'Iris Gris. Well, it is said that constraints stimulate creativity…"

Silab reconnects aged fibroblasts to help regenerate mature skin,"According to Sibab research, the so-called ""fibroblast regenerating complex"", the cooperation process between the cutaneous, immune and vascular systems that is instrumental to cutaneous regeneration is altered with age. The capacity of fibroblasts to interconnect the three systems, via the secretion of a pool of growth factors, is thereof reduced. In order to revitalize the key processes of regeneration, Silab developed Regenixir [1], a patented regenerating active ingredient that stimulates the skin's capacity to synthesize its own ""growth elixir."" According to the French-based manufacturer of cosmetic active ingredients, by restoring the capacity of aged fibroblasts to interact with their environment, Regenixir enables a transversal action on the three interconnected systems: – cutaneous system: matrix restructuring and epidermal renewal are improved [2]; – vascular system: formation of a vascular network is restored [3]; – immune system: pro-regenerating macrophages population is increased. In clinical tests, an emulsion with Regenixir at 2.5% demonstrated an anti-wrinkle effect as of 21 days of application, by significantly reducing crow's feet wrinkles in Caucasian (-10%) and Asian subjects (-6%). According to Silab, tested in Caucasian volunteers in the same conditions, the active ingredient: – improves the biomechanical properties of the skin (firmness: +10%; elasticity: +14%; tonicity: +25%); – attenuates the visibility of microvessels (-6%) and demonstrates an anti-under-eye circles efficacy by significantly improving the colour of under-eye circles; – significantly restores the parameters characteristic of complexion radiance (reflection: +9%; pink colour: +15%; olive colour: -7%; luminosity: -6%). ""All these effects continue after 42 days of treatment and are perceived by the volunteers themselves,"" said Silab. For developing Regenixir, Silab has focused on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Widely used in the food industry, this yeast is also recognized by the medical and scientific community for its countless properties: richness in nutrients, capacity to stimulate energy production and immune defences, etc. From S. cerevisiae, Silab has extracted oligo-β-glucans that can restore the interconnectivity of the cutaneous, immune and vascular systems for a regenerating anti-aging effect. Available in aqueous solution (recommended amount: 0.25 to 2.5%), Regenixir has a content of natural origin of 99% (ISO 16128) and is compliant with international cosmetic regulations (Europe, United States, China, Japan, etc.)."
2022 inspirational formulas: on the go and anhydrous products by Gattefossé,"Dubbed Escapism, Gattefossé's new inspirational collection aims to be an invitation to dream of new destinations while rethinking the art of travelling. Therefore, the company's applications laboratory has developed practical solid and anhydrous formulations to transform the beauty routines of travellers. Solid cosmetics are not only trends, since they are part of a global movement to protect the planet by reducing the overall impact on the environment, including beauty. However, beyond the many benefits they have to offer to the environment, the characteristics of solid cosmetics make them the best solution for travelling. Indeed, they are easily transportable, smaller and lighter than conventional versions. They are also multifunctional, with a size that can be adapted to the trip duration and most of them do not leave any waste behind. This year, Gattefossé developed 5 new formulations: Magma Mask, a mask in the form of solid black pellet to grind to powder; Everything Balm, a multifunctional anhydrous balm texture; Softer Skin Stick, a scrub made from vegetal waxes and apricot kernels and shaped in a stick format for convenient use; Scalp & Body Scrub, an exfoliating wax that rinses easily; and finally Slide n' Foam, a solid face cleanser. ""As its name suggests, Inspiration is a collection of formulas created, to inspire formulators by highlighting Gattefossé ingredients used out of their comfort zone. Each year, we focus on one or more themes illustrated with new formulations. The idea is above all for our lab team members to let their imagination and creativity run free, to propose original and surprising formulas while respecting our charter in terms of naturality and sustainability,"" said Flora Bollon, Product Marketing Leader Texture & Applications at Gattefossé."
Solvay unveils two biodegradable guar ingredients for beauty care products,"According to Solvay, Jaguar C500 STD, a conditioning polymer, and Jaguar HP-8 COS SGI, a multifunctional polymer, will help formulators to produce beauty care solutions with superior benefits and desirable biodegradability claims thereby responding to both stringent global regulations and the changing expectations of consumers searching for more responsible, sustainable products. ""Consumers are becoming more aware of how their actions impact the health of our planet,"" explained Stephanie Neplaz, global marketing innovation director, hair care at Solvay. ""This means they are looking for beauty products made with biodegradable ingredients that have a positive impact on their hair or skin as well as on the planet."" The guar beans used to create these polymers are sourced in India where Solvay is supporting sustainable guar sourcing through the Sustainable Guar Initiative program, which is part of the group's sustainability agenda. The Sustainable Guar Initiative aims to implement best farming practices to improve guar quality and supply security while enabling farmers to earn a better living, and to preserve precious groundwater, and empower local women. ""We are constantly investing in innovation, technology, and developing our Jaguar portfolio,"" said Jean-Guy Le Helloco, global vice president, home and personal care at Solvay. ""And we have more innovations, such as next generation biodegradable polymers, on the horizon."""
Three natural ingredients coming to beauty routines in 2022,"The pandemic has sounded the death knell for complex product formulas and endless beauty routines, paving the way for more authentic, natural approach and preventative care. Beauty is now more minimalist, focusing on a few key active ingredients instead of multiple layers of creams, serums and other products. Throughout 2021, the craze on TikTok - Gen Z's preferred social network - was all about grandma's age-old remedies based on natural ingredients. If retinol — considered one of the most effective anti-aging active ingredients — is the star ingredient at the start of the year, as it has been around the world throughout 2021 (alongside aloe vera and vitamin C) according to a recent research from Skincare Hero, some botanical ingredients may supplant this active form of vitamin A in the coming months. The prickly pear, for instance, is enjoying increasing success thanks to its anti-aging properties. Found in Mexico and the Maghreb, prickly pear seed oil is now renowned throughout the world for its anti-aging properties, now giving rise to numerous cosmetics formulated with this natural ingredient. Rich in vitamin E, polyunsaturated fatty acids and sterols, prickly pear seed oil not only reduces the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines, but also improves skin tone and fights premature aging. And to top it all off, it is believed to have healing properties. While it is found in the form of a plant-based oil, there is a growing number of cosmetics based on prickly pear, including creams and masks for the skin and hair. Star of social media in 2021, rice is now an exceptional ingredient in cosmetics, enhancing dull skin, combination to oily skin, as well as mature skin. In fact, TikTokers came up with hacks and challenges throughout 2021 to highlight the many virtues of rice, using hashtags like #ricewaterhairchallenge (75 million views) and #ricewaterforskin (3.6 million views). While there were already rice-based cosmetics, it hasn't taken long to see the emergence of many more, from rice powder masks to rice bran plant oils, exfoliants, mattifying powders and the likes. Used for centuries in Asia to enhance women's skin and hair, rice powder is known for its strong absorbing and mattifying power, whereas rice water, rich in antioxidants, fights the signs of aging while improving skin firmness and deep moisturizing. And as if that wasn't enough, rice is also a great ally for hair, making it stronger and shinier. Properties that are now highlighted in a host of beauty brands' products in the cosmetics aisle. If the environmental qualities of flax have allowed it to make a comeback in the fashion world in 2021, its benefits for the skin are perhaps less well known. And yet, the powers of its flowers and seeds make it an essential ally for sensitive, dry and mature skin. And it's clear that cosmetic brands have caught on too, bringing out a vast choice of creams, serums and oils based on this ingredient that's soon to be a must-have. The most sensitive skins will appreciate the soothing, anti-inflammatory and emollient powers of flax, which, as a bonus, has regenerating and repairing properties. But flax is also everywhere in the moisturizing section since it has nourishing virtues, while improving the elasticity and tonicity of the skin. Like prickly pear and rice, flax is also a top choice for mature skin because it would help delay skin relaxation and sagging. And, like its counterparts, it is not to be outdone when it comes to boosting hair in need of strength and thickness."
Firmenich and Jungle create a sustainable lily of the valley extract,"Lily of the valley is known in perfumery as one of the most iconic ""silent flowers"", a flower that yields no essence, and its use in the composition of fragrances is therefore very difficult, if not impossible. In order to create the first-ever commercial sustainable extract obtained from the lily of the valley flower, Firmenich has relied on its patented Firgood extraction technology, which uses the water contained in botanical cells: once warmed up by electromagnetic vibration, the water carries the odorant components, to yield the final pure extract. Developped for the luxury perfume market, Muguet Firgood was developed through a collaboration with French start-up Jungle, a specialist in vertical agriculture, a technology allowing to grow crops in vertically stacked layers for reduced land and water use. According to Firmenich, Muguet Firgood is a pure and 100% natural ingredient with fresh and authentic notes never obtained before. ""It is the first time in the history of perfumery that an extract of this flower has been captured with a safe and sustainable process, offering a completely new olfactory profile with genuine tonalities,"" said the company in a statement. The Firgood technology does not require any solvent. The dry biomasses only needs water humidification and the whole extraction process only requires low energy consumption and generates clean wastes that can easily be upcycled. Combined with Jungle's unique capabilities in vertical farming, allowing to create clean and highly efficient farms, the technology provides high yields with a very low environmental impact. ""Our strategic partnership and joint expertise with Jungle on sustainable technologies now makes it possible for our perfumers to capture and harness the genuine natural scent of this exquisite flower to the benefit of our customers and of consumers,"" said Julien Firmenich, Vice President Product Strategy and Promotion. ""Muguet Firgood is a truly rare and precious ingredient."" Firmenich will market Muguet Firgood as a captive ingredient intended for the fine fragrance market. It will thus complete the exclusive range of natural ingredients available to the company's perfumers. By combining their respective expertise, the partnership between Firmenich and Jungle should shape new sustainable natural ingredients for the fragrance market. ""This project with Firmenich has strengthened our protocols and expertise in cultivating plants, in our vertical farms, for their enhanced biological activity,"" underlined Gilles Dreyfus, President and Co-founder of Jungle. ""We are now well positioned to support the cosmetics and nutraceutical industries by providing safe, local and reproductible plant extracts."""
"Sozio launches Cosmocaps, a 100% natural encapsulation technology","Developed to provide an alternative to synthetic microcapsules, the Cosmoscaps are microcapsules that encapsulate perfumes into a vegetable matrix made of natural waxes. This 100% natural innovation is also Cosmos-certified. ""This technology is the result of a reflection that we had started to be able to provide our customers in the natural segment - accounting for 30% of our portfolio - with an encapsulation technology. The innovation does not only provide a solution without microplastics but also a Cosmos certified solution to natural cosmetic brands,"" explains Laurie Junillon, Marketing & Communication Director at Sozio. According to Sozio, the vegetable base gives Cosmocaps a double action: they ensure a controlled release of the fragrance on the skin throughout the day and bring emollient properties to the formulas. As far as the performance olfactive is concerned, the fragrance benefits from a progressive and continuous diffusion on the skin, before and after rinsing. In addition, Sozio's Cosmocaps provide a cosmetic benefit thanks to the emollient properties of their vegetable matrix, which nourishes and restructures the skin. According to Sozio, the Cosmocaps are adapted to all cosmetic bases, in particular aqueous emulsions, whether for rinse or leave-on products. However, they are not compatible with alcoholic bases. The Cosmocaps do not cause any change in the product's texture, a slight clouding of the formula can however be observed."
"Beraca launches Berashades, a range of natural colours for cosmetics","The launch features a palette of five naturally coloured clays for mineral cosmetics - Ivory, Beige, Bronze, Caramel and Ebony. These five shades allow to mix customize more than 3,000 colour combinations adapted to the different skin tones, claims Beraca. The shades in the Berashades palette with meets vegan claims and offer good coverage, allowing a more natural appearance and matte effect, in addition to stable colour resulting from a micronization process. [1] As a mineral ingredient, they also offer detoxifying and a remineralizing effect, adds the Brazilian company. The skin barrier protection offered by Berashades was assessed in a TEWL Test that showed a significant reduction of transepidermal water loss, thus demonstrating the ability of the ingredient to ensure skin integrity and hydration. Additionally, a cutometer test to study skin firmness showed improved firmness after seven consecutive days. In parallel, Beraca also launched an online tool, The Berashades Mixer, which is a digital platform that allows formulators to create their own shades with simultaneous access to different levels of benefits delivered by the ingredient, such as hydration, skin ́s barrier function and firmness. This technology aims to assist professionals in each of the tones created, in particular in order to reduce time-to-market. Berashades was designed for use in a wide range of cosmetic products, including makeup (mascara, foundation, concealer, compact powder, tanning powder, contour palette), hair care (powdered or dry coloured shampoo, root retouch), skin care (tanning oil, cream and moisturizer, BB cream, CC cream). Clays are a major trend in the cosmetics industry. According to Mintel GNPD, the number of global skin care products containing clay has grown by 27% in the last five years, reaching 819 launches in 2020. For hair care, the growth was 62% in the last two years, registering 232 new products in 2020."
Berkem targets skin irritation with a polyphenols-rich botanical ingredient,"Berkem, which recently announced an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in order to be listed at Euronext Growth in Paris, has just unveiled a new plant active ingredient intended to relieve the skin for the stress and discomfort induced by mask-wearing, also known as ""maskne"" (or mask-related acne). Dubbed Skin'Calm [1], this active ingredient is extracted from the flower of false acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia). Sourced in France from organically grown plants, Skin'Calm is rich in sugars and polyphenols [2], both of which help fight certain skin disorders by soothing the skin, rebalancing its pH and correcting imperfections. The soothing properties of the active ingredient were evaluated by an ex-vivo proteomic study (a screening of all skin proteins in order to identify those impacted by the botanical extract), which revealed a 25% decrease in the expression of the S100-A8 protein (compared to usual levels). This protein is known for playing a prominent role in the regulation of inflammatory processes and immune response. An in-vivo test confirmed the ingredient's anti-blemish effect, its ability to reduce discomfort sensations and oily skin, and to improve the skin's texture. ""As a skin care ingredient Skin'Calm was eagerly awaited by professionals in the cosmetics industry, who are keen to offer products adapted to 'maskne',"" explains Berkem in a statement. Driven by a particular attention to skin health and the overall search for well-being, the dermo-cosmetics market is growing strongly, together with strong expectations regarding the use of natural ingredients. Since the start of 2020, demand has only accelerated, in particular due to the stress generated by the obligation to wear facial covers in link to the health situation. ""Maskne"" - or the skin irritation linked to mask-wearing - is often cited as a major concern of consumers in post-Covid times globally. A study by market research firm The NPD Group, pointed that sales of face care products claiming anti-acne and anti-blemish benefits grew by 32% between 2019 and 2020. ""Skin'Calm is a 3-in-1 ingredient that meets the strong expectations of the cosmetics market. It promotes skin's balance together with soothing and anti-imperfection benefits,"" highlights Charlène Martin, BtoB plant extraction product manager at Berkem. Berkem's Skin'Calm complies with China's cosmetic regulations and can be used as an ingredient for soothing face and body care products, and to reduce face skin blemishes."
Lubrizol emphasizes eyes beauty with new sustainably sourced botanical active,"Dubbed Resulook, the new botanical ingredient crafted by Lubrizol Life Science - Beauty (LLS Beauty) is sustainably sourced from Myrothamnus flabellifolius, an African species also known as the ""resurrection plant"" for its ability to remain dormant during drought, then revive after a rainfall. The Zulu people believe that this reviving ability can be transmitted to those who use the plant. Inspired by the traditional uses of the botanical, LLS Beauty created Resulook to enhance the appearance of the eyes. To achieve this unique benefit, the company used an eco-friendly alternative to conventional chemical solvent. In addition to a lower environmental footprint, the so-called Phenobio subcritical water technology generates a broader range of phytoactives in higher concentrations. ""Today, the emphasis on eyes in the beauty business is greater than ever due to mask wearing brought on by the pandemic. Healthy, fuller eyelashes and brows complement and flatter the eyes, whether the customer wears makeup or not. Now, more so than ever, our eyes make a first impression,"" highlights the company. According to LLS Beauty, in vitro testing has shown that Resulook improves hair anchorage and supports hair growth. Furthermore, clinical testing performed with a serum and a mascara containing 2% ingredient showed a 164% increase in eyelash length compared to a placebo. Other results were a lash lift effect and filling effect for bolder eyebrows. The resurrection plant is ethically sourced by a company that works with rural farmers trained in sustainable practices. ""The business contributes to community development throughout Zimbabwe by creating jobs and improving living conditions,"" said LLS Beauty. The company also works closely with the nonprofit Samara Foundation to give back to rural harvesting communities."
"Givaudan unveils microbiome-friendly fragrance technology, Z-biome","Givaudan's scientists and perfumers have developped two new technologies, My Z-biome and Z-biome Deo, designed to ensure consumers can choose not only beautiful scents, but also microbiome-friendly fragrances across a range of personal care products and body deodorants. My Z-biome is a fragrance design tool that allows Givaudan perfumers to craft fragrances that take special consideration of the skin's microflora. More focused on personal hygiene, the Z-biome Deo technology allows the creation of microbiome-friendly and deo-effective fragrances. The fragrance giant says Z-biome Deo is based on ""more than 30 years of expertise in malodour counteraction research to effectively combat sweat malodour while respecting the natural perspiration process."" According to Givaudan, these innovations match with the growing desire of consumers to protect their skin's microbiome in a context where more and more people believe that wellbeing is connected to the health of the skin.

"Skincare: ""Good skin"", the return to a natural and serene beauty","Although the situation may vary significantly from one market to another, the pandemic has had a profound impact on consumer habits. Make-up is mostly down, while hygiene, hair care and skincare have benefited from the confinements. Perfume, after a worldwide drop, is experiencing a fine upturn in many markets. Not only has the interest in skincare products undeniably increased during the confinement periods, but skincare habits have also changed durably: No more layering of products, the trend is towards simplification, respect for the skin, and ""skin fasting"". Above all, the objective is the well-being of the skin for a fresh and natural complexion. People invest in daily care and hygiene rather than spending time concealing imperfections. They want perfect, luminous, unified skin... with a minimum of products while integrating new facial massage techniques. Another, even more minimalist trend, skin fasting, recommends using a minimum of products to let the skin self-regulate and regenerate itself. This skin fasting, which streamlines the application of cosmetics to two or three essential products, is said to give results after only two weeks. The skipcare trend also aims to reduce the number of products, to do better with less, but also to fight against wastage. The skincare ritual is reduced to a cleanser and a moisturiser. The choice of products used is all the more relevant as they must be effective, more concentrated in active ingredients and multifunctional. This minimalism does not mean that the time spent on skin care will be reduced. On the contrary, the use of accessories or optimisation techniques for greater efficiency is in vogue. As proof, Google searches on these subjects have more than fourfolded in 2021. Self-massage, use of a jade or rose quartz roller depending on the benefits sought, the gua sha technique (scraping, sand) or more high-tech techniques such as those offered by the Swedish brand Foreo. Its bestseller LUNA 3, made up of silicone dots, combined with T-Sonic pulses, removes up to 99.5% of impurities. The latest addition, BEAR combines advanced micro-currents, pulsations and Anti-Shock System to stimulate the 69 muscles of the face and neck. Firming effect guaranteed! Estée Lauder recently filed two separate patents, one for a reusable dispenser that cools the product before use to optimise its properties, the other for a multi-layer heating pad. The product alone is no longer sufficient and the search for ever more optimal efficiency is becoming the absolute quest. Women want a luminous skin, with a perfect glow, smooth, free of imperfections... the perfect glow. Brands have therefore reinvested in this niche by offering new galenic formulas such as exfoliating foams and lotions that are easier to use, concentrated in active ingredients or based on patented enzymatic complexes. The deep cleansing of the face once again becomes a fundamental gesture. And to add a touch of perfection, a BB or CC cream will replace the now obsolete foundation. Faced with these new challenges, laboratories must revisit their formulas. On the one hand, they have to integrate these new skincare routines by working on the sensory side, and on the other, they have to find simpler, more natural formulas, free of controversial ingredients... in short, more ""eco-designed"". According to Mintel [1], 62% of Millennials care about INCI lists and other information on the packaging, including environmental friendliness. Hygiene and hand care is also a new area of focus, due to COVID. Brands will have to come up with new solutions to meet demand. For ingredient suppliers, the challenge is to reconcile all aspects of CSR while keeping in mind the main consumer requirements.

Aloe vera tops the skincare charts as the world's most-searched ingredient,"The pandemic has changed the face of cosmetics, making skincare products — preferably natural ones — rise to prime popularity. As a result, consumers are now looking for simplified formulas based on one or two ingredients with multiple benefits. Expert advice website Skincare Hero [1] looked at the most coveted ingredients by country, then by geographical area, by analyzing Google data on the subject. And the result is clear: aloe vera is the most searched skincare ingredient in 37 countries around the world. As seen in a previous study, hydration is at the heart of men's and women's skin care concerns. So, it's perhaps not all that surprising to learn that an ingredient with strong moisturizing powers is being embraced in many countries around the world. Grown in places with generally warm climates, such as North Africa, South America and the Mediterranean, this age-old plant is primarily known for its high concentration of water, making it a great ally for dry and dehydrated skin. In detail, aloe vera tops the skincare ingredient search results in Italy, Finland, Switzerland, Sweden, Portugal, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Guyana, Paraguay, Costa Rica, Guadeloupe, Jamaica and Panama. Indeed, it seems that the star ingredient is especially popular among Europeans and Americans. The study also reveals that the most searched question about aloe vera is none other than: ""does aloe vera clear pimples?"" As it happens, the plant has healing virtues, which means it can play a role in fighting acne. Many people around the globe are now looking for ways of getting beautiful, natural skin, with no gimmicks. This is reflected in the recent craze for vitamin C, which has become a cosmetic must-have in recent months. Not only does it bring radiance to the complexion, but it can also reduce the signs of aging — a godsend for residents of the 12 countries in the world where it's the most searched ingredient. These include Greece, Serbia, Slovenia, Malta, Bulgaria and even Fiji, mainly. Note that people in North and South America don't seem particularly interested in this ingredient, which only tops the list in St. Vincent, in the heart of the Caribbean. This time, internet users' top question is: ""should you use vitamin C serum every day?"" Something that is indeed recommended by specialists, who advise using it in a day cream. Neck and neck with vitamin C, retinol is also the top-searched ingredient in 12 countries around the world. A member of the retinoid family — a class of chemical compounds derived from vitamin A — retinol is now considered one of the most effective anti-aging agents. This seems to be important, even essential, for people in France, Belgium, Norway, Spain, Mexico, Brazil and even Colombia. As with many active ingredients intended to fight the signs of ageing, internet users are primarily wondering at what age to start using retinol. Note that hyaluronic acid, which leads searches in 'just' seven countries, is nevertheless the star ingredient in the United States, Canada, and Australia."
Seppic adds sensoriality to clean beauty formulas with new rheology modifier,"Launched worldwide for cosmetic application, Sepilus K is a concentrated liquid polymer designed to give a touch of sensory elegance to particularly demanding formulations such as minimalist formulas or those compliant with ""Clean Beauty"". Already launched for a year in Asia where it has met with rapid success, Sepiplus K is Winner of Ringier Technology Innovation Awards 2021 in China for its high performance and its possibility to formulate with cold process. Sepiplus K is solvent, preservative and EO-free. Cold processable, it requires very little energy for formulation. ""A considerable advantage for the development of more ecological products,"" explains Seppic in a statement. It is not considered a microplastic [1] and comes as a concentrated inverse emulsion. Sepiplus K provides high performance in terms of thickening, oil stabilizing and resistance to electrolytes. It is pre-neutralised and efficient on a large pH range from 3 to 12. ""Sepiplus K imparts a silicone-like gliding skin feel with a non-tacky and non-sticky finish. It has been scientifically proven in a study carried out in China according to the R3M score [2], that it activates the positive emotions of consumers, an important factor in the appreciation of cosmetic products,"" adds Seppic."
Eurofragance debuts first captive with an upcycled genderless woody note,"According to Eurofragance, this new perfumery ingredient is significant in three respects: it completes the woody notes olfactive family; it is made from upcycled wood waste; and it has a genderless olfactive profile that meets today's consumers expectations in the high-end fragrance segment. For the creation of their first captive note, Eurofragance paid great attention to sustainability. To avoid deforestation and any negative impact on the environment, the company chose to use discarded sawdust from a particular tree. The long upcycling process required to remove, via natural purification methods, all superfluous molecules from the wood compound, but to keep those of perfumistic interest. ""This time- consuming purification step was repeated over and over, over several months. In the end, [the team of researchers] was able to uncover an ingredient with the best olfactory profile, while retaining the soul of the wood,"" said Eurofragance. In French, soul (or essence) translates into ""âme."" Hence, Eurofragance named their captive L'Âme du Bois, the soul of wood. While wood notes have always held an important place in the perfumer's palette, as key ingredients to create the heart or base of a fragrance, they were historically perceived as being more masculine. However, for this new creation, Eurofragance aimed to design an ingredient that could appeal to women and men alike, and also resonate for those seeking more unisex scents. ""L'Âme du Bois is avant-garde in terms of its conception, but, above all, for what it brings to fragrance creation. It redefines woody notes in a manner befitting our time. L'Âme du Bois is inclusive and all-embracing of other accords and olfactive notes. For Perfumers, L'Âme du Bois is a true breakthrough,"" said Henry van den Heuvel, Global Creative Director and Senior Perfumer at Eurofragance. According to Felipe San Juan Tejada, R&D Scientist at Eurofragance, in the near term L'Âme du Bois should be reserved for the design of prestige fragrances and for all premium product categories, be it fine fragrance, home or personal care. Eurofragance's L'Âme du Bois was unveiled at the Beautyworld Middle East trade show, which was held in Dubai from 05-07 October 2021. To illustrate the potential of this new captive the Spanish company used it to craft an exclusive collection of fragrances that was presented to visitors. In weeks to come, Eurofragance will present these creations to customers around the world who could not make it to Dubai."
"Givaudan's Sericoside, a natural ingredient to regenerate the skin","""When it comes to anti-ageing, consumers want to see a reduction in lines, wrinkles and sagging skin,"" explains Givaudan Active Beauty. Indeed, according to a recent study conducted by the manufacturer of active cosmetic ingredients, 75% of women consider these signs of ageing most responsible for looking older. [1] To address this concern, Givaudan Active Beauty presents Sericoside, a natural active ingredient able to rejuvenate and regenerate the skin, two claims loved by 66% of consumers when asked for expected antiageing benefits of a skincare product. Sericoside is crafted by green fractionation from Terminalia sericea roots, an African Silver tree whose name reveals the activity of the extract, as the adjective sericea, in ancient Latin, means ""silky, smooth as silk"". According to Givaudan, it can offer skin a second youth by ""resetting its cellular memory."" ""Sericoside is a pure molecule obtained from the roots of Terminalia sericea, a tree that grows in the miombo forest of Central and Southern Africa. Through cellular reprogramming, Sericoside acts on multiple aspects of skin regeneration, activating many endogenous resources like antioxidant defences to reduce undereye bag and dark circles while also firming the skin. As an anti-ageing ingredient, Sericoside acts on skin texture and density by reducing wrinkles, fatigue and roughness aspects,"" explained Giada Maramaldi, Personal Care Category Manager at Givaudan Active Beauty. Clinically tested on volunteers, Sericoside demonstrates significant results when formulated at low dosage (0.5%). Several parameters, all indicators of ageing, were evaluated during the study: skin elasticity and firmness were assessed by means of a cutometer on the right cheek at the baseline, at D15 and D30. According to Givaudan, fter only one month of application, skin tonicity had improved by 19.8% and signs of fatigue decreased by 16.5%. A positive effect was also visible on dark circles with 45% of the panel showing a perceptible improvement, along with a reduction in the volume of under-eye bags. These results have inspired Givaudan's Active Beauty team to develop a brand new marketing concept, Dream Contour, an eye-contour cream powered by Sericoside to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and dark circles and restore a youthful look. This 2-in-1 cream is also formulated with Escin, a natural ingredient crafted from horse chestnut, and Eliorelys, designed from cherry tree blossoms, to improve signs of ageing while instantly reducing under-eye puffiness thanks to its smoothing blur effect."

Is ashitaba beauty industry's latest star ingredient?,"Ashitaba is also known as Angelica keiskei, which means ""tomorrow's leaf."" It's a plant that belongs to the carrot family, and is native to Japan — more precisely, to the country's Pacific coast. But while carrots promise a healthy glow and a long-lasting tan, while making skin more supple, ashitaba is known for other virtues. Ashitaba is a perennial plant with divided green leaves and white flowers. Its stems contain edible yellow sap. It is primarily as a food — a superfood, even — that the plant became famous. In Japan, it's consumed as a vegetable, but it is also often found in the form of tea, and used as an ingredient in certain ""health"" drinks. According to Japan's tradition, Ashitaba is said to improve the health of those who consume it, while helping extend their lives by several years. Although these benefits have not been confirmed by scientific studies, the profusion of ashitaba-based foods and products now springing up worldwide testifies to a certain enthusiasm and interest for the plant. In addition, a study published in the scientific journal Nature Communications in 2019 identified DMC (4,4'-dimethoxychalcone) — a flavonoid found in ashitaba — as a natural compound with anti-aging properties. It is precisely these virtues that seem to interest some sections of the beauty industry today. It is mainly in the form of oil that we find this plant, often combined with other natural ingredients, promising an elixir of youth. Ashitaba has recently appeared in the composition of some cosmetic products. Based in France, the cosmetics Japanese-inspired brand Bijin is one of the first to promote this ingredient, which can be found in its ""Concentré Jeunesse Visage"" [Youthful Face Concentrate] from its Secret d'Okinawa range. Here, it is used in the form of an infusion, in association with Gettō — another plant from Japan considered to have anti-aging properties. It promises to deeply nourish and preserve the skin while fighting against skin aging. In a statement from the brand, Bijin explains that ashitaba is renowned for its anti-aging power, naturally reducing cellular decline by decreasing the formation of free radicals. The brand's ""Concentré Jeunesse Visage"" has a 100% plant-based formula and is available for €49 per 50 ml via its e-store."

in-cosmetics Global skips over Barcelona edition and heads to Paris in 2022,"The organiser of the events dedicated to personal care ingredients has announced today that in-cosmetics Global will be held on 5-7 April 2022 in Paris, and that in-cosmetics Asia will take place on 1-3 November 2022 in Bangkok. Furthermore, in-cosmetics Latin America, which was planned to take place in São Paulo, Brazil from 22-23 September 2021, will now take place from 10-11 November. The decision to reschedule the events is due to the ongoing travel restrictions due to the pandemic, explained RX. ""Despite live events now taking place, we have to consider the international nature of in-cosmetics Global. We have seen positive signs over the last few months with successes in the vaccination programme rollout, but new variants have created increased uncertainties and steady progress is not the case everywhere. We have been in continuous contact with both exhibitors and visitors, and it is clear the level of confidence to travel and attend large-scale international B2B exhibitions in the cosmetics industry is not there yet. Our primary aim is to meet the expectations of our exhibitors and visitors, and this we believe will happen in 2022,"" said Roziani Zulkifli, Exhibition Director of in-cosmetics Global, in a statement. Also speaking about the announcement, Sarah Gibson, Exhibition Director of in-cosmetics Asia, said: ""Thailand's COVID cases are on the rise with Bangkok and neighbouring provinces placed in the dark red zone of maximum restrictions to curb the spread of infection. The new delta variant cases are increasing across Asia with widespread travel bans and further tightening of government movement measures. We believe that the most responsible decision at this stage is to allow time for Thailand and the ASEAN region to recover, and when safe, re-unite the Asia cosmetics community in 2022."" ""After monitoring the coronavirus situation in Brazil, we've decided to postpone our Latin America show to November, which will give the country's vaccination programme a further seven weeks to boost immunity. It was a difficult decision to make as we're aware of the event's importance to the region's personal care industry and the demand for face-to-face networking. However, we believe it is the best course of action for all involved to ensure we can deliver a valuable business event to our exhibitors and attendees,"" added Daniel Zanetti, Exhibition Director at in-cosmetics Latin America."
Solvay introduces a comprehensive restorative routine for textured hair,"Solvay has unveiled a complete routine for textured hair, featuring 10 products formulated to help textured hair consumers cleanse, moisturize and style their hair with products made specifically for them. According to Solvay, up to 75% of the world's population has textured hair (40%-50% in the USA, 75% in Latin America, 20% in Europe,90% in Africa, 20% in the South of Asia), and natural hairstyles are increasingly seen as an element of personal identity. Yet, there is still a notable gap in high-end shampoos, conditioners and other hair care products made for these unique hair types. Solvay therefore strove to meet the challenge within the personal care world with ready-to-use formulations designed to help textured hair consumers embrace their natural hair. Acknowledging the many different types of hair was just the first step in creating hair care solutions formulated for textured hair. Then, in partnership with the textured hair stylists and models at Studio Ana'e, in Paris, France,Solvay's scientists were able to evaluate and validate each of their products when used in real-world conditions. ""As curls are becoming a huge part of the hair care and hairstyling market, we are often asked to share our expertise in the field,"" said Aude Livoreil-Djampou, Founder of Studio Ana'e. ""We particularly enjoyed this partnership because the whole Solvay team was totally dedicated to understanding the needs of curly haired women and men. The quality of the products we tested reflects their commitment to provide their clients with a high-level textured hair regimen."" In order to better address consumers expectations, in addition to providing highly specialized benefits for textured hair, Solvay has also developed many of the formulations with natural and eco-friendly ingredients. Solvay's Restorative Textured Hair Routine includes: a ""Pure Clean Shampoo"", a ""Hydration Boost Shampoo"", a ""Cleansing Cream"", a ""Luxurious Moisturizing Conditioner"", a ""Moisture Lock Mask"", and a ""Wake-Up Curls Day Cream"". The other four products in the range will be unveiled soon. To learn more about the restorative textured hair routine Solvay's formulation eBooklet is available online."
Eden Ecosystem presents new plant extraction model,"Premium Beauty News - What does the Eden Ecosystem model consist of? Rémi Pulvérail - It is the very first highly innovative project to include all key elements of the value chain: first, the optimized ultrasound extraction technology, which more efficiently captures what is in the plant, then the integrated farming dimension by means of our association with Cassan - one of the main Provence aromatic plant distilling company - and lastly, the creation and manufacturing of exclusive, original, tailor-made extracts. In short, our project unites the farmers that cultivate the plants, the engineers that develop the extract recipe using our innovative technology, and the plant that manufactures the extract with full control and traceability. This uncompromising project guarantees made-in-France products, short supply chains, and compliance with the circular economy and green chemistry principles. Premium Beauty News - Why partner with farmers? Rémi Pulvérail - We have a partnership with Cassan, a distilling company which manages a family farming property that spreads out across 100 hectares in the Drôme, Vaucluse, and Alpes-de-Haute-Provence regions in southern France. It will help us upgrade the distillation waste generated by Cassan, but also manage exclusive cultures that meet both traceability and circular economy requirements for all customers interested. Co-founder of Eden Ecosystem Cassan boasts farming expertise as regards culture implementation and follow-up. With these exclusive parcels, we are actually considering producing great wines and putting forward the diversity of each region. Just like for wine, lavender, for example, does not provide the same results at all depending on its location, soil, altitude, and variety… So, for example, regarding perfumes, we aim to make people discover the olfactory diversity of these various regions and highlight the added value of all the aromatic plants we have in France – that is what consumers want today. Now, to us, all this involves partnering with farmers and putting forward their production in full transparency. Customers need to be aware of the farming reality. In the long run, we aim to develop new supply chains in these areas because they boast real expertise in perfume plants, and we also intend to exploit parcels on very large surface areas. Premium Beauty News - Why choose the ultrasound technology? Rémi Pulvérail - It was one of the most interesting gentle plant extraction technologies for our business model. We use ultrasounds to optimize the extraction, but also green solvents, exclusively. This technology helps capture plant actives more efficiently. The process involves very low temperatures for a shorter time, so it preserves the plant better. Lastly, ultrasounds help make molecules explode more efficiently, which makes it possible to extract more for a different result from those obtained with standard methods. We mainly work on dry plants: spices, roots, wood… so we can more easily manage the constraints related to harvest periods. Ultimately, by upgrading distillation grains, we carry out a double extraction from the same plant. L'Atelier Français des Matières invested a lot in this technology: 25% of our turnover every year over the past five years with very interesting results validated by Antoine Lie, a Master Perfumer and project partner. Premium Beauty News - Who is the target for these extracts? Rémi Pulvérail - We target all brand types, from major players to small companies in the fields of fine fragrances, cosmetics, aromatherapy and food supplements. We aim to build up strong partnerships with companies willing to put forward all players of the value chain in a fair manner."
Mibelle debuts new moss based ingredient to harmonize the skin's moisture flow,"A few years after the launch of MossCellTec No.1, the Swiss-based supplier of cosmetic ingredient is launching MossCellTec Aloe [1], an unequaled aloe-moss extract sustainably obtained. Derived from aloe-moss (Aloina aloides), a tiny dark green to reddish-brown moss measuring 2 to 5 mm in height and known as ""common aloe-moss"", MossCellTec Aloe improves cell-to-cell communication via connexin channels, optimally evens the moisture distribution in the skin and reduces the volume and depth of wrinkles. Due to the similarity in the appearance of the leaves, aloe-moss was named after the Aloe vera plant. This rare and tiny moss species has a high water retention capacity. Compared to seed plants, mosses do not have roots and water transport systems. Instead, they absorb water directly into their leaves. Mosses can trap excess water and nutrients from the soil and air. In vivo tests have shown that MossCellTec Aloe can reduce signs of skin aging (skin elasticity, wrinkle volume and depth), improve skin hydration and improve moisture homogeneity. MossCellTec Aloe is based on Mibelle Biochemistry's MossCellTec technology which allows for the sustainable large-scale production of the moss extract."

""Solvay's Rheozan BLC belongs to a new generation of biotechnology-based ingredients that can revolutionize the chemical industry, harnessing the power of nature to combine higher performance with more safety and sustainability toward a more circular economy,"" said the company in a release."
"""in-cosmetics Global 2021 will be a hybrid event,"" says Roziani Zulkifli","Premium Beauty News - The next in-cosmetics show will be a hybrid event. Can you tell us more about that? Roziani Zulkifli - We know that nothing beats physical interaction, so, when face to face interactions do take place at the show, it will be the same as always but with the addition of health and safety precautions. This will ensure a safe experience for everyone involved whilst preserving the essence of the renowned event. Firstly, the virtual platform will open on 13 September to allow exhibitors and visitors to begin connecting and scheduling meetings for when they meet in-person in Barcelona from 5-7 October. The true virtual experience will commence post-show on 11 October as the online platform will be open again to allow R&D professionals and suppliers to meet digitally, in case they didn't get the chance to do so in person. In addition, there will also be lots of live and on-demand content in the form of webinars, demos, tours and sessions that will run over the following weeks. On 29 October, we'll wrap up in-cosmetics Global and bid farewell until next year, where we'll reunite the personal care industry once again in Paris! Premium Beauty News - Will all exhibitors participate in both events (in person and digital)? Roziani Zulkifli - Exhibitors will participate in both the virtual and physical events as those that enrolled for the in-person show also receive a virtual listing as part of their stand package. However, as some companies may not be able to make it to Barcelona, we've also provided the option to just attend virtually to ensure they don't miss out on all of the invaluable networking opportunities offered. Premium Beauty News - How both events will be articulated? Roziani Zulkifli - The in-person event will be the primary way to source ingredients, make connections, and generate new business leads. But the virtual event will complement it by allowing visitors to catch up on anything they may have missed at the show and start conversations with exhibitors they didn't have time to meet onsite. Premium Beauty News - Do you already know how many exhibitors will attend this year? Roziani Zulkifli - We currently have 500 exhibitors attending the show. Premium Beauty News - What sanitary measures and restrictions will be implemented during the in-person event in Barcelona? Roziani Zulkifli - The health and safety of visitors, exhibitors and staff remains our top priority, and so we're working closely with local authorities and the Fira Barcelona venue to adopt a robust 'Health & Safety 5-point Strategy' and implement all necessary precautions. The changes at in-cosmetics Global include an exhibition hall capacity of 1 person per 2.5m² and a one-way system to help maintain the government regulations of a minimum 1.5 metre social distancing. There will also be the highest standards of cleaning before, during and after the event, readily available hand sanitisers throughout the venue as well as increased ventilation to improve fresh air circulation. As COVID-19 safety and security requires participation from everyone, all those attending the event will be expected to follow a number of hygiene measures such as wearing face coverings, maintaining physical distancing, and refraining from shaking hands. Exhibitors will also be reviewing the design of their stands to assist with these measures and will be required to clearly display the maximum capacity to prevent overcrowding. Premium Beauty News - Next year the show will be in Paris. Any specific forecasts for this return to a normal (hopefully) show? Roziani Zulkifli - We are very excited for in-cosmetics Global 2022, which will take place in Paris on 5-7 April, but our primary focus at this time is the event taking place this October in Barcelona! For over a year, in-person activity has been put on hold due to the pandemic which has resulted in a string of event cancellations and postponements in all industries across the globe. We are very proud of our transition to virtual events, but it is our physical events that we are renowned for, and their absence has only strengthened our belief in the need for face-to-face events. We're working extremely hard to see the return of in-cosmetics Global in a COVID-19 secure format. The next edition of in-cosmetics Global is due to take place from 5-7 October 2021 in Barcelona, Spain. For more information visit: www.in-cosmetics.com/global/en-gb.html"
Firmenich explores new territories with a sustainable technology,"The Swiss-based manufacturer of perfumes and aromas has patented a new extraction technology that enables the processing of biomass never previously used in the industry for natural ingredients. Named Firgood, this technology uses only the water that is an inherent part of the biomass cells. Once warmed up by electromagnetic vibration, the water carries the odorant components, to yield the final pure extract. According to Firmenich, this technology is the culmination of advances in sustainable extraction and is more environmentally friendly than any other extraction method. Solvent-free, dry biomasses only require water humidification. In addition, the whole extraction process only requires low energy consumption and generates clean wastes that can easily be upcycled. ""This advanced and highly sustainable technology is a revolution for natural ingredients in our industry. It opens new creative territories, unexplored until now,"" said Gilbert Ghostine, CEO of Firmenich. To implement this process, Firmenich has developed a new industrial tool within its centre of excellence for natural ingredients located in Grasse, in the south of France. ""We have successfully scaled-up from lab and pilot plant to two industrial lines, offering production capacity that ranges from hundreds of kilograms to several tons of primary extracts,"" added Boet Brinkgreve, President, Ingredients. The Firgood technology has already led to the addition of three natural extracts to Firmenich's creative palette: a pear extract, a ginger extract and a green bell pepper extract. In the coming months, 10 additional ingredients will be introduced, followed by a rich pipeline of future launches for both perfumery and taste applications. This type of innovation, which is also illustrated by the Symtrap process developed by Symrise, makes it possible to bring previously unseen ingredients into the creative palette of formulators and perfumers, with potential new sensory experiences and cosmetic advances for consumers."
IFF expands olfactory know-how with Science of Wellness programme,"This trend is nothing new, but it got well-established in 2020: scents, which are essential to the public, became a source of wellness and comfort. Like a return to the origins of perfume, in a way, says IFF, based on a survey of 10,000 consumers from 14 different countries. According to the perfume manufacturer, 87% of consumers want fragrances that offer emotional or physical benefits. This search is reflected on the global perfume, wellness, and beauty market. In 2018, according to the Global Wellness Institute, this market reached 4,500 billion dollars, a quarter of which was represented by personal care, beauty, and anti-ageing. A majority of the 10,000 people surveyed by IFF in 2021 said they were keen on aromatherapy, Ayurveda, and Chinese medicine. However, among this group, 67% would like their products to be developed using science. Consumers want wellness and energy on a daily basis thanks to perfumes, which are now viewed as able to create positive emotions. To meet these expectations, IFF asked their experts to set up the Science of Wellness programme. After forty years of research, this tool can now study ""the brain activity related to smells and perfume,"" explains Céline Manetta, PhD in Psychology and Senior Consumer Science Manager at IFF. Initially launched in the 1980s, this programme was used in the 1990s to study the links between smells, colours, and textures. Year after year, IFF completed it with new neurosciences knowledge and methods and the calculation power of Data Science. By combining Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence, and Statistics, Big Data helped significantly increase the number of combinations possible between ingredients to get high-performance synergies on brain perception. Billions of pieces of information were cross-referenced for perfumers to pick up what they need in this database when they receive a new brief, so they get the emotional benefit wanted. By combining science and creativity, the Science of Wellness programme offers ""augmented perfumery for holistic wellness"", says Céline Manetta. For IFF's brand customers, the programme provides more accuracy to awaken the emotions users want. Thanks to an in-house team of over 60 people including PhDs in Psychology, statisticians, researchers, and olfactory experts directly in contact with perfumers, this expert programme helps make progress in terms of formulation and olfactory know-how. It is based on a multifaceted approach structured around three dimensions – emotional, cognitive, and physical – to create perfumed products with beneficial virtues for consumers. As regards emotions, brands can target benefits in terms of happiness, relaxation, or seduction. The cognitive area covers full awareness, attention, self-esteem, and memory. Lastly, physical benefits can include sleep quality and skincare. The Science of Wellness programme offers new formulation possibilities to enhance the creative approach of perfumers. The latter can rely on data based on consumer studies and on the analysis of over 6,000 ingredients, accords, and perfumes. ""This tool is highly inspiring creation-wise"", explains Juliette Karagueuzoglou, perfumer at IFF. ""Since we work closely with this programme's team, we can add the relevant ingredients to our formulas,"" she adds. This AI system offers ""new accords and makes it possible to discover new facets of raw materials"". IFF recently drew inspiration from this programme to convey the notion of youth, romanticism, and happiness required in the brief of Eternity Summer by Calvin Klein. The perfumers chose to work with Rose Essentielle LMR, which creates a sensation of happiness, and relaxing Sambac jasmine from India. This search for wellness and authenticity when buying a fragrance was already visible before the pandemic. This phenomenon obviously grew during this stressful period. (Temporarily?) giving up on seduction, perfumes are now related to the search for meaning. This issue being quite complex, AI efficiently feeds perfumers' creative work and expertise."
"Circalys, a chrono-detox active ingredient inspired by Ayurveda","Modern lifestyles are always more intense and have a real impact on the appearance of the skin. ""Disturbed circadian rhythm, our inside clock, affects most of biological processes, leading to a tired skin and a bad mood,"" explains Greentech. To prevent these negative repercussions, Greentech has created Circalys, an active ingredient titrated in andrographolide, a molecule identified by the group's scientists as able to counteract circadian disruption and revitalize skin. Inspired by Ayurveda, Circalys was developed from Green Chiretta (Andrographis paniculata), a major detoxifying plant in Ayurvedic traditional medicine. According to Greentech, Circalys helps modulate skin rhythms, by restoring a ""young"" invigorating clock gene expression profile in old/tired skin cells and by acting on circadian modulators related to key cellular pathways. ""It extends cell longevity, reduces cell damages, promoting skin revitalization. Circalys also stimulates key signaling pathways connecting skin and brain, also influenced by circadian clock. It boosts oxytocin, endocannabinoid and endorphin signaling pathways to relax and protect skin from modern life impacts."" Greentech has tested the efficacy of the new ingredient on night/shift workers in a double-blind clinical study. According to the company, the use of Circalys during 28 days led to a significant reduction of visible signs of fatigue : eye bags, dark circles and under-eye wrinkles. Volunteers also found their skin more radiant, comfortable and rested. In addition, with the help of three ""scientifically recognized"" psychological tests, Greentech has also shown that the use of Circalys in a cosmetic formula also significantly modulated the impacts of fatigue on mood : boosted feeling of well-being, reduced perceived stress and negative affect («yoga-like» effect). The development of this new active is part of the psychobiological approach implemented by Greentech in connection with the growing expectations of consumers in terms of well-being. ""An increasing number of scientific studies established a bidirectional link between skin/hair aspect or disorders and the psychological state of people. Skin and hair are the most noticeable parts of our body and thus important for self-image and mental health,"" explains the French manufacturer of natural active ingredients. ""Skin has revealed itself to be a complex organ involved in multiple neuro-immuno-endocrine functions, connecting skin and brain, and involved in many skin and hair functions."" Today, four Greentech active ingredients are based on this systemic approach, addressing different skin and hair issues, supported by articles published in international scientific journals: – Circalys, to counteract the impacts on skin and mood of fatigue and modern lifestyles; – Hebelys, to address skin and emotional need of the silver generation woman with Positive Aging. – Expozen, to sooth visible and perceived signs of skin sensitivity. – Arcolys, to restore natural hair colour and boost self-esteem."
"Sustainable beauty: A tailor-made, plant-based approach for tomorrow's cosmetics","The revolution of ""Sustainable beauty"" has become a thriving market and has been booming for the past few years. In 2019, it was estimated at $39 billion and could reach $48 billion by 2024, growing at a rate of 5.7%. [1] For final consumers, however, sustainability applied to the cosmetics sector is sometimes misunderstood. Therefore, it is necessary to define what sustainable beauty means and how key players in the industry are changing their approach. The need for a more sustainable approach shared by the whole cosmetics industry, comes with the necessity for more clarity, in order to give consumers a better understanding of what they will apply on their skin. ""Consumers are looking to make more commitment to sustainability. What do they expect from us? To be more transparent, authentic, and responsible. As consumers also need to feel perfectly safe, they are looking for products with the right balance between nature and technology. This is our responsibility to meet the final consumers' expectations for sustainable beauty and offer clean and safe ingredients while preserving our resources,"" comments Ophélie Bourgon, Marketing Manager Europe and the Americas at Roquette Beauté. At Roquette, sustainable beauty is empowered by more than 85 years of recognized experience in health and nutrition, now applying its expertise to beauty through sustainable, innovative and high performance plant-based raw materials. For consumers, this statement is a guideline, communicating a desire to protect people's skin, which represents a surface of 2 square meters per person, in the most natural way. In China, for example, 64% of females aged 18-49 perceive that naturally derived ingredients are more effective in maintaining skin health. [2] As a global leader in plant-based ingredients, Roquette is committed to provide traceability of raw materials to offer high quality solutions for consumers. For that purpose, Roquette has defined four sustainable development commitments: Innovating, Sourcing, Biorefining and Acting sustainably. The Innovating pillar aims to understand consumers' needs and anticipate customers' expectations. Thanks to a constant drive for innovation and a long-term vision, the group is committed to improving the well-being of millions of people all over the world while taking care of resources and territories. In continuity with this, Roquette has set commitments for a Biorefining pillar, which leads Roquette to improve its energy consumption, by investing in projects like geothermal power and biomass, to be able to offer more environmentally friendly ingredients. Since 2009, Roquette has been a member of the United Nations Global Compact, based on 10 principles about Human Rights, Labor, Environment and Anti-Corruption. This responsibility also applies to Roquette's suppliers, who are asked to sign Roquette's Code of Conduct for Suppliers. This is an approach defined by the Sourcing pillar, to build partnerships with plant breeders and farmers to select and use the most suitable agricultural resources. In line with its pledge to source sustainably, Roquette has joined the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) Platform that supports global and local responsible sourcing and good agricultural practices. Finally, bringing the best to Roquette's consumers also means answering the needs of the company's employees by protecting their social rights and reducing health and safety risks to a minimum, valuing diversity, inclusion and promoting the sharing of best practices in a multicultural network. These commitments, defined by the Acting pillar, are key for Roquette! As a responsible company towards its consumers and final customers, Roquette Beauté has set a series of engagements that place the quality and the performance of their multifunctional solutions for personal care as its highest priority. At Roquette Beauté, 90% of its ingredients are produced in France, with the remaining 10% produced in Europe and 100% are developed in respect of the ISO 16128 norm. Furthermore, its industrial sites are members of SEDEX (Supplier Ethical Data EXchange), an ethical data platform for exchange on responsible and sustainable business practices, based on regular on-site SMETA (Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit) audits. Every year, ECOVADIS evaluates and benchmarks the sustainability performance of Roquette, which is made available on their data exchange platform. Within a sector that is more than ever anticipating the demands of a continually more environmentally friendly industry, using raw materials such as corn, wheat, potatoes and peas coming exclusively from Europe and generating less than 0.5% of waste to produce innovative plant-based ingredients for cosmetics, is one of the best examples of sustainability for Roquette Beauté. Roquette Beauté is committed to its motto ""Sustainable beauty is all about Skin Health and Nutrition"" and being the best partner to people's skin, health and nutrition."
Lubrizol unveils new formulation benefits for Kelco-Care Diutan Gum,"With a similar structure to xanthan gum, Kelco-Care diutan gum is a microbial polysaccharide produced by fermentation. Introduced to the market last year, the ingredient has thickening and suspending capabilities that can impart protection and repair benefits to hair fibres even at low use levels. According to LLS Beauty, these properties make the new ingredient ideally suitable for conditioners, treatments and hair colour where it can be used in a wide range of pH and temperatures. Thanks to its film forming capabilities ""with excellent conditioning benefits"", Kelco-Care diutan gum also ""give a nice, silky sensory experience to the hair with no drag or stickiness,"" claims LLS Beauty. New tests allowed to uncover new benefits of Kelco-Care diutan gum for skin care, sun care and colour cosmetics formulations. According to LLS Beauty, the ingredient provides : – Immediate moisturizing effect that lasts all day long making it a truly multifunctional ingredient for skin care formulations; – Excellent stability at high temperature, maintaining the viscosity of sunscreens during the summer season; – Strong pigment suspension capabilities to meet the growing demand for natural-derived makeup. In addition, Kelco-Care diutan gum is easy to disperse and cold processable in formulations. It is also high efficiency due to high pseudoplasticity with greater low shear rate viscosity (and yield), adds LLS Beauty. ""Our team of researchers and scientists continue to look for new ways to enhance our nature-based ingredients to meet sustainability goals and consumer expectations,"" said Maxime Fougère, Global Marketing Manager, LLS Beauty. ""We're excited to have found new benefits for Kelco-Care diutan gum that meet these needs."""
"Sophim: a virtuous, sustainable squalane derived from olive cultures","If squalene derived from shark liver has almost disappeared from cosmetic formulas, it remains a significant emollient in product compositions. Initially created to provide the industry with this basic ingredient, Sophim soon chose olive, a raw material native of the Mediterranean basin which offers a plant-derived squalene with specificities identical to that of animal origin. ""We started in 1996, but the demand started regularly increasing only about ten years later. Olive squalene has really taken off since then,"" says CEO Alexis Margnat. In 2005, the company made considerable investments to get the production capacities necessary to meet market needs. Later, in 2014, they purchased a plant in Almeria, Spain, to get closer to raw materials. ""We work with waste from the olive oil industry. These by-products derived from olive oil refinement are fatty acids which contain 5% to 10% of squalene,"" explains Alexis Margnat. The Spanish site collects the squalene retrieved from these by-products, and then sends it to France for it to be purified and transformed into squalane. The remainder is also transformed into biodiesel in Spain. ""We valorize the whole raw material. The non-squalene fraction is transformed: 95% of our by-products are mainly valorized into biodiesel we sell to the oil industry. It is a real circular economy,"" adds the CEO. Thanks to both a unique industrial capacity and full integration of the transformation process for a pure, plant-derived, Cosmos-approved ingredient, Sophim has become a major player on the cosmetics market, which is increasingly turned to naturalness. Today, the company boasts almost half the market shares of plant-derived squalane. ""80% of our products are exported, while 20% are sold in France. Europe accounts for 40% of our sales – the rest goes to Asia, the area with the strongest growth for several years, in particular in Japan, China, and Korea,"" says Alexis Margnat. Although it was affected by the slowdown due to the different lockdown periods in 2020, the company chose to continue to operate. And they were right to: they ended the year with a better turnover than in 2019 and achieved a 30% growth during the first quarter 2021. ""We have observed a very strong recovery in France and on the European market,"" says Alexis Margnat, who is considering diversifying activities in 2021 to adapt to new markets."
DNA & Cosmetics to promote the traceability of natural resources,"Initiated by DNA Gensee (a company specializing in the DNA analysis of plants, algae and beehive products), the DNA & Cosmetics consortium aims to provide models to the cosmetics and perfumery sector to ensure the safety of plant raw materials and allow for better control of natural resources, from the plant to the consumer. Using a scientific method based on DNA analysis, the members of the consortium [1] plan to build the first reliable database that will guarantee the botanical authenticity of the plant resources used in their products. The members of this consortium are eager to commit to more secure supplies and controlled exploitation of plant resources used to formulate cosmetic products. The main purpose is to be able, when purchasing natural raw materials, to ensure that brands and their suppliers source the right plant (belonging to the desired botanical family, genus and species). These issues are in line with the growing expectations of consumers in terms of safety, authenticity and transparency. They are also of major importance in connection with the application of the Nagoya protocol. The DNA analysis technology can identify plant species and even varieties with great reliability: this analysis allows us, for example, to distinguish the white lily (Lilium candidum) from the royal white lily (Lilium regale). As a matter of illustration, the consortium has undertaken a scientific work on lavender, an emblematic species in the cosmetics and perfume sectors. According to the consortium founders - both cosmetic groups and ingredient suppliers - this initiative enables companies to act concretely to accelerate the ecological and solidarity transition while contributing to the health of all by guaranteeing the absence of fraud in raw materials."
"""The clean perfumery trend is a growth driver"", Frédéric Braud, Sozio","Premium Beauty News - Sozio has made many announcements since the beginning of the year. Frédéric Braud - Our recent purchases are perfectly in line with our growth strategy, both in terms of geography and market segments. The fact that we purchased Alpine Aromatics in 2011, and then Elias Fragrance in 2015 helped us settle in the USA. In France, after purchasing Sentaromatique in 2012, we were able to really establish ourselves in Grasse and better adapt to the craze for natural and organic perfumes. Also, we purchased two other companies based in Grasse, APF Arômes et Parfums in 2013, and then Fragworld in 2016, which contributed to our growth in Fine Fragrances and strengthened our presence in Asia and the Middle East, where these companies were very well-established. Likewise, we purchased Phoenix Fragrances Ltd. last March, so we now boast a solid base and a production centre in the UK, a very specific perfume market. The company achieves 85% of its turnover on the British market, on the cosmetics and home care segments, where we are very present. Besides, 40% of their perfumes are natural. There is a real strategic complementarity and multiple synergies. As for Scentessence, a Brittany-based company specialized in natural perfumes for detergents in France, this purchase further strengthened our presence on these markets. Premium Beauty News - Botanicals by Sozio helped you diversify your ingredient offering, did it not? Frédéric Braud - We launched this division both as part of our strategy to diversify our product offering and because we wanted to meet new market trends. Over the past 15 years, at least, we have significantly strengthened our presence on the natural perfume segment. Today, natural products account for 30% of our sales in France. We were gradually led to source raw materials with much rigour in terms of traceability and ethics. Our customers benefit from this know-how. Many of our customers used to purchase raw materials from traders with few guarantees as regards sourcing. With Botanicals by Sozio, they take advantage of our own supplier chains and, consequently, of both our fair farmer compensation policy and all the traceability guarantees we implemented. Today, all this is essential, given the strong transparency and ethics expectations. Premium Beauty News - Is that also a way to revive your history? Frédéric Braud - Sozio is a centuries-old company founded in 1758 in Grasse. It was a pioneer in French perfumery, so our launching the Botanicals by Sozio division is also a return to our origins: perfume essences and absolutes. But our history is also that of a company with a family spirit and a long-term perspective. We are craftsmen specialized in perfumes. Our customers get the tailor-made approach and flexibility medium-sized companies can offer. Premium Beauty News - You are doing pretty well after a tough year 2020, are you not? Frédéric Braud - Indeed, we have not really suffered from the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, our turnover rose by 9%, and we increased our sales by 23% in the first quarter 2021, on a like-for-like basis. Our subsidiary in the USA is doing very well. It is very well-established on markets that remained drivers despite the pandemic (industrial detergents and home fragrances). Also, we have achieved significant growths in Asia for several months. Of course, recovery remains fragile in Europe, but we have received many projects for launches scheduled next September and October, so we are optimistic for the second part of the year. The situation is trickier in the Middle East, but it remains a key region for the global perfume market. We will have a stand at BeautyWorld Middle East, next October in Dubai, and at in-Cosmetics Global in Barcelona. We achieved a 50-million-euro turnover in 2020, and with our various purchases, our sales should reach 62 to 65 million euros in 2021. We make 40% of our turnover in the Europe-Middle-East-Africa region, 40% in the Americas, and 20% in Asia. Premium Beauty News - How do you think the market will evolve? Frédéric Braud - Natural perfumes are a growth driver: there is a real craze for these products. Plus, perfumers' palettes were considerably broadened, thanks to natural isolates, which provided alternatives to essential oils. However, naturalness is far from being the only market challenge. Clean Beauty and Clean Perfumery are two other major trends that drive the market growth. Our strategy consists in being as close as possible to these new expectations. Last year, we created our own clean fragrance label based on strict specifications: we removed all molecules suspected of being harmful for human health and the environment. These perfumes are intended for detergents, personal care and cosmetics. They are not 100% natural perfumes: they do contain synthetic materials, but these were chosen because they do not have a negative impact. For our clean range and natural perfumes, we chose a comprehensive transparency policy: we shared all our formulas with our customers, without mentioning the doses, in order to meet brands' complex requirements… The demand for transparency cannot but be taken into account, although perfumes cannot be patented – which explains why manufacturing secrets need to be preserved. Last April, we launched a new tool to calculate the biodegradability of perfumes. Based on the profile of raw materials, we can now calculate a score for each perfume. We have already used this tool within the company to create biodegradable perfumes, and we are now making it available to our customers. Again, to meet this demand, we are going to broaden our Botanicals by Sozio offering and strengthen our supply chain controls with specific contracts with farmers and purchases, or by creating local distillation units, in particular in Indonesia and Madagascar. In addition, we will develop an increasing number of raw materials derived from natural isolates by fermenting or fragmenting essential oils. We are also working on specific innovations: highly-perfumed gels (for air fresheners or wax melters…), a COSMOS-certified natural micro-encapsulation for cosmetics… All this should help us attract new customers!"
"""We want to become a leader in Brazil"", Damien Lamquet, Greentech Brasil","The factory which has just been completed in Diadema, south of the urban area of São Paulo, marks a new start for Greentech Brasil, even though the French manufacturer of plant active ingredients has been based in the country since 2015. ""The initial idea was to explore the Brazilian market and distribute made in France ingredients, but the idea has evolved in the direction of local production,"" explains Damien Lamquet, director of Greentech in Brazil. The project accelerated when Greentech acquired Mapric, a Brazilian supplier of ingredients for the cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and nutraceutical industries, in November 2016. ""Mapric was a distributor, and Greentech a manufacturer that had yet to make a name for itself in the Brazilian market. With this purchase, we have gained in capillarity"", notes the director. ""The time had come for Mapric to finally become Greentech Brasil"", adds Damien Lamquet. With 3,500 m2, of which 600 m2 are fully dedicated to manufacturing, the new plant can produce up to 10 tonnes of active ingredients per day - for comparison, the French plant currently produces up to 12 tonnes per day. Greentech also increased the site's storage and fractionation capacities, which previously occupied a 700 m2 hangar south of São Paulo. Although the factory is already in operation, an official inauguration ceremony is planned for the beginning of the second half of the year, or when it is possible to bring part of the French team to Brazil. Designed to better respond to local demands and strengthen customer service, the Brazilian factory will also enable Greentech to develop new markets. ""The plant has the potential to become our production centre in Latin America, a market still underserved by the company,"" says Damien Lamquet. Currently, Greentech is present on the continent through distributors. ""We want to set up a team to address the demand in Latin America, with a special focus on Peru, Colombia, Chile and Argentina,"" he adds. Greentech Brasil also intends to invest in scientific research and expand its knowledge of the Brazilian biodiversity. ""Brazil is a country with an extremely rich diversity and we still know little about it. Everyone is looking at the Amazon, but we want to investigate other biomes. In Cerrado, for example, we have already developed a sustainable and traceable supply chain,"" says Damien Lamquet. Greentech has invested EUR 1 million to open their new factory. Despite a difficult economic context in Brazil, aggravated by the Covid-19 epidemic, the director of the Brazilian branch says potential return on this investment has been calculated on five to ten years. ""Brazil is a country where one's invests for the long term,"" he emphasizes. Damien Lamquet is confident in Greentech's growth potential in Brazil. ""We want to be number one in botanical technology in Brazil and we are in line with the country's bio-economy development plans. Any kind of investment is stressful, but I used to say that even with the pandemic and despite the pandemic, the time has come for Greentech Brasil."" Along with the inauguration of the factory, Greentech Brasil also launches a new active ingredient: Hidraskin Coco, a 100% green ingredient made from coconut water, vegetable glycerin and propandiol, designed to reduce skin dryness and its effects. Damien Lamquet also reveals that two ingredients from Greentech's portfolio will be produced in Brazil later this year: Dandrilys, an anti-dandruff ingredient, and Aquasilolis, for soaps, shampoos and micellar waters."
Symrise: Three new creations very close to hemp's smell,"As hemp (Cannabis Sativa) satisfies both wellness and naturalness criteria, it has become a flagship cosmetic plant and is now added to an increasing number of consumer goods. A study conducted by Symrise in the USA reveals that for 70% of respondents, beyond its medical and recreational properties, hemp is viewed as a natural, modern (37%) plant with health benefits (38%) and a holistic dimension (30%). ""Today, hemp has a much more positive connotation. Its smell, which was still taboo a few years ago, is now much more acceptable. When a consumer chooses a product based on hemp, the olfactory experience is inherent to the concept,"" explains Fabien Calvet, Sustainability Ambassador and Global Haircare, Skincare & Deodorant Category Leader at Symrise. The study conducted by Symrise showed that for 77% of respondents, it would be definitely acceptable to put forward a cosmetic product with the smell of cannabis. This smell should actually be viewed as natural, which highlights its herbaceous, aromatic, and medicinal qualities, and as being very close to marijuana's smell. To meet this olfactory expectation, Symrise chose to use the capacities of the Vitessence technology. In practice, the idea is to capture the natural smell of a plant or a flower and reproduce it faithfully with a cocktail of molecules composed by the perfumer. ""We use it to recreate natural smells which are hard to obtain with other transformative processes, but also for flowers which cannot be extracted, like lily of the valley, or which can be, but in too small quantities. It is really an authentic reproduction of the smell as it is in nature,"" explains Fabien Calvet. The plant or flower is tightly isolated and unveils its volatile notes for half an hour, so they can be captured on a material. This capture is then analyzed by the laboratory to detect the concentration of all molecules. That is when the perfumer reproduces the natural smell with the palette of ingredients at hand. ""Sometimes, the molecules we find are not available in the perfumer's palette, or they are banned. But the Art of the perfumer consists in finding equivalents,"" adds Fabien Calvet. Whether they are derived from fruit, vegetables, or rare plants, Symrise's Vitessences help combine synthetic and natural materials, but also - thanks to a cost per kilogramme often lower than the absolute or essential oil - solve countless economic equations. Symrise eventually recreated a synthetic essence close to the dry plant with a green, balsamic, earthy, herbaceous, and woody olfactory profile. This hemp Vitessence contains neither tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) nor cannabidiol (CBD). And as ""most customers who buy products based on hemp want natural products,"" Symrise developed a 100% natural version [1] and a Cosmos-Natural-certified one. Created by Symrise's Master Perfumer Dirk Braun, these three hemp Vitessences suit various categories and can be combined with other notes. They can be added to face care, body care, or hair care formulas, but also home products and Fine Fragrances."
"Seppic launches Lumipod, a natural active ingredient for tan boosting","For a nice glow without sun exposure, Wesource, Seppic's brand for cosmetic active ingredients, has developed Lumipod, a melanin activator from natural origin. This new tan booster stimulates melanin synthesis and its transfer from melanocytes to keratinocytes, without UV. Lumipod is an esterified Aminovector. It is a defined molecule, 100% from natural origin, Cosmos approved, with stable and reproducible composition and strong performance. In vivo tests have shown that Lumipod at 1% provides a better efficacy than acetyl tyrosine (market reference), with significantly visible results from 4 days (6% of tanning variation measured by ITA - Individual Typology Angle - on volunteers) and long-lasting effect (15% of variation maintained 15 days after the last product application). ""This new active ingredient is a nice example of innovation that illustrates Seppic expertise and ability to answer consumers' need for naturality and efficacy. Seppic teams design, develop and create ingredients with the highest respect for people and the environment, advancing the science of ingredients for all,"" said Anne-Sophie Dutailly, Wesource marketing product manager."
Givaudan Active Beauty bets on A.I. and epigenetics for skin radiance,"Created from Haberlea rhodopensis also known as the resurrection plant, Chronoglow is a natural skin care active ingredient designed to reverse the effects of ageing and improve skin radiance. ""Haberlea rhodopensis is an ice-age plant that has survived extreme climate conditions thanks to its unique epigenetic mechanisms of cellular survival. We are now able to mimic and reproduce what the plant does in its own cells in the skin. Chronoglow is therefore a 100% natural & sustainable powerful botanical ingredient, with exclusive benefits of well-ageing and radiance,"" said Mathias Fleury, Category Manager Active Beauty at Givaudan. According to Givaudan, Chronoglow rejuvenates the skin at different cellular levels, from epigenetics to proteins expression, and protects skin cells from senescence and oxidation, therefore reversing skin ageing to take back youth, but also enhancing skin firmness and radiance. To better represent the clinical results and demonstrate the visual benefits of their new active ingredient, the company's researchers have used Artificial Intelligence and were able to represent the how it impacted the ""three dimensions of glow"" (i.e. elasticity, luminosity and radiance) on the face: – Elasticity. After two weeks of use, Chronoglow improved skin elasticity by up to 8.9% (more than three times better than the placebo). This positive impact on the skin elasticity is increasing during the whole duration of the clinical test, with an increase up to 15.3% after two months. – Luminosity. After four weeks of use, this factor improved by up to 3.8% and up to 6.4% after two months (almost two times better than the placebo). – Radiance. After two weeks of use, radiance was improved by up to 6.1% (more than four times better than the placebo) and up to 12.5% after two months. According to Givaudan, skin ageing is a major priority for consumers, who are looking for a smooth bright skin. According to the company, 80% of consumers globally said they would be upset to look older than their actual age [1]. ""A radiant complexion is associated with living a healthy and balanced lifestyle. This is why the consumers' desire to reveal the natural luminosity and maintain the firmness of their skin by using sustainable and botanical solutions is important,"" explains Givaudan Active Beauty in a statement. To inspire beauty brands, Givaudan's formulation experts have used Chronoglow to create a glowing veil with skin regeneration benefits. Dubbed Eau de Radiance, the skin care liquid needs to be applied on the skin. According to the company, a few drops will help ""rejuvenate and illuminate"" skin tone. ""Also powered by Ocâline XP and Sophogreen plus, Eau de Radiance will soothe the skin, and offer a second skin protection thanks to Sens'Hyal powder,"" added Givaudan."
Clariant launches new natural active ingredient to take on senescence,"Celyscence, Clariant Active Ingredients and Biospectrum research's latest active ingredient, has been designed to prevent the decline in skin function and promote healthy aging skin. The extract draws on the therapeutic properties of milk thistle (Silybum marianum), using the flowers to achieve particularly wide activity in targeting and counteracting cellular senescence, a major contributor to the skin aging process. ""Senescent fibroblasts can trigger an unhealthy state of the skin at any age,"" explains Clariant. Indeed, chronological aging is associated with the accumulation of senescent fibroblasts and is exacerbated by the impact of regular exterior stressors like pollution and UV light. These fibroblasts alter and generate damage more quickly than their healthy counterparts. They are highly resistant to apoptosis (cell death), they impair biological regenerative and repair functions, and even secrete molecules that damage surrounding cells. This undermines the ability to maintain a healthy skin structure, causing a long list of age-related disorders, including dull, dehydrated skin, and loss of skin firmness from decreased collagen production. ""Delaying the formation of senescent cells is key to maintaining healthy skin,"" says Alexandre Lapeyre, Global Head of Marketing and Business Development, Clariant Active Ingredients. According to Clariant, Celyscence is proven in vitro to demonstrate a unique combination of senolytic and senomorphic effects: pushing senescent cells to apoptosis (senolytic effect) to maximize their elimination and prevent them from irreversibly inducing damage; and alleviating their side effects (senomorphic effect) by downregulating their secretion of molecules that cause additional harm. Further experimental evaluations also show the ability of Celyscence to even reprogram senescent cells and reverse their loss of functionality. For example, contributing to the return of a healthy metabolism by restoring functions like collagen production. ""Celyscence reinstates the crucial ability of dermal fibroblasts to produce collagen, which shows its ability to reprogram senescent cells. This ultimately ensures aged tissue repair and remodeling efficacy,"" says the manufacturer of cosmetic active ingredients. In addition, the potential of Celyscence has been assessed under real-life conditions. In-vivo testing focused on the lower face, throat and décolleté area, one of the less explored areas for skin care and generally the most neglected by consumers, to determine its suitability for mature skin care, healthy aging products and neck firming creams. A volunteer group of 30 women aged between 50 and 60, all presenting visible wrinkles on the neck and the décolleté, were enrolled. For 56 days, one half of the panel applied a product containing 3% Celyscence on the throat and chest, and the other half a placebo product. Clinical measurements were done after 14, 28 and 56 days. Twice daily for 14 days, all participants also applied either a cream containing 3% Celyscence or a placebo cream on one half of the face to enable specific and quick face observation. The evaluation took place in fall. According to Clariant, the ability of Celyscence to successfully hydrate skin, increase brightness and radiance, re-firm the chest and neck, address issues with sagging skin and redefine features, was confirmed. Celyscence is shown to support healthy skin by hydrating it. The skin hydration level on the décolleté, particularly susceptible to seasonal stresses, increased by 8.6% after 14 days and by 14% after 56 days of using Celyscence. In the placebo group, the skin hydration decreased by 12.6%, as was to be expected during fall season. After only 14 days, Celyscence significantly increased chest brightness, producing a more luminous and even appearance. The effect was even more marked after 28 days and 56 days, where the chest looks more radiant. There was a rapid decrease of melanin content on facial skin, decreasing by more than 5% after only 14 days. As a result, the face has a brighter and more luminous complexion. In a self-evaluation after 28 days and 56 days, 81% of volunteers thought their skin looked healthy. Volunteers agreed that Celyscence cream made the skin on their chest firmer and brighter. A visual evaluation showed that the throat is visibly firmer and the facial contours are remodeled. ""Novel active ingredient Celyscence has strong capabilities to target and selectively clear out senescent cells, to successfully mitigate the impacts of senescence and repair damaged cells,"" concludes Alexandre Lapeyre."
BASF taps into the emotional skincare trend with an algal extract,"BASF's new skin care ingredient is based on sacran, a natural giant molecular polysaccharide extracted from Aphanothece sacrum, an algae living in clear spring waters in Japan. Sacran has long been known for its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. In order to take advantage of these exceptional properties and harness its potential, sacran has been integrated into a MicroPatch, consisting of the natural bio-polysaccharides pullulan, alginate, and hyaluronic acid, to form Sacred Patch. According to BASF, the new ingredient works in three ways: it offers an instantly perceptible uplift in mood once applied to the skin, helps to soothe sensitive skin, and provides strong moisturization properties. According to ISO 16128, Sacred Patch is 99.2% of natural origin. BASF scientists have discovered that the polysaccharide helps to stimulate the release of oxytocin, a neuropeptide and wellness mediator. The new active ingredient has been shown ex vivo to help stimulate the release of oxytocin in human skin explants by as much as 40%. Comprehensive in vivo testing confirmed that the molecular patch had a positive emotional effect immediately after application: 93% of the volunteers associated the use of Sacred Patch with tenderness, 90% with joy and happiness, and 61% with desire. One of the causes of skin sensitivity is an overreaction to external stimuli such as irritants or microorganisms. It can be exacerbated if unwanted invaders manage to penetrate the skin. Once inside, the irritants cause the epidermal cells to produce inflammatory messengers such as interleukin IL-8. In an in vitro test conducted on human keratinocytes infected by Staphylococcus aureus, Sacred Patch was shown to help significantly reduce inflammation by 93% compared to an untreated control. The active thus demonstrably helps to comfort irritated skin. Disruptions within the skin barrier can lead to dehydration, contributing to a variety of unwanted skin conditions including discomfort, fine lines and wrinkles, and dull, flaky skin. To fight this phenomenon, BASF's MicroPatch product forms a protective, comforting mesh on the surface of sensitive skin to prevent water evaporation. Furthermore, thanks to Sacran water-attracting properties, Sacred Patch helps to increase the skin's natural water retention capacity, keeping it hydrated. Tested ex vivo on human skin biopsies, Sacred Patch has been proven to offer immediate moisturization of the upper layers of the epidermis, lasting until at least 6 hours after application. Clinical tests confirmed this result: study participants rated the moisturizing and soothing effect of an emulsion containing Sacred Patch at 2% with a score of at least four out of five after eight hours and 14 days of application. The patch technology is a result of BASF's dual expertise in natural macromolecules and the controlled release of active ingredients. It forms the basis for a range of products in the company's active ingredients portfolio, including PatcH2O that offers immediate and long-lasting hydration for skin scalp, MicroPatch Caffeine that helps to improve cellulite and decrease dark circles under the eyes, and the moisturizing MicroPatch Serine. BASF plans to further expand its product range based on the MicroPatch technology in the future."
Gattefossé launches EleVastin to fight gravity-induced skin sagging,"Over time, gravity relentlessly takes its toll on the skin, with sagging skin being one of the most common manifestations of ageing. However, according to Gattefossé, gravity's side effects on the skin might be prevented. The Lyon-headquartered company has designed EleVastin [1], a targeted solution to fight gravity-induced skin sagging. According to Gattefossé, the new ingredient boosts key proteins involved in the synthesis and maintenance of functional elastic fibers: elastin, fibrillin-1 and fibulin-5. It also protects elastic fibers against their degradation by elastases. ""Through this mechanism of action, it ensures an increase of the density of elastic fibers coupled with an augmented skin elasticity. These last outcomes have been obtained using an advanced spheroid model developed in our cell culture laboratory,"" explains the company in a statement. The efficacy of EleVastin has been assessed ex-vivo using a model of 3D dermal microtissue free from any exogenous matrix developed in partnership with BioMeca. The ingredient was also tested in vivo at a concentration of 1% only, on 37 volunteers using a novel and original method specifically developed in-house. According to Gattefossé, it proved its capacity to reduce drooping of the lower face. ""Skin elasticity is significantly improved versus placebo. Facial contours are better defined, and deep vertical wrinkles are significantly reduced."" ""The clear reproducibility of the results obtained with EleVastin on different types of skin models is a true assurance of the ingredient's efficacy,"" explains Laurie Canel, Product Marketing Leader - Personal Care Actives. The ingredient is extracted from the leafy stems of the Murraya koenigii tree, which are manually harvested from fertilizer-free plots in the preserved environment of La Reunion island. The plant has been used for hundreds of years in ayurvedic medicine and in cuisine. A rich pool of synergistic phytomolecules is obtained using an innovative blend of solvents from plant origin and gentle extraction process. This results in a 100% natural origin content according to the norm ISO 16128 and a COSMOS approved ingredient. ""The phytochemical content of Murraya koenigii is both very rich and well described, which has made it possible to adopt a methodical research strategy for plant extraction. By adjusting the polarity of the solvents, we have been able to target more specifically certain molecular families such as flavonoids, phenolic acids or alkaloids. In parallel, in our laboratories, and also in partnership with experts in proteomics and biomechanics, we have developed innovative in vitro evaluation models. They enabled us to achieve a very comprehensive demonstration of the biological efficacy,"" says Boris Vogelgesang, R&D Director Cosmetic Actives."

Furthermore, according to Seppic, Adipoless Eco maintains the silhouette and prevents the formation of new fat by regulating angiogenesis. Wesource has thus found in organic quinoa a double efficiency ally for the contour of the silhouette and the eyes."
Ashland launches new nature-derived styling polymer based on cassia seeds,"As consumers continue to demand natural ingredients in their beauty products, hair styling formulators seek ingredients derived from nature that could help them to address this trend. In styling, natural solutions can be challenging as they often do not provide the performance of their synthetic counterparts. To solve the equation, Ashland has bet on cassia seeds that are grown wild and naturally harvested in India. This natural material has been used in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine for over four thousand years.

Fragrances: Mane reinvents enfleurage to reveal new facets of floral essences,"Dubbed E-Pure Jungle Essence, Mane's new range of floral extracts is obtained from a new and greener extraction method of fresh flowers. Dedicated to flowers that are too delicate to be transported, or to preserve all their facets during traditional treatments, the new technique is based on the principle of maceration in a fatty substance specific to the old enfleurage method, which has fallen into disuse due to its cost and low yields. To create the E-Pure Jungle Essence, the Mane teams let fresh flowers infuse in a neutral vegetable oil until saturation. Then, the olfactory components of the E-Oil thus obtained are extracted by supercritical fluid to obtain an essence offering ""a perfect balance between top and heart notes"". This reinvented enfleurage only requires simple and relatively light equipment, easy to use next to the flower fields, for optimal freshness. The ""enfleurage"" step is performed with simple and light equipment using only natural vegetable oil a natural solvent to extract the aromatic molecules. This maceration process has a low energy consumption. The supercritical fluid extraction step that follows uses CO2, which collected from the outside air and returned to its gas form at the end of the process. The E-Pure Jungle Essence range obtained from this process are natural aromatic extracts, as defined by the ISO 9235 standard. Furthermore, they can be used in formulations with the organic COSMOS label, which is not the case for absolutes extracted with the use of petrochemical solvents, therefore opening up new creative perspectives for organic perfumes. ""E-Pure Jungle Essence extracts highlight new floral facets, revealing unique olfactive opportunities. This environmentally friendly technique honours Nature's beauty and refinement,"" says Mane in a statement. According to Mane, E-Pure Jungle Essence extracts exhibit an extraordinary olfactive rendering. They unveil a flower's natural and original note without the typical green and fatty undertones that are usually captured when using petrochemical solvents. Extracted at low temperature, the most delicate facets are preserved. E-Pure Jungle Essence extracts thus contain the most volatile molecules that reveal the flower's freshness and the emotion it conveys. The debut E-Pure Jungle Essence range features three floral extracts: Red Champaca, Jasmine Grandiflorum and Jasmin Sambac. The Red Champaca E-Pure Jungle Essence offers an orange blossom scent, honeyed and indolent with a jasmine facet. It has a transparent, light yellow colour, a notable cosmetic advantage compared to the vivid blood red colour of the Red Champaca absolute, which is therefore difficult to integrate into a formula. The Jasmine Grandiflorum E-Pure Jungle Essence offers a very present indolent facet, but unlike an absolute, has less animality. The Sambac E-Pure Jasmine Jungle Essence makes us rediscover the flower in its natural state: it is much more jasmine, more orange blossom and, once again, much less animal than the absolute. According to Mane, this Sambac is airy, less indolent, less pharmaceutical, it brings an almost virginal femininity, a less heady seduction. ""Of course, the E-Pure Jungle Essence extracts are green ingredients, obtained without petrochemical solvents, at a very low environmental cost, but they are also extremely close to the flower's natural scent. Compared to absolutes, their notes are less fatty, less vegetal, the quality of the extracts is exceptional, it is the flower exactly as we know it in nature"", comments Serge Majoullier, senior perfumer at Mane, who closely participated in the development of the new process."
Berkem expands its range of floral waters,"The plant extraction [1] subsidiary of the Berkem Group aims to address the growing demand for natural ingredients and botanical extracts in the cosmetics industry. ""As part of what some see as a valuable marketing approach, more and more professionals in the cosmetic industry are introducing floral water into the composition of their products, sometimes even replacing pure water with floral water,"" explains Berken SAS in a statement. Used for their fragrant properties and active ingredients, floral waters (also called herbal distillates or hydrolates) are recognised for their purifying, anti-inflammatory, regenerative, antiseptic, antioxidant and sebum control virtues. Extracted by distillation and comprising aromatic molecules, they constitute real ""active waters"" for formulas. Berkem SAS therefore added four new products to its floral water line: bamboo, peppermint, linden and everlast flower. They add up to the other floral waters already marketed by the company: Damask rose, orange blossom, cornflower, witch hazel, jasmine, lavender, grapefruit, grape, green tea, lemon balm, lemon and roman chamomile.

"With MoodScentz, Givaudan carries on exploring positive emotions","In the wake of the launch of VivaScentz this summer, Givaudan continues their exploration of the links between perfumes and emotions with the launch of MoodScentz, a fragrance technologies platform intended to guide the group's perfumers and creative teams in crafting mood enhancing fragrances. MoodScentz was launched with the aim to explore the potential of fragrances in increasing emotional wellbeing. Since then, it has significantly evolved under Givaudan's Scentz platform as the latest neuroscience techniques allowed the company to better understand the underlying mechanisms that take place in the human brain in the presence of odours. Thus, going beyond the basic aromatherapy approach, it has been possible to develop fragrance design guidelines to create perfumes with scientifically proven mood enhancing benefits. Mixing blend psychological and neuroscientific measurement techniques with perfumery expertise, the MoodScentz patented technologies form a set of fragrance creation guidelines focusing on three mood effects: ""Relaxing"" (bringing peace of mind and serenity), ""Invigorating"" (making consumers feel uplifted and energised), and ""Happy"" (making consumers feel positive and delighted). While several studies have highlighted the role of scents in many emotions, the development of neurosciences and of new analytical methods now allow to scientifically demonstrate the emotional effects of specific scents. For instance, Givaudan scientists have been able to translate the connection between scents and sentiments thanks to the use of the art multi-dimensional statistical techniques. ""To further measure the consumers' response to different fragrances, our researchers have developed and used Mood Portraits to uncover deeper links between fragrance and emotion through images. This innovative technique involves asking volunteers to select the visuals that represent emotions evoked by a fragrance, avoiding the use of words - eliciting a more spontaneous and discriminatory response,"" details Givaudan in a statement. While the threefold health, economic and ecological crisis that we are experiencing is more conducive to anxiety than to the feeling often associated with happiness, the demand for more well-being is skyrocketing and fragrance and beauty manufacturers are trying, in their own way, to provide news answers."

Givaudan: A marine ingredient to correct dark spots on all skin complexions,"Created from Himanthalia elongata, a brown macro-alga sourced in Brittany, France, B-Lightyl addresses hyperpigmentation disorders in a preventive and curative way. The extract re-establishes the communication between fibroblasts and melanocytes, thereby reverting pigmentation disorders. According to Givaudan Active Beauty this natural ingredient is ""the first gentle and powerful universal dark spot eraser crafted by Marine Biotechnology."" ""On a daily basis, environmental stress such as UV exposure and pollution as well as chronological ageing generate a loss of control in the pigmentation process, which ends up in the appearance of brown and dark spots on the surface of the skin,"" explains Givaudan Active Beauty. Hyperpigmentation, dark spots and brownish marks are therefore commonly found on sun-exposed areas of the body, face, hands and chest. As they are considering as ""betraying one's age"", these problems appear as a major concern among global urban consumers. According to Givaudan, over 70% of consumers worldwide are concerned. In parallel, shifting consumer preference toward natural and organic products is also expected to impact the category. According to a recent global online consumer study by Givaudan Active Beauty, algae extract is perceived as one of the most effective ingredients, with 45% of the Chinese beauty care users choosing it to reduce hyper pigmented spots. With B-Lightyl, Givaudan's Marine Biotechnology and skin experts intend to build on consumers' strong interest in clean and safe ingredients. Himanthalia elongata is a macro-algae, which is rich in marine polyphenols, and more specifically phlorotannins. ""We discovered that these powerful marine molecules can reactivate the expression of SDF-1, a key target in hyperpigmentation disorders. It makes this alga one of the most sustainable resources to develop a cosmetic ingredient able to gain control of the skin pigmentation process,"" says Anne Humeau, Marine Biotechnology Manager at Givaudan Active Beauty. To evaluate the consumers' benefits of B-Lightyl against dark spots and pigmentation disorders, three clinical tests were conducted in double blind versus placebo, on more than 100 volunteers from various ethnic skin types (Caucasian, Asian and African). According to Givaudan Active Beauty, B-Lightyl induces a significant decrease of the melanin content in the dark spots of Caucasian volunteers (down to -12.6% in one month, more than twice better than placebo), a significant reduction of the number of visible spots on Asian skin (-156% in one month) and a significant decline of the melanin content in hyperpigmentation spots (-327% in 2 months) on African skin. As an example of the potential of B-Lightyl, Givaudan Active Beauty formulated a skin complexion boosting essence called S3D Oceanist. The formula combines B-Lightyl together with radiance booster, Eutectys Sea Fennel, and a water rich in sea minerals sourced from Brittany (Eau de Source Marine). ""Its 'fat water' texture (a 2020 skincare trend) and its delicate smell makes S3D Oceanist the perfect beauty product to smooth the skin, erase dark spots and even out complexion,"" claims Givaudan."

In formulation, it immediately stabilises the oil-water interface but also deploys in the aqueous and oil phases to both bring support to the emulsion and give a recognisable sensory impact,"" said Vincent Hubiche, Global Applications Manager at Gattefossé. In order to assess the performances of Emulium Dolcea MB, Gattefossé has formulated many different kinds of products, from light fluid lotion to high oil-content rich butter, in conditions known to challenge stability. ""The textures obtained are not only robust, they also surprise by their extreme softness and by a moisturizing capacity that is immediately perceptible to the user,"" highlighted Flora Bollon, Product Leader at Gattefossé. COSMOS approved, Emulium Dolcea MB can be used in organically certified, vegan and readily biodegradable formulations. ""In cosmetics, we all know that naturalness and biodegradability are no longer just a trend, but a matter of responsibility. However, formulating fully natural emulsions is not that simple. Emulium Dolcea MB has been developed to make formulation of natural cosmetics effortless, with a composition carefully chosen to contribute towards biodegradability,"" she added. Gattefossé's Emulium Dolcea MB has been awarded bronze, ex-aequo with Clariant's Velsan Flex, at the in-cosmetics Global Awards in the Best Functional Ingredient category, for its ability to create a wider range of textures, from fluid serum to thick butter in a wide range of applications, such as skincare, suncare, make up and haircare."
Symrise plants garden in perfumer's palette,"The SymTrap technology holds its promises. After creating the first passionfruit note (maracuja), it has just given birth to new original extractions. Derived from the synergy between the Food and Fine Fragrance Symrise Divisions, this environmentally friendly creation is based on upcycled food by-products, which means the latter are valorised. For these new creations, Symrise selected vegetables from organic cultures in France, Germany, and Belgium used by the Dianafood plant, a recent Brittany-based purchase. The vegetables are grounded, cut, and then heated to be used as food ingredients. The SymTrap technology captures the odorous molecules in steam and residual waters, concentrates them, and then removes water to inject alcohol. The highly concentrated vegetable alcoholate is a clean ingredient, since it results from waste recycling requiring neither heat nor chemicals. Symrise has managed to develop ""old"" vegetable SymTraps with asparaguses, artichokes, onions, leeks, and cauliflower – a new playground for perfumers. These real new materials, whose olfactory result is as close to the natural smell as possible, also provide certain compositions with a new texture or give more classic ingredients a new dimension, working on different aspects. ""As perfumers, we work with an evolutionary palette. We keep looking for new creations with no prejudice about the smells. It is a real milestone for us to get five new materials in our palette,"" explains Alexandra Carlin, perfumer at Symrise. To illustrate the creative potential of these five new ingredients, Symrise perfumers shaped them and integrated them in original compositions. For example, Alexandra Carlin used artichoke from the Pyrenees to create a fern which enhances the choke, coumarin, tender and green accents of the vegetable. As for Aliénor Massenet, she worked with a white asparagus from Germany. She highlighted its green, crunchy qualities in a thrush note. Similarly to galbanum, asparagus exacerbates the herbaceous undertones of the flower, while offering iridescent, powdery, cereal facets. Leslie Gautier played with leek tones to enhance the saline, mineral dimensions of grey amber. The rather dense formula is endowed with the ""violet leaf"" greenness of this vegetable. Cauliflower is also a real surprise: its unctuous texture and roasted tones were staged by Aliénor Massenet in a sweet, truly vanillin, pyrazine, ethyl-maltol-like fragrance with a pop-corn effect. The ""texture"" aspect of this new ingredient is a stimulating advantage for perfumers. Lastly, onion's sulphur notes were subverted by perfumer Alexandra Carlin to work on a spicy, woody perfume. She highlighted its skin, sensual characteristics, which she melted into the creamy, milky notes of sandalwood, ""loosening it up"". This small revolution paves the way for new olfactory territories. And it has only just started, since Symrise is now working on other ingredients, like carrot in France and cashew nut in Brazil. Will brands highlight the presence of these new ingredients in their perfumes? Will this new palette be rather used to play with texture and undertones, without explicitly indicating it? The current craze for natural, organic, sustainable products cannot but play in favour of this innovation."
SYN-GLOW: A glow-boosting peptide can bring a sun-kissed holiday glow all year,"Beauty trends are constantly evolving, and what's in-demand one moment may be a thing of the past the next. But one beauty concept that has stood the test of time is the fresh-from-holiday complexion: that bronze, sun-kissed skin tone that seems to radiate from the inside. Even more than a desirable color, this skin tone also seems to evoke a feeling that most would agree to be beneficial year-round, not just during the summer holidays. Recent consumer research suggests that when it comes to the face, beauty standards are moving away from a deep, dark tan and towards a more natural-looking glow that evokes healthfulness. In a 2017/2018 study, 45% of respondents reported wanting ""some tan"" in order to look healthy and not too pale. [1] This sentiment is reflected across all age groups but resonates particularly with those under 55: in this category, over 60% reported wanting ""some tan"" in order to look healthy and good. [2] The idea of having ""some tan"" is increasingly becoming associated with the concept of ""glowing"" skin, according to DSM's Consumer Insights Hub, which captured these consumer statements: ""I think that glowing skin means your skin has healthy color and shine, and it's free of blemishes or any other issues. It's just like looking sun-kissed but not sun damaged."" - Michelle, age 29. ""To me glowing skin is synonymous with health, the skin looks fresh and alive, not covered in makeup, not pale and pallid, good color, good tone and not spotty."" - Stephanie, age 49. Even more than a concept, this idea of ""glowing skin"" is beginning to be reflected and demanded in the market. For example, product launches for face and neck care products with ""glow"" in the name doubled in the US and Europe from 2017 to 2018 [3]. And in 2019, the social media hashtag #glowingskin was used more than 3.5 million times [4]. Further leveraging its dedicated Consumer Insights Hub, paired with a global survey of over 6,000 respondents, DSM has been engaging with consumers to better understand the forces behind this trend. The findings and consumer sentiments indicate that having a natural glow triggers an emotional response that boosts youthfulness and confidence. ""I definitely think having a tan makes me feel and look younger and more confident."" - Staci, age 35. What's more, consumers who have a natural glow or tan feel a sense of empowerment and are even changing some of their beauty habits, moving away from make-up and artificial tanners. "" . . . When I'm more tanned I probably do wear less make up because I feel a bit more confident in my skin tone."" - Kirsten, age 34 It's no surprise then that consumers also say that they'd like to have this ""sun-kissed"" glow all year round – not just after a summer holiday -. The quick fixes currently on the market - self-tanners and various make-up products - often generate mixed reviews. The search for a year-round healthy glow has also gained further momentum amid the events of 2020, when the opportunity to develop a sun-kissed skin tone from a much-anticipated holiday was forfeited by many consumers. This unexpected experience further revealed a gap in the market - but also an opportunity for products that can deliver an iconic, natural-looking and glowing complexion and compliment a wide range of skin tones. As one of the leading companies in rational-design-inspired peptides for skincare applications, DSM is working to meet this opportunity with a glow-boosting pentapeptide. SYN-GLOW™ works with skin to reveal its natural, sun-kissed tone and, thanks to its unique mode of action, it can also strengthen skin defences from within. It is clinically proven that SYN-GLOW™ promotes a visible healthy glow in just five days, with long-lasting results and a natural personalized effect. In an in vivo study with 29 volunteers applying 3% SYN-GLOW™, a natural, healthy glow was visible in just five days and lasted up to two weeks. In addition to encouraging results, participant feedback was overwhelmingly positive: 100% noticed their skin looking fresher and more revitalized; over 90% noticed skin looking less dull and tired; over 80% noticed a facial healthy glow; and over 80% would use the product again. Beyond a desirable healthy glow, synthetic peptides can also appeal to modern, engaged consumers who are paying close attention to ingredients – including how they're made and where they come from. Synthetic peptides can meet the demand for vegan and clean, sustainable and environmentally- friendly cosmetic alternatives that are backed by concrete scientific evidence. Most consumers would agree that everyday life, especially these days, can leave us feeling stressed and tired – and it can show on our faces with dull-looking skin. Having the right tools to develop that sun-kissed, back-from-holiday glow on the outside helps consumers to feel more youthful and confident on the inside. DSM'S range of ready-to-use peptide formulations can fulfill the opportunity to help people achieve - and maintain - a natural, healthy glow all year round, without ever leaving home."
DSM sets new standards with its microbiome-friendly PDO,"Earlier this year, DSM and METEX NØØVISTA, the industrial subsidiary of METABOLIC EXPLORER, a biological chemistry company that develops and industrializes competitive and sustainable fermentation processes, announced an exclusive, global strategic collaboration to deliver the first European-made cosmetic PDO to the market. TILAMAR® PDO with NØØVISTA™ is a multifunctional ingredient suitable for all cosmetic applications. It is produced at METEX NØØVISTA's new, state-of-the-art production site in Carling Saint Avold, France and its benefits and performance as a sensory enhancer, solvent, humectant and preservative booster are proven in tests. An imbalanced skin microbiome can lead to conditions such as acne, atopic dermatitis (eczema), dry skin and dandruff. As the use of cosmetics has been shown to alter microbial composition and dynamics1, 2*, it is important to minimize the negative impact products exert on the skin microbiome, while also making sure that they comply with industry safety standards on microbiology. In a test performed by MyMicrobiome, an independent control body that checks products for their impact on the skin's microbiome, TILAMAR® PDO with NØØVISTA™, which has a proven preservative boosting effect, was shown to respect the balance of the skin microbiome. Specifically, when tested at 2% in-vitro, the results confirmed that TILAMAR ® PDO with NØØVISTA™ has a minimal impact on the diversity of the skin microbiome, respects its sensitive balance and has a negligible influence on the growth or number of different key organisms. These results have earned it a positive 1.2 ranking. ""We believe research into the skin microbiome has the potential to revolutionize how we approach skin care and possibly hair care"" said Bruno Trinquart, Head of Global Marketing Technical and Performance Ingredients, DSM Personal Care & Aroma. ""Today, we see a growing market need – both among our customers and consumers for microbiome-friendly products and we are delighted our product is not only sustainable and high-performing, but also microbiome-friendly .""

Givaudan addresses demand for natural make-up with a botanical red colour,"Givaudan Active Beauty's New Red 1805 [1] aims to offer a sustainable alternative to synthetic red pigments in make-up products, while creating new possibilities to answer the growing demand for a more natural and cleaner beauty. Extracted from the Chinese red radish (Raphanus Sativus L.), whose roots are naturally rich in coloured metabolites named anthocyanins, New Red 1805 has been crafted for natural makeup designers and especially for lipsticks creators looking for high content of natural-origin ingredients without compromising performance on shade, intensity and stability. ""Most of the existing colour formulae rely on synthetic pigments. Crafted by Green fractionation, New Red 1805 enables brands to bring a premium vegan, cruelty-free and performant innovation in the most iconic category of colour cosmetics: the red lipstick. With a 100% natural origin, it doesn't interfere with performance,"" said Yohan Rolland, Global Category Manager at Givaudan Active Beauty. Indeed, according to Givaudan, New Red 1805 delivers a better chroma C and a better coverage (Contrast Ratio) in comparison to synthetic benchmark red pigment in products designed for lips. In recent years, several brands - such as All Tigers, Bo.Ho. Green or Le Rouge Français to name a few - have endeavoured to offer more natural make-up alternatives, in particular by avoiding synthetic pigments but also mineral raw materials (which might be complex to formulate and increase heavy metals contamination risks) and ingredients from animal origins (because they are deemed unethical). To address a maximum of concerns, Givaudan Active Beauty has secured a partnership agreement with a cooperative of farmers in the Yunnan province, in China. New Red 1805 is therefore fully traceable, for increased quality and sustainability credentials. In addition, according to Givaudan, New Red 1805 features antioxidant properties, protecting the fragile lip skin from free radicals. With such properties the ingredient is perfectly in line with the current quest for healthy and soothing beauty products. To illustrate the potential of the new pigment in beauty formulations, Givaudan Active Beauty has designed a luxurious red lips beautifier. Dubbed S3D® Désir, the product offers a ""high covering and flamboyant satin texture."" Easy to formulate, New Red 1805 can be used alone in the formula or in association with other pigments. ""Its intense natural red is wear-proof stable and offers the perfect shade on all ethnicities,"" adds Givaudan."
Velberry: A new fruity-sweet fragrance ingredient by BASF,"Velberry [1] is the first of a series of new launches developed through a collaborative approach within the ""Virtual Innovation Ecosystem"", a network of perfumery and formulation experts formed by BASF to speed up the development of new fragrance ingredients. ""Bringing innovative products to the market is time consuming, cost-intensive and involves complicated regulatory efforts and financial risks. Only a few companies in the market have the resources needed for the tedious research and development work involved,"" explains BASF. The chemistry giant has therefore join forces with perfumery and formulation partners to develop a series of new substances for the fragrance market. The experts search through the entire palette of BASF chemicals for molecules suitable for use as fragrances. The large number of potential candidates calls for a strict selection and prioritization process. ""We ask for feedback from perfumers, jointly evaluate the substances and then develop the most promising candidates,"" explains Ralf Pelzer, head of the New Business Development Unit at BASF Aroma Ingredients. Velberry is described as a fresh, and fruity-sweet top note fragrance material with an ultimate blooming sensation. ""The gourmand character combines soft and powdery notes with freshness and red fruits. It has an excellent blooming effect and can be used as a building block to round off formulations,"" says BASF. According to the company, the new ingredient is readily biodegradable with a particularly good toxicological profile. It is not classified by the EC CLP Regulation 1272/2008. ""With Velberry, we have succeeded not only in meeting our customers' desire for new substances to differentiate their fragrances, but also in meeting the growing demand for sustainable alternatives - all at an attractive price,"" says Steffen Götz, head of the BASF Aroma Ingredients division. BASF explains there is a high demand among perfumers for new fragrances in order to continuously provide consumers with new fragrance profiles for example in personal care products such as shampoos and body lotions. These new products have to give perfumers more freedom in terms of fragrance creations while meeting growing demands for sustainability, product safety and supply reliability at the same time. ""Our pipeline is filled and additional innovations are already on the way,"" announces Ralf Pelzer."
Interest in upcycled ingredients expected to rise in the cosmetics industry,"Food side streams, or food byproducts, are already established as a source of natural ingredients. Some ingredients, such as palm kernel oil, are widely used in cosmetic and personal care products. According to Ecovia Intelligence, there is greater demand for such raw materials because of growing consumer demand for natural and organic personal care products. The quest for sustainability is another major driver, with cosmetic and ingredient firms making pledges to use more plant-based and natural ingredients in their formulations. According to the market research firm, there is heightened interest in upcycled ingredients this year. indeed, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the supply of natural ingredients. Indeed, the collection and processing of plant materials has been affected by emergency measures introduced by state and national governments. Ingredient buyers also experienced higher transportation costs and delays because of quarantine measures at ports. The pandemic is therefore leading many operators to consider regional, if not local, supply sources of natural ingredients. Food byproducts are increasingly viewed as a sustainable source of such materials. The last 12 months has seen the launch of some notable upcycled ingredients. The French company Laboratories Expanscience has developed an active eye care ingredient from discarded avocadoes. It has set up a sustainable supply chain for the raw material from Peru. More recently, Givaudan launched Koffee'Up. Marketed as an alternative to argan oil, the upcycled ingredient is made from spent coffee grounds. The ingredient has been developed in partnership with the Danish start-up Kaffe Bueno. Rahn AG is upcycling pumpkin seeds to make the active ingredient Reforcyl-Aion. Sourced from pumpkins in Styria (Austria), the skin care ingredient is marketed as conforming to the principles of a circular economy. Cargill Beauty has extracted pectin from leftover lemon peel to produce a new texturizer and emulsion stabiliser for skin care products. Based on this new generation of natural ingredients, cosmetic brands are creating dedicated lines. The Taiwanese company Hair O' Right is a pioneer; it introduced natural hair care products made from spent coffee grounds in 2006. It is now creating products using other upcycled ingredients, such as goji berry roots and distiller grains. The use of such ingredients fits into the ethos of sustainable brands; Hair O' Right is carbon neutral and a leading user of recycled packaging materials. Recognition of its green endeavours came last year when it received the Sustainability Leadership title at the 2019 Sustainable Beauty Awards. New brands are emerging that are positioned on their upcycled ingredients. Launched in the UK, the Dr. Craft brand, for instance, uses discarded blackcurrant pulp to make sustainable hair colours. Upcircle Beauty is another UK brand that upcycles waste materials for its skin care range. New York-based LOLI Beauty is also using upcycled ingredients. Its heroe product Plum Elixir is made from plum kernel oil that is sourced from organic farms. According to Ecovia Intelligence, cosmetic and personal care companies are now looking to make the transition to a circular economy. Large firms like Unilever and P&G are developing zero waste systems and moving to sustainable packaging materials. Since removing waste is one of the tenants of the circular economy, upcycling presents an opportunity to such companies. According to the market research firm, adoption rate of upcycled ingredients is expected to rise as such cosmetic firms re-formulate their products using ingredients from waste streams. Green materials, including the use of upcycled ingredients, will be discussed in upcoming editions of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit: – North American Virtual Edition: 28-30 September 2020 – European Virtual Edition: 2-5 November 2020"
"Driven by new consumer preferences, demand for cupuaçu butter is on the rise","From about USD 34 million in 2020, the global cupuaçu butter market is expected to grow to approximately USD 62 million by 2030 (compared to USD 3 billion for murumuru in 2030), at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 6.3% from 2020 to 2030, according to market intelligence company Transparency Market Research (TMR). The tectonic shift of consumer preferences toward natural, organic, free-from, safe, and healthy products has played an important role in influencing the choice of ingredients used in the cosmetics, foods and beverages and paved the way for novel products developed using unique ingredients. Murumuru butter, for instance, is being pervasively used in cosmetics products. It is a key ingredient in several products from Brazil's cosmetics giant Natura and is also widely used in a wide array of 100% vegetarian and handmade facial and body care items from UK-based company Lush. California-based Physicians Formula recently increased its portfolio and raised awareness for their Murumuru Butter Blush by tying up with small-scale retailers. According to Transparency Market Research, cupuaçu butter benefits from the same market trends. ""As consumers across the world continue to lean toward a vegan lifestyle, particularly in North America and Europe, the demand for cupuacu butter is on the rise. A significant rise in the number of beauty- or skin-conscious consumers is another major factor that is expected to propel the demand for cupuacu butter in the forthcoming decade,"" says the company. As a consequence, cupuaçu butter is used in a growing variety of cosmetic and personal care applications, including skin and hair care products. Additionally, it is also significantly used in the food processing industry. ""Over the past few years, cupuacu butter is also increasingly being used as an alternative to shea butter to treat brittle and dry hair, as it offers improved hydration and a great degree of softness. Haircare companies, particularly in developed regions, including North America and Europe, are leaning toward the use of cupuacu butter to develop high-quality hair conditioners and other products,"" details TMR. However, the COVID-19 pandemic will certainly impact the growth of the cupuacu butter market in 2020 and 2021. In such a context, ""addressing supply chain challenges should remain a priority"" warns the firm. Key supliers of cupuaçu butter include Beraca Ingredientes Naturais SA., Hallstar, Henry Lamotte Oils GmbH, Jarchem Industries Inc. and Biobrazil Botanicals, among others."
"VivaScentz, Givaudan's new creation tool to boost consumers' wellbeing","The importance of the attitude people adopt in the face of the vagaries of life has long been highlighted by philosophers and psychologists. We know that positive emotions have an impact, both on our state of mind, our body and our moods. And the current success of books on personal development, on practices like yoga or meditation, show the importance f customer expectations in this area. Expectations that perfume, through its ability to trigger good emotions, could partly satisfy. On this premise, the Givaudan teams have developed a new technology, to help perfumers in creating more easily fragrances with real well-being benefits, but also hygiene, household and oral hygiene products. VivaScentz thus offers brands possibilities to foster a strong connection between fragrances and well-being. In a nutshell, consumers will have in one product, a quality fragrance along with beneficial powers. This new technology complements Givaudan's already existing offers in terms of sensory innovation, such as DreamScentz, a technology that improves sleep. It is on this basis that the Unilever brand, Radox, has launched two shower gels, one with a lavender and Ylang Ylang scent, the other with a chamomile and white valerian scent, with the mention DreamScentz on the packaging. The technology was developed in Givaudan's Health and Well-being Centre of Excellence in Ashford. This center focuses on three areas, namely, bad odours, neuroscience and oral hygiene. VivaScentz will have required more than 30 years of multidisciplinary research and innovation. This interconnection between fragrances and well-being is backed on scientific evidence and the Centre has been collaborating closely with a renowned research academic partner, to develop a metric that measures overall well-being, covering the psychological, physiological and social dimensions in a fragrance context. In addition, the centre's team of neuroscientists works in a concerted manner with the team of perfumers during the creative process to trigger a feeling of well-being. In total, more than 2,000 consumer tests have demonstrated that fragrances created with the VivaScentz technology have a positive impact on the user's overall state of well-being. It appears that 89% of consumers from the study, estimated that fragrances, flavours, oral hygiene products could improve their quality of life, and help them adopt a more positive attitude in their everyday lives. Could this be the opening of a new chapter in fragrance creation?"
TechnicoFlor deciphers post-crisis olfactory trends,"Premium Beauty News - What changes have you noticed in the olfactory world? Caroline Catherine - During this unprecedented crisis, people ""took advantage"" of lockdown to take care of themselves, using products they knew and had at home, or trying to create their own, taking inspiration from old recipes. It is both reassuring and creative to use old things to make something new – in marketing, we call it newstalgia. Pierre Flores - From an olfactory standpoint, current trends are mixing up with lockdown needs, so the idea would be to select soothing, comforting notes. There is actually a return to musky, powdery notes related to a renewed taste for delicacies. But in perfumery, this taste is gradually oriented towards savoury fragrances. We are developing notes based on salt flower, for example – and they can be combined with marine notes, or hazelnut. For the latest collection of 100% natural TechnicoFlor perfumes, Alter Eco, we worked on a savoury addiction: textured, white cashew milk which both offered the comfort of milk and this off-beat savoury aspect. Right now, everyone is looking for this – in line with the evolution of tastes. Premium Beauty News - Is the perception of natural perfumes changing as well, as a result of the context? Caroline Catherine - The relationship with authenticity and traceability is confirmed, and it will keep developing. As a committed Perfumer, TechnicoFlor has had a vivid history with naturalness for a long time. Today, we endeavour to make natural perfumes evolve, orienting them towards playful, sensorial, and responsible naturalness, thanks to new ingredients. It is actually the concept of our new perfume range, Alter Eco, which is inspired from ""alternative"" ingredients for more environmentally friendly consumption: it features our most beautiful FairTrade materials. We like provoking, so we often do with our new gourmand fragrances, because consumers are not used to these notes in natural perfumes. Pierre Flores - Today, biotechnologies make it possible to offer more and more original natural raw materials. For example, we managed to obtain natural heliotropin, although this ingredient is usually derived from organic chemistry. All this opens up new creative ways. In addition, we work on long-lasting Eaux de Toilette with a real signature. Many of our customers ask for this. Premium Beauty News - Are there new emerging codes? Pierre Flores - Unisex perfumes are booming: mixed perfumes count more launches than others right now. It is due to niche perfumes and it shows they have become democratic, but it is also due to the Middle East, where perfumes have never been gendered. Olfactory codes are changing, and societal factors have an impact on how fragrances are created. It encourages us to innovate and play on the existing palette, while searching for novelty."
Givaudan launches an upcycled Arabica coffee oil,"Dedicated to skin care, Koffee'Up is a coffee oil designed as an alternative to argan oil, thanks to its natural properties: hydration, protection, and anti-ageing. Upcycled using from spent coffee grounds using supercritical fluid extraction by CO2, the oil was developed in collaboration with Danish start-up company Kaffe Bueno, the winner of the 2019 edition of MassChallenge Switzerland, a start-up incubator co-founded by Givaudan. Kaffe Bueno focuses on upcycling spent coffee grounds, or coffee waste, into active and functional ingredients in particular for cosmetics. The strong sustainable mission of the biotech start-up is also in line with today's trends related to sustainability. The launch of Koffee'Up follows the launch of Vetivyne, a fully natural and sustainable cosmetic active ingredient launched in 2018 that is crafted from upcycled vetiver roots from leftover fragrance raw materials. Most recently, for instance, Expanscience launched Number 6, their sixth ingredient derived from avocado upcycling. ""We are thrilled of this unique collaboration with Kaffe Bueno and we're eager to start using the new product in creative solutions for customers. The high quality, traceable and upcycled ingredients used in Koffee'Up showcases a prosperous new avenue for using sustainable coffee in the world of beauty. This is a big achievement and opportunity, and we're looking forward to presenting this innovative beauty elixir to customers,"" explains Laurent Bourdeau, Head of Active Beauty. To illustrate the benefits of this new premium and sustainable oil, Givaudan has developed Active Beauty Eye Shot Express, a fresh gel with immediate effect on the eye contour area. Koffee'Up has received the COSMOS seal from Ecocert. ""The innovation surrounding upcycling in the cosmetics industry today is a crucial point for the evolution of sustainable business and we're thrilled to partner with a young start-up company at MassChallenge Switzerland who values the same sustainable practices we do,"" concludes Maurizio Volpi, President of Givaudan Fragrances.

Wesource wants to put an end to dry skin conditions,"Characterized by tightness, itching, and lack of elasticity, a dry skin is the source of an overall discomfort, which makes skin hydration a key claim in cosmetics (60% of skin care launches). In case of prolonged dehydration, the altered barrier function leads to increased dehydration, impaired lipid production and creates an inflammation signalling cascade. Recent scientific progress has linked skin dryness to inflammation: this is the phenomenon that Seppic describes as Inflamm'dryness. To tackle this phenomenon, BiotechMarine (Seppic group) took an interest in the properties of the Marine Everlasting plant (Helichrysum stoechas), a plant subject to high salinity, sun rays and winds, and that developed a strong resistance to dehydration. This is how Hydrachrysum was born. The patented moisturizing active ingredient was designed to break the Inflamm'dryness vicious circle. ""Hydrachrysum is the new natural ally of dry skin. Bio-inspired by Helichrysum stoechas, which adapts to its arid ecosystem. It offers a unique molecular richness made up of hydrophilic & lipophilic molecules derived from the dedifferentiated plant cells and specific ones secreted in the medium,"" explains Seppic in a release. According to the supplier of cosmetic ingredients, Hydrachrysum induces a decrease of pro-inflammatory and an increase of pro-resolutive mediators to allow a return to homeostasis and improved barrier function. Furthermore, Hydrachrysum increases the number of lacunae, these markers of hydration acting as extracellular water tanks and representing up to 40% of the volume of the stratum corneum. It boosts skin moisturization after only 5 days by increasing significantly the number of lacunae +82% vs placebo. ""Innovating in the Hydration field is a hard task. We are delighted to reveal Hydrachrysum, the first product in the market that breaks the Inflamm'dryness vicious circle by helping resolve the inflammation process, restoring the skin barrier function and boosting skin hydration on the long term. It meets the needs of consumer for effective moisturizing cosmetics,"" Aude Le Grand, Wesource Product Manager. Hydrachrysum is Cosmos and NaTrue approved, Halal certified, and scientifically proven with in-vitro, ex-vivo and in-vivo data at 1%."
Natural cosmetic ingredients to gain popularity in post-Covid-19 era,"In the context of the current pandemic consumers try to improve their personal immunity and natural ingredients with antibacterial and antiviral qualities are the most sought after, according to Ecovia Intelligence. Australian companies, for instance, are reporting a surge in demand for lemon myrtle (Backhousia citriodora), which is used in hand sanitizers and cleaning products. Australian Native Products, the largest producer, is therefore planting 180,000 new lemon myrtle and anise myrtle (Syzygium anisatum) trees to ramp up production. Tea tree oil (Melaleuca alternifolia oil), well-known for its antibacterial and antiviral properties, is also experiencing a coronavirus boost. It is used in a wide range of personal care and home care products. Based in New South Wales, Gelair has developed a line of tea tree oil-based cleaning products for the maritime industry. Virus fears are leading commercial ships and cruise liners to use Gelair products to decontaminate ducted ventilation systems. Already well established in the personal care industry, aloe vera is also experiencing high demand. During the pandemic, the use of the ingredient has extended while companies were massively producing hand sanitizers, and some consumers were doing the same at home, says Ecovia. Seeing the shift in purchasing behaviour, the American supplier Desert Harvest has started producing hand sanitizers for the first time. Amyris, a producer of sustainable ingredients, has also launched natural hand sanitizers under its Pipette brand. The natural essential oils company EO Products has increased production of its hand sanitizers 16-fold since the virus outbreak. Other natural ingredients in high demand include eucalyptus oil, propolis, and oregano. Asian ingredient suppliers are reporting a spike in demand for eucalyptus oil. In Indonesia, the Agriculture Ministry is actively using eucalyptus oil to help stop the transmission of the coronavirus. It has developed ointments, balms, inhalers and diffusers. Ecovia Intelligence also notes the popularity of cannabidiol (CBD) is continuing during the coronavirus crisis. ""CBD is featured in many new product launches, including hand sanitizers, creams, lotions and balms. The UK online retailer Alphagreen is reporting a doubling of interest in CBD-based products since the virus outbreak. Consumers are buying CBD products to help give them relieve from anxiety, insomnia and pain."" As Covid-19 is changing the way we eat, meet and clean, the pandemic will impact a large array of markets, including cosmetic and personal care products. ""Expect to see more natural ingredients in the products we use,"" concludes Ecovia Intelligence."
Silab targets greying hair with a plant-based anti-free radical active ingredient,"After having investigated hair regrowth and launched Hairgenyl, last year, the French supplier of natural cosmetic active ingredients focused on the fight against natural processes of hair greying through an innovative approach. ""Greying of hair is an unavoidable phenomenon, however, there is a strong consumer expectation to avoid it with natural solutions,"" says Silab in a statement. In order to effectively address the issue of hair greying, the company launched an in-depth screening of natural raw materials, targeting the anti-free radical and pro-pigmenting effects. This work led to the identification of two botanical raw materials: black oat seeds (anti-oxidant and detoxifying) and spiny restharrow roots (pro-pigmenting). The use of green solvents combined with enzymatic bioengineering enabled the optimized extraction of molecules of interest. The repigmenting effect of Agreynist [1] was demonstrated in vivo on a panel of Caucasian and Asian, male and female volunteers. Indeed, a visual scoring by experts on photos highlighted that after four months of daily application, Agreynist formulated at 2.5% in a lotion significantly decreases the stage of greying by 20% (P < 0.001) on Caucasian volunteers, corresponding to an average decrease of one stage of greying (result visible in 91% of volunteers). A subjective evaluation confirmed these data, as after six months of use, 91% of the volunteers reported that they have fewer grey hairs and 88% of them considered that it is an anti-grey hair product. ""With its protective, detoxifying and repigmenting action, Agreynist offers a natural solution for grey hair care,"" concludes Silab. Composed of biopeptides and polyphenols, this patented active is available in aqueous solution (recommended amount: 0.5 to 2.5%) and compliant with international cosmetic regulations (Europe, United States, Japan, China, etc.). An overview of the cosmetic ingredient launches is available in our special issue: Happy Cosmetics issue - cosmetic ingredients, May 2020. Available online for free, here."

Happy Cosmetics: The trend that reconnects beauty to life?,"According to Euromonitor, for 51% of respondents beauty is first synonymous with ""looking healthy""; followed by ""feeling good about yourself"" and then ""to be self-confident"". The perception of health, according to this same study, is linked to enjoying fine mental health but also of feeling good. Hence beauty would come from within, far away from aesthetic pleasure, which is also another aspect of beauty. We therefore understand why cosmetics seeks to go beyond the surface of things - skin, hair and nails, in this case - to take interest in the inner well-being of customers! Some companies have started to explore the emotions aroused by the application of a cosmetic product or ingredient. Significant advances made by neuroscience and the technologies available, in particular with brain imaging tools, have led to new discoveries. LMR Naturals by IFF has for instance carried out a major study on the emotional effects of a hundred natural aromatic ingredients. Eight emotional dimensions emerged: energy, relaxation, seduction, joy, the alternative, learning, self-esteem, mindfulness. The study highlighted in particular, that immortelle oil with an energy score of 125%, triggers the brain areas associated with motor activation, it stimulates the urge to move, the planning of things, control, and the execution of voluntary movements. Actually, in aromacology, this oil is traditionally used to combat fatigue, encourage action. Givaudan, for its part, used the method of Mood Portraits, following a method which consists in exposing panellists to series of images and then asking them to choose the ones which were the most evocative of their feelings. The Company compared the results obtained before the application of a cream enriched with its Sensityl® active and after 28 days of application. In addition, an expert analysed the facial expression of panellists who had applied the product. The measurements showed that the number of positive emotions aroused, had increased. At Sequens, the teams chose the in-depth analysis of the physical parameters of the voice (prosody) and the lexical field used (verbatim), to objectify the emotional impact of the active Glycuron 2.78™ and show vs. placebo that a cream enriched with this active, reduces the emotional charge triggered by the confrontation with one's own image. Cosmetics is making progress in the analysis of what it arouses in its customers even if, not surprisingly, it knows perfectly well that providing happiness to users is its raison d'être. In North America, the trend for cannabis products is in full swing. According to the research company BDS Analytics, the market for CBD is expected to exceed $ 20 billion by 2024. The molecule extracted from hemp indeed has a taste of forbidden fruit and is associated with the well-being effects provided by cannabis. However, cannabidiol or CBD, generally the only active derived from cannabis to be authorized in cosmetics, does not contain THC, which is psychoactive. On the supplier side, Mibelle Biochemistry proposes Lipobelle Pino C a comforting complex composed of CBD encapsulated in a nanoemulsion based on organic hemp seed oil and pine extract from the Swiss Alps. Grolman, through its Austrian supplier Hanfama, offers Canokos CBD, cannabidiol originating from crops with no herbicides or pesticides, and where the picking and cutting of the plant material is handmade, for a rigorous selection of stems and leaves and thus avoiding flowers containing THC. The Hanfama Company has also carried out a very extensive bibliographic study on the potential properties of CBD in cosmetics. An alternative solution put forward by Mibelle Biochemistry is to activate, via the neurotransmitter, cannabinoid receptors present in skin cells, thanks to its active, NanoCacao, rich in anandamide, and thus induce a feeling of well-being and relaxation. At a time when consumers are worried and left with unanswered questions, the Pinterest social network notes a surge in queries related to ""well-being at home"".

The perfume plant sector post-Covid-19,"Premium Beauty News - How is the field of noble materials doing in perfumery? Rémi Pulvérail - Agricultural activities are still going on in most countries, but the number of orders for fine perfumery natural extracts dropped all of a sudden, which will further weaken a number of producers: they will end up with their harvests on their hands… in countries already struggling, from a structural standpoint. Producers have launched an operation to ask their historical customers, perfume houses, for help, as can be seen in Africa, where there is still no clear vision of the impact of the pandemic, and where sanitary equipment is sadly lacking. Premium Beauty News - Can this put the different networks involved in danger? Rémi Pulvérail - Of course, there are additional tensions, but they already existed before the pandemic, due to climate disruption, for example. Natural material producers expect at least some visibility and contractual commitments from buyers, but unfortunately, it hardly ever works that way. Buyers have two objectives: minimize their stock levels with orders placed only when they need the materials, and purchase the latter for the lowest price possible. As a matter of fact, farming involves long, unchanging cycles with harvesting periods at the same fixed date every year. An initial investment is required to launch the culture, get the first harvest a few years later, transform the plant to obtain the extract, and eventually export the material. The payment comes later. And in periods like these, things get even more unbalanced. The unprecedented duration of the vanilla crisis in Madagascar just shows aroma and perfume houses cannot restore the balance, despite the many ""ethical sourcing"" projects launched. Premium Beauty News - What do you recommend? Rémi Pulvérail - For these producers, which still represent micro-sectors in the global agricultural landscape, the only solution would be to implement truly responsible purchase policies with contractual commitments over several years and a systematic pre-financing policy. Of course, it comes at a cost, but it is still significantly less important than the cost of a major crisis. Also, to me, producing countries should better control their local networks with more interventionist policies regarding both the volumes produced and the price levels. Today, the market on its own cannot regulate and guarantee the sustainability of all sectors. Premium Beauty News - Should activities be relocated to guarantee the sourcing? Rémi Pulvérail - Definitely not. In a number of countries, it would be a catastrophe without this plant perfume production. For example, Haiti has become the first global producer of vetiver essence – it is the second export resource in this country and a product with a high added value. This sector provides dozens of thousands of families with a decent life. The same goes for the production of Ylang Ylang essence in the Comoro Islands. Premium Beauty News - Can green chemistry be a solution for the future? Rémi Pulvérail - Of course, whether it be in the field of bioconversion, biosynthesis, or enzymatic catalyses, today, many synthetic molecules derived from 'dirty' chemistry - let's face it - can be replaced with the same molecules in their natural version. It is a major challenge. In France, we have new players at the forefront of these future, environmentally friendly technologies, like AFYREN, who work on fermentation based on French sugar beet."
Ashland uses lavender to help sleep-deprived skin,"Dubbed Nightessence biofunctional [1], Ashland's new active is derived from lavender flowers sustainably grown and harvested on the mountain slopes in Provence, France, 140 kilometers from the Ashland biofunctional facility. It is extracted using the patented and proprietary plant small RNA (PSR) technology, developed to catch some specific nutrient compounds, including small RNAs. According to Ashland, the new ingredient helps restore skin overnight, so it looks ""rested, renewed and illuminated by morning."" As consumers are increasingly aware of the link between sleep and lifestyle factors with skin appearance, mental and physical health, the 'beauty sleep' or 'clean sleep' concept becomes extremely trendy. ""A recent Mintel study reports that 80 percent of women in France, Germany, Italy and Spain all agree that getting enough sleep is an important part of looking after their skin,"" said Justine Cotton, global marketing manager and new business development, Ashland. In this context the 'clean sleep' trend is on the rise, focusing on habits and behaviours that can improve the quality of sleep and help one feel better rested. ""Based on scientific research, Ashland has defined the biology of the skin at night as noctology, which describes the needs of skin through essential nocturnal processes and molecules for night repair of daily damage,"" explains Joël Mantelin, vice president marketing and business development, Ashland. ""Ashland's Nightessence biofunctional enhances skin's naturally occurring nocturnal process, dysregulated by hectic lifestyles, visible light and sun, and helps skin boost essential nighttime molecules such as timezyme and melatonin."" Nightessence biofunctional was clinically tested on a group of 36 Asian volunteers who worked the night shift or who stayed up very late. According to Ashland, after using the product for a month, the volunteers showed a more rested skin with fewer dark circles."
Symrise brings the treasures of Madagascar to perfumers,"Among the major ingredients that Symrise grows in Madagascar are spices such as the emblematic vanilla and cinnamon, as well as geranium, red lemongrass, pink pepper leaf and ylang-ylang. More recently, newer raw materials have been added to the portfolio of ingredients the group produces there, including ginger, vetiver, black pepper and mandarin. ""There is a great diversity of climates on the island with very rich soils, lots of spices and fragrant plants. To diversify our palette of natural ingredients, we proposed to our network of farmers to diversify their production when the vanilla season is over,"" explains Suzy Le Helley, perfumer at Symrise. Indeed, the German company has forged special links with several hundred farmers, mainly from the Sava region, Diego-Suarez around the city of Sambava, in the province of Antsiranana (formerly known as Diego-Suarez), the heart of the vanilla culture, in the Northeast of the island. Symrise provides them with a regular income and a health insurance. The program also provides them with training on tropical forest certification, reforestation and good agricultural practices. Farmers therefore enjoy short and long-term sources of income and can also sustainably improve land productivity. Four new Malagasy natural materials have recently joined Symrise's palette: – Ginger Oil. Cultivated under the most suitable climate conditions in the Sava region, Malagasy ginger is recognized for its exceptional quality. Symrise actually offers two varieties, a fresh ginger, distilled locally, and a dried ginger undergoing a CO2 extraction in Germany, as part of a zero-waste program where the by-products are upcycled for skincare purposes. ""Ginger CO2 is a warmer, deeper version of ginger. Its earthy and woody facets make it more complex and richer,"" highlights Suzy Le Helley. – Mandarin Oil. Symrise has taken advantage of the large number of mandarin trees in Madagascar and the possibility to work manually in the country to reproduce there the ancestral Sicilian manual method known as ""sponge"" and produce a very high quality of mandarin oil. The fresh mandarin is cut in half and hollowed out of its fruit and pulp in a basin of water. The peel is then pressed several times with a rotating movement against a funnel to bring out the essence drop by drop. After the pressing, a very fine essence is recovered in a glass bottle that serves as the container. There is therefore no alteration of the mandarin's natural scent, as can be the case with mechanical harvesting. – Vetiver Heart. In the wake of the launch of a vetiver essential oil in 2019, Symrise now proposes a more complex product A vetiver essence is extracted in Madagascar using ethanol then sent to Symrise's plant in Holzminden, Germany, to purify and preserve only the ""heart"", the noblest part of the ingredient. – Fresh Black Pepper Oil. Instead of using the usual dried berries, this fresh black pepper oil is obtained by direct distillation of the fruit from a three-year-old vine. Still green, the ripe berries are freshly crushed and distilled on the spot. The result is a new note: greener and crispier than traditional black pepper, which is usually close to that of pepper used in cooking. For Suzy Le Helley, these new materials illustrate both the richness of the Malagasy terroir and the long-standing cooperation between Symrise and local farmers. ""These new crops are a way to diversify sources of income, beyond vanilla. We have set up nurseries to provide perfume plants and spices, when asked we provide advice for cultivation, some farmers will test certain plants, some will prefer another, extolling the merits to those around them, and testing new ones. culture associations. It's a dynamic process, we are very happy with the results,"" she concludes."
BASF targets scalp health and microbial diversity with new detox ritual,"The specialty ingredients supplier has created a new hair care active designed to restore the scalp's beauty and health. Dubbed Scalposine [1] it targets excessive sebum production in hair follicles and the diversity of the scalp microbiome. According to BASF: ""Today's hectic lifestyle as well as environmental influences, such as dust and pollution, negatively modify the physiological parameters of the scalp, making hair and scalp concerns more prevalent around the world. An unhealthy scalp is often oily, covered with dandruff and can become sensitive."" In a series of in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro tests, BASF has demonstrated the ability of the new active ingredient to soothe and purify the scalp by decreasing the production of sebum and replenishing its microbiota. The scalp shelters several types of micro-organisms living in harmony with human cells. While being virtually unexplored until now, this ecosystem plays a key role in maintaining the scalp in healthy conditions. In a metagenomic study, BASF explored the disruptive influence of sebum on this fragile microbiotic balance. The analysis confirmed that the diversity of the microbiota is lower on an oily scalp than on a normal scalp. Products able to reduce this excessive sebum production are therefore useful to enhance scalp health. After one month of in vivo application of a product with 1 percent of Scalposine, the diversity of the scalp's microbiota significantly increased - with the number of taxa increasing by 36 percent as compared to the placebo. Moreover, the active ingredient exhibited a prebiotic effect, boosting recolonization with six strains of bacteria previously identified by BASF researchers as being beneficial for a healthy scalp overall. In vitro trials showed that Scalposine at a dose of 0.7 percent effectively reduces the gene expression of 5α-reductase 1, the enzyme initiating the process of sebum production, by as much as 77 percent. In addition, a one-month placebo-controlled clinical study confirmed the active ingredient's ability to lower the level of scalp sebum. Furthermore, 82 percent of study participants reported an immediate soothing effect on the scalp, while some even saw flakiness decrease after 28 days of application. ""With Scalposine, BASF has developed a holistic approach based on Sarcosine, an amino acid derivative found naturally in the human body. It is a precursor of glycine, an amino acid essential for building major skin macromolecules such as elastin and collagen,"" concludes the company."
"""We are opening the age of ethical perfumes"", Juliette Sicot-Crevet, Firmenich","Premium Beauty News - Why ""reinvent"" perfume creation? Juliette Sicot-Crevet - We used a study of 5,000 representative consumers in Brazil, France, the US, and China, conducted in partnership with the aroma department to determine expectations in terms of naturalness and sustainability, measure the importance of these issues, and identify the most interesting claims, but also the dilemmas related to conscious consumption – it is not that clear, after all. We also wanted to know how natural perfumes were perceived, among natural perfumes, but also compared to others, from an olfactory, sensorial standpoint. And we realized that a majority of people have now adopted these natural-oriented consumption habits, although not always for the same reasons. Based on these observations, we decided to adapt the development process. Premium Beauty News - Why was the ""traditional"" process no longer adapted? Juliette Sicot-Crevet - A traditional process involves working on a brief with parameters mostly based on the olfactory performance, on the perfume's hedonic aspect. Today, this dimension, which still corresponds to the main role of perfume and our core business, is no longer enough. Consumers expect more as soon as the design phase - more upstream. Premium Beauty News - What expectations were revealed by the study? Juliette Sicot-Crevet - As regards perfumes, people mainly want to know what they contain, what the ingredients are, and in particular whether they are natural or not. Then come the environmental impact, the human and ethical dimensions, the origin, and the design. We also discovered perfume plays a key role for the product and the brand to be perceived as natural and sustainable. It is obvious for perfumes, but the same goes for shampoos, shower gels and skincare. Premium Beauty News - What does the CreateForGood approach consist in? Juliette Sicot-Crevet - It is a five-step process. The first step is focused on our knowledge of the brand that will embody the perfume. We definitely need to know how it is positioned on the market, based on its products, ingredients, and packs. We also need to understand what it aims for in terms of naturalness and sustainability. The second step is based on our consumer study. It helps us advise and guide brands into choosing the best perfume strategy. Once the strategy has been defined, step three involves creation, in particular ingredient choices. Depending on the strategy, some ingredients will be possible, while others will not. For the perfumer, it becomes an exercise involving much more than hedonics. There is a need to comply with accurate specifications. Now, there was no step four in standard creation. Here, it involves the EcoScent Compass tool launched two years ago to measure a perfume's sustainability from a holistic standpoint, based on three complementary scores. The first measures the green properties of the ingredients depending on their content in renewable carbon, their biodegradability, the use of green chemistry, etc. The second score is focused on the environmental impact, and the third has to do with the social aspect and compliance with good practices as regards the labour, health, and safety rights of both our employees and suppliers. We rely on the life cycle analysis data related to our ingredients, our suppliers' data, and Ecovadis data. Today, this EcoScent Compass score is already calculated for every new creation. Lastly, step five corresponds to finalization. It requires total control over natural creation processes to be able to meet all criteria: the olfactory relevance, in line with the claims wanted, a stable formula, and an adapted price. Premium Beauty News - What are the constraints? Juliette Sicot-Crevet - We try to be as objective and to provide as much information as possible. There are still a lot of misunderstandings and clichés. If a company wants to go all natural, they need to know what it involves. You do not get to win all the time. Today, consumers know what sustainable packaging is, but they still do not really know what a sustainable product or perfume is. In particular, they do not know that naturalness does not always rhyme with sustainability. There is a lot to be done with brands, and EcoScent Compass helps with it. Generally speaking, the 100% natural perfumes analyzed by this tool are not those that get the best environmental score, given their high energy and water consumption and the presence of allergens. EcoScent Compass takes into account educational and communication parameters: it provides both transparency and objectivity. For example, it involves a score for green chemistry. Consumers do not know what green chemistry is. Our study actually confirmed that younger generations, in particular, are eager to understand these notions and practices to reconcile naturalness with environmental protection. Thanks to a tool like EcoScent, we get the means to measure and explain these concepts and vulgarize them with objectivity. Premium Beauty News - What are Firmenich's aspirations within this context? Juliette Sicot-Crevet - We aim to support brands in adapting to this movement. There are as many combinations as there are brands. We intend to provide solutions that help each brand discover what suits them, what is most relevant given their strategies and targets. Since the company was founded, 125 years ago, Firmenich has been a key player in modern perfumery. Today, we are opening a new age I call ethical perfumery: it consists in offering sensorial, environmentally friendly, safe perfumes trusted by consumers. Firmenich aims to be a leader in this new era."
Mibelle calls on the Alpine rose to fight cellular senescence,"Eliminating senescent cells has emerged as a promising anti-aging therapy in the medical field in the past few years. With Alpine Rose Active [1], Mibelle Biochemistry is pioneering the novel ""senolytics"" concept in the cosmetics field. When fibroblasts responsible for the production of collagen either age or encounter too many harmful oxidative stresses (such as UV light and pollution), they become senescent. Senescent cells are also called ""zombie cells"" because they no longer divide, but are also far from being dead. These cells continue to secrete signalling molecules that promote inflammation and can influence surrounding cells into also becoming senescent. In younger tissue, senescent cells are usually cleared by the immune system. In aged skin and skin that has been exposed to consistent stress, senescent cells accumulate. The resulting chronic inflammation exacerbates the aging process by promoting collagen degradation, which leads to a lack of skin elasticity. Studies in medicine have shown that so-called senolytic molecules can eliminate these ""old"" cells and prevent disease. In order to adapt this concept in the cosmetic field, Mibelle called on the Alpine rose (Rhododendron ferrugineum), one of the most typical and prominent Swiss alpine plants. ""Alpine Rose Active was shown to specifically clean-up misdirected, age-promoting senescent cells and in clinical studies to significantly reduce skin redness, increase skin elasticity and protect from UVA induced photo-aging,"" explains the Swiss-based expert in botanical actives. To assess the properties of this new active ingredient, Mibelle Biochemistry carried out an in vitro study and two clinical studies. In vitro, a treatment with 1% Alpine Rose Active significantly reduced the number of senescent fibroblasts in a mixture of senescent and healthy fibroblasts, while not affecting the number of healthy cells. In vivo, the application of a cream with 2% Alpine Rose Active twice daily on volunteers showed that redness was significantly reduced after 14 days by 8.4%, while skin elasticity significantly increased after 28 days by 16.1% compared to placebo. In a second in vivo study, using a cream with 2% Alpine Rose Active allowed to completely prevent the oxidation of skin proteins after UVA-irradiation compared to placebo. Alpine Rose Active is a purified extract of organic alpine rose leaves. This robust and hardy plant grows in the high Alpine regions of Switzerland and is carefully harvested by sustainable wildcrafting. The extract is COSMOS approved and organically certified by EcoCert."
Givaudan: A natural active ingredient to protect the skin from digital stress,"Dubbed Synchronight, this new active ingredient comes from an extract of dried fruit of gardenia, sourced in the Guangxi region, in China. Designed to protect the skin, it acts as a shield against digital stress, in particular the blue light emitted by electronic devices. Thus protecting the skin against external aggressions linked to today's digital lifestyles, it allows melatonin to play its natural role in regulating the sleep-wake cycle. ""Synchronight, which is activated by the microbiome, stimulates skin rejuvenation and preserves the natural skin melatonin release cycle, resulting in younger skin and better sleep,"" explains Givaudan in a statement. Developed at Givaudan's Green Fractionation Centre of Excellence in Avignon, France, this new active ingredient is obtained using the NaDES technology [1] patented by Naturex (a company which is now part of Givaudan) that allows the extraction of some phytochemicals that are not always fully soluble in lipid or water phases. ""Our accomplished scientific team in skin research and microbiomics identified a unique opportunity to bring this ingredient to life. Creating a natural ingredient with the strength to fight the effects of digital stress and improve sleep quality is a turning point for innovation in the beauty space today. We look forward to collaborating with our customers to create new meaningful beauty products that bring moments of delight throughout the day and night,"" says Laurent Bourdeau, Head of Givaudan Active Beauty. To illustrate the formulation possibilities linked to Synchronight, Givaudan has designed a night cream named, ""My Blue Guard High Performance"" also featuring DreamScentz, a fragrance technology aimed to enhance everyone's sleep experience."
Gattefossé highlights the benefits of its iconic natural emulsifier for the human microbiome,"Emulium Mellifera MB a natural, PEG-free, O/W emulsifier made from beeswax and jojoba wax. Flexible and multifunctional, it allows the formulation of a wide range of textures suitable - from sprayable lotions to thick butters - and applications, such as skin care, sun care or make-up for all skin types and climates. It creates natural emulsions with white and luxurious appearance, while leaving a light and smooth feeling after the application. Furthermore, according to Gattefossé, it is also an active ingredients, thanks to ""its moisturizing and anti-pollution properties, its capacity to visibly improve skin texture and its high tolerance even for sensitive and hyper reactive skin."" In a clinical study, Gattefossé assessed the microbiome-friendly effects of Emulium Mellifera MB. The purpose of the research was to test the effect of an emulsion formulated with 4% of Emulium Mellifera MB on parameters including skin moisturi­zation, skin barrier function and to understand its impact on cutaneous microbiota. Several evaluation techniques were used: – Study of cutaneous microbiota by amplification and sequencing of ribosomal 16S DNA – Biometrological measures: corneometry, TEWL – Self-assessment by the volunteers on various criteria – Questionnaire to understand what volunteers know about cutaneous microbiota – Overall satisfaction questionnaire According to Gattefossé, results showed an increase of moisturization, a reduction of TEWL reflecting a better barrier function and an improvement of the skin quality of volunteers. More importantly, regarding the main focus of the research, the study of cutaneous microbiota after application of an emulsion containing Emulium Mellifera MB revealed that the taxonomic diversity and richness of the skin flora have been at least maintained or even improved for 81% of volunteers. These parameters are directly linked to a healthy skin, able to defend itself against external aggressions. A specialist in lipid chemistry and plant extraction, Gattefossé products Emulium Mellifera MB through a patented technology of transformation and functionalization of natural waxes. ""From beeswax and jojoba wax, the wax butter obtained by esterification and interesterification brings a unique sensoriality and moisturizing properties to this emulsifier,"" highlights the French company."
Beraca taps in Amazon oils to develop an alternative to CBD,"To address this trend, Beraca is launching Beracare CBA (Cannabinoid Active System), a new active compound designed to reduce inflammatory activity and promote the production of β-endorphin, one of the hormones responsible for providing a feeling of well-being. According to the Brazilian company, Beracare CBA is also is a safe natural alternative to CBD (Cannabidiol), which is not allowed for use in cosmetics in all countries. Beracare CBA is a complex of Amazon oils with high levels of terpenes and unsaturated fatty acids - especially linoleic acid. It does not contain any cannabis derivatives. ""Beraca is always concerned to develop products in a way which is sustainable and ethical while measuring its direct impact on nature and society. Beracare CBA, in addition to being developed within these guidelines, is an avant-garde active compound because it aims to answer the current consumers' demand, who increasingly seeks beauty products for mindfulness. Beracare CBA has well-being and stress-relieving properties, promoting several benefits to the skin, such as a feeling of relaxation, improvement in healing activity and overall comfort,"" explains Daniel Sabará - CEO of Beraca. According to Beraca, laboratory tests show multiple benefits of Beracare CBA: anti-inflammatory action, aid in tissue repair and feeling of relaxation - including for the most sensitive skin. When placed in an inflamed microenvironment, human skin cultures show a reduction of 55% in interleukine IL-1β and also a significant decrease (-25.2%) in the interleukin IL-6 levels under the action of Beracare CBA. As these interleukins are related to the triggering of inflammatory signals, the company explains that such results imply that the ingredient acts as an anti-inflammatory agent and has protective effect on the skin. Another test was performed to evaluate the action of the active ingredient on skin well-being. When having a skin culture stressed by LTA (lipoteic acid, an inflammatory agent which stresses the skin tissue), there was a 39.6% reduction of β-endorphin. On the other hand, the use of Beracare CBA was able to avoid the decrease of B-endorphin besides stimulating its production by 92.2% - proving the product's efficacy when it also comes to skin healing, according to Beraca. ""Beracare CBA has an action similar to CBD, but without containing hemp (Cannabis sativa). In addition, it contains linoleic acid, which facilitates absorption by all layers of the skin and is a powerful active ingredient in phase with the mindfulness trend in products for the skin, the scalp, as well as tonics, gels, serums, creams, soaps and lotions"", explains Tiago Cordeiro, head of Beraca's Research, Development and Innovation department."
Clariant develops a sustainably-sourced mulberry root active ingredient for well-aging skincare,"Prenylium, the first product unveiled thanks to Clariant's new partnership with Plant Advanced Technologies (PAT), is a Morus alba tree root extract designed to protect the skin matrisome [1] from degradation that occurs with time and UV exposure. According to Clariant, it also helps prevent signs of aging by visibly reducing the appearance of existing wrinkles and smoothing skin. Unveiled at Cosmetagora, the B2B event dedicated to the formulation of cosmetic products which took place in Paris last week, the new ingredient is produced by PAT's patented Plant Milking Technology, which explores generally inaccessible plant parts - the roots - without killing the tree and allows for the production of rare compounds at an industrial scale. The process is based on aeroponic, soilless system that stimulates roots to produce targeted molecules in higher quantities than those found in their natural environment. Roots are cut and collected several times a year from the same plant to harvest the molecules without destroying the plant culture; the roots can regrow multiple times. In the case of Prenylium, the technology allowed to obtain a higher concentration in prenylated flavonoids (more than 2,000% higher than the content found in traditional Morus alba, white mulberry, root extracts, according to Clariant). ""This class of bioactive compounds has a higher affinity with cellular membranes and better interaction with biological targets of interest when compared to the non-prenylated flavonoids more commonly present at a high level in nature. As a result, biological efficacy is higher,"" said the ingredient manufacturer. Tested in vitro, Prenylium was able to modulate expression of CCN1, thus rebalancing the equilibrium between collagen synthesis and degradation. According to Clariant, all the active compounds of Prenylium were also shown to inhibit the collagenase enzyme activity, the enzyme inducing collagen damage. In addition, quick and noticeable results were seen at the clinical level, in particular regarding the reduction in the appearance of wrinkles, improvement in skin smoothness and plumping effect. A group of 22 females with wrinkles, aged from 45 to 70 years old, applied a product twice a day containing 1% of Prenylium versus a placebo in a double-blind randomized study. Results were analysed after four and eight weeks of application and demonstrated time-dependent wrinkle reduction: deepest wrinkles were reduced by -12.7% after 4 weeks and by -16.6% after 8 weeks. Data also revealed good improvements in smoothness and skin plumping. ""Prenylium's variety of benefits make it suitable for a wide range of applications, including anti-aging creams, plumping serums, dermal matrix prevention care, rejuvenation night creams, and smoothing products,"" said Clariant."
BASF shows commitment on ethical mica in new video,"Colors & Effects - BASF's brand focused on pigments - has chosen to demonstrate its commitment to sustainably sourced natural mica flakes in a video tour providing visual insights on how the material is sourced. Given the increased awareness of unethical mica mining operations in India, Pakistan and other parts of the world, involving child labor in conditions sometimes compared to slavery, the pigments specialist has chosen to provide customers with full transparency about its in-house sourcing from its wholly owned mine located in Hartwell, Georgia, U.S.A. According to a March 2018 report from the Switzerland-based nongovernmental organization Terre des Hommes (TDH), an estimated 22,000 children work in mica mines in India, where about a quarter of the world's supply is extracted. Mica is used to make products like cosmetics and paints shimmer. But its qualities - including perfect cleavage, flexibility, elasticity, chemical inertness, infusibility, low thermal and electrical conductivity, and high dielectric strength - explain the wide use of the mineral across many sectors, including the electronics industry. However, India's mica belt - mainly the states of Jharkhand and Bihar - is among the poorest regions in the country and has high rates of illiteracy and unemployment. BASF's Colors & Effects claims to source 100% of its natural mica flake used for the production of effects pigments for the coatings, plastics, printing and cosmetic industries from their own mine in the U.S.A. ""The controlled, North American based supply chain that tracks mica from source to supply, enables the guarantee for zero child labor and a deep focus on preserving the environment,"" explains Colors & Effects. A video tour of the mine is therefore available on the Colors & Effects website to provide insights about mining practices in Hartwell and the people behind. ""Compliance with internationally agreed labor standards, including the abolition of child labor, is a fundamental cornerstone of the Colors & Effects operations. As one of the leading pigments suppliers globally, Colors & Effects takes responsibility to drive important discussions in key industry networks fostering sustainable solutions,"" claims the BASF division. According toTDH, the cosmetics industry buys 18 per cent of the world's mica production, ranking 5th behind the electronics industry (26 per cent), paints and coatings (24 per cent), and construction (20 per cent)."
Lessonia adapts to the cannabis trend with a new range of CBD ingredients,"Contrary to the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) also found in hemp (cannabis sativa L.), the cannabidiol molecule (CBD), which is not a psychoactive substance, is authorized in cosmetics under French regulations, provided it is extracted from the stem, seeds, or leaves, and not from the flower itself - which American regulations do allow. There should not be any trace of THC in the finished product. Based on these restrictive conditions, Lessonia has just developed a range of ingredients to complete their line of finished products unveiled last September, in an attempt to reassure brands about how to integrate this new ""super"" ingredient to their formulas. ""CBD is mainly concentrated in the flower, not much in the other parts, so there are two options: either you use synthetic CBD, which is prohibited on the American market, or you extract it from the stem. We decided to work on this solution using authorized cannabis sativa varieties,"" explains Charles-Henri Morrice, Innovation Director of Lessonia. Free from THC, the Hemp Ingredients range by Lessonia is composed of six natural ingredients, some of which are organic: stem-extracted CBD molecules, of course, but also a 1% titrated CBD oil, organic hemp oil obtained from cold-pressed cannabis sativa seeds, a 99.4% natural and organic floral water derived from hemp stems and leaves, and a natural exfoliating agent. Thanks to these ingredients, the seven natural references of the soothing skincare range cover all body and face needs. According to multiple publications, cannabidiol offers several cosmetic interests. ""We have cannabinoid receptors in our skin cells which create anti-inflammatory, i.e. anti-ageing effects. This ingredient also reduces sebum secretion in acne-prone skins,"" adds Charles-Henri Morrice. Often associated with transgression, but also related to the notions of naturalness and wellness, cannabis can take on different forms to seduce a young, urban target eager for novelty and surprises. ""For our skincare range, we went as far as choosing a cannabis smell for our fragrance,"" explains Lessonia's Communication Director Marion Lagadec."
Givaudan Active Beauty targets Gen-z with a combination of botanicals and biotech,"In order to address the demand for a perfect ""Instagrammable"" skin while responding to the concomitant quest for natural ingredients and high sensory features, Givaudan's Active Beauty division has launched a new skincare concept at the in-cosmetics Asia trade show on 5 -7 November 2019 in Bangkok, Thailand. Based on botanicals, the product is formulated with 95% of natural origin ingredients and is marketed as a day cream and morning ritual to ensure perfect skin to young consumers. Designed to protect young consumers' skin against daily aggressions, in particular from blue light, My Blue Guard HD ""represents an ideal balance between natural ingredients and biotechnology,"" claims Givaudan Active Beauty. ""As soon as applied, consumers will have an immediate feeling of hydration - ready to face their frenetic and digital life,"" adds the company. According to Givaudan's the new concept is consistent with findings of their Clean and Natural Study 2019 demonstrating that 92% of people are interested in the concept of 'clean beauty' and that 75% of them are even more interested in products powered by biotechnology. ""My Blue Guard HD was a great challenge for our formulation team to create a concept dedicated to Generation Z. It allowed us to go beyond what we did before by creating a refined skin care product that offers a perfect 'Instagrammable' skin while bringing sensoriality thanks to its specific velvety texture, soft touch and fine floral scent. Simple and pure, this is the perfect incarnation of efficiency to take care of their specific skin types,"" said Caroline Reverte, Formulation Project Manager at Givaudan Active Beauty. The ""My Blue Guard HD"" concept is infused by four active ingredients for several benefits: – Hydration: Hydranellys, a by-product of 'Selaginella Pulvinata' inspired from Traditional Chinese Medicine that helps to increase skin moisture and strengthen the barrier function. It also restores water and lipid balance. – Radiance: Eliorelys, an active ingredient extracted from fresh cherry blossoms that improves the quality of the skin showing signs of photo ageing. According to Givaudan, measures of visible aspects and texture of the skin demonstrate it can protect against blue-light and repair photo-induced skin damages. – Gentle exfoliation, through the action of hibiscus acids, a series of botanical extracts traditionally used topically to soothe the skin. – Skin defence, thanks to CristalHyal MW+, a high molecular weight hyaluronic acid crafted by white biotechnology. The biomimetic active ingredient acts as a film generator which protects the skin from external aggressions and ensures its hydration."
GREENette a natural and highly sensorial range by ABC Texture,"Dubbed GREENette, ABC Texture's new range of natural or organic certifiable products represents a straight continuation of the company's history of nature-based innovations. The range features foundations, lipsticks, face care and sun care formulations offering between 95 and 100% of natural ingredients. ""The variety of textures and shades created offers many possibilities, and allows everyone to find the most suitable for his skin type and the desired result"" said the company in statement. The foundations, for instance, offer textures with a matte or glow finish, with over 97% ingredients of natural origin, including natural active ingredients suitable for both oily and dry skin types. The coverage is more or less intense, depending on the expected result. The formulas of the entire GREENette lip range reach more than 99% natural and organic origin ingredients, both for the creamy lipsticks and for the liquid matte or shiny lipsticks that are available in bright or soft colours depending on the user's choice. As far as face care is concerned, the GREENette range is based on ABC Texture's Bubbles innovative texture that combines an oily phase and aqueous phase to deliver specific active ingredients and leave a protective film on the skin. The formulas are free from surfactants and alcohol and are composed of a minimum of 98% natural and organic origin ingredients. A concealer completes the range with a formulation reaching more than 99% of natural and organic origin ingredients. While consumers are looking for more natural products, they have absolutely not given up on the quality of textures and want always be surprised. Within the GREENette range, ABC Texture therefore developed the Bouncy sub-line with products having a soft, gummy-like texture that transforms into a fluid when applied on skin. The Bouncy textures can be used for both make-up products and skin care formulations. As far as make-up is concerned, ABC Texture showcased All-Over Bouncy Vegan, a 3-in-1 formulation that can be used as an eyeshadow, a blush and a lipstick. It creates a natural but sophisticated monochromatic effect and contains almost 99 percent of natural ingredients. The Bouncy highlighter combines this innovative texture with 94% of natural and organic ingredients for a pleasant application and a glowy finish. Eventually, a Bouncy sunscreen based on nano-free mineral filters top the whole range. It offers a SPF30 sun protection and leaves no white mark when applied on the skin with a formula containing 97% of natural ingredients. ABC Texture thus achieved a rare combination of naturalness, innovation and sensorial features."
SymTrap: A new generation of ingredients with a low carbon footprint,"In an effort to reduce their raw materials' carbon footprint, Symrise developed SymTrap, a technique which consists in capturing the fragrant molecules contained in aqueous solutions, like rinse water or residual juices produced by extracting, distilling or lyophilizing plants and fruit. The process results in a resin, which is washed with alcohol to become a ""SymTrap"", a new ingredient which differs from an essential oil, an absolute or a synthetic molecule by its low environmental impact. Derived from the valorization of by-products based on a technique requiring neither heat nor chemicals, SymTrap ingredients offer an extremely low carbon footprint. Symrise first tested this 2008-patented process in Ecuador. The fragrance house retrieved residues from the production of maracuja juice to make SymTrap passionfruit - a natural, juicy, authentic material. Until then, fruity notes could only be obtained by synthesis, except for blackcurrant bud. SymTrap also highlights standard ingredients in a new way, beautifying unexplored facets of them, as can be seen with a clove with smoky, almost peated notes, and cocoa with a surprisingly carnal, animal trail – these two materials from Brazil were showcased at WPC 2018. Beyond environmental protection, SymTrap paves the way for revolutionary ingredients. Indeed, Symrise tested this process on residues of baby food products from the Diana brand: in 2019, onion, artichoke, garlic, asparagus, and cauliflower SymTraps were obtained from this waste. Symrise perfumers have only just started to explore these new materials. ""Artichoke offers similarities with the green notes of Rose Centifolia, which can help highlight its presence in a composition,"" explains Suzy Le Helley, Fine Fragrance perfumer at Symrise. If onion does not sound very sexy, it does possess sulphurous notes similar to those of exotic fruit. The same goes for leek, whose green, milky tones evoke pandanus, an Asian fruit. ""These are interesting prospects from a creative standpoint,"" adds Suzy Le Helley. ""We are gradually discovering these new plant-derived, sustainable materials. One can imagine this process will eventually be applied to other original materials. It is a real technological advancement,"" she says. Other than a low carbon footprint, the SymTrap technology boldly renews the perfumer palette. Let's hope new perfumed notes will soon be released and breathe new life into the genre. We will see how perfumers will seize this opportunity! The latest trends and innovations in fragrance will be presented on November 7, 2019 at the Fragrance Innovation Summit in Paris.

Strand Cosmetics Europe increases the power of pigments,"Strand Cosmetics Europe has developed five Maestracolors+, pigments and fillers on which are grafted or coated molecules of interest, in favor of the formulation and application mainly for makeup products but also for care. The main benefits are hydrophobicity, coverage and homogeneity of colour at application, long-lasting or biologicla properties of grafted molecules. Among this offer of five treatments, four hydrophobic treatments and one hydrophilic treatment provides various benefits: – The two silicone treatments, MaestraColors+ Creamy and MaestraColors+ Classic, improve the fluidity of foundation formulas to which they are integrated while increasing the pigment load and thus the coverage at the application, the stability of the color and the long-lasting of the makeup. – The MaestraColors+ Green treatment allows more naturalness in the formulas thanks to a natural and vegan molecule. – The MaestraColors+ Safe treatment provides antimicrobial efficacy that boosts the preservation of anhydrous products such as complexion powders. – Finally, the MaestraColors + Hydro treatment, with hyaluronic acid, is specific because it is hydrophilic. It thus makes it possible to improve the stability of the oil-in-water emulsions, to bring a particular sensoriality with a richer and more rolling touch, while providing a moisturizing efficacy. It also allows the integration of this hydrophilic active in waxy textures such as concealers or lipsticks. The interest of these functionalized pigments on wellness has also been proven by a clinical study made on a foundation including C8‐silk lipoamino acid functionalized pigments. The study showed a decrease of stress indicators after five days of application [1]. The application also allowed to generate positive emotions and improve the self-esteem of users. ""Maestracolors+ technologies combine with the fundamental and historical expertise of Strand Cosmetics Europe: the formulation of cosmetics combining sensoriality and colour, recognized by international makeup brands,"" concludes the company in a release."
Silab unveils new findings on hair regrowth,"For the first time, Silab and the team of Prof. Aberdam have shown that exosomal communication between the dermis and the hair follicle was an interesting biological pathway for the growth of hair. This work has just been published in the highly-respected journal Stem Cells [1], following a peer-review process by experts in the field. As powerful vectors of intercellular communication with a direct impact on the metabolism and behaviour of target cells. Exosomes extracellular vesicles are at the heart of major biological processes and are of great interest in the areas of basic biology, health and therapeutic technologies, in particular regenerative medicine. In spite of this, there has been relatively little work on the role of exosomes on hair growth. However, the original results obtained in joint work with the team of Prof. Aberdam has demonstrated intercellular communication between dermal fibroblasts and the dermal papilla, the ""nerve center"" of the hair follicle. ""Indeed, exosomes from fibroblasts stimulate the secretion of Norrin, a ligand that activates the ß-catenin pathway that is involved in hair growth,"" said the company in a statement. Using biological models in vitro and ex vivo mimicking androgenetic alopecia, Silab has developed Hairgenyl, a natural active ingredient on the market capable of acting on this newly discovered exosomal communication system between the dermis and the hair follicle to stimulate the regrowth of hair. Hairgenyl was widely rewarded during its presentation in 2017 at the Latin America in-cosmetics show winning two innovation awards. These new data on the mechanism of action extend the findings from numerous tests already conducted on this natural ingredient."

A 100 percent natural ingredient for the beauty of African skins,"African skins have the reputation to produce more sebum and therefore to require skincare products adapted to their specific needs. Indeed, the overproduction of sebum and resulting shininess are a common concern when it comes to African skin. ""This skin also has a different composition of sebum and skin lipids, and shininess can be more pronounced,"" explains BASF Care Chemicals in a release. According to the Germany-based supplier of personal and home care ingredients, ""while 35 percent of people worldwide grapple with oily skin, the topical solutions available are often not suitable for African type of skin."" Oily skin is a result of hyperactive glands that produce sebum. The causes of this hyperactivity are manifold, ranging from hormonal changes, to environmental factors (e.g. weather or air pollution) and lifestyle (e.g. consumption of alcohol, a diet rich in dairy products and sugar). Launched at the beginning of this year, Bix'Activ [1] reduces sebum production by restraining the proliferation of sebocytes in sebaceous glands. In addition, it blocks the signal that induces hyper-keratinization and helps to refine pores as a result. Because it also keeps microbiome virulence at bay, the agent also helps in reducing skin blemishes, BASF claims. A placebo-controlled clinical study demonstrated the capacity of Bix'Activ to decrease the number of active sebaceous glands by more than 50 percent, and the follicular sebum excretion rate to fall by more than 70 percent. Lately, BASF has also checked the efficacy of Bix'Activ on oily African skins. An in-vivo study performed in 2018, had already demonstrated the ability of Bix'Activ to decrease sebaceous gland activity, pore size and skin imperfection in an Asian population. A new placebo-controlled clinical study conducted in Mauritius has now confirmed the efficacy of Bix'Activ for the unique characteristics of the African skin type, too. ""The study showed a decrease in sebum excretion to the skin surface by 44 percent and an 11 percent reduction in shininess compared to the first day of the study (D0),"" BASF claims. Furthermore, in a self-assessment, a significant majority of volunteers reported an improvement in their skin's appearance. For instance, 93 percent perceived their skin to be less oily, while 90 percent felt their skin looked healthier. An extract of Red Lip Tree (Bixa Orellana) seeds, the active ingredient conforms to the COSMOS standard for natural and organic cosmetics and is suitable for use in NATRUE-certified formulations. The development of customized personal care products for African type skins is part of BASF's overall strategy to develop consumer-oriented solutions for the sub-Saharan African beauty market. Earlier this year, the supplier of personal care ingredients opened a R&D centre in Nigeria to better address the skin and hair care needs of African consumers."
Givaudan Active Beauty launches a natural alternative to cationic guar for hair conditioning,"Hair care is no exception to the general green trend impacting the personal care market. According to Givaudan Active Beauty, 91% of consumers are interested in the concept of clean beauty for hair care and seek products that are free from synthetics, preferring those made from natural ingredients [1]. To address this demand, researchers of Givaudan Active Beauty have developed Naturein Wheat Peptides [2], a new natural detangling active for hair care products obtained from wheat and crafted by green fractionation. Locally sourced in the region surrounding Givaudan Active Beauty's industrial facilities in France, the new ingredient is 100% natural. It has been developed to be used as a conditioner to smooth and detangle the hair. As such, it is an alternative to cationic guar, one of the most used chemical ingredients in the hair care market. It is mainly used as a conditioning agent in shampoos, hair conditioners and hair styling products. Actually, cationic molecules are obtained by chemical modifications to give them a positive charge. These molecules include among other the polyquaternium family, and hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride - modified guar or starch polymers. They are mostly non-biodegradable and considered as bringing extra pollution to aquatic environments. Replacing modified guar polymers by clean and natural solutions would therefore bring important benefits to the shampoos and conditioners markets. Clinical tests have been performed to evaluate the impact of Naturein Wheat Peptides on wet and dry hair. Two double blind and placebo-controlled studies were carried out, each of them on 40 volunteers. In each study, 20 volunteers applied placebo and 20 volunteers applied shampoo with Naturein Wheat Peptides at 3% or Hydroxylpropyl Guar Hydroxylpropyltrimonium chloride at 0.3%. The results, as unveiled by Givaudan, show that the wheat peptides extract significantly improved (+20%) the detangling on wet hair (versus +15% with 0.3% cationic guar). In addition, it significantly improves (+22%) the combing and smoothness of dry hair (versus 5% with 0.3% cationic guar). Two additional effective results have also been perceived by the panel: after applying the active product, 80% of the participants said their hair did feel good (versus 40% of those who used the placebo) and 70% said that their hair was easier to untangle (versus 45% of those who used the placebo). ""To prove the effectiveness of our natural active ingredient, we opted for tests that put Naturein Wheat Peptides in competition with cationic guar. Results prove that it is more effective in record time. All clinical tests carried out on a hundred people demonstrate the excellence of Naturein Wheat Peptides,"" said Amandine Scandolera, Ph.D, Head of Biological Evaluation. To illustrate how this new ingredient can be used, Givaudan has formulated a leave-in conditioning spray using Naturein Wheat Peptides and ResistHyal, a hair beauty enhancer containing an optimised ratio of low and high molecular weight hyaluronic acids. These two hair care actives have been mixed with Buruti and Moringa oils for repair and Saffron flower and guarana extract to strengthen the hair. Givaudan will present the illustrative formulation and the new ingredient at their booth during in-cosmetics Latin America in Sấo Paulo from 18-19 September."
New Generation skin care active ingredients adapted to modern lifestyles,"What are the functions of the skin? Edith Filaire - The skin is our largest organ, and provides our organism integrity and identity. It allows exchange with our environment, while simultaneously mediating protection from it. The skin balances body temperature and moisture, protects from UV light, transmits sensations, and represents a tight barrier against myriad microbes, toxins, and other dangers. Historically, the skin was seen as an organ comprising an outermost layer, the epidermis, and a subjacent connective tissue, the dermis. Whereas the epidermis comprises different stages of differentiated keratinocytes building up a layer of cornified cells, the stratum corneum (SC), which creates a mechanical barrier against potentially harmful invaders. The dermis is a rich collection of collagen fibres, fibroblasts, and nerve endings. While these distinct anatomical layers are critical to our understanding of the organization of the skin, they accomplish many disparate functions. Currently, researchers divide the skin into four, carefully orchestrated, functional levels of the cutaneous barrier: the microbiome barrier, the chemical barrier, the physical barrier, and the immune barrier. These developed during evolution and function to both stabilize and restore cutaneous homeostasis and to mount measures of defense when needed. Alterations in each component of the skin barrier can cause pathogenic conditions, such as skin infections, skin inflammation, allergic sensitization. Consequently, the best possible understanding of the functioning of the different parts of the cutaneous barrier is a prerequisite to develop strategies to conserve the integrity of the skin and to support the recovery of disturbed barriers. What is the skin exposed to nowadays? Edith Filaire - The skin receives a lot of stressors named Exposome. Exposome is the totality of specific and nonspecific external environmental exposures to which a subject is exposed and their consequences at the organ and cell levels. Among the best-studied environmental factors of the specific external exposome, indoor and outdoor aeroallergens and air pollutants play a key role in the etiopathogenesis of the inflammatory response to allergens and in clinical manifestations of allergic disease. Climate change, urbanization, and loss of biodiversity affect sources, emissions, and concentrations of main aeroallergens and air pollutants and are among the most critical challenges facing the health and quality of life of the still increasing number of allergy and skin diseases such as acne. How to prevent these aggressions? Edith Filaire - Environmental insults such as ultraviolet (UV) rays from sun, cigarette smoke exposure and pollutants, and the natural process of aging contribute to the generation of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that stimulate the inflammatory process in the skin, playing an important role in the intrinsic and photoaging of human skin in vivo. Strategies to prevent photodamage caused by this cascade of reactions initiated by these stressors include among another, prevention of UV penetration into skin by physical and chemical sunscreens, prevention/reduction of inflammation using anti‐inflammatory compounds (e.g. cyclooxygenase inhibitors, inhibitors of cytokine generation), scavenging and quenching of ROS by antioxidants, inhibition of neutrophil elastase activity to prevent extracellular matrix damage and inhibition of MMP expression and activity. What is Greentech developing in this area? Edith Filaire - In this field, Greentech is at the forefront! For many years, we have developed active ingredients allowing a global protection of the skin against pollution. Urbalys® protects against biological attacks from daily urban pollution in all its forms, by activating skin's own lines of defense and cell detoxification. Urbalys® permits an effective global action, triggered when there is contact or penetration by pollutants: a double defence mechanism fights both free radical stress and inflammation, and strengthens the cutaneous barrier. Alerted and mobilised against all daily pollutants, the skin breathes again. It recovers balance and radiance, a smooth texture and a glowing complexion. Aware of the deleterious effects of Exposome, Greentech developed an alga-based active ingredient to fight against reactive and sensitive skin: Expozen®. The skin is the organ that protects the body from the outside environment, but it's also the mirror of our way of life. It is therefore directly impacted by the Exposome, including environmental stressors (UV, pollution, cold…). Expozen® limits neurogenic inflammation, strengthens skin barrier and reduces sensitive skin symptoms such as itching, pain and flushes. It also shows a soothing effect on agressed, reactive and intolerant skin, calming feelings of discomfort and redness. It also maintains bacterial diversity, reduces species involved in inflammation and redness and promotes strains known to be beneficial for skin as Staphylococcus epidermidis. At the same time, Expozen® decreases levels of Corynebacterium Kroppenstedtii, a novel target for the control of skin redness. The skin is less flushed, more comfortable and more radiant. In this same area, Greentech developed Soliberine®. It acts against all damages induced by solar rays, including blue light, thanks to a dual power of protection and stimulation. Soliberine® limits acute and chronic inflammation by decreasing the release of inflammatory mediators and inhibiting erythema formation. It also reduces hyperpigmentation and appearance of sunburn cells. The youthful appearance of the skin is preserved by preventing irritation, dryness, occurrence of dark spots and premature wrinkling of the skin. Finally, one of our latest actives, Hebelys®, is based on a new concept in cosmetics related to a psychobiological and systemic approach: the Positive Aging. We focused on the population above 60 years old, which in 2050 will represent 33.5% of the world's population. Today's population expects to live longer but in good health. The trend is all about living a good life, in good shape and the most of all : living happily. The Well and Happy Aging will be the must in the cosmetic field of tomorrow, and it starts now! Hebelys® boosts the cutaneous architecture and maintains skin's beauty after 60 years old. Acting on the key markers of senescence, it limits the deleterious of senescent and maintain the biomechanical properties of skin. Moreover, Hebelys has emotional benefits, increasing self-esteem (Rosenberg test, 1965) and improvement of global mood state (Profile of Mood State, McNair and al., 1971). Greentech is a pioneer in Positive Aging and at the forefront of the innovation in this field. About Edith Filaire Edith Filaire obtained her PhD from the University of Clermont-Ferrand in 1997. She has worked in major French universities (Lyon 1). From 2006 to 2018, she was full Professor and -co director of a Research laboratory at Orleans-Paris Saclay.

A strong innovation strategy drives Chemyunion's international growth,"Founded in 1992, Chemyunion was initially dedicated to the production of emulsifying waxes. In 2002, the company initiated an open innovation strategy to address the needs of other markets. The first active skin care ingredients were launched in 2005. Today, the company's portfolio offers more than 250 skin and hair care ingredients. In 2010, Chemyunion entered a new era by investing in supercritical extraction technology in order to develop innovative plant-based ingredients in line with the clean beauty criteria. ""Supercritical extraction provides us a great competitive advantage. We have been focusing on this clean technology for over ten years, with investments worth US $ 2 million. We are currently the only company in Brazil, and probably in South America, to have this technology"", stresses Sérgio C. Gonçalves, the group's Marketing Director. To continue growing, Chemyunion has expanded their activities to other markets such as the United States, where they opened an office in 2015, and Colombia, where it created, in 2017, Chemyunion Andina SAS. At the same time, the Group has gradually established itself as a leading partner on the international scene, thanks to its technical-commercial team and distributor network. ""About 30% of our revenues come from exports to China, Colombia, the United States, Europe, India, Mexico, among others. Our goal for the next two years is that exports will correspond to 40%"", completes Sérgio C. Goncalves. With the objective of establishing a business base in Europe, the company has currently opened an office in Portugal and, in the medium term, will also open another one in Spain. In Brazil, Chemyunion is a partner of leading players of the cosmetics industry, particularly hair care manufacturers, as this is the country's largest category. ""As far as exports are concerned, the most important category for Chemyunion is skin care, but we also have a great development potential in the hair care market,"" says Sérgio C. Gonçalves. Innovation is an integral part of the company's strategy. ""It is the key to success,"" says the marketing director. Over the past three years, Chemyunion has invested BRL 13 million (about EUR 2.8 million or USD 3.15 million) in their Sorocaba factory, located one hour from the city of São Paulo. Out of about 130 employees, 20% work in the company's R&D department. ""We want to be recognized as an innovative company that works with cutting-edge technology, a company that can accept challenges and meet market needs, positioned as the main reference for its customers,"" continues Sérgio C. Gonçalves. Currently, 17% of Chemyunion's net sales are invested in innovation and 7% in research and development. An excellent illustration is the investment the company made in the supercritical CO2 extractor, the only one in Brazil to date, and in botanical research for the development of natural ingredients. The company cultivates its own plants on the outskirts of the factory and owns 5 hectares of farmland where more than 100 plant species are grown. The next steps involve the development of probiotics and prebiotics as well as recombinant peptides - but this requires new facilities and hiring more professionals. The dermocosmetics sector, which is recording significant growth in Brazil, is also one of Chemyunion's research and development priorities. Eventually, the company has projected to invest USD 3 million in the expansion of its factory in São Paulo."
Lavender back in fashion with French farmers,"Working its way across a purple-green field in southern France, a claw-fitted tractor harvests plants of lavender destined to become essential oil as a traditional sector stages a modest comeback. ""They are slightly grey because they are starting to wilt, it is the best point for the quantity and quality of essential oils,"" explains Vincent Jamonet who runs the operation in the Drôme region of southeastern France. The plants are fed into a hopper and taken to a nearby distillery. Also nearby, fields of lavandin, a hybrid variety that provides greater quantity and resists bacteria, soak up the sun against a muted backdrop of the Vercors mountain range. The scent of Lavandin resembles that of camphor, which is not a sweet-smelling as lavender. The Jamonet family have planted 100 hectares (250 acres) of aromatic plants, one-fifth of which are organic. They hope to extend their crop surface to 150 hectares in the future. One motivation is to improve regional biodiversity, another is that ""revenues are a little better than with crops like corn, wheat or barley,"" Jamonet says. Thanks to the increasing popularity of aromatherapies, French lavender is staging a comeback from years of decline brought on by bacterial infestations. Perfume plants that can also be used in cosmetics, medicines and household products ""are the only crop in France whose surface is increasing,"" notes Laurent Quadrio of the regional Drôme agriculture organisation. They still represent a tiny fraction of the country's millions of hectares of cultivated land, but have expanded from 2010 to 2016 by around 40 percent to 53,000 hectares (130,000 acres), while cropland in general is being nibbled away by spreading urban areas. The number of producers has grown from 1,000 to around 1,400 and France now also has 120 distilleries. ""It's a sector where you can earn a living, and where young farmers can get started,"" says Alain Aubanel, head of the Cihef federation that follows essential oil production. Oil from lavender destined for perfumes, aromatherapy and cosmetics sells for around 100 to 150 euros ($110-$170) a kilo, while lavandin, used in detergents and soaps, sold last year for 28-40 euros, which was nonetheless a rise of 20 percent from the previous year and 30 percent over the past five years, Aubanel says. However, France now has to contend with Bulgaria, which became the world leader in traditional lavender production last year and is aiming for a record crop in 2019, he notes. With Bulgaria aiming to produce 600 tonnes this year, double its output in 2018, it will surpass French production by five times. Instead of trying to compete on volume or cast, French farmers are aiming to produce a higher quality product. ""A modest wine from the Ardeche region is not the same as a great Bordeaux,"" Aubenal says by way of analogy. ""The big French companies, Dior, Chanel, Guerlain, L'Occitane, L'Oreal, Yves Rocher all buy French lavender,"" he adds. Latest innovation in fragrances, including the increasing use of natural and locally sourced ingredients, will be discussed at the next edition of the Fragrance Innovation Summit in Paris on November 7th, 2019.

Imerys' mineral exfoliating pearls move on to colour,"At this year's in-cosmetics Global, Imerys showcased a full range of spherical, coloured perlites developed using patented technology with the aim to provide new aesthetic effects in exfoliating products. The new ImerScrub range is currently available in five different shades: jade, coral, gold, amber and plum. According to Imerys, high colour stability is one of the main interests of the new range, as it prevents any migration to the formula. Coloured beads facilitate the creation of colourful aesthetic effects that are highly appreciated by consumers. However, the need to be combined with white pearls to maintain the exfoliating effect. ""This new coloured range is a huge step forward for the replacement of plastic beads in cosmetics with natural ingredients. It opens new horizons for our customers through minerals in cosmetics and rounds out the current white scrub range perfectly,"" says Thierry Casteran, Global Business Development Director - Personal Care at Imerys. Imerys' perlite products are made from a volcanic rock which contains 2-6% water in its inner structure. When heated to around 900°C, the water trapped within the structure is vaporized, causing the material to expand and form a spherical structure. The white ImerCare P-Scrub range and new coloured ImerScrub range have been developed using patented engineered technology which combines the natural hardness of the volcanic rock with the softness of these spherical particles to provide a gentle, physical exfoliation effect."
Clariant rethinks anti-aging skin care with a superfood of the sea,"On the occasion of in-cosmetics Global 2019, the Germany-headquartered specialty chemical company debuted a new seaweed active ingredient pioneering a new cellular target to improve the appearance of the skin. Derived from Laminaria japonica (Kelp or Kombu), Epseama targets long non-coding RNA nc886 to improve signs of rejuvenate skin and reinvigorate its self-defense abilities. ""Commonly known causes of aging are the genetically-determined factors (chronoaging), extrinsic factors like UV exposure (photoaging), and chronic inflammation,"" explains Clariant. Epseama does not address these factors separately but goes down to the root cause they trigger. It does so by targeting the long non-coding RNA, called ""nc886"", recently recognized as a key regulator of PKR, a protein known for inducing premature aging. A research by Clariant Active Ingredients, demonstrated the correlation between aging and the decrease of nc886 expression. Thus, when properly expressed nc886 is a fundamental player in the rejuvenation of skin. The new seaweed active ingredient targets chronoaging, photoaging and inflammaging at once and gets to the heart of these problems by addressing the real cause of aging by reverting the natural increases of nc886 production in order to prevent damage to the dermal-epidermal junction. In vitro and ex vivo tests have confirmed that Epseama improves the skin appearance by reducing wrinkles, skin roughness and skin dehydration. ""It prevents collagen IV degradation through direct inhibition of MMP-9, and boosts it so that the junction between the epidermis and dermis is strengthened. Epseama heightens keratinocytes proliferation by improving the synthesis of CD44 hyaluronic acid receptors. It also enhances epidermis thickness, and inhibits the inflammasome pathway,"" claims Clariant. The ingredient's performance is confirmed in clinical trials on 19 women over 50 after only four weeks. Difficult to remove nasolabial wrinkles are smoothed - reduced by 19% in volume and 10% in roughness after only four weeks. Spots decreased by 10% and skin moisture levels increased by 14.2%. ""By 2050, the over-60s are projected to make up over 21% of the global population [1]. This, together with the increasing middle-aged population, presents a big opportunity for Personal Care to contribute new approaches to aging and wellness. Understanding the biological processes that influence skin aging processes makes us better placed to focus our innovation on advanced ingredients to delay it. By uniquely targeting nc886, Epseama offers formulators a new source of rejuvenation erasing age-related and photo-related signs, tackling the true causes of skin aging with an ingredient derived from the sea,"" said Julie Droux, Senior Technical Marketing Specialist, Clariant Active Ingredients. According to Technavio, the global anti-aging products market size will grow by USD 17.2 billion during 2019-2023 [2], with the increasing older population between the ages of 30-45 and motivation to look younger among the key drivers for this expansion."
Chemyunion launches a new plant-derived deodorant active and targets global markets,"Hebeatol Plus DEO is a xylitol ester with an antimicrobial activity and deodorant function. According to Chemyunion, this new active can be used as a safe substitute to triclosan or farnesol in traditional deodorant formulations. This ingredient of vegetable origin is obtained from xylitol and caprylic acid. Xylitol is a pentol sugar, which main industrial source is the reuse of grain by-products (i.e. corncobs), while caprylic acid, is obtained from plant-based oils extracted in a sustainable way and certified by RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil). ""In addition to being obtained from renewable sources, the synthetic route of Hebeatol Plus DEO has been developed to meet most of the requirements of an ecologically-friendly process, generating a 100% biodegradable molecule,"" claims Chemyunion. The inhibition of the skin's bacterial and fungal flora is one of the main ways to control the body's unpleasant odours. However, health concerns linked to anti-microbial actives have sparkle intensive researches for a broader range of efficient actives from natural origin. According to Chemyunion, Hebeatol Plus DEO eliminates 99.9% of odour causing microorganisms. The non-ionic surfactant molecule reduces surface tension of liquids and increases solubility of materials thus reducing the adherence of microorganisms on the skin. Already a huge player in Brazil, Chemynunion has been expanding fast into international markets recently. Recently, the company has strengthened its commercial team in the North America with two new appointments: Marisol Bello has joined the company as Senior Account Manager, responsible for the Chemyunion Inc. business in the Northeast United States, and Melanie Joink was appointed as Account Manager Western Region."
Seqens uses blockchain register to guarantee traceability of organic actives,"The platform developed by Seqens, called ACT4S, for Active Cosmetic Trust for Seqens, makes it possible to track the journey of the company's organic-certified cosmetic actives, from the receipt of the raw materials down to the release of the product to be delivered to the customer. Technically, a blockchain stores and transfers information sent by different users to a database, whose internal links are verified and clustered in blocks at regular time intervals, forming a chain - the whole is secured by cryptography. The idea is to protect data from any falsification or modification. As part of a manufacturing process, every step is recorded in a digital register whose transparency and distributed management prevents any unilateral modification. ""The blockchain technology makes it possible for us to guarantee compliance with our internal processes and organic certification processes in real time, for every single batch. It provides additional assurance, because the Ecocert certification is only focused on the quality system. Thanks to the blockchain, we can validate all our operations in real time,"" explains Marie-Alex Premier, VP Cosmetic Division at Seqens. In practice, Seqens's customers only need to enter their batch number on the ACT4S.com website to track the journey of the organic active they purchased. This way, they can check the validity of the raw material's Cosmos/Ecocert certificate and trace the history of the ingredient within the company, from the storage of raw materials to the issuance of the final active's Cosmos/Ecocert certificate, including the manufacturing process and storage, in order to verify compliance with the Cosmos/Ecocert requirements. ""The blockchain follows the product throughout our internal process, so it guarantees compliance with the organic standard throughout the manufacturing and storage process,"" adds Marie-Alex Premier. ""It guarantees the organic origin of the raw materials and the compliance of the final active."" And for even more transparency, Seqens has planned to give Ecocert access to the platform in real time, so that the quality system control becomes almost instantaneous. Thanks to this system, the company has full control over the quality chain. ""If there is an error within the chain, the blockchain systematically prevents the product from being marketed,"" explains the company. Right now, the use of the platform is limited to the group's internal value chain, but it is to be deployed more widely. And if the practical obstacles are obvious, from a technical standpoint, nothing prevents the company from going farther, by integrating everything upstream and downstream. For example, anyone could trace the active up to the supplier, and even the field, or down to the final product. In the long run, the blockchain technology could make it possible for consumers to find out by which farmers and in which fields the botanical actives contained in their cosmetics were produced. A future revolution!"
Mibelle launches superfruits and honey derived skin care actives,"Swiss-based Mibelle Biochemistry builds on their expertise in biotechnology and biochemistry with the launch of two new cosmetic actives: PhytoCellTec Goji, which scooped a bronze award in the category ""Cosmetic actives and naturals - anti-ageing"" at in-cosmetics Global, and Black BeeOme, which was awarded Gold, in the ""Natural products: ingredients"" category. Derived from stem cells of the goji berries, a super-fruit native to south east Europe and Asia, PhytoCellTec Goji encourages fibroblasts to produce more collagen and elastin via a new mechanism of action: – By revitalizing mesenchymal stem cells ""MSCs"" (notably found in the hypodermis and involved in regeneration processes). – By increasing their release of exosomes, the transport vesicles allowing cell-to-cell communication. In vitro studies showed that PhytoCellTec Goji revitalizes aged mesenchymal stem cells and boosts their exosome production, thus resulting in an improved production of collagen and elastin by fibroblasts. In placebo-controlled clinical studies, treatment with PhytoCellTec Goji increased skin density, reduced wrinkle depth and visibly improved the oval face shape. According to Mibelle, PhytoCellTec Goji thus allows a visible oval face rejuvenation in just 1 month. Black BeeOme, Mibelle's second launch at in-cosmetics, takes advantage of two strong beauty trends: bee beauty and skin microbiome. The active is an extract of honey produced by the Swiss Black Bee (Apis mellifera mellifera nigra) - a sub-species of European honey bee - fermented by the bacterium Zymomonas mobilis, which ferments only simple sugars and leaves complex sugars intact. BlackBeeOme was tested in vivo and in vitro. According to Mibelle it restores the skin microbiota and like so, makes the skin more resistant and more radiant (the skin is less oily, better hydrated and more uniform)."
Cosmetics enter the age of emotion,"Happiness and well-being molecules are the latest trend in cosmetic and skin care products. The craze for cannabidiol-based (CBD) cosmetics is certainly one the clearest signs of how the ""happy skin"" trend is growing. However, regulatory hurdles linked to the use of this substance encourage cosmetic actives manufacturers to turn to other molecules. At the in-cosmetics Global tradeshow, which was held in Paris at the beginning of the month, Givaudan launched Sensityl, an active cosmetic ingredient developed from microalgae with powerful soothing effects and the ability to positively influence consumers' mood. ""Consumers have fewer and fewer problems accepting their wrinkles,"" said Pauline Martin, Global Communications & Events Manager at Givaudan. ""However, they want to feel well with their age."" To demonstrate the effects of their ingredient on the consumer's mood, Givaudan used test protocols developed within its fragrance division. ""The main mission of the beauty industry is to bring emotion to consumers. Now we are able to demonstrate this effect scientifically,"" added Pauline Martin. In the same vein, Seqens tested the emotional impact of Glycuron 2.78, a biotech active promoting hydration and skin regeneration which was launched at in-cosmetics 2019 in Paris. Evaluated in a placebo-controlled study according to a protocol developed by Spincontrol, Glycuron 2.78 has demonstrated its ability to significantly enhance self-image perception. ""Self-image perception is a key element within the well-aging trend, which is a major change in the way women perceive their age,"" says Aïna Queiroz, Innovation and Scientific Communication Manager at Seqens. This point of view is also shared by Solabia. According to the French supplier, ""today, consumers do no longer want to hide their wrinkles by any possible means, first of all they want to be in harmony with their body and image."" Solabia thus launched 3Dermilyn at in-cosmetics, a new active ingredient obtained from plantain (Plantago lanceolate) seeds, organically and sustainably grown in France and offering a high content mucilage. 3Dermilyn is a polysaccharide that has the ability to retain large amounts of water. According to Solabia, the active has three types of action on the skin: a structural action by strengthening the -deep architecture, sensorial action thanks to a unique touch, and an emotional action, by regenerating natural soothing abilities and limiting the consequences of stress. In an in vitro placebo-controlled study, 3Dermilyn showed its capacity to increase the release of dopamine (+19%) and serotonin (+12%), two molecules known for their positive effects on mood. Can consumers expect to reach unrivalled levels of happiness and wellbeing thanks to soon-to-be-launched revolutionary creams? Some suppliers call for more caution as some claims might be seen as exaggerated. ""The links between physiological and psychological well-being have been known for a long time,"" highlighted Edith Filaire, Scientific Director at Greentech. ""We know that aging is linked to a decrease in self-esteem. These psychological changes can also be related to changes in hormonal levels. The application of a skincare cream can improve wellness, but the effect must be quantified using scientifically validated tests."" With this in mind, Greentech presented at in-cosmetics the results of new studies for Hebelys, a cosmetic active dedicated to mature skin launched in 2018 in partnership with biotech company Deinove. Tested on a panel of 24 volunteers of 60-70 years, Hebelys has demonstrated a positive impact on self-esteem (+10.5%) and on the general mood (+9%). The emotional approach undoubtedly offers new innovation opportunities for the cosmetics industry. However, brands and suppliers will have to take care to strongly substantiate their claims as part of a more holistic conception of beauty."
"Algaenia, a new natural cosmetic active ingredient for sensitive skins by Expanscience","Endowed with very beneficial qualities, microalgae and the infinite variety of molecules they produce are the new favourite in the cosmetics industry. Expanscience Laboratories were no exception this year, with the launch of Algaenia at the in-cosmetics show. Originating from the acid lakes of Patagonian volcanoes, the microalga used for Algaenia is able to survive in a hostile environment. The alga is cultivated of 5,000-liter tubular photobioreactors, using an innovative technological process that has been patented by Microphyt, a French biotech company and Expanscience partner. This cellular culture gives rise to a biomass from which the microalga peptides used by Expanscience are extracted. Algaenia stands out for its ability to protect sensitive skin. The microalga's peptides act on the different layers of the human epidermis. They protect sensitive skin from inflammation and allergens through a softening, moisturizing and soothing action. Two clinical studies have validated these results. The first, carried out on 20 subjects, showed a significant decrease in an erythema caused by a chemical agent on skin protected by Algaenia compared to a placebo. The second confirmed the soothing and moisturizing potential of the active ingredient. Thirty-six women with ""sensitive"" skin noted a marked improvement in their cutaneous barrier (less inflammation, improved hydration, noticeably soothed) after 28 days of use, and 85% of these women responded in a positively to the satisfaction survey made after the study. In order to meet new demands from consumers, the extraction industry has begun a ""green revolution"" by carrying out a technological mutation toward eco-design. With this in mind, the ERI 360° (Eco Responsible Ingredient) label - which was launched in 2018 - provides an analytical grid featuring 100 SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Recognized and Transparent) indicators to assess the sustainability of cosmetic ingredients. Like seven other cosmetic actives from the Expanscience portfolio, Algaenia has been awarded the ERI 360 ° label. ""This recognition highlights our involvement and our demands with respect to the eco-responsibility of our active ingredients, which is in line with our CSR approach,"" states Armelle le Peniec, Director of Cosmetic Active Ingredients for Expanscience Laboratories. Skinhairgium Bio wins the Green Ingredient Silver Award This eco-socio-designed hair care active is derived from the maca plant, which is grown organically in Peru and sourced by Expanscience via a responsible supply-chain under the control of UEBT (Union for Ethical BioTrade). Certified ERI 360, this active won the ""Green Ingredient"" Silver Award at the in-cosmetics show 2019."
Gattefossé: A natural emulsifier for silicon-free make-up and sun care products,"With the aim to meet an increasing consumer demand for natural colour cosmetics and sunscreens, Gattefossé has been working for six years to find a composition that provides a concrete solution to natural water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion issues. ""We have carefully selected three raw materials that are reacted together by esterification and interesterification. The association of a low freeglycerol grade of polyglycerol-6, 12-hydroxystearic acid and ricinoleic acid allow us to obtain a supple structure that stabilizes without need for a co-emulsifier. The insaturated chain brings fluidity to the final emulsion and gives textures that present easy spreading capacity,"" explains Maxime Nollet, research scientist specialized in lipid chemistry at Gattefossé. Dubbed Emulium Illustro, an innovative W/O emulsifier of natural origin, designed principally for pigmented formulations and sing a patented technology based upon polyglycerol esters. According to Gattefossé, Emulium Illustro demonstrates superior performance and stability compared to other W/O emulsifiers on the market. ""Flexible, easy to use and suitable for cold processing, this new ingredient enables the formulation of fluid textures that are comfortable to wear and bring a soft and hydrated feel to the skin,"" highlights the French supplier of cosmetic ingredients, a renown specialist in lipid chemistry and plant extraction. Of particular interest in colour and sunscreen formulations, Emulium Illustro can also be used to formulate innovative textures for skincare. ""Guided by colour formulation experts, we have placed pigments at the heart of the research from day one. The emulsions were constructed around pigments, taking into consideration different types of coating as well as uncoated materials. We have performed many tests with Emulium Illustro to explore it from every angle: compatibility with cosmetic ingredients, stability, sensoriality and clinical evaluation. We have also developed many formulations to demonstrate its interest in make-up, sun care and skincare. Our fully natural foundation was evaluated in a consumer test on a panel composed of habitual users of silicone foundations. The panellists were thrilled by both the performance of the natural foundation and the appearance of their skin after use. This is the best reward we could have hoped for,"" concludes Malorie Duvent, formulation scientist at Gattefossé. Emulium Illustro receives the Gold Innovation Award at in-cosmetics Global Emulium Illustro scooped the Gold Innovation Award in the Functional Ingredient category at in-cosmetics Global last week in Paris. ""Gattefossé truly believes that natural alternatives can meet or surpass the performance of conventional cosmetics ingredients. The great feedback received from the panellists who tested Emulium Illustro was a reward in itself. This in-cosmetics Gold innovation award is a fantastic recompense for all our teams who have contributed to the conception and development of this new launch and I am confident in its future success,"" commented Paula Lennon, Gattefossé Group Director for Personal care."
The in-cosmetics trade show to unveil the latest cosmetics trends in Paris,"Estimated at US$ 21.4 million in 2018, the global market for cosmetic ingredients is expected to reach US$ 26.8 billion in 2020. This rapid growth in value is boosted by the development of emerging markets, particularly in Asia, but also by a higher valuation of ingredients whose properties are substantiated by stronger scientific background and whose origin is more and more natural. Due to the strong demand from consumers and to new regulations, sustainability and naturalness should once again top discussions and trends at the show. Among the sustainable solutions, upcyling seems to be on the rise. Biolie, for instance, has built its image on this principle: it offers a complete enzymatic cracking of the plant material originating from the waste of other industries such as off-sized vegetables or seeds which have lost their ability to germinate. In line with this upcycling principle, the Italian company Akott offers the Italine range from co-products of the food industry, the BioNap exploits co-products from Mediterranean agriculture and Expanscience boasts 64% of upcycled products in its catalogue of actives. Polymer manufacturers are also following suit by improving the biodegradability of their materials. Initially originating from organic synthesis, polymers tend to become bio-sourced. ""We strive to meet customer demand. For the past 10 years, Covestro has been focusing on the issue, resulting in the launch of Baycusan Eco E 1000 which contains 58% bio-based carbon and whose hair care performances are similar to traditional film-formers"", explained Mélanie Dick, Marketing Manager, Cosmetics at Covestro. For its part, Roelmi HPC proposes alternatives to plastic microbeads with its Tselus-Bi Feel range based on corn starch and polyvinyl alcohol.

Givaudan: A soothing marine active with dual benefits on beauty and well-being,"Sensityl is a patent-pending active cosmetic ingredient developed from microalgae in Givaudan's Marine Biotechnology Centre of Excellence based in Brittany, France, which fuses nature and scientific expertise to offer consumers dual benefits on beauty and well-being. According to Givaudan, Sensityl is the first of its kind ingredient to positively influence consumers' mood after just one month of use, owing to its powerful soothing benefits. Exploiting new neuroscience protocols, researchers have shown that volunteers using Sensityl expressed a real positive change in how they felt about their facial skin moving from negative feelings to positive ones, due to the ingredient's soothing benefits compared to a placebo. ""Capitalising on our leading understanding of the effect of fragrances on the brain in our state-of-the-art Sensory Centre of Excellence in Ashford, Givaudan expands its research in cosmetics and well-being with the launch of Sensityl. It will revolutionise the beauty market by developing products acting on people's mood thanks to its exceptional soothing benefits,"" highlighted Laurent Bourdeau, Head of Givaudan Active Beauty. In line with Givaudan's sustainability approach, Sensityl also innovates responsibly thanks to state-of-the-art biotechnological processes that preserve resources. ""We are very proud of this unique cosmetic breakthrough originating from our research on marine biotechnology, one of the most innovative sustainability pillars of Active Beauty. It reflects our deep willingness to offer our customers not only new, but also natural and sustainable products that meet consumers' needs,"" said Maurizio Volpi, President of Givaudan's Fragrance Division."
Seqens enhances self-image perception with new biotech ingredient,"Capitalizing on their expertise in biotechnology, Seqens has developed a high molecular weight polysaccharide rich in uronic acid. Produced by Alteromonas sp strain, Glycuron 2.78 is an exopolysaccharide able to interact with DC-sign lectin [1] and Rhamnose receptor, respectively involved in inflammation and dermo-epidermal regeneration. Clinical tests run on a 1% Glycuron 2.78 cream versus placebo showed statistically significant results after 28 days, on hydration and a trend in favour of the Glycuron 2.78 cream regarding skin evenness and texture. Furthermore, Seqens has evaluate the emotional impact of Glycuron 2.78 versus placebo. The company used Spincontrol's patented technique Emospin, which is based on prosody (voice loudness and frequency) measurement and verbatim analysis. The study shows that Glycuron 2.78 cream is able to significantly enhance self-image perception (what would you say of yourself), and projected halo perception (what do you think others think about yourself). Placebo did not generate any significant change in prosody or verbatim. At in-cosmetics Global, Seqens will also launch Megabiotic-44 a Pre and Postbiotics complex derived from Lactobacillus bulgaricus GLB44, a microorganism already used in the food industry. In the cosmetic version developed for topical use, micro-organisms have been inactivated while keeping their probiotically produced bactericide peptides. In vitro tests have shown the ability of Megabiotic-44 to modulate both the skin microbiome and the strains targeted in the field of product preservation (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes). In addition, clinical tests have demonstrated that Megabiotic-44 introduced at 1% in a formulation is able to significantly reduce the number of visible pores together with pore size versus placebo after 28 days. Last but not least, Seqens is also adding ChemoxyCare 6 to their portfolio of functional ingrdients. ChemoxyCare 6 is a humectant and emollient which, according to Seqens, also shows very good preservative boosting properties while being odourless, colourless. Non-sensitizing, with light feel, ChemoxyCare 6 is especially adapted to Asian skins."
SEPPIC's poetic imagination serving their polymers,"Why did you decide to communicate about polymers? Corinne Stoltz - Our expertise in polymer science dates back nearly 30 years. We wanted to remind the young generation of formulators that SEPPIC was a pioneer in ""Hydro-Swelling Droplets"" polymers with the launch of SEPIGEL 305™ in 1990. Just a few magical drops can stabilize, thicken and texture emulsions with a cold process under the most extreme pH conditions, in the presence of electrolytes, etc. It was a real revolution back then! And we also wanted to remind everyone that our family of polymers is constantly evolving. Today, our innovations bring together technical and sensory performances with increasingly natural and sustainable sourcing, along with higher awareness of biodegradability. For example, our latest emulsifying polymer, SEPILIFE™ Nude, is part of an eco-designed generation. We started with polymers but, in the future, we will no doubt have the opportunity to communicate on other families of functional ingredients! SEPPIC's communication is original, both in its style and in its content… Corinne Stoltz - Indeed, we wanted to stand out with communication that is sincere, close to who we really are, but with a strong impact. I think you can see that in the style and in the content of our approach. The main video, the real cornerstone of the campaign, is an allegory full of grace and moisture. The storytelling created by MAKE IT BLOOM! makes an esthetic parallel between the polymer molecules dispersed in a liquid phase and the members of a artistic swimming team performing in a pool, which turns into a lake at the end of the film. A natural environment symbolizing our desire for an approach that is more environmentally friendly. Formulation and synchronized swimming both have an artistic dimension. They are esthetic, sensory and emotional while requiring the real technical expertise. The different networks formed by swimmers look like that of polymers in water. Thanks to these networks, our polymers address different technical challenges in formulation. These configurations symbolize also the link. On both a molecular and human level, this link provides stability to the formulas, relational solidity and success to projects. We greatly value the human contact between the sales, marketing and technical teams at SEPPIC and our customers. If it was not so important to us, we would no doubt not be the world leader in polymers for skin care. Why did you mainly want to communicate by video? Corinne Stoltz - Given the main media we use - social networks and trade shows - we wanted a simple, visual way of expressing ourselves. What could be better than a film to illustrate the grace and beauty of the swimmers' movements? Videos are the best way to reach our target audience: formulators, marketers and buyers! Alongside the main film, we have also made a collection of five short video clips running about two minutes each. They are in the form of interviews with various personalities in the SEPPIC network. Each one sheds light on a particular quality of our polymers. For example, Chantal Amalric, Beauty Care Strategic Marketing Manager & RSPO Coordinator, explains eco-design, while Sébastien Duprat de Paule talks about innovation since he's the Innovation Director. International managers also speak, such as Lillian Han, Asia Pacific Director, who points out the sensory advantages of our polymers and the specificities of her region. So even though SEPPIC designs and produces polymers in a French spirit, we wanted to point out the international scope of our markets. And to accompany these video tools, we also wanted to use this kind of interview so they could be relayed by the print and digital press for a 360° communication, faithful to our strategic choices in terms of messaging and our values, reflecting our spirit."
BASF opens a laboratory in Nigeria to better address the skin and hair care needs of African consumers,"BASF's Care Creations has officially opened its new Application Technology Laboratory for personal care and cosmetic products in Lagos, Nigeria. Part of BASF's global application technology network in 21 countries, the new laboratory is part of BASF's new regional headquarter for West Africa which was commissioned in Lagos in October last year and is at the pulse of one of the main sub-Saharan African personal care markets. BASF thus intends to offer a local technical service for African hair and skin care applications throughout sub-Saharan Africa. At the same time, the company strengthens its regional marketing and sales network. Beyond formulation support, this new laboratory will allow BASF to expand and develop consumer-relevant claim support for the needs of consumers in sub-Saharan Africa. ""Customized solutions meeting the specific requirements of consumers in different markets are key for business growth. With our broadened presence and the investment in a new Application Laboratory in sub-Saharan Africa, we can provide on-site technical expertise and market insights to our customers and support the local development of tailor-made products for the specific needs of African hair and skin,"" said Dirk Mampe, Vice President Business Management Personal Care Solutions Europe. Nigeria is one of the fastest-growing beauty markets in sub-Saharan Africa. However, local hair and skin and thus consumers' personal care regimens are widely different from many other regions, necessitating tailored cosmetic products. ""The unique African hair is typified by kinks and coils along the hair shaft, an elliptical cross-section, and fewer cuticle layers than other hair types. These characteristics make natural African hair more difficult to comb through and prone to breakage, necessitating a tailored care regimen to maintain healthy hair. Popular styles such as natural afro hair, chemically-relaxed hair, dreadlocked hair and the usage of styling tools, e.g. flat irons, also call for specialty products,"" said BASF. As with hair, African skin types have distinct characteristics. According to BASF, differences include a relatively high amount of protective melanin, skin lipids and sebum secretion, and a comparatively large pore area. ""An intensive and gentle cleansing combined with suitable skin care products can improve the skin texture by supporting the balance between moisture and sebum production,"" adds the company. The opening of this laboratory is therefore an important step in the creation of both hair and skin care applications to answer specific needs and trends of African consumers."
Silab: A new sensorial active ingredient for mature skins,"For the development of this new patented natural active, Silab took inspiration from recent studies showing the expression of epidermal receptors of smell and taste, whose stimulation enhances cutaneous regeneration (cell proliferation, migration, differentiation). Through new in vitro models, Silab has shown the expression and functioning of these receptors is disrupted in the course of aging. According to Silab, Sensorialine [1] thus allows to activate the epidermal olfactory and taste receptors and to favour epidermal renewal. In a clinical study, Sensorialine significantly reduces transepidermal water loss on both Caucasian and Asian volunteers after 14 days of twice daily treatment at 2.5% and compared to the placebo. In addition, a consumer test conducted on a panel with mature skin highlighted the moisturizing effect of Sensorialine. According to Silab, 85% of the panellists assessed their skin more moisturized from the first application, a statement also confirmed at 77% after 14 days of application. Moreover, almost half of them reported that the moisturizing effect lasted more than three hours after the first application. Sensorialine is derived from coconut (cocos nucifera) flour, a co-product obtained from cold-pressing the white flesh of the fruit. As part of their commitment in terms of eco-responsibility, Silab is sourcing its raw material in Sri Lanka, a country renowned for its traditional use of coconuts. The company, has selected its suppliers by favouring certified organic chains and production sites with good manufacturing practices label. ""Managing these supplies of coconut flour is the assurance of working with a traceable, secure and high quality raw material,"" highlights Silab. Sensorialine is available in aqueous solution (recommended amount: 0.5 to 2.5%) and is compliant with international cosmetic regulations (Europe, United Sates, Japan, China). Silab recognized for its approach in combating climate change Silab obtained an A- rating from CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project), a non-profit organization for climate change, water security and forests. ""Compared to the average score in the sector which is D, this rating recognizes the effectiveness of the company's ambitious actions to reduce carbon emissions,"" explains the company in a statement. One of the actions carried out in 2018 to protect the planet was the creation of an internal carbon fund."
BASF wants a simpler and faster formulation of cosmetics,"Presented the latest Cosmet'Agora trade show in Paris, BASF's ""Innovative Skincare Journey"" concept features one basic multi-purpose formulation which is adjusted in a second production phase. Various formulas can be created by carefully selecting additional ingredients (e.g. active ingredients) depending on the textures, senses and functions that want to be achieved. The aim is to help brands to address more easily the latest beauty trends. According to BASF, by allowing manufacturers to focus on only few ingredients, this technique helps them to easily ensure high transparency levels to consumers. Like other suppliers of cosmetic ingredients, BASF has made the shift towards more natural cosmetic products. Naturalness is the leading growth driver of the cosmetics industry today. About 130 ingredients developed by BASF for personal care applications have already been registered with COSMOS and more than 50 of the products are evaluated according to the NATRUE criteria. ""That makes BASF the largest provider of raw materials that are suitable for natural and organic cosmetic,"" said the company in a statement. Furthermore, BASF has reviewed its complete personal care portfolio according to the ISO 16128 standard criteria and calculating rules, providing manufacturers of cosmetic products with guidance and information on the degree of natural origin of the ingredients. [More than 250 of BASF's personal care ingredients meet the ISO definition as natural or derived natural->http://www.premiumbeautynews.com/en/basf-personal-care-expands-its,14103] with a share of at least 50 percent natural carbon atoms. In line with this trend, BASF presented four new products on the occasion of Cosmet'Agora: – Euperlan® OP White, a wax-based, readily-biodegradable and cold-processable white opacifier dispersion for surfactant formulations. – Cegesoft® Peel, an environmentally-friendly alternative to sharp-edged abrasives and non-degradable beads (often referred to as microplastic beads) consisting of spherically shaped wax beads that provide a gentle and mild exfoliation. – Emulgade® Sucro Plus and Eumulgin® VL 75, two new emulsifiers both completely natural-based and approved by COSMOS. ""The personal care market has become increasingly complex, evolving at an ever-faster pace. At the same time, consumers seek more transparency, particularly on the composition of a product and the details of the production chain. We support our customers in developing winning products that provide all the transparency consumers wish for,"" said Marine Belthé, Marketing Manager at BASF Personal Care Europe."
"Geotrends, new Seppic cosmetic formulations inspired by beauty trends","Taking inspiration from five global beauty trends - Personalized Beauty, Well-Being, Ethics, Inspiration from nature and Digitization - Seppic is showcasing a series of cosmetic formulations developed, with the help of its laboratory, to suit different lifestyles. Personalized Beauty, Do-It-Yourself is back among global trends. A Modisumer (= Modification + Consumer) personalizes their cosmetic product to use a formula: – 'Home-made' with known ingredients, – Unique and matched to their skin needs and their desire for texture, – Enhanced efficacy. Hence the need for a sound base, whatever the cocktail of active ingredients. To stabilize the DIY Dermocosmetic Skeleton after adding dermocosmetic actives such as urea, glycolic acid, Seppic therefore used Sepimax Zen a next-generation thickening, stabilizing and texturizing powder polymer. Minimalism, from Europe and Japan, is part of the Well-being trend. The consumer uses simple and transparent formulations containing ingredients essential for well-being. To address this trend, Seppic presents Adipo'Stop, a transparent minimalist slimming formulation containing a combination of two active ingredients - caffeine and Adipoless - that helps to beautify legs. Increasing consumer interest in labels and biodegradability is the main factor increasing demand in the global Ethical trend and Natural Products. To address this trend, Ethik'Biote Daily Care presents a natural body fluid for easily hydrated skin and a balanced microbiota with the active ingredient Equibiome derived from Burdock roots. It has been developed with a combo of natural and easily biodegradable ingredients: Fluidifeel Easy emulsifier, Emogreen L15 emollient and Solagum AX polymer. ""A light formulation with a nude skin feeling, ultra-soft on the body,"" highlights Seppic. Coming from Asia and the United States, 'Dirt Beauty' is inspired by nature (products based on seaweeds, clays, ashes, wood charcoal, probiotics...) and brings numerous benefits for the skin. The Trash Slime face mask uses the powers of red seaweed extract and of Contacticel, an active developed by Seppic to fight pollution due to PM2.5 particles. The 'slime' texture looks like as the children's 'slime' game and is inspired by tree sap. The combination of natural Solagum AX gum. Sepimax Zen stabilises the original elastic texture of the face mask and suspends the matcha tea, the only colour and perfume in the skincare product. A biomimetic mask from sap for anti-pollution effect! To be ready for a photo, a selfie at any moment, is part of the global Digitization trend with Instantaneous Effect. To keep photo-ready all along the day, Seppic therefore developed Insta-Aging fluid serum, a comprehensive anti-aging skincare, combining Sesaflash, an immediate tightener, and Aspar'Age, which protects young cells from contagious aging due to SMS (Senescence-Messaging Secretome)."
Givaudan aims to protect hair from free radical-induced whitening,"The loss of pigmentation in the hair shaft (hair greying) is one of the most obvious signs of ageing, and one of the main beauty concerns of ageing. Indeed, between 45 and 65 years old, 74% of the worldwide population is affected by greying hair. According to Givaudan Active Beauty, 59% of consumers are worried about hair ageing. Asians, especially Japanese and Chinese, are particularly concerned about hair whitening. While genes can play a large role in hair whitening, ""it is now well-known that free radicals are directly inducing the premature greying of hair for both men and women,"" explains the manufacturer of active cosmetic ingredients. To tackle this phenomenon, Givaudan's scientists have designed Darkenyl, an active cosmetic ingredient combining two synergistic molecules: the taxifolin glucoside (a stabilised plant polyphenol) and N-acetyl-tyrosine (a soluble precursor of melanin). According to Givaudan Active Beauty, Darkenyl fights against white hair through three main mechanisms: – Protection of hair follicles from oxidation. – Stimulation of hair follicle stem cells to create new melanocytes. – Melanogenesis activation to increase melanin production ""This mode of action is completely independent from gender, hair type or hair colour, making Darkenyl an ideal solution to universally target hair greying,"" says Givaudan. The ability of Darkenyl to stimulate hair follicle stem cells and the melanogenesis has been demonstrated by various in vitro tests. A clinical study versus placebo using white hair proportion scoring on hairlines and white hair density quantifying on a shaved scalp area have demonstrated the significant consumers' benefits of Darkenyl: in 4 months, volunteers had more than 3 times less white hair/cm2, with up to -56% reduction of white hair. Darkenyl was presented at the in-cosmetics Asia tradeshow, which was held in Bangkok, Thailand, from October 30 to November 01, 2018. To inspire beauty brands while showcasing the high potential of this new hair technology, Givaudan's experts crafted S3D Colourback, a repigmenting and conditioning serum to beautify and rejuvenate the hair. S3D Colourback features Darkenyl and ResistHyal, a hair conditionning active. The serum quickly penetrates into the scalp and spreads on the hair thanks to an innovative comb placed on the tube to facilitate a precise and effective application, directly on the roots. S3D Colourback was awarded in the haircare actives category at the show's Spotlight-On-Formulation Award competition. ""It is part of our corporate DNA to inspire our customers, by providing them with not only the most performant ingredients, but also by crafting disruptive product concepts leveraging consumers insights and market trends to help them move faster on their market,"" said Laurent Bourdeau, Head of Givaudan's Active Beauty."
Indie brands and new markets to take center stage at in-cosmetics North America show,"With a revenue reaching US$82,492m in 2018 [1] and sales forecasted to grow by 2.2% (CAGR) annually on 2018-2021, North America remains the world's largest personal care market. The skincare segment is leading the charge and is expected to hold 13-14% market share (US$20,116m) in 2018. The upcoming edition of in-cosmetics North America will therefore focus on the main innovations and trends that are impacting this key market, in particular the impact and need of indie brands that are taking the US by storm. The buzz surrounding indie brands in the cosmetics space in the US is further compounded by e-commerce giant Amazon recently announcing the advent of an Indie Beauty Shop within its Marketplace. With this in mind, in-cosmetics North America is dedicating a full session of its conference program to the biggest challenges facing this emerging group, such as distribution difficulties, entering consumer consciousness and keeping up with fast-moving trends.

Gattefossé launches a natural substitute for silicones in hair care products,"Gattefosé researchers have built on their knowledge in lipochemistry to develop an ingredient that mimics the beneficial conditioning and protective properties of hair sebum without the greasiness. Central to the composition are high molecular weight esters found in the hull of the sunflower seed and in jojoba seeds. These esters are reacted with polyglycerol to improve spreading on the hair surface and to ensure a homogeneous film. According to Gattefossé, tests show that hair regains hydrophobicity and is protected from humidity and frizz. The hair becomes easier to manage and is smooth to the touch, also style is maintained for longer. ""We have been working for several years to find a composition that can substitute silicones in hair treatment products. We discovered that naturally occurring sebum really is the best conditioner for hair. With over-washing, thermal aggression and pollution, sebum cannot always play the role it is designed for and hair becomes damaged and exposed,"" explains Vincent Hubiche, in charge of the applications' development for the Gattefossé Group. This is why the company has designed an ingredient with a chemical structure close to sebum. However, Definicire has slightly higher carbon chain lengths than sebum to optimize performance while avoiding greasiness. ""The sensory properties of the hair after treatment were key in this development. We fine-tuned the composition to avoid oiliness in appearance or on touch. Our teams in Singapore and in Brazil tested the formulations to evaluate the effectiveness of the humidity barrier. We are very satisfied with the results,"" added Hubiche."

Symrise is enhancing its fragrance palette,"With the strategic objective to grow faster than the market, while consolidating its sustainability, Symrise has implemented new channels for the sourcing of natural ingredients originating from sustainable agricultural cultivations and compliant with fair trade standards. In Madagascar, the Company has developed a fine quality of Vanille Bourbon absolute, where alternately leathery, animal and spicy hints reveal its sensual intensity. Symrise has also sourced from the ""red island"" a round and gourmand vanilla extract, which highlights the addictive sweetness of the pod. This unique terroir has also enabled to revisit other species: cinnamon, only produced from the bark of the tree, to offer more potency; a fine grade of ginger, pure and sparkling with lemony hints, but also ylang-ylang, lemon grass and geranium. To note also, a variety of pink pepper, based on the cultivation of the leaf. The Company also introduced the first ingredients extracted from its Brazilian factory and originating from Amazonian biodiversity. If flowers are not that common in the Amazon, fruits are on the contrary found everywhere and Symrise was able to make the very most of them in perfumery thanks to its SymTrap technology. Originating from aromatic processes and patented in 2008, this technique, which requires neither heat nor chemicals, rely instead on the recovery of fragrant molecules in aqueous solutions (rinse water, residual juice from extraction or distillation processes). Hence, many by-products are recycled to create new ingredients from cocoa, clove, orange or passion fruit (which until now only originated from pure synthesis). Symrise also made quite a statement this year with the launch of new De Laire bases from novel captives. Originally designed at the turn of the 20th century to support emerging new synthetic molecules, the former bases created by the De Laire Company have played a part in many masterpieces, like the Mousse de Saxe for Molinard's Habanita. The ""De Laire"" project has remained unchanged: create new qualitative bases to structure compositions. Among these novelties, the Poivre Pique DL base, built around Belanis, a captive with aniseed notes that bypasses IFRA restrictions on anethole. A spicy and pungent bouquet combining at once freshness and potency. Another flagship product, Tabac Bourbon DL, which reveals tobacco in an addictive and intoxicating way. The almond-like roundness of Tonkalactone, the sensuality of Vanille Bourbon absolute and the spiciness of cinnamon mingle with the dried leaf side of the Tabanone captive, the whole of it shrouded in a dash of liquor. Tubéliane DL puts forward Lilybelle with its hints of muguet, (but without its lyral and lilial molecules in the IFRA cross-hairs). This captive imparts luminous freshness to a former base, tubériane that gave pride of place to a tuberose with a carnal inspiration. Finally, the Noir Prunol DL, supports the roundness of the iconic plum note, preserved in the chocolate accents of the Tiramisone captive, the whole of it enhanced by a dark and spicy veil. With such projects, no doubt we will be hearing more about the fragrance house, Symrise."
Beraca wants to facilitate access to ingredients sourced from the Brazilian biodiversity,"Specializing in the sourcing and development of ingredients from the Brazilian biodiversity to the cosmetics, pharmaceutical and personal care industries, the company aims to improve all stages of the process regarding the use of Brazil's natural resources. Beraca's new Integrated Service solution offers full support to clients; from developing tailored socio-environmental projects to ensuring they comply with Brazil's Biodiversity Law 13.123/15. Beraca will also offer an additional service to assist its clients in the changes they will need to make by November 6, 2018 (as per the deadline established by the Brazilian government) in order to comply with the current legislation. ""We have acquired vast knowledge in this field through years of investment. Our goal is to support clients who already work or intend to work with ingredients sourced from the Brazilian biodiversity but are struggling throughout the process, especially in matters relating to regulation and access to serious, ethical benefit-sharing projects that add real value to the supply chain,"" says Érica Pereira, Sustainability Coordinator at Beraca.

Mane adds a new flower and a new fruit to the perfumer's palette,"Among the various innovations that Mane showcased at the 2018 edition of the World Perfumery Congress, we spotted Gnidia Flower Absolute a floral extract from Madagascar's Gnidia Daphnifoliar. ""These wild orange flowers attracted Mr Jean Mane's attention in 2005 when travelling through Madagascar. We eventually started testing different extractions which gave surprising results leading to this unique absolute,"" explained Véronique Nyberg, Vice President Creation, Fine Fragrances at Mane. To make this new scent available, Mane spent several years overcoming the legislative and sanitary hurdles that have to be passed prior to placing a product on the market. The multifaceted scent of the flowers unveils notes of narcissus, violet, cucumber, tea, and tuberose. The extract contains natural maltol, which brings a note of delicious sweetness. ""A new ingredient of this type is a strong vector of innovation,"" added Véronique Nyberg, ""That's what can make the difference when responding to a marketing brief."" Locally called Mandriakiaka, the fibre of the plant is used to make ropes or Antaimoro paper from the name of the communities which produce it. Today, the Gnidia flowers are harvested by hand by two associations of women living in a village where Mane also sources its vetiver. Mane also presented in Nice another new botanic in perfumery: Four Corners Alcoholic Resinoid, an extract of the fruit of Tetraptera Tetraptera or Aidan tree. Also called Quatre Côtés or Esesè locally, this wild fruit from the tropical forest of Cameroon is a loved spice of local family used for jams, cookies and sweets. It provides very powerful notes of rum and banana flambée that combine very well with leathery notes. Among the other innovations are: – Lavandin Pure Jungle Essence, a Lavandin extract sourced in Southern France with fresh feminine top notes resulting from an extraction of the flowers only with Mane's Jungle Essence supercritical technology. – Geranium Bourbon Essential Oil, extracted from specific variety, from an original cultivar of Madagascar, hat has been meticulously chosen for its superior quality. – Forest Pepper Pure Jungle Essence, derived from spicy-citrusy berries from Thailand it unveils a new kind of citrus note with orange, pink pepper tonalities and aldehydic facets. – Bigaflower, a specialty created with a selection of Mane's captive molecules including a high level of Bigarane for its interesting soft green notes of petitgrain. – Driftwood, a speciality offering ambery-woody tonalities and created with Ambramone, a Mane captive molecule, with is a nice radiant ambery scent with elegant facets reminiscent of white woods"
ERI 360 °: A label to assess the sustainability of cosmetic ingredients,"The ERI 360° (Eco Responsible Ingredient) Label is a comprehensive method to measure the level of social and environmental responsibility of cosmetic ingredients based on 100 SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Recognized and Transparent) indicators. The specifications of this labelling scheme have been designed by France Eco Extraction - a French association focusing on the eco-extraction of natural ingredients - in co-operation with the PASS [1] competitiveness cluster and 13 French suppliers of aromas and cosmetic ingredients. The ERI 360° Label therefore enables companies to evaluate their extracts' processes in the supply chain as well as their sustainable and responsible practices. The ERI 360° Label is an internal tool for companies to guide them and measure their performance, it also offers the possibility to obtain a certification via an external audit. The ERI 360° Label provides an evaluation grid established on 100 SMART [2] indicators to measure the level of eco-responsibility of an ingredient. It is based on a transversal evaluation to measure the traceability of the ingredients built on three main criteria: an assessment of the raw material, the bio-processes and the processes. The labelling is processed through an electronic application presented on a web platform, supported by a training course to help users carry out the evaluation. There are three levels of labelling (gold, silver, bronze) which result from the level of success obtained during the evaluation. The evaluation is accompanied by recommendations aimed at the continuous improvement of the company for the production of responsible ingredients. The ERI 360° Label is exclusively intended for ingredients' suppliers in the aromatic, cosmetic and agro-food sectors taking into account the environmental and societal impacts of the ingredients' production in a perspective of continuous improvement. Companies wishing to commit in the implementation of sustainable production methods respectful of people and environment can apply for certification with France Eco Extraction or PASS Cluster. The implementation of the labelling can be done individually, by extract and / or family of extracts, or it can take the shape of a subscription to use the evaluation tool for a portfolio of ingredients. ""The ERI 360° Label has been created in a real proactive synergy with other partners and we are personally proud of this reliable and robust reference tool which is based on a transversal evaluation"", explains Sandrine Lopis-Presle, Research Engineer - R&D Plants Sourcing at Gattefossé, one of the companies participating in the consortium that created the labelling scheme. Rates and details are available in the leaflet that can be downloaded here."
"""The use of natural cosmetic ingredients requires new traceability tools,"" Nicole Giraud, DNA Gensee","Premium Beauty News - The authentication of raw materials and ingredients used in cosmetics seems to have become a crucial matter. How do you explain this assay frenzy? Nicole Giraud - Demand is indeed strong on the market for the authentication of cosmetic substances. To explain this growing phenomenon, a number of factors come into play: the increasing use of natural ingredients, traceability and safety requirements and the search for increased sustainability. All this generates new needs for visibility and transparency throughout the supply chain. The regulatory background also plays an important role. The requirements of the Nagoya Protocol on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization thus imply a precise identification of the genetic signature of plants and organisms concerned. In this context, DNA Gensee offers DNA-based analysis to ensure quality and safety of supplies. This allows players in the cosmetics industry to have some factual data on the authenticity of what they have bought. In cosmetics, it enables to ensure that what was supplied is in line with the R&D specifications and to control the presence or absence of contaminating or adulterating plants. As part of regular supplies, especially in the perfume sector where people work with high added value ingredients, it is also an important means of quality control. We provide unequivocal scientific evidence and this is what companies ask. The need for control is no longer limited to R&D and Q&A departments. As part of CSR, Marketing or Purchasing departments can express a need to control their supplies. Even distributors and traders do checks! Premium Beauty News - On what types of products do you work? Nicole Giraud - On all natural raw materials, mainly plants or algae. But we don't limit ourselves to raw materials; we can also analyze derived products such as oils, for example. Genetic analysis enables to check the origin of oils, to control possible adulterations. For honey, we can even identify all the plants on which the bees went foraging. We can even work on highly ""processed"" finished products, like shampoos. Premium Beauty News - But analyzes are not strictly limited to conformity controls? Nicole Giraud - No, of course not. In many cases, it has more to do with a product valorisation approach. This can help a Company obtain a certification or improve a rating. The activity of DNA Gensee is based on a logic of proofs. The DNA guarantee also allows going upmarket and prove to customers the reality of what is claimed. Premium Beauty News - What are the limits of these analyzes? Nicole Giraud - The only limit are when you have to work on products where some DNA originating from the initial plants still remains. In cases where the manufacturing process destroys the entire DNA present, no analysis is possible except by analyzing less processed products. It is also possible to work on samples coming from the upstream stages of the process and thus see where the DNA was retained or degraded. DNA trackers make it possible to characterize processes which are gentle and friendly to the selected raw materials. The question of costs is less and less a obstacle because these decrease very quickly. Over the past six years, they have been divided by three thanks to technological advances and market development. We have chosen to invest in a next-generation sequencer (NGS) and we can analyze simultaneously nearly 350 million genetic sequences."
2018 in-cosmetics Global show: major trends,"With 773 suppliers displaying their latest ingredients, the 2018 edition of the event attracted 9,392 unique visitors, 7% more than last year's show in London. The microbiota was far ahead the subjects most discussed by ingredient suppliers, with research for a better-balanced and enriched microbiota as the main theme. Silab took inspiration from the microbiota of flower nectar to help regulate that of aged skins with Ecobiotys. With Fensebiome, Lipotec stimulates the synthesis of good skin nutrients and increases microbial diversity. With Equilibiome, Seppic focused on two particular stem cells to regulate them. Evonik, Greentech, Phenbiox, and Rahn also offer new data on the microbiota, either to enhance the barrier function, regulate the sebum, or act on complexion radiance. The impact of screens and blue light on the skin is another major concern for cosmetics professionals. Gattefossé specifically characterized screen light, which is mainly composed of three wavelengths (blue, red, green): they developed EnergiNius to fight this additional environmental stress. Solabia, with Blueshield, and Lipotec, with Lumicease, also took interest in the disturbance of opsins triggered by blue light exposure. Sustainable development is still a priority for cosmetics manufacturers, and the co-valorization of other industries' by-products inspires new product ranges, as can be seen with Biolie, BioNap, Cosun, and Boréaline. In addition, the development of sustainable sourcing is still one of the main concerns, just like the will to make chemical ingredients more and more biodegradable. Seppic launched Sepilife Nude, a polymer functional ingredient with 45% biodegradability in 28 days – another step toward more environmentally friendly products. in-cosmetics is also meant to introduce formulation concepts. Gattefossé targets XYZ generations with three different products: an anti-dark spot cream, a night cream, and a cheekbone stick. As for Seppic, they drew inspiration from research on skincare adapted to physical exercise to create a six-product range. IFF Lucas Meyer went to formulation extremes with products with extreme oil, perfume, and alcohol rates. Next year, the show will be held in Paris on April 2-4, 2019."
Clariant: A botanical answer to the impact of modern life on the skin's appearance,"Presented during the latest in-cosmetics Global tradeshow in Amsterdam, B-Circadin is a new active skin care ingredient designed to fight the damages caused by disruption to circadian rhythm, frequently altered by stressors in daily life. According to Clariant Active Ingredients, the new ingredient ""maintains the vital synchronization of the skin's circadian cycle, rapidly improving the complexion while decreasing puffiness and dark circles."" The importance of the circadian rhythm - also coined ""24-hour biological clock"" - in the regulation of the human body metabolism is now well-know. According to day and night cycles, it controls our physiological behaviour and metabolism, synthesizes molecules and hormones, and regulates our sleep patterns and appetite. While primarily regulated by the brain, skin cells also possess their own circadian rhythm governing major biological responses which are known to follow this 24-hour clock. Such responses include aquaporin-3, which allows the transportation of water and glycerol involved in the maintenance of epidermal hydration. Skin cells also have an efficient detoxification mechanism called the Nrf2 pathway to eliminate free radicals. It is one of the most important detoxification pathways in the body and is also regulated by the circadian rhythm. When the cells' circadian rhythm is desynchronized and under too much stress, the detoxification pathway becomes less efficient. According to Clariant, stress, jetlag, shift working hours, intense lifestyles and even exposure to blue light emissions from ubiquitous electronic devices such as laptops, tablets and mobile phones, disrupt the body's circadian clock, which leads to the deregulation of the skin's circadian rhythm. Skin shows signs of fatigue and is more prone to aggressions. ""B-Circadin is major leap forward in the development of innovative ingredients to protect skin from the stressors of modern living"", explained Alexandre Lapeyre, Global Technical Marketing Manager, Clariant Active Ingredients Business. ""With the increasing usage of digital devices showing no signs of abating and the demands of the working environment meaning extended or unusual working hours, we believe B-Circadin will issue a real breakthrough in the treatment of dull, tired skin, improving its overall well-being."" B-Circadin is extracted from the Lespedeza Capitata plant, grown and harvested in South Korea where it is used for its medicinal properties. ""Containing two key glycosylated flavonoids directly involved in circadian clock maintenance - carlinoside and isoschaftoside - B-Circadin emulates the ability to resynchronize the circadian cycle within the skin cells, to regulate rhythm-dependent biological functions such as aquaporin-3 and Nrf2 pathway detoxification efficacy,"" detailed Clariant in a release. Tested on a skin model exposed to blue light as a stressor to deregulate the circadian rhythm, B-Circadin improved essential biological functions and also ""blocked the direct oxidative stress induced by blue light radiating from digital screens."" In two double blind clinical studies, Clariant Active Ingredients studied the impact of a deregulated circadian cycle on skin properties. With volunteers working at night, so having their biological rhythms disrupted, a cream containing 3% B-Circadin was applied to one half of the face and a placebo to the other half, for 28 days. After only a week, volunteers saw their complexion visibly upgraded by over 17% compared to the placebo - and by 4 weeks, upwards of 35%. In another study over a much shorter 4-day period, volunteers applied a cream along with a placebo every day. During this study, they were exposed nightly to the blue light effect from a tablet in order to induce sleep perturbation. After the 4 days, eye contour was noticeably improved and puffiness decreased. A new active that seems perfectly in line with the evolution of lifestyles!"
Wesource targets skin microbiota balance with a burdock extract,"As scientific discoveries highlight the role of the human microbiota (the numerous bacterial, viral, fungal and other communities of microorganisms living in symbiosis with our organism), consumers become increasingly aware of the importance to adopt new skincare habits. Actually, Seppic explains, the skin is the place of delicate and balanced cell-microbe interactions. ""Any disturbance of this homeostasis (dysbiosis) may lead to skin disorders such as barrier function disruption or excessive inflammation, increasing skin reactivity and discomfort."" Developed by Wesource - Seppic's brand dedicated to cosmetic active ingredients - Equibiome is sourced from the core of the roots of Greater Burdock (Arctium lappa) with a non-destructive process using aeroponic culture performed by Plant Advanced Technologies (PAT). Great Burdock has been used for over 3,000 years to improve overall health. Most active compounds present in the roots have been noted for their activity on bacteria and inflammation. Thus, Equibiome offers a unique composition with a higher content of rare root metabolites than usually found in many root extracts. According to Wesource, Equibiome deliver new benefits on skin protection and microbiota equilibrium: – Support of skin-microbiota interactions, – Control of the microbiota biodiversity, – Protection of the skin integrity. In vivo tests on volunteers with very dry and/or sensitive skin have shown that Equibiome improves the skin's tolerance threshold to environmental stresses by reducing both skin redness (-60%) and stinging/burning sensations (-20%) after 14 days vs placebo. For a better and long-lasting skin comfort, Equibiome also promotes skin moisturization (+56%) after 21 days vs placebo. ""Inspired by the well-known Great Burdock, we used our active science to develop Equibiome, a sustainable root extract designed to bring comfort to reactive skin by balancing skin microbiota. Wesource commits to deliver active ingredients with science and vibrant stories,"" says Céline Blanchard, Product Manager at Seppic. Equibiome is Cosmos approved and China compliant."
Mibelle Biochemistry bets on a moss-derived active to enhance skin cells' resilience,"Mibelle Biochemistry scooped the gold innovation award for the best active ingredient at in-cosmetics Global for MossCellTec No.1 [1], an active ingredient based on two main innovations: – A novel anti-aging concept, the cell nucleus health. – A new ingredient source, a biotechnologically produced botanical moss. MossCellTec No 1 is based on the protonema culture of the moss Physcomitrella patens, a common moss in the Northern Hemisphere that can mainly be found in open fields. ""Mosses were the first plants to conquer the land about 470 million years ago. They used their extraordinary adaptation abilities to survive from the prehistoric age until today,"" explains Mibelle in a release. ""Mosses are able to trap excess water and nutrients from the soil, air and rain by acting like a sponge. They are able to tolerate long periods of desiccation where they stop their metabolism. Since mosses filter all of the necessary nutrients from the air and rain they also accumulate air pollution particles such as heavy metals. In order not to poison themselves, mosses have a large set of antioxidants to mitigate the effects of accumulating toxic compounds."" These properties may explain why more that forty species of mosses are used in traditional medicine, in particular for reducing inflammation or the pain linked to insect bites. However, mosses being difficult to collect in a sustainable way in the natural environment, Mibelle has developed a technology that enables the large scale cultivation of moss cells in sterile conditions. Cells from Physcomitrella patens were harvested and cultivated in the protenoma stage (germinating spore). Finally, in order to obtain the MossCellTec No.1 cosmetic ingredient, the resulting extract was carefully sprayed on a powder based on isomalt. The process only requires a small quantity of plant material. According to Mibelle Biochemistry, the active enhances the cell nucleus function to fortify the skin. Extensive studies showed that MossCellTec No. 1 activates the lamin A gene responsible for the nuclear envelope structure and the nuclear transport gene RanBP17. Both genes are down-regulated in aged keratinocytes. As a consequence, according to Mibelle, ""MossCellTec No. 1 supports the skin's adaptation to climatic stresses in vitro and in vivo."" Furthermore, adds Mibelle, ""MossCellTec No.1 strengthens skin against urban aggressors and climatic changes and improves the hydration, barrier and homogeneity of the skin after just two weeks."" This new anti-aging concept based on an innovative and sustainable cell culture seems to perfectly matches current's demand for powerful natural ingredients. Mintel recently stressed that biotechnologies would become one of the main sources of innovation for sustainable natural ingredients in the cosmetics industry."
Cosmetics composition scanning: an impacting trend!,"The QuelCosmetic application is claimed to help consumers spot undesirable substances in over 6,000 listed cosmetics by scanning the product bar code. Financed by UFC-Que Choisir - a French consumer association - with their endowment fund and through user crowdfunding, this new source of information seems to meet consumer expectations, just like its competitors. ""We are living in a society where people question everything, tests, public authorities, and companies. Consumers want trustworthy third parties that can help them really understand formulas and products,"" explains Gildas Bonnel, President of responsible communication agency Sidièse. Still, this approach has sparked debate about the objectivity and scientificalness of the information provided. Although they are aware and concerned about the need to give consumers information, FEBEA, the French Federation of Beauty Companies, has pointed out flaws in these applications. ""These applications make judgments that are not based on scientific data. It can be disparaging, and above all, it can make consumers believe products are not safe, when they actually are,"" explains Anne Dux, Scientific and Regulatory Affairs Director. This point of view is shared by Céline Couteau, PhD in Pharmacy at the Nantes University and author of the blog 'Regard sur les Cosmétiques', who endeavours to analyze cosmetic products from a global and scientific standpoint. ""We should not let ourselves be destabilized by the noise we can hear here or there. We do our best to guide you and give you a clear idea of the compared interests of such or such cosmetics category,"" she explains on her website. To this scientist, the information provided by these applications is not based on any scientific evidence, it does not take into account individual specificities, and above all, it plays on irrational fears. ""There is a lack of knowledge on this issue, there is this unreasonable angst about certain ingredients which are completely harmless to us chemists. In addition, what suits certain people does not suit others, and the problem is that the application does not make this distinction. Denigrating conventional cosmetics without evidence is not a good solution. When you try and make people scared, they end up being scared of everything,"" she comments. Starting from the principle that ignorance is at the core of all evils and fears, the need to inform consumers to reassure them is the main conclusion to draw from this phenomenon. FEBEA and European authorities have already anticipated it. ""We are partly responsible for this,"" Anne Dux admits. ""The cosmetics industry thought that labelling the product composition before all sectors provided a satisfactory answer to consumers' need for transparency. But this list is there for products to travel the world, and it can actually contain names likely to leave users puzzled. The industry should take into account this legitimate need for information and meet this expectation differently."" After tests in France, the Federation is now working with Cosmetics Europe, its European counterpart, on systems that can provide consumers with better information using packaging scanning. Launched on a large scale in five European countries, the experimentation consists in dematerializing objective, thorough information on cosmetic product compositions. Although shopping based on test applications still only concerns a small part of the population, the need for reassurance cannot be ignored given the current deconsumerism trend. ""No one can estimate to what extent brands are impacted, but what is for sure is that the current climate is favourable to organic products, which definitely partly explains the market contraction,"" Anne Dux analyzed. Indeed, according to the latest Kantar Worldpannel study, the beauty hygiene sector is declining in France. Volumes are now in the red, with -1.5%, and there has recently been a reduction in value (-0.9%), although this figure is better than in 2016, due to the price rise (+0.6%). ""People buy less, but better, and their choices are more qualitative,"" comments Business Development Manager Anaïs Dupuy. This can be partly explained by the search for more natural products, which involves being vigilant as regards the ingredients used, among others. ""The decline of beauty hygiene is 78% related to the naturalness target, meaning people search for more natural products and are willing to take action to preserve the environment. They have next to no impulses to buy and pay attention to ingredients,"" adds Anaïs Dupuy. Here is another way for consumers to express their need for confidence!"
Lessonia addresses the pro-age trend with a new marine active,"Well-known for its ranges of natural exfoliators, its algae extracts and decorative particles, Lessonia is strengthening its offering of active ingredients by addressing the healthy-aging trend. At the in-cosmetics Global tradeshow (which was held on 18-19 April 2018 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands), the French company showcased Healthyskin, a cosmetic active ingredient designed to improve the skin's hydration and barrier function. ""We answer to the needs of the cosmetic industry's big names by offering an active ingredient with metabolic and innovative paths. This active is a concrete and scientific transposition of the health & well-ageing trend as it aims to restore the physiological mechanisms of the skin health,"" explains Charles-Henri Morice innovation manager at Lessonia. According to Lessonia, Healthyskin restores healthy epidermal physiological mechanisms for a visibly younger and healthier appearance. A clinical test against placebo showed that the hydration and the barrier function are improved (+16,50 % after 28 days (p<0,001). Healthyskin also boosts all processes essential to proper epidermal reconstruction: differentiation, cornification and desquamation. A clinical test conducted on 20 volunteers shows that 1% Healthyskin improves the skin renewal, that is more than doubled in just 4 days (p<0,01). Eventually, a third clinical test shows that 1% Healthyskin decreases the skin micro-relief, up to - 42,9% after 28 days(p<0,02) thus improving the skin texture. Healthyskin derives from a marine microorganism called Pseudoalteromonas carrageenovora that lives in symbiosis with some gigartina seaweeds. It is involved in the digestion of a polysaccharide by secreting an enzyme called carraghenase. The microorganism synthesizes an important quantity of enzymes thus releasing oligo-carrageenans which activate the defence and the repair system of the seaweed. To develop Healthyskin, Lessonia worked in cooperation with the the marine glycobiology research branch of the CNRS [1], which highlighted this mechanism. The patent pending active is produced in two steps: culture of the micro-organism in a bioreactor to obtain the enzyme, then enzymatic hydrolysis of the marine carrageenan. Healthyskin is the third marine active developed by Lessonia (after Fucowhite, an anti-ageing active ingredient for sensitive skin, and Fucoreverse, an organic certified whitening active ingredient). ""Lately, we observe a shift in the conception of the ageing. The time is to the acceptance of our age and of its signs on the skin. Customers do not necessary look for appearing younger anymore, but want to be in harmony with their age. Healthyskin is a scientific translation of this trendy concept. Furthermore, this 'green' biotechnology answers to the requirements of cosmetic groups for sustainable development with a new way to manufacture bioactive molecules,"" concluded Charles-Henri Morice. Cosmetic ingredients 2018 More information on the ""ageing well"" and ""pro age"" trends that are shaking the beauty industry,as well as on corresponding ingredients solutions, is available in the special issue on Cosmetic Ingredients published by Premium Beauty News on the occasion of the in-cosmetics Global show, which took place at RAI Amsterdam on 17-19 April 2018.

"""Each year, in-cosmetics is awash with new trends, products and innovations and this year is no different,"" Roziani Zulkifli","Premium Beauty News - What are some of the 2018 personal care trends that will be explored at in-cosmetics Global in Amsterdam? Roziani Zulkifli - The personal care sector is one of the most dynamic industries in the world, it is constantly changing and evolving. Each year, it is awash with new trends, products and innovations and this year is no different. The big four tends in the industry this year, according to Mintel, are biotechnology in response to environment stressors on skin and hair; definitions of beauty; brands with personality; and customisation driven by digital technology. All of these trends and many more will be explored in detail during the educational programme at in-cosmetics Global 2018. Premium Beauty News - What will the new R&D tours offer participants? Roziani Zulkifli - The R&D tours that are being launched at this year's show are designed to shine a spotlight on some of the newest ingredients and technologies that will be launching at the exhibition in a quick, convenient and relevant format. The tours will be based on one of two topics - Biotechnology Actives (sponsored by Mibelle Biochemistry) or The Future of Anti-Ageing (sponsored by Novacap). Ms Rouah Al-Wakeel, a prominent technical consultant and cosmetic chemist, will lead the tours, with participants being guided through wireless headphones to hear about relevant ingredients and technologies being launched at the show. Premium Beauty News - The Formulation Challenge will take place at in-cosmetics Global for the first time this year. Roziani Zulkifli - The Formulation Challenge is a fascinating, exciting competition that has run to great success at a number of other in-cosmetics events around the world. It will see cosmetics giants go head-to-head in a bid to create the most innovative formulation from a box of mystery raw materials in just 90 minutes. The resulting products will be judged by a panel of market specialists who will present the winning team with the highly-coveted trophy. Colgate-Palmolive scooped victory at in-cosmetics North America 2017 and we can't wait to see who will steal the title this April. Premium Beauty News - What are the must-attend educational sessions at this year's event? Roziani Zulkifli - Every year, in-cosmetics Global offers an extremely thorough and in-depth educational programme that takes place over the three days of the exhibition. The programme will help visitors stay up to date with the latest industry trends and ingredient applications. Our aim is to help them leave the event and return to their day job as the best-informed formulator in the lab, or the most forward-thinking executive in the office. Regarding workshops, the session on the microbiome is definitely not to be missed. This topic continues to inspire discussion following the 2017 Formulation Summit and we are delighted to explore it further at in-cosmetics Global. Additionally, our workshops on natural ingredients (Beyond natural - New frontiers in green formulation) and sun protection (Suncare protection - The skin and the electromagnetic spectrum) are proving extremely popular. For those interested specifically in industry trends, the Marketing Trends Theatre is a must-attend. With more than 100 hours of free content, the sessions – led by some of the sector's best-known beauty experts – will share facts, figures, market analysis and research data, as well as the latest regulatory changes in personal care manufacturing. Premium Beauty News - What are some of the key suppliers that cosmetics professionals should see first-hand? Roziani Zulkifli - There are several not to be missed suppliers at the show this year. Clarion will be showcasing their revolutions in haircare, specifically conditioning ingredients and innovative active ingredient, whilst Cargill Beauty will bring its range of natural derivatives and sustainable ingredients. This year there will also be a Peru pavilion at the show, with 8 local companies showcasing their innovations over the three days. Premium Beauty News - What, in your opinion, are the top three reasons to visit in-cosmetics Global? Roziani Zulkifli - In addition to the exciting new additions to the show, there are many other features that are exceptionally popular with visitors and draw in the crowds year after year. Particular highlights for me include the Innovation Zone, which is an area of the show dedicated to showcasing more than 100 state-of-the-art concepts. It enables time-poor R&D scouts to find the latest ingredients all in one place, mitigating the need to scour the show floor. Mintel will also host a series of live demonstrations, presenting market-leading finished products alongside key insights into the trends that inspired them. I would also highly recommend the Make-Up and Sensory Bars as well as the Sustainability Corner as must-visit areas of the show. The Make-Up Bar will demonstrate the latest innovations in pigments and technology, with visitors able to touch and experiment with the ingredients on display. Meanwhile, the Sensory Bar is aimed at product developers, formulation experts and marketing professionals, and gives them the opportunity to experience unusual textures and sensations first-hand, including transforming and hybrid textures; heating and cooling jellies, butters and powders in the 'try-out' area. Textural effects remain a key focus for manufacturers and that will be reflected at the event. Finally, with environmentally-friendly practices currently extremely high on the cosmetic industry's agenda, it would be remiss of me not to mention the ever-popular Sustainability Corner. This area of the show is dedicated to environmental and social initiatives, as well as highlighting how the beauty industry is moving beyond compliance and paving the way towards a more sustainable business model. Cosmetic ingredients 2018 in-cosmetics Global is taking place at RAI Amsterdam from 17-19 April 2018. On this occasion, Premium Beauty News has published a special issue on Cosmetic Ingredients and the ""ageing well"" & ""pro age"" trends that are shaking the beauty industry.

BASF: The 4 elements of personal care,"""Today's health-conscious and responsible-minded consumers want cosmetics that support their lifestyle and sense of wellbeing. Demand for sustainably sourced products that help protect and beautify skin and hair is increasing steadily."" Dirk Mampe, Vice President Business Management Personal Care Specialties Europe, BASF. We see huge potential for products that support natural beauty from within and a healthy sense of self-esteem. To serve the personal care industry in addressing these needs, BASF delivers solutions that perform in the four Personal Care Elements: Protect, Cleanse, Beautify, Maintain. Protect: Considering that protection is a basic human need, it's not surprising that stressful urban lifestyles are driving demand for products with protective functions. People want protection from pollutants, the sun's rays and irritants. Demand is also growing for skin- and hair-care products with trustworthy protective performance. Cleanse: Hygiene is another basic human need, and cleansing products with mild, natural ingredients have a special consumer appeal. People want solutions that gently cleanse and replenish the skin and hair. Beautify: When we talk about beautifying, we want to define it as more than just outward appearance. Cosmetics and beauty treatments that enhance the individual's natural good looks and provide a beautiful sensory experience open up new dimensions. Especially sought after are solutions that enhance natural beauty and support self-esteem. Maintain: Personal care products that help maintain healthy skin and hair also provide a sense of nurturing. Products that moisturize and nourish the skin and hair fulfill this need. Fast-paced modern lifestyles leave consumers stressed and seeking comfort, making solutions with pleasing and pampering sensory profiles especially appealing. The four Personal Care Elements are not only the theme of the BASF booth (E40) at in-cosmetics, but also the topic of special events and exhibits during the tradeshow. The Innovation Zone (booth E60) invites visitors to explore new launches and draw inspiration for their formulations. Here, more than 100 products are showcased, including the anti-aging active ingredient for hair, DN-Age®. At the Formulation Lab®, BASF offers hands-on interactive training for R&D laboratory staff. In a special training session, experts demonstrate how to formulate a gentle shampoo with excellent foaming properties and wet and dry conditioning qualities. The formulation highlighted uses mild alternative surfactants and a natural conditioning polymer combined with a conditioning booster, a synergistic thickener and an APG®-based pearlescent concentrate. BASF is also hosting two technical seminars, one focusing on our new galenic-based skincare solution and another looking at the UV filter solution Tinosorb® S Lite Aqua. The first topic is especially relevant due to the effects of pollution on skin health. The galenic-based solution helps reduce the adhesion of particulate matter, creating a first line of defense. The second seminar offers insights into the advantages of the UV filter Tinosorb® S Lite Aqua, a solution based on a unique water-encapsulating technology that brings broad-band UV protection to the water phase. The responsible lifestyle trend continues to influence the personal care market, driving consumers demand for natural cosmetic brands. BASF focuses on increasing sustainability and providing solutions to serve this growing market. The approach is reflected in the Palm Dialog, which BASF is hosting for the third time. The panel discussion offers personal care ingredients suppliers, cosmetic manufacturers, retailers and NGOs a platform to discuss recent developments in the palm-based oleo-chemical industry."
Seppic and Ecovia Renewables partner to create and market biopolymers,"Seppic, a subsidiary of Air Liquide Healthcare specialising in the development and marketing of specialty ingredients for health and beauty, is partnering with Ecovia Renewables, a US company focusing on the research and development of high-performing biobased chemicals. In practice, the two companies have signed a joint development agreement and Seppic has taken an equity stake in Ecovia Renewables. The aim of this partnership is to develop and market high-performance and environmental-friendly ingredients to manufacturers of beauty and healthcare products. ""Due to growing environmental awareness and increasing focus on health and wellness, consumers are looking more and more for natural and sustainable products,"" says the company in a release. Ecovia Renewables has developed a ground-breaking platform technology to produce biobased ingredients through a proprietary fermentation process using renewable biomass. It will be combined with Seppic's expertise in formulation and large-scale production of specialty ingredients. Seppic and Ecovia Renewables will jointly develop biopolymers that the Seppic Group will market globally on an exclusive basis for all topical applications. ""This partnership with Ecovia Renewables is fully aligned with Seppic strategy to design, develop and market ingredients that bring strong environmental and health benefits. Responsible innovation is at the heart of this strategy and this partnership is a significant milestone and a new success for our open innovation initiative,"" commented Jean-Baptiste Dellon, CEO of the Seppic Group. Sustainable solutions for hair care at in-cosmetics At this year in-cosmetics Glogal, Seppic will showcase a new inspiring formula designed to address the demand from more and more demanding consumers regarding hair care products. Combining sensoriality, performance and sustainability, the Daily Beautifying Hair Serum is based on an association of 3 complementary ingredients: EMOGREEN L15 (an alternative to silicone oils), FLUIDIFEEL EASY (a glycolipidic O/W sustainable emulsifier processable at room temperature) and SEPIMAX ZEN (to texturize and stabilize the formula, and to increase its sprayability performance). Eventually, XYLISHINE adds hydrating properties to the product: this botanical inspired active ingredient is made of an association of natural sugars derived mainly from wood and the brown algae Pelvetia canaliculata. This minimalist formula offers a high naturality content and a good biodegradability. It is produced at room temperature and is easily sprayable"
Beraca to launch natural alternative to silicones,"Recognized globally as a leading supplier of raw materials sourced from the Brazilian biodiversity Beraca will launch the Tucumã Butter, ""a 100% natural, clean and efficient alternative to silicones in skin care formulations."" What sets this ingredient apart from others on the market is that it is non-hydrogenated (and therefore free of harmful compounds, according to Beraca) and highly stable. The Tucumã Butter is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and has a unique skin feel, providing good spreadability, light texture and a dry, non-oily feel. ""The Tucumã Butter is in line with Beraca's vision to develop active ingredients suitable for plant-based formulations and to replace chemical compounds with natural and sustainable solutions,"" says Juliana Checon, P&D Manager at Beraca. The efficacy of this active ingredient has been proven by independent laboratory tests. In addition to the cosmetic benefits of the Tucumã Butter, Beraca also highlights the socio-environmental aspect of its manufacturing process. The collection of the tucumã fruit provides an extra source of income for more than 90 families and directly impacts the lives of approximately 600 people. The sustainable sourcing of tucumã is part of Beraca's Socio-Biodiversity Enhancement Program, created in 2000 to serve as a bridge between farming communities spread across Brazil and some of the world's leading beauty brands. ""This project enables Beraca to connect the Brazilian biodiversity to thousands of customers through a relationship of transparency, full traceability and innovation,"" says Beraca's Marketing Manager, Marianna Cyrillo. At the next in-cosmetics tradeshow, Beraca will also launch Capilus PRO 22, a new hair conditioning agent developed in partnership with Clariant. Capillus PRO 22 is a secondary surfactant designed to restructure the hair fibre, seal the hair cuticle and control hair volume. The ingredient smoothens the hair surface, reduces hair porosity and protects the hair against external aggressors as well as increasing hair shine in over 100%, according to laboratory tests. The ingredient is obtained from the junction of a non-ionic surfactant (that carries a cationic charge in acid environment and whose pH is suitable for hair care formulations) and of the natural oil of pracaxi (whose main active component is the behenic acid, a natural hair conditioning agent). ""Capillus PRO 22 is the first amido-amine created from the pracaxi oil to suit the market needs. It has a fully traceable production chain and fosters the social and economic development of the local communities involved in its production,"" says Checon."
Greentech announces the launch of its new active for problem skin,"Beyond the imbalances of adolescence, adult skins suffer more and more from these imperfections. Indeed, acne affects up to 85% of 12-24 year olds and 12% of women and 8% of men over 25 years. The shape, appearance and location of acne can be different: presence of more pronounced inflammatory lesions more on the upper face or back for men and in the lower face for women. Depending on the intensity and severity of the pathology, the person can be touched and impacted psychologically. This pathology is aggravated by various factors: the hormonal environment, but also stress, sun, nutrition (rich in carbohydrates in particular), or pollution. Acne is an inflammatory disease of the pilo-sebaceous follicle. Four associated factors are responsible: – Hyperseborrhea (which corresponds to an overproduction of sebum resulting from hormonal activity) and dysseborrhea (qualitative alteration of sebum, modification of its composition and in particular oxidation of squalene which then becomes acnegenic and comedogenic) – Increased microbial proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes (now named Cutibacterium acnes) – Hyperkeratinization (excessive multiplication of the cells of the follicular canal wall which causes a plug, prevents sebum from evacuating and leads to the formation of comedones) – Inflammation and associated hyperpigmentation In addition, these components are linked. In fact, oxidized sebum constitutes an ideal nutrient medium for certain bacteria and in particular P. acnes causing its multiplication. However, P. acnes itself has deleterious effects inducing overproduction of sebum, hyperkeratinization and inflammation. Thus the acne phenomenon behaves like a vicious circle, each component increasing the other one. Pioneer in plant biotechnology, Greentech has drawn on its knowledge in terms of botany, plant molecules and skin biology to develop its new active. Resulting from a wide screening of plants, selected from the literature, on the different components of acne, ACNILYS® was born. Extracted from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa berries, it contains different molecules of interest. Acnilys® has been tested in vitro thanks to innovative tests. An in vivo study completed the results and showed the effectiveness of our new active from 28 days. Discover the incredible effects of Acnilys® on the different components of acne at in-cosmetics, booth A10."
Seppic brings together its range of active ingredients under one single brand: Wesource,"The brand's mission is to embody the richness and diversity of Seppic's natural cosmetic actives. Thanks to the take over of BiotechMarine in 2013, the subsidiary of the Air Liquide Group has expanded its range of botanically-derived active ingredients with new ingredients derived from the extraction of algae or marine plants. With the acquisition of Serdex in 2017, Seppic added new ranges of botanically extracted ingredients to its portfolio. This latter acquisition also allowed the group to strengthen its presence in the global market of natural active ingredients for the personal care industry.

Givaudan strengthens research efforts on skin microbiome,"Givaudan continues to invest in its Active Beauty business unit and its metagenomics platform to boost its pioneering position in the microbiome market. Givaudan, which claims to be the only fragrance company with in-house microbiome research capabilities, says these new strategic investments will help the company to remain one of the leaders in the development of new actives focusing on the skin microbiome. The company recently equipped its Applied Microbiomics Centre of Excellence in Toulouse, France, with a state-of-the-art automation equipment allowing high throughput screenings (HTS). This should accelerate the development of more disruptive solutions to activate, protect or balance the skin microbiota. ""Our astonishing advancements in microbiomics allow us to bring ground-breaking cosmetic concepts to new and existing customers. As the microbiome trend continues to grow, our teams will be at the forefront of this exciting area of scientific research,"" said Laurent Bourdeau, Head of Active Beauty. Givaudan's first discoveries in this field - such as microbiome activated' ingredients as well as 'microbiome protecting' agents - have resulted in the development of two award-winning active cosmetic ingredients, Brightenyl and Revivyl. Brightenyl, the first microbiome activated skin brightener, won a Gold and Bronze Innovation Award in 2015 at in-cosmetics Global and in-cosmetics Latin America, respectively. The first holistic skin renewal accelerator, Revivyl, won Gold for Best Innovation Award at in-cosmetics Latin America and in-cosmetics Asia in 2017. ""It's incredibly fascinating for a fragrance house to lead the creation of new active cosmetic ingredients in microbiomics. I'm very proud of the team in our Applied Microbiomics Centre of Excellence which is constantly pioneering the ingredients of tomorrow. This also includes our teams around the world working alongside our customers to create inventive new products for their markets,"" concluded Maurizio Volpi, President of Givaudan's Fragrance Division."
"Microbiota, this infinitely small protector, for our health and beauty…","A taboo is being defeated: the one that states bacteria is our enemy, these invaders that occupy our body and our skin weakening them and causing much damage. Thus, thanks to gradual popularization, which started in the worlds of health, food supplements and functional foods, the cosmetics industry has logically found itself at the crossroads due to a cross-sector approach. It is now a matter of an individualized, microbial balance, useful for our protection and our well-being. Thus the notion of cutaneous ecology takes on its full meaning by applying it to the world of the infinitely small, that of the microorganisms forming the Stratum microbium or cutaneous microbiota. In the case of a ""skin-microbiota"" imbalance, much skin damage and even more severe disturbances may appear and the factors of aggression are unfortunately lacking in the hygienics society in which we live. It is now recognized that ""too much hygiene kills hygiene"" and from that we need to understand that it is not necessary to wash too frequently or to use harsh products because in close proximity to us, there are unwanted microorganisms, ready to take the place of the microbiota and destabilize it. Cutaneous Microbiota cannot be defined in a specific way and generalized for all individuals. We have our own microbiotic identity card that has developed over time. Microbiota forms a true interactive ecological community, a balanced ecosystem that is essential to maintain or restore, but which is very complex. Indeed, since the launch of the National Institute of Health's ""Human Microbiome Project"" (HMP) in 2007, the researchers were able to observe great topographic variations of human microbiota [1] as well as great differences according to each individual [2]. When you become aware that each cm2 of skin contains 1 million microorganisms with hundreds of specific species, you can measure the importance of this ecosystem better. Bacteria can be commensal when living in contact with a host's cutaneous-mucus membrane surface without causing damage. An equilibrium is then established between the individual and the various commensal flora of the skin and mucous membranes, depending on age, diet and living conditions, but this equilibrium is constantly threatened by the physical or chemical attacks they are subjected to (pollution, temperature, UV rays, intensive use of surfactants, antibiotics, stress, etc ). Commensal or resident bacteria are considered beneficial in the common discourse delivered to consumers. Facing them are transient, undesirable and/or pathogenic bacteria. These notions are much more sensitive insofar as the same bacteria may or may not be associated with undesirable effects. This will depend on the individual as well, in addition to the stability of his or her microbiota. Opportunistic bacteria, another way of characterizing them, can become harmful or induce disorders when the host's defenses are weakened. They await the opportunity to come and settle on the cutaneous area. The skin can also contain pathogenic bacteria, for example Staphylococcus aureus, which is part of their commensal flora without developing damage; it is worth noting that according to the Institut Pasteur, 30 to 50% of the population is healthy and that the breakdown of the skin barrier (in the case of an injury for example) can induce a pathogenic effect. Other examples: What is the status of Propionibacterium acnes and that of Corynebacterium xerosis, bacteria that are involved respectively in problems of oily skin or the development of bad odors? These microorganisms are not considered to be pathogenic per se, but their harmful action or the unpleasant problems they cause are related to the composition of the microbiota that surrounds them, but it also depends on skin function and its intrinsic imbalances. Last but not least, Staphylococcus epidermidis, which you often hear about in cosmetics: depending on the case, it can induce significant skin infections and is found in acne prone skin [3], while a study in 2015 by a Japanese team demonstrated its benefits on maintaining hydration [4]. We are only at the beginning of the investigations and many questions remain to be clarified before penetrating all the mysteries of microbiota and better understanding how it acts on the cutaneous ecosystem. In addition to the microbiota that blocks the development of opportunistic bacteria, the skin has other defense mechanisms, in particular its physical, chemical and biological barriers (Fig 1). When this barrier is impaired or broken, leading to the entry of opportunistic microbial agents, the skin uses various biological defense mechanisms. Its innate immune system induces responses such as phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages or the induction, in particular by the keratinocytes, of the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides ( [5], [6]) or AMP (the β-defensins, in particular hBD2 & hBD3, cathelicidins LL37) in addition to constitutive AMP peptides (Rnase 7, psoriasin, lactoferrin, dermcidin). Important points: pathogenic bacteria do not seem to be able to develop resistance to these AMPs. These peptides act, for example, by breaking the membrane of the targeted microorganisms or by penetrating the microbial cell to interfere with its intracellular functions. Convinced of the interactions between the body and microorganisms, Solabia became interested in skin flora and maintaining its balance on the surface of the skin almost 20 years ago. Specialized in enzymatic biocatalysis, Solabia thus developed an original method consisting first of all in producing a specific enzyme by fermentation (Glucosyl-transferase) and then in activating the latter on substrates of plant origin in order to obtain prebiotics. – Maintaining the integrity of the microbiota or promoting its development. Prebiotics are oligosaccharides having bioselectivity with respect to the microbiota. In the present case, these are gluco-oligosaccharides (Fig. 2, Bioecolia®) acting as selective substrates to promote the development of the microbiota to the detriment of that of opportunistic or undesirable microorganisms associated with skin disorders (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylooccus aureus, Corynebacterium xerosis, Malassezia furfur, Gardnarella vaginalis, Candida albicans, etc.). The selectivity of Bioecolia® is linked to the presence of specific bonds of types α-(1-6) and α-(1-2) between the constituent glucose units, metabolizable more quickly and efficiently by the commensal resident flora, which by competitive inhibition, is reinforced or develops better on the cutaneous surface than the opportunistic flora. A signature active ingredient of the Solabia Group, Bioecolia® is the guarantor of a sustainable ecology and is formulated in many skin care, hair care and personal and intimate hygiene products. – Stimulating the synthesis of antimicrobial defense mechanisms. With consumer interest in probiotics, better known than prebiotics, Solabia has continued its research and developed a symbiotic active ingredient, combining two prebiotics and two probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei) but in an inactivated form to obtain Ecoskin®. In addition to the ability of the complex to interact on microbiota bioselectivity, the gluco-oligosaccharides and fructo-oligosaccharides (obtained after pressing the yacón tubers, Polymnia sonchifolia), have demonstrated stimulatory properties of the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides (Fig. 3) of type β-defensin 2 and β-defensin 3 (+71% vs. placebo). The presence of lactobacilli also enhances the immune protection of the skin. Evaluated against placebo, on a panel of volunteers with very dry skin, Ecoskin® enhances the skin's radiance by reducing the average depth of the micro-furrows, restructuring the skin via its microdepression network, while nourishing it and reducing feelings of discomfort. Thus brighter, the skin can display an ecologically controlled ""happy-look"". – Acting against microbial adhesion. The colonization of the cutaneous area but also of the mucous membranes uses adhesion factors associated with specialized structures present on the surface of the bacteria with the ability to bind to specific receptors of the skin cells. Fighting against the microbial adhesion of opportunistic bacteria is an additional means of defense to limit the proliferation of undesirable or even pathogenic bacteria, and to maintain the cutaneous microbiota. The adhesion factors are different according to the bacteria. Among them, the bacterial lectins, glycoproteins found on the surface of bacteria and capable of binding to receptors of epidermal cell membranes. Moreover, the adhesion process can also come from the lectins of the epidermal cells having a specific affinity for sugars, the latter then being on the surface of the bacteria and at the origin of the formation of biofilms [7]. It was from this observation that Solabia Research, specialized in Glycobiology, developed a polysaccharide, Teflose®, with a high concentration of rhamnose (Fig. 4), a sugar having specific affinity for epidermal cell receptors. This molecule then plays the role of a coating on the surface of the skin to limit the adhesion of opportunistic bacteria, like an anti-microbial shield, and reduce the resulting reaction of discomfort. Tested on reconstructed epidermis after topical application, Teflose® confirmed its affinity for the skin by decreasing the adhesion of Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Other studies, undergoing more in-depth study, have also emphasized its ability to reduce the biofilm formed by certain bacteria. But the rhamnose composition of Teflose® is not limited to anti-microbial adhesion; in fact, with 60% of this rare sugar, the polysaccharide also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties by regulating the release of specific mediators, in particular bacterial attacks (e.g.: Interleukin-8). Ubiquitous by its applications (soothing care, deodorants, care of sensitive skin / atopic dermatitis, care of oily skin, personal hygiene, etc.), Teflose® can also be combined with prebiotics, the latter promoting maintenance of the microbiota while this anti-adhesion shield prevents the establishment of opportunist bacteria on the skin, and even more so if the skin's ecosystem is weakened. Since the start of the HMP project in 2007, many discoveries have been made regarding the role of the human microbiota. While only yesterday microorganisms were perceived negatively because they were considered as the cause of many diseases, today mentalities have changed and the evolution of knowledge has led us to consider the microbiota as one of our sentinels commanded by the skin's defense system. Many promising avenues remain to be explored, and will undoubtedly change our approach to the skin and the ingredients we use to provide protection and well-being to it."
BASF tackles the signs of skin and hair aging,"""Consumers are leading ever-busier lives. As the pace of life remains fast, products that calm, sooth and rejuvenate the skin are in high demand,"" explains BASF in a release. Inspired by the vogue of yoga and meditation and by the natural trend, the designer and manufacturer of ingredients for personal care and hygiene products therefore has developed a series of new active ingredients for skin and hair care products aiming at strengthen them to cope with everyday stresses. In a BASF survey of 100 volunteers, 90 percent reported that stress had a negative effect on their skin, causing it to turn dull and dry. According to the company, ""daily stresses are known to translate into cutaneous stress, with cortisol as its main mediator."" As an anti-stress ingredient, Hyalurosmooth mimics the benefits of a mindful way of life. Hyalurosmooth represses the cortisol's damaging impact on skin, restoring collagen type I and hyaluronic acid that are affected. ""Bringing the positive effect of a mindful lifestyle - rested from the inside - Hyalurosmooth helps the skin recover its hydration and radiance"", claims BASF. Extracted from the Indian Cassia angustifolia, Hyalurosmooth is IECIC [1] listed. As it ages, the skin loses its firmness and begins to sag, causing the face to lose its youthful contours. Based on the latest findings of BASF's epigenetics platform, the new active RNAge rebalances Let-7b - the microRNA that downregulates the production of proteins which are key to building dermal architecture. ""In doing so, the active helps the dermis to stay dense, rebuilding it from deep within and finally firming facial shape,"" states the company. Extracted from sea buckthorn, RNAge is COSMOS approved and IECIC listed. The third anti-aging active showcased by BASF at Cosmetagora, DN-Age slows down the hair greying process and reduces hair loss. ""The active ingredient acts on the scalp by preventing UV induced DNA damage. As assessed by in-vitro tests, it also protects hair follicle cells to prevent hair greying and hair ageing. DN-Age leads to greater hair density: 80 percent of panellists perceived their hair to be stronger, fuller, and thicker,"" claims BASF. Extracted from Cassia alata leaves and titrated in flavonoids, DN-Age is also COSMOS approved and IECIC listed. DN-Age is available as a concentrated powder and a hydro-glycerin solution."
Naturex to unveil new efficacy results and new actives at Cosmetagora 2018,"Naturex continues innovating with new ingredients inspired by food and beverage products and new efficacy results to be presented at the next edition of the Cosmetagora tradeshow in Paris. Awarded last year at the in-cosmetics tradeshow in London, Eliorelys is a cherry blossom active produced through Naturex's Eutectys technology and designed to delivers effective protection against damage caused by 'blue light' from mobile phones, tablets and computers. In a comet assay conducted by the Group, Naturex found that human keratinocytes incubated with Eliorelys demonstrated a significant decrease in DNA damage (up to 75%) compared with cells that had not been treated. The results indicate that Eliorelys exerts a protective effect against blue light-induced DNA lesions. The full findings are to be unveiled at the Cosmetagora trade show. ""Recently published studies, confirmed by Naturex's own internal testing, have concluded that blue light can in fact lead to damage in cultured human keratinocytes and live skin, causing levels of skin ageing similar to that triggered by UVA radiation. On average, people spend five hours a day in front of a screen, and 90% of 20-65 years olds use electronic devices every day. This means there is a risk that blue light pollution could cause skin damage on a widespread scale,"" highlights Naturex. Also set for launch at Cosmetagora is Fortify - the fourth and final part of Naturex's Beautyfood collection of natural skin care solutions made with ingredients derived from plants found in the food chain. The new range comprises five nutrient-rich ingredients inspired by food and beverage products: ginseng, oat, bamboo, nettle and ginger. All are renowned for their ability to deliver regeneration and stimulation benefits. The Fortify collection's ingredients are produced and supplied in accordance with Naturex's standards of traceability and transparency. Fortify Ginseng, for example, is grown on small and medium sized farms in northeast China using sustainable agricultural practices that place a high priority on preserving the land and the environment. Working in collaboration with Naturex, ginseng farmers in the region implement an on-going program of environmental stewardship, under which biodiversity is encouraged, weeding is conducted manually to minimize pesticide use, and trees are planted to offset carbon emissions. ""Our approach at Cosmetagora will be to unlock nature's beauty secrets and showcase some of the most exciting natural actives available today. Consumers love to be inspired by innovative beauty products that deliver effective benefits. In tune with this, both Eliorelys™ and the new Fortify range deliver high performance and a wow-factor that shoppers will love,"" said Stéphanie Puel, Personal Care Director for Naturex."
French study demonstrates the skin whitening properties of the dyer's weed,"After having dried and collected the leaves and seeds of Reseda luteola L. to extract dying agents, the researchers have used various methods to isolate individual molecules to test their effect on the inhibition of tyrosinase, the most commonly method used to lower the level of melanogenesis. A bioguided purification procedure employing centrifugal partition chromatography, Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was developed to isolate and identify the whitening agents (i.e., luteolin and apigenin) from aerial parts of Reseda luteola. The procedure also enabled the characterization of acetylated luteolin- and apigenin-O-glycosides, which occurrence is reported for the first time in Reseda luteola. The in vitro biological tests carried out made it possible to highlight the promising whitening activity of Reseda luteola L. extract, and to isolate the flavones responsible for this mechanism. Collected data show that, beyond its traditional use as a dyestuff, Reseda luteola is potentially of great interest in the development of a natural whitening ingredient in cosmetic, cosmeceuticals, and eventually pharmaceutical products, once its safety and tolerability are assessed. Used to treat various skin pigmentation disorders, or simply to obtain a lighter skin tone, skin whitening agents occupy an important part of the global dermo-cosmetic market nowadays. These active agents may act at various levels of melanogenesis, however tyrosinase inhibitors are currently the most commonly used. Due to the current boom of the natural beauty market, exploring new botanical sources of whitening products appears crucial nowadays, in particular given the fact that ancient skin whitening ingredients - such as hydroquinone, retinoic acids, corticoids, or mercury salts - are of safety concern as they display several severe side effects, resulting in their interdiction or restricted use under the European Cosmetic Regulation 1223/2009 and several other international regulations."
"Polyphenols extracted from berry seeds can have a selected antimicrobial effect, finds Finnish research centre","When manufacturing fruit juice, the food industry produces large amounts of press cakes [1] containing a range of useful compounds for the skin, such as polyphenols known for their antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Until now, the industry has largely confined itself to extracting seed oil from press cakes. Despite the potential for new product concepts, no other high-value-added products are currently made from these press cakes. This is why VTT has been searching the best way to extract actives from fruit by-products, and more particularly from Nordic berry seeds. Actually, VTT has developed various methods to extract and enrich these actives. For berries with large seeds and various fruits, a specific sanding method can be used. For example, 20% of a cloudberry seed's weight can be sanded using this method to recover the husk. ""One kilogramme of berries yields 10 grammes of seed husk fractions, but a small amount suffices for cosmetics products,"" explains the centre. Then, active substances from seed husk fractions are extracted using the so-called hydrothermal extraction technology. ""The whole process is free from no toxic agents or solvents,"" claims VTT. The final product tends to be light-coloured, powdery, water-soluble, food-grade fractions. After sanding, seed oil can be extracted from the remaining seeds. VTT has optimised and patented the process for a variety of berry seeds. As far as small-seed berries such as blueberries are concerned, their useful compounds can be extracted using a wet milling method developed by VTT. One of the most interesting properties of the substances extracted from the husks of berry seeds is their ability to prevent the growth of harmful microbes. Indeed, research conducted by VTT show the new actives may have selected effects on the numerous microbes inhabiting the human skin. ""Berry seed husks contain large amounts of antimicrobial compounds which can help to maintain a natural microbial balance in the skin, by suppressing the growth of harmful microbes while beneficial ones flourish. This is based on nature's way of protecting seeds from threats such as fungi,"" explains Riitta Puupponen-Pimiä, Principal Scientist at VTT. ""We have investigated how the microbes typically found in human skin and those that hide in cosmetic products react to polyphenols contained in berries. At a general level, you could say that seed husk fractions and the resulting extracts prevent harmful microbial growth in the skin, but do not suppress the growth of good microbes,"" she adds. These findings could be of high interest for the cosmetics industry which is looking for natural alternatives to synthetic preservatives as well as for innovative methods to protect the skin's microbiota. ""The maintenance of healthy skin and the replacement of synthetic preservatives by natural compounds is one of the major trends in the cosmetics market,"" confirms Riitta Puupponen-Pimiä. VTT investigated the properties of a large array of Finnish and Nordic berries and found cloudberries and Arctic brambles to produce the most efficient seed fraction extracts to inhibit the growth of harmful microbes. These berries, which belong to the Rubus genus, contain high levels of polyphenols called ellagitannins, which are known for their anti-microbial effects. Extract from sea buckthorn seed fractions has also proven effective. Sea buckthorn seed husks are also rich in polyphenols known as procyanidins, a kind of tannin. VTT's research has shown that, in addition to polyphenols, seed press cakes contain many other health-promoting compounds making them a very interesting and sustainable source of active ingredients for the food and cosmetic markets. ""Most of the thousands of kilogrammes of seed cake produced could be used for purposes other than feed,"" concludes the research centre."

Capsum: A new interpretation of cosmetic oil,"Over the past few years, oil made a comeback on centre stage and progressively entered various segments (face care, body care, hair care, nail care...) to provide a large area of benefits (massage, nutrition, slimming, cleanser…). To reinvent this millennial product, Capsum has combined its different microfluidic technologies: ReoBulle (oil droplets with a light gel consistency), SoftDrop (invisible microcapsules stabilized without surfactants that allow to create non-greasy and non-sticky oils), NeoPearl (capsules of 2 or 4 mm in diameter, with and oil core protected under a fine alginate membrane). To illustrate the potential of these technologies, the young Marseille-headquartered company showcased five new formulations based on hibiscus oil last week in its show-room in Paris: – Huile fraîche infusion (oil in serum), – Huile fraîche extrait (oil in bubbles), – Huile fraîche gelée (oil in gel), – Huile fraîche concentré (oil in Pearls), – et Huile fraîche baume (oil in cream). ""By showcasing oil through unexpected shapes, microfluidic technologiess reinvent its sensory,"" explains Capsum in a release. According to the company, these new textures will help to challenge common beliefs about oils. For instance, the encapsulation of oil into hundreds of pearls or thousands of droplets allows keeping it ""trapped"" until the moment of application for a drop-by-drop release on skin, thus avoiding the mass effect responsible for oil's greasy reputation. Capsum's Huile Fraîche collection also demonstrates that oils can be both elegant and sophisticated."
Perfumes: Symrise innovates with a lily of the valley note from sustainable sources,"While lily of the valley can be cultivated easily, its delicate flowers offer too low yields and their scents are very difficult to capture efficiently, either through steam distillation or volatile solvent extraction. For fragrance house, the only solution for providing this fresh and delicate scent is to recreate it using synthetic ingredients. Unfortunately, for the lovers of fresh floral fragrances, the existing synthetic molecules - such as Lyral [1] or Lillial [2] - have been dropped out due to public health concerns. In recent years, perfume houses have therefore invested heavily to find alternatives to these substances. In such a context, Symrise hits hard with the launch of Lilybelle, a molecule offering fresh, green and wet notes and very close to the scent of the lily of the valley flower. The new molecule also stands out from the mass with its responsible and sustainable sourcing based on the re-use of D-limonene derived from orange peels and other by-products of the fruit juice industry. In order to produce Lilybelle, Symrise has designed and developed a synthetic process that complies with the twelve principles of green chemistry, including the use of catalysts at each stage of the process, the recovery and recycling of solvents within the manufacturing process, and the restriction of waste production. Furthermore, states Symrise, environmental decomposition studies have shown that the Lilybelle molecule is biodegradable. According to David Apel, Senior Perfumer at Symrise, ""Lilybelle is a molecule with an extremely fresh, green and wet smell. A touch of aldehydes raises its luxuriant floral touch, thus capturing the sparkling freshness of spring."" In a context marked by the increasing use of floral notes in male fragrances, David Apel considers that Lilybelle opens new opportunities to create innovative male fragrances and is an ""incredible source of inspiration""."
Seppic: A natural active ingredient for acne-prone skins,"An estimated 80 percent of all people between the ages of 11 and 30 have acne outbreaks at some point in their lives [1]. Despite the strong demand for natural solutions, there are hardly any effective responses to date. Based on new studies showing that an increased cutaneous and systemic oxidative stress is often involved [2] as a cause of acne, searchers from Serdex, a subsidiary of Seppic since January 2017, have screened various molecules from the Malagasy flora, a biodiversity reservoir that the company has been studying for several years. As a result of this research, Serdex has developed Subligana, a titrated extract of Harungana madagascariensis, a tree originated from the centre and East of Madagascar and renowned for its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant benefits. Subligana was especially designed to address skins with imperfections and spots and for those looking for a flawless complexion. ""On the basis of scientific results, we have developed an original mechanism of action focusing on soothing and anti-oxidant effect to address acne-prone skins,"" explains Virginie Anchartéchahar, R&D Manager for Serdex. Also known as the dragon's blood tree, orange-milk tree or haronga, Harungana madagascariensis is traditionally used in Madagascar and in the numerous African countries where it was introduced for its medicinal properties. Leaf decoctions are used against asthma and skin disorders and leaf juice is used for wound healing. Subligana mechanism of action combines soothing effect (lipase inhibition, IL-10 and IL-12 regulation), antioxidant effect (protection against lipid peroxidation) and efficacy against Propionibacterium acnes. An in-use test on teenagers presenting acne-prone skin showed a significant whiteheads reduction versus placebo after 28 days. In line with Serdex previous actions in Madagascar, the entire supply chain has been sustainably designed. Harungana madagascariensis leaves are collected under good collecting practices in the high plateaus area in Madagascar to ensure a repeatable and reliable phytochemical composition. Furthermore, Serdex has implemented a fair and equitable sharing of benefits under Nagoya Protocol. Eventually, Subligana is listed in the Inventory of Existing Cosmetic Ingredients in China (IECIC) and is compliant to the Cosmos standard for natural and organic cosmetics."
Naturex expands its portfolio of cosmetic active ingredients,"In order to add a hair care active to its Eutectys range of botanical extracts, Naturex turned to Tillandsia, a plant also known as Angel's Hair that grows on other plants, often taking root on the limbs of trees, creating large structures that hang from the branches. It obtains moisture from run-off water that falls onto its stems and leaves. This is subsequently stored in its plump tissues, where it stays until required during dry periods. Naturex has harnessed these properties to benefit human hair in the form of a new active - Tillandsia Eutectys - which has been proven to enhance hair suppleness, increasing its manageability by reducing friction and making it easier to comb. Like every other ingredient in the Eutectys collection, this new active is produced using Eutectigenesis, a patented extraction process that involves Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents (NaDES). Furthermore, Naturex has released the results of two double-blind clinical trials involving its Cherry Blossom Eutectys active, which has been rebranded as Eliorelys. The ingredient, was shown in the studies to improve significantly the appearance of the skin of subjects aged 40-50 and 51-60 years old who were already showing signs of photo-ageing. According to Naturex, tests have also demonstrated that the topical application of Eliorelys delivers skin repair benefits, too, with levels of carbonylated proteins and MDA (markers of lipids oxidation) significantly reduced versus a placebo. The researchers observed a reduction in photo-induced skin damage after 28 days of applying a cosmetic formulation containing Eliorelys, while skin texture was also improved after 56 days. Eliorelys awarded Eliorelys was awarded the Gold Green Ingredient Award at in-cosmetics Global 2017. This award is given to an ingredient that makes a significant environmental difference in the area of sustainability. Naturex's Eliorelys is sustainably sourced in the heart of Provence, less than 50 miles from Naturex's processing facility. The fresh flowers, a by-product of cherry fruit cultivation, are carefully handpicked and follow a dedicated supply chain that insures full respect of sustainability recommendations, especially regarding the avoidance of chemical treatments. Naturex also showcased Chakah Honey, a new addition to its Super Honeys collection - a line of ready-to-use cosmetic honeys first unveiled in January 2017. Chakah Honey has never been used in the modern cosmetics market, and was only recently rediscovered by Naturex sourcing experts working in the Yucatan region of Mexico, the cradle of the ancient Mayan civilization. The Maya used the bark or leaves of the Chakah tree as a basis for their traditional medicine. ""Chakah Flower Honey is a treasure-trove of health benefits. It delivers a moisturizing activity that, although traditionally well known, had not previously been scientifically demonstrated. But more importantly, in vitro research has shown it to stimulate and protect the mitochondria, the energy reservoir of human cells, making Chakah a super-active energizing cosmetic honey,"" explains Naturex."

"""Photoprotection has applications in many cosmetics claims,"" Christophe Paillet, Exsymol","Premium Beauty News - You have launched a new photoprotection active ingredient at the last edition of in-cosmetics. Skin protection against external aggressions was one of the main trends of the event. How is photoprotection positioned within this context? Christophe Paillet - It is a cross-disciplinary theme which offers applications in many cosmetics claims like anti-aging, sun protection, or anti-pollution. All these claims are in high demand. As we were in search of something inspired from naturalness, we eventually developed and patented a premium bio-molecule: SOLEXYL®. It is a conjugate derivative of thiomethylpropenoic acid, an isomer of Entadamide A found in tropical lianas. This active is both able to play a photoprotective role, like natural chromophores (melanin, tryptophan, urocanic acid…), and prevent any adverse effect such as premature aging, inflammation, immunosuppression… which are often generated by these natural chromophores. Among others, our tests showed its remarkable photoprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory virtues, so this new active can be positioned on the anti-immunosuppression niche. Premium Beauty News - We have noticed that this edition of in-cosmetics paid particular attention to all sources of aggressions, whether external or internal. Christophe Paillet - It is more and more widely recognized that the skin's appearance mainly depends on external, but also internal aggressions, which all generate more or less chronic stress. That is why we have been strengthening our involvement in the field of the impact of psychological stress on the skin. A new study on Epidermosil®, a silanol (organic silicon stabilized by hyaluronic acid with low molecular weight), showed its efficacy against the effects of psychological stress on the epidermis, for example atrophy and dermatoporosis. This active can act thanks to an original mechanism: an action on hyalurosome, a real hyaluronic acid production machine and a regulator of cell growth. Premium Beauty News - What were the other key points to your participation in in-cosmetics 2017? Christophe Paillet - We had chosen to highlight our expertise in body issues with a review of our concepts and slimming and firming actives, and by providing details on the last results obtained with a red algae extract with a lipolytic and anti-adipogenesis effect particularly involved in anti-yo-yo phenomena. We also emphasized our offering in dermocosmetics, another segment that is showing strong growth, with new data in the field of healing – in particular results obtained with a scratch test on keratinocyte and fibroblast models - on actives like Glistin® or Epidermosil®, which were previously used for a more traditional cosmetics positioning. In the field of anti-aging, we presented the results of a recent clinical study targeting global anti-aging, eye contour and anti-wrinkle effects. This study demonstrated the synergic benefits provided by the combination of MeiYanoL® and Algisium®. MeiYanoL®, a common elder flower extract which acts thanks to an original mechanism on dark circles and bags, was introduced for the first time in 2015. MeiYanol was actually one of the themes presented on our Sustainability Corner dedicated to CSR policies. As regards Algisium®, it has been an essential for several decades in terms of restructuring and firming activity. Lastly, we also introduced a new element to our anti-aging offering with OLEOSTERINES® HOUBLON, an unsaponifiable fraction of hop which reshapes the oval of the face through a ""V-reshaping"" effect mainly due to an adipogenic mechanism that prevents the ""gaunting"" phenomenon typical of facial aging."
The main trends of in-cosmetics 2017,"Pollution was once again one of the main targets of new the launches by ingredient suppliers. However, this issue, which concerns all geographical areas, has been addressed more comprehensively. Some companies, such as Greentech with Urbalys presented a 360° anti-pollution active thanks to its protective effect on cellular channels. On the other hand, Clariant with Eosidin specifically targeted indoor pollution. The concept of exposome, which encompasses the totality of environmental stresses that a person receives during its lifespan, has been the focus of ID bio's attention with the launches of Cell'intact and Osmo'city but also of Symrise with Symbright. Lipoid with HerbaShield URB has combined anti-pollution and detoxification. The offer was wide and varied. Some innovations might very well also be suitable as anti-aging or anti-inflammatory. The replacement of raw materials that went under fire was also a source of innovation. This was especially true with polyethylene beads, with the launch of new series of alternatives. Lamotte, for instance, launched an alternative based on hydrogenated castor marketed under the name Rizipearl. The product is distributed by Lavollée. Also noteworthy are Ronald Britton's bio-glitters, made from a biodegradable compostable film. Once again, exhibitors demonstrated the great creativity of their marketing teams regarding formulation concepts. From one stand to another, visitors were able to travel across various universes, with formulations often marked by sensorial and pleasure. Seppic, for instance, took inspiration from pictorial arts and put the different artistic movements and mixtures of colours and textures in parallel with innovative cosmetic formulas. DSM with ""Dare to change your hair"" proposed to let hair loops move freely with adapted products and without styling them. Naturex has presented a series of gourmet skin care formulas based on ingredients derived from the food business. Aldivia launched a 3-in-1 kit where it is possible to customize a mist with triggering actives responding to the demand of the moment. Univar broke boundaries with multifunctional products, such as lip-glosses that can also be used as eye-shadows. Eventually, men have not been forgotten since Thor created a new routine of daily beauty specifically for them. The next edition of in-cosmetics Global will take place in Amsterdam on 17-19 April 2018.

The new facility will be officially inaugurated on April 26th, 2017. ""I am convinced that these state-of-the-art laboratories will contribute to accompanying our customers more closely in their projects and to expanding our business in America. My priorities are clearly linked to establishing the future of Gattefossé through its geographical expansion, our efforts in R&D and the development of additional strategic alliances,"" said Jacques Moyrand, Gattefossé Group Chairman. Gattefossé's Technical Center of Excellence has been organized around four areas: – A main central open space for formulation featuring five benches equipped with hot plates, homogenizers, blenders, dispersers, water baths, rheometer, stereoscope and cross polarized light microscope. – A processing room with planetary mixers, 3 kg pilot reactor for emulsions, co-mill, vertically integrated hot melt extruder. – An analytical room equipped with differential scanning calorimetry, pH-stat, laser diffraction particle sizer, ultra-high pressure liquid chromatograph, dissolution bath coupled with autosampler for liquid chromatography vials and direct UV reading. – A stability room featuring 25°C/60% relative humidity and 40°C/75% relative humidity stability chambers. The range of equipment will be gradually expanded to encompass additional formulation techniques such as tableting, capsule filling, lipstick moulding and others. The new technical team will offer an interface with both pharmaceutical and personal care customers throughout North America by providing formulation troubleshooting, inspiration and technical support. As far as personal care products are concerned, the laboratory will develop specific formulas to meet local needs and trends. Gattefossé will continue to build its expertise in sensory evaluation, offer formulation support, train customers, and provide hand-on seminars. The initial works will be focused on skin care and sun care, to be followed by make-up and hair care. ""We want our customers to better understand our ingredients and their behaviour in final formulations. This new Technical Center of Excellence will allow us to demonstrate the benefits of using our ingredients and will provide the resources necessary to organize educational trainings"", said Ben Blinder, Senior Director, Personal Care Division. Gattefossé USA was the Group's first affiliate created overseas 35 years ago. Since this initial foray, Gattefossé has posted continuous growth in North America, expanding its presence all over the US territory and to Canada and Mexico with corporate offices in Paramus, NJ, Toronto, ON and Montreal, QC. Local service is also provided by long-term partners in the US Midwest and West Coast, as well as Mexico. Gattefossé operates three other technical centres around the world: in France, in China and in India."

"Sustainability, Brexit and Artificial Intelligence to head up the debate at in-cosmetics Global 2017","""We are very proud to be bringing in-cosmetics Global to London in 2017. It is a dynamic, vibrant and well-connected city which is accessible from around the world and we wanted to capitalise on this for our international audience. It is 15 years since we were last in the UK and so much has changed since then – there is a huge local visitor group which we will be tapping into, delivering new, exciting and inspiring visitors throughout the event,"" said Cathy Laporte, Exhibition Director. This year, R&D professionals and formulators participating in the show will be invited to put new make-up formulations to the test. The new Make-Up Bar area has been designed for exhibitors to demonstrate their expertise, enabling visitors to identify innovative pigments and technologies that will deliver the next generation of trend-setting colour cosmetics products. The other addition to the event, the Sustainability Corner, an open theatre, will help visitors explore the latest developments and initiatives in personal care sustainability. As for the previous years, novel ingredients launched within six months of the show opening will be presented in the Innovation Zone, where cosmetic professionals are invited to touch, smell and feel the products during a series of live demonstrations. This year's show will also see the return of the Formulation Lab with sessions designed to provide R&D and lab professionals with hands-on experience from the industry's leading experts into how to formulate the latest ingredients. Evonik, Lonza, Nikko, Dr. Straetmans and Symrise AG are among 14 suppliers already confirmed to take to the stage. In addition, the education programme will cover the latest market trends and issues including changes in the way consumers shop for beauty, Brexit, the sustainability debate and ethical developments, such as halal's influence across fragrances and cosmetic ingredients alike.

Consolidation among cosmetic ingredients producers to continue,"ThinkingLinking has analysed fifty acquisitions in cosmetic ingredients businesses during the five-year period from 2012 to 2016. In total, 45 acquirers were involved for an estimated amount of more than EUR 3 billion (GBP 2.5 billion). ""2012 and 2013 were slightly more active years in number of deals. Since then the picture has been stable, with around 10 deals a year and shows no signs of abating,"" said the company. The investors came from 16 countries and went into 20. Approximately half of the deals (28) were cross-border. Not surprisingly given the origin of the sector, Europe saw the greatest focus - both as the source of the investor and for the location of the target. However, emerging investors have appeared from the Middle East and increasingly from Asia. According to ThinkingLinking, the 45 investors include many new faces not seen before on the M&A market. ""They had previously been happy with organic growth but have now joined in the consolidation game,"" said the company. Although 'usual suspects' were behind many of the EUR 100m deals, the investors in the EUR 10-100m deal range were mostly well-funded mid-sized businesses making their first acquisition. ""Ingredients are being concentrated into fewer hands by companies with the confidence and commitment to pay high prices to play in a fast-changing world,"" commented Mark Dixon, the firm's Chief Thinking Officer. The investors fall into three main groups: financial investors, 'core' buyers from the cosmetic ingredients sector, and horizontal moves such as by food, beverages or pharmaceuticals ingredients producers entering cosmetic ingredients for the first time. The core investors are by far the most active. They are in effect rationalising a sector that has traditionally been restricted by ingredient and geography. The full report can be viewed at thinkinglinking.com"
Deinove and Greentech want to market new cosmetic actives derived from bacteria,"Greentech has chosen Deinove to develop new active substances from its panel of extremophile bacteria. Deinove had already screened its strains to identify activities sought after in the cosmetics industry. The Greentech and Deinove R&D teams will continue testing and working on the production, purification, and formulation of several compounds with the goal of bringing a first ingredient to market by the end of 2018. ""In our developments we aim to leverage the extraordinary ability of microorganisms to build mechanisms of adaptation and resistance in extreme environments: hot, cold, hypersaline, radioactive, acid, basic, etc. Deinove's bacteria are unique and can bring real added value to our portfolio of ingredients intended to protect and beautify the skin,"" commented Jean-Yves Berthon, CEO of Greentech. Deinove undertook in 2016 an extensive screening program of its bacterial collection to identify strains with properties that could be useful in cosmetic applications, mainly in skin care. A selection of 430 wild-type strains was screened by the Fluofarma laboratory, specializing in cell-based assays, to assess the effect of compounds in various applications and especially in cosmetics. In vitro screening tests helped to identify successfully dozens of strains with sought-after properties in cosmetics, nutrition, and health: – Antioxidant properties, for anti-aging, firmness or anti-UV, for example; – Anti-inflammatory, especially for a soothing effect (for sensitive or irritated skin, or for post-operative skin care); – Healing properties for damaged or photo-damaged skin, post-operative applications, repair, anti-aging; – Activity on lipolysis for slimming, anti-cellulite; – Action on lipid storage that can be exploited for a plumping and moisturizing effect, etc. ""These results are a solid foundation for the development of our activities, initially in cosmetics, skin and hair. As we foresaw, our strain bank has exceptional potential. This is now fully confirmed and we have a catalog of strains with various and identified properties,"" said Emmanuel Petiot, CEO of Deinove. Based in Montpellier, Deinove employs approximately 50 employees and has nearly 160 international patent applications. The company is specialised in the discovery, development and production of compounds with industrial value from rare microorganisms, for the healthcare, nutrition and cosmetics markets. Deinove relies on two key assets: a unique strain bank with 6,000 rare bacteria that have not yet been exploited, mainly of the Deinococcus genus; and a genetic, metabolic and fermentation engineering platform that enables them to customize these natural micro-factories, transforming them into new industry standards. Also note that Greentech will speak on issues related to microbiota and cosmetics in a conference organized by Premium Beauty News at in-cosmetics London next week. More information here."
TechnicoFlor invests in a new production site,"The construction of the new production site is scheduled to start at the end of 2017 in Allauch, Provence, Southern France. The new facility will feature two industrial buildings: one dedicated to the production of perfumes and the other to the production of raw materials. The new site will replace the current production unit which employs 70 people on an area of 2000 m2. With a total area of 3,000-3,500 m2 on a land area of 20,000 m2, the new production tool is expected to be operational at the end of 2018. It will enable TechnicoFlor to double its production capacity. All production, mixing, packaging, quality control and shipments will be carried out in the new buildings. The company - which already uses 5 automated weighing and mixing machines that can produce 0.05 g. to 50 kg. of compounds, 24 hours a day under software supervision - has designed fully robotised lines for its new units. They will feature several new generation robots, including a powder weighing machine, allowing ultra-precise dosages, regardless the particles size. The production and packaging will be carried out by gravity in order to avoid using pumps. Eventually, the construction of an unloading dock featuring three special doors adapted to trailers will facilitate deliveries. This investment should allow the French designer of aromatic composition to address the challenges linked to its growth and to better serve its customers in particular with shortened delivery lead times, which are expected to drop down to 4 or 5 days of processing - irrespective of product type and volumes ordered. ""We needed a new production unit to anticipate our growth and support our development. Our future production centre and its state-of-the-art equipment is designed to optimize the delivery lead time. It will meet stringent environmental quality standards, in line with our environmental policy,"" explains François-Patrick Sabater, President of TechnicoFlor. Indeed, the company has been involved for many years in a demanding eco-environmental approach. In the Valley of Nepal, for instance, TechnicoFlor supports Man & Nature, a non-profit organisation that helps farmers from the Bardia National Park and their families. This initiative allows the company to collect an ultra-premium quality of essential oils (Chamomile, Ginger, Curcuma, Lemongrass, Coriander, Mint, Lemongrass, Eucalyptus, Lantana, Calamus, Basil ...) while helping local populations and contributing to the protection of the fauna. The new building will thus meet France's HQE (High Environmental Quality) standards, and will feature a rainwater collecting system and a green roof. TechnicoFlor is a family-owned group created in 1982by François-Patrick Sabater. The company has been supplying many major perfumery and cosmetics brands for nearly 30 years. With offices in Miami, Dubai, Singapore, Jarkarta, Bangkok and Shanghai, TechnicoFlor distributes its products in more than 60 countries in the Middle East, Asia, Western Europe and Central Europe. With a total of 200 employees and a team of eight perfumers, the Group has consolidated sales of nearly 50 million Euros, 30% in France and 70% in international markets. It sales grew by 14% in 2016, while revenues grew by 12%."
Gattefossé: A new organic active for the eye contour area,"The new addition to the Gatuline range is obtained from organic horse chestnut flowers. Gattefossé's Gatuline Link n Lift has been specifically developed to lift the eye contour area. Indeed, the fragility of the eye contour and its permanent motion favour the formation of wrinkles. ""Gatuline Link n Lift restores fibroblast dynamism and acts on the dermal-epidermal junction to firmly reconnect the epidermis to the dermis. Wrinkles around the eyes are visibly erased and a positive expression is restored,"" claims Gattefossé. The efficacy of Gatuline Link n Lift was evaluated through in vitro tests. According to Gattefossé, the tests have demonstrated the active's impact on the dermis, in particular on fibroblast dynamism and mobility to help the skin fight matrix degradation. The ingredients manufacturer also claims that Gatuline Link n Lift ""reinforces the dermal-epidermal junction integrity and functionality by stimulating the synthesis of all major components involved in the epidermis-dermis cohesion and communication"". The efficacy of Gatuline Link n Lift was also tested in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. According to Gattefossé, used at 2% in formulation, Gatuline Link n Lift ""visibly acts on all eye contour wrinkles (crow's feet, under-eye and tear trough (also called valley of tears), with the first effects visible in just 2 weeks."" Gatuline Link n Lift is Gattefossé's first active obtained using the NaDES (Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents) technology. It contains active molecules found only in the horse chestnut flower. ""The NaDES technology allows the creation of active compositions unattainable with conventional solvents. Natural, non-toxic and efficient at low temperatures, this technology is perfectly aligned with Gattefossé's strategy to provide high-performance sustainable ingredients,"" highlights the company. The horse chestnut flowers are selectively and manually picked in Ardèche (South of France). Gattefossé has set up a responsible sourcing procedure and the ingredient is certified organic."
"""The acquisition of Serdex will help us gain new CSR skills"", Caroline Drouart, Seppic","Premium Beauty News - Seppic announced the acquisition of the Bayer group's Serdex division in early January. Now, that is quite useful to enrich your portfolio of natural ingredients! Caroline Drouart - Obviously, this acquisition helps widen our product offering for the booming market of natural actives designed for the cosmetics industry. It corresponds to a basic strategy for our group, but we also intend to add a new technological bedrock to our know-how. We are experts in bio-based chemistry, and since the acquisition of BiotechMarine, we have developed new ingredients derived from marine biotechnology. The acquisition of Serdex gives us access to highly pure plant extraction technologies. As an example, Serdex produces very accurately titrated extracts for the pharmaceutical industry and boasts an exceptional expertise in extraction techniques. Just like BiotechMarine, Serdex becomes a Seppic subsidiary. It will still be based in Pau, France. As a result, Seppic has three industrial sites in France: our historical site in Castres, in the south of France, dedicated to bio-based chemistry for cosmetics, the site of Pontrieux in Brittany for marine biotechnologies, and now the site of Serdex in Pau, for plant extraction. The acquisition of Serdex also helps develop our position on the dermo-cosmetics market, which is their historic market and represents a strong growth driver for the next few years. Premium Beauty News - Seppic and Serdex also seem very complementary on the geographic level. Caroline Drouart - As a matter of fact, Serdex helps us strengthen our presence for certain key accounts in France, for whom the company very regularly works as a unique supplier on tailor-made development projects. In addition, Serdex has a huge potential on the global scale: the company generates most of its turnover (8 million euros in 2015) in France, while 75% of Seppic's turnover comes from international activities. This way, Serdex will be able to benefit from our strong commercial network around the world. Premium Beauty News - Serdex was also famous for their commitment in CSR. Will their policy be pursued? Caroline Drouart - Not only Serdex's CSR commitment will be continued, but we intend to draw inspiration from their remarkable experience for everyone at Seppic to acquire new skills in this area. Serdex has been a member of the UEBT [1] since 2008, and got a 9.5/10 mark at the 2014 audit, so we are eager to benefit from their know-how. Serdex is recognized for its ability to set up environmentally friendly supply chains for exotic plants, while enhancing the quality and skills of local suppliers, as well as the social and economic development of local communities. For example, the company has an excellent base in Madagascar. Premium Beauty News - Are other acquisitions considered? Caroline Drouart - Indeed, Seppic aims to pursue its external growth strategy, maybe on the global level."
Three top trends in cosmetics formulation to look for in 2017,"""Consumers want product to suit them, matching their lifestyle, their skin, their tone, their look. When it comes to developments in 2017, think about how you can customise, or provide a customisation option, for your consumer,"" recommends the Institute of Personal Care Science. Customisation options for cosmetic formulations include: – Customisable bases with optional actives. A base serum, cream or crème-gel formulated to suit a target market can be complemented with concentrated 'active' serums to add to the base to suite specific skin needs at any given moment. For example, when their skin is feeling dry, customers can add drops of a 'hydrating serum' to the base. ""Make sure your base addresses key concerns in general such as anti-pollution but provide active concentrates with easy dispensing units and clear instructions for true customisation and a happy consumer,"" says the Institute of Personal Care Science. – Colour cosmetics should also become customisable in 2017. For instance, cosmetics makers can provide a multi-colour palette with instructional on-line videos on how to make lipstick pinks and reds 'hotter' or more 'muted'. They can also create foundations (liquid and/or powder) that can be adjusted to be slightly lighter or darker depending on consumers' skin tone depending on the season. – Scents will not be left aside the customisation trend this year. For instance, scents can be modified by the consumer with small additions of concentrates to adapt a base to their daily moods. – Eventually, the Institute of Personal Care Science, an Australia-based organisation dedicated to the education of the personal care industry around the world, has identified the 3 top trends in cosmetics formulation for 2017.] forecasts an explosion of apps that will enable customers to 'try before they buy' in a virtual reality space, and will be tailored to help self-selection of the best actives, colour and scent. This trend has been growing in recent years and will become a mainstay this year. So cosmetics makers need to incorporate their sustainability message into their general marketing and company philosophies. ""Using sustainably sourced materials is a must moving forward; but adding to this message are other environmentally and/or community focussed messages. From greening up your carbon footprint, using materials that 'give back' and even making a point of your recycled packaging, make sure your marketing provides the sustainability message of your brand as a mainstay from 2017 on,"" says the Institute of Personal Care Science, an Australia-based organisation dedicated to the education of the personal care industry around the world, has identified the 3 top trends in cosmetics formulation for 2017.]. The use of film formers to enable make-up to withstand exercise and be selfie-ready at a moments' notice is really taking off. This trend is especially prevalent in the major growth area of colour cosmetics: Asian trend setting women from 20 right through to 35 who also have the highest social media use and exploration of colour cosmetics. Cosmetics makers should provide them with fantastic sweat/wear proof make-up to take them from the gym through the day and into the night with interesting YouTube footage (and even an app!) to really capture their attention."
Naturex to showcase new Eutectys haircare actives and superhoneys at Cosmetagora,"""A few years ago, terms like eco-friendly, sustainability, and traceability, were not part of consumer vocabulary when it came to cosmetics. These now familiar concepts are the driving forces behind the growth of the natural cosmetics market,"" explains Naturex in a release. In line with this growing market demand, the French company specialising in botanical ingredients will showcase several innovative natural actives at the Cosmetagora show. Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents (NaDES) are a type of natural solvent that reproduce the plants' intracellular environment. Leading the way in the development of this cutting-edge technology, last year Naturex launched a patented extraction process called Eutectigenesis, which consists of extracting the active compounds of the plant through the formation of NaDES. The obtained ""Eutectys™"" compounds show augmented phytoactive profiles and improved performance. Naturex has expanding the Eutectys technology to haircare, and will be showcasing two brand new actives this year: – Horsetail: The Eutectigenesis-obtained extract is rich in phenolic compounds and demonstrates impressive anti-frizz and radiance activities. Tested on curly human hair, Horsetail Eutectys BLA demonstrates the ability to reduce frizziness by 458%. – Saffron flower: This well-known spice also has recognized cosmetic benefits, thanks to its beautiful flowers. Eutectigenesis gives this extract a wider and richer spectrum of actives. Saffron flower Eutectys™ BLA is the perfect active to increase hair manageability and suppleness. By reducing friction, it ensures easy-to-tame hair and eases combing. Naturex will also showcase its ready-to-use cosmetic honeys selection, boasting six different honey varieties, from all around the world. French-lavender, Romanian acacia, Spanish orange blossom or New Zealand Manuka, every Naturex honey is highly traceable, carefully selected and designed for perfect formulability. ""An incredible natural ingredient with moisturizing, dermo-purifying, healing and soothing powers, honey has been used for centuries. Each honey or honey extract is in itself a unique natural formulation, perfumed and enriched by its floral origin and geography,"" said the company. Three applications will be unveiled at the show, including a purifying honey powder, and a gentle honey face scrub. ""As an ever-increasing number of potent natural-based beauty formulations are launched, consumers are now convinced that these types of products can benefit them personally while protecting the environment. Increasing the efficacy of natural personal care products is a sure way to attract new customers,"" highlights Stéphanie Puel, director of Naturex Personal Care Business Unit."
Lipotec aims to reprogram the skin through epigenetics,"Among the biological processes regulated by means of epigenetics Lipotec chose to focus on the control of the fate of progenitor cells located in the basal layer of the epidermis. ""The epidermis is one of the most active tissues in terms of regeneration thanks to the ability of the stem cells from the basal layer to divide and renew themselves. With age, this regenerative potential and the overall function of epidermis are reduced resulting in the development of aging signs, such as appearance of wrinkles and loss of radiance,"" explains the company. To address this problem, Lipotec has developed Reproage, a new peptide that may induce cellular reprogramming in the epidermal basal layer through the modulation of epigenetic elements, thus helping to reactivate basal cells and their regenerative abilities, leading to an improved appearance of mature skin. The new peptide specifically targets the microRNA-145, an epigenetic regulator known to repress the activity of the stem cell transcription factors, restraining the stemness properties of the basal cells. According to Lipotec, ""Reproage reduces the levels of microRNA-145 and increases the level of the stem cell factors related to stemness, contributing to an improvement in the skin properties."" Lipotec performed two in vivo assays, using 2% peptide solution twice a day during 56 days. The tests showed a general improvement in skin complexion and more radiance with 1.5% increase in luminance as well as a rejuvenated skin with epidermal self-renewal activity increased to the level of a skin 17 years younger in the 50-55 years old volunteers and up to 41.3% decrease in skin roughness. ""Reproage peptide assists in obtaining a smoother, more radiant and visually rejuvenated complexion and can be incorporated into any anti-aging formulation to cope with the slowdown in skin regeneration that takes place with age or in products designed to rejuvenate the skin,"" concludes the company."
Seppic launches a new anti-pollution active derived from macro-algae cell culture,"To protect the skin from the ravages of pollution, Contacticel is an extract from a little known red algae, Acro chaetium moniliforme, which lives in contact with other algae. In association with other micro-organisms, it helps to protect its host against outside aggressions. Drawing inspiration from the properties of this algae, Seppic's new active ingredient offers the skin protection against pollution. ""In two months, it effectively reduces the sebum of skin exposed to a polluted atmosphere with a visible and lasting result,"" claims the cosmetics ingredients supplier. According to Seppic, Contacticel is an exceptional skin-purifying agent that works against several pollutants (ozone, microparticles, heavy metals) through its combined properties. ""92% of the world's population lives in an environment that is too polluted, which causes numerous adverse impacts on the skin, such as early aging, cutaneous malfunctions or over-production of sebum,"" highlights the company. After Ephemer, Contacticel is the second active ingredient that Seppic has developed with the Celebrity technology, which makes it possible here to produce large quantities of biomass from an algae that could not be cultivated or harvested in its natural setting. ""This innovative technology enables us once again to enhance a rare marine species and draw inspiration to create an original active ingredient that promotes healthy skin. It's a great example of bio-inspiration,"" confirms Erwan Le Gélébart, R&D project manager for BiotechMarine."
Huntsman launches new TiO2 pigment for premium cosmetic formulations,"Global chemical company Huntsman has developed a brand new, super pure grade of titanium dioxide (TiO2) that can be used to improve the opacity of premium cosmetic products that need to provide excellent uniform coverage. The Hombitan AFDC 101 pigment is a unique, high purity, uncoated anatase grade of TiO2 with a very narrow particle size distribution. ""Delivering better opacity performance than standard white pigment grades, Hombitan AFDC 101 pigment is ideally suited for use in high-end cosmetic formulations including foundations, eye shadows, face powders and lipsticks,"" said the company. The Hombitan AFDC 101 pigment, which is of mineral origin, is created using a special process technology devised by Huntsman, which gives it greater control over crystal size and particle distribution. Using its enhanced crystal size control technology, Huntsman is able to produce crystal size distributions that are optimized to reflect selected wavelengths of light. In the case of Hombitan AFDC 101 pigment, the result is a product that combines the softness of an anatase pigment with the opacity of a rutile pigment. ""The launch of Hombitan AFDC101 pigment represents a major breakthrough in our TiO2 offering to the premium cosmetics industry. It is the first product made using our enhanced crystal size control technology, which gives us the ability to fine-tune both particle size and distribution to suit specific applications. Hombitan AFDC 101 pigment has consistently fine particles over a consistently narrow distribution. There is no other product that offers the same properties,"" said Reiner Mertscheit, Sales and Marketing Director at Huntsman. Used as a white, natural, identical colour additive, Hombitan AFDC 101 pigment can work on its own or in combination with colour pigments. According to Huntsman, it disperses rapidly into formulations and is ideal for use in aqueous systems such as creams, which use water as a wetting agent. Hombitan AFDC 101 pigment is compliant with relevant regulations including ISO 9001 (quality); ISO 14001 (environment); ISO 18001 (health and safety); ISO 22000 / FSSC 22000 (food); and Ecocert / Cosmos. It is also satisfies kosher and halal requirements."
Symrise widens its range of antipollution actives,"Despite the introduction of threshold limits and driving restrictions, air pollution continues to increase in cities around the globe. ""This extreme situation is very detrimental to skin,"" explains Symrise. According to the cosmetics ingredients supplier, consumers are increasingly aware of this and their demand for product solutions and formulations that restore skin's balance is constantly growing. Indeed, studies show that urban dwellers develop 20 percent more pigmentation spots and show a more stressed complexion than rural residents. Professor Jean Krutmann and his research team at the Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine (IUF) in Düsseldorf have revealed the harmful effects of Particulate Matter on skin. ""Thanks to the studies from the Leibnitz Institute for Environmental Medicine, we now know exactly how these tiny particles attack and damage skin,"" says Dr. William Johncock, Senior Vice President Cosmetic Ingredients Business Unit Sun Protection and Functionals at Symrise. According to Symrise, until recently, skincare solutions to fight pollution were limited to antioxidant strategies and protective skin-coating polymers. Neither offered complete protection against the effects of Particulate Matter and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). ""Since we now understand precisely how particulate matter affect the skin, we were able to design an evaluation protocol involving standardized particles and specific markers. This provides us with an objective and reliable framework for assessing the efficacy of anti-pollution actives,"" continues Johncock. Originally launched at in-cosmetics 2016 in Paris, SymUrban can ""protect skin from the harmful effects of Particulate Matter - including collagen degradation, overproduction of melanin and inflammatory processes."" SymUrban adds to a portfolio of active ingredients allowing the formulation of complete product lines to defend the skin against environmental aggressions: – Dragosine helps protect the skin against infrared-induced damages and can support the global protection against sun rays beyond the UV spectrum. – The natural raw materials SymVital AR and SymFinity 1298 reduce the effect of diesel exhaust particles, which exist in cities at extremely high concentrations. They can thus help to significantly reduce the risk of inflammation and pigmentation resulting in a more even skin tone. – SymRepair 100 uses a special formula that reinforces the natural skin barrier while the Neo Heliopan range comprises diverse filters that protect the skin from UV light."
Silab takes care of compromised skin with a new active and a new division,"AD-RESYL, Silab's new patented natural active ingredient dedicated to the comfort and resilience of atopic skin. The molecule was specifically developed to prevent the clinical signs of atopic dermatitis by prolonging remission periods following treatment with corticosteroid therapy. ""With the launch of AD-RESYL, Silab offers a dermo-cosmetic approach of atopic dermatitis,"" says Brigitte Closs-Gonthier, Deputy Managing Director for Research. ""Our goal was to decrease the frequency of inflammatory periods, with a molecule meeting our criteria: efficacy, naturality, and safety."" Silab screened no less than 57 raw materials to launch this new active. The French laboratory eventually chose an extract of Ophiopogon japonicas (dwarf lilyturf), a plant with tuberous roots known for their resistance to drought and native to China and South Korea. The efficacy of AD-RESYL was demonstrated by a series of in vitro and in vivo assessments. Silab used a 3D model reproducing a skin affected by atopic dermatitis. Tests were also on cohorts of Caucasian and Asian children and/or adults. ""AD-RESYL meets the many expectations of patients on the lookout for care and comfort to restore health to their skin: it benefits from clinically demonstrated efficacy, optimum skin tolerance, and a controlled natural raw material,"" said Silab. The launch of AD-RESYL is the result of over 5 years of research by multidisciplinary teams made up of molecular biologists, bioinformaticians, clinical experts and process engineers. In the wake of this innovation, Silab intends to invest in the long term to address the markets of dermo-cosmetics and dermatology. ""Our conviction is that the skin care market is moving towards an increased medicalization,"" explains Xavier Gaillard, Silab's Deputy General Manager. ""It is less about beauty and more about well-being."" In order to extend its knowledge of healthy skin to the problems of compromised skin, Silab has created the Silab softcare division, which is dedicated to the research, production and marketing of innovative natural active ingredients specifically designed to care for dermatological disorders by restoring the homeostasis of healthy skin. ""Silab softcare relies on Silab's expertise, capacity for innovation and responsive organization to broaden acquired knowledge of healthy skin to the problems of compromised skin,"" adds the company. According to company executives, Silab softcare should strongly contribute to help the group to reach its target to double size within 5 years. In 2015, Silab's achieved a turnover of EUR 40 million, 60% on export markets."
"in-cosmetics: More than 2,000 visitors at first event in North America","The future of the personal care industry will be based on specialty ingredients, announced Nikola Matic from Kline at the opening of the two-day event which took place at Pier 36 on September 07-08 in New York City. He is certainly right, considering the numbers of members of the industry who visited the event where 160-plus exhibitors were showcasing their latest ingredients. A total visitor attendance of more than 2,000, including senior scientists and R&D representatives from 23 of the top 25 US manufacturers. ""in-cosmetics North America stands out as a truly international event. The Innovation Seminars were one of the highlights of the event. The high profile speakers and the topics were spot on, answering the questions that companies like ours are asking,"" said Evonne Lau, Scientist at Unilever. ""We travelled to in-cosmetics North America to source new raw materials for our future products. The quality conversations we had with suppliers in attendance were extremely useful to us and will help manufacturers create some unique products,"" commented Elizabeth Thomas, Director of Regulatory Affairs at L Brands. Exhibitors were showcasing their latest ingredients - some of whom had never presented at a trade show in the region before. The latest innovations from AkzoNobel, Ashland, Cargill, Clariant, Lonza Consumer Care and Solvay were all on display, with the show's Innovation Zone presenting some of the best ingredients launched in the last six months. ""We've seen many new suppliers with super-innovative ingredients, many of whom we have never met before,"" said Brianne Repasy, Color Chemist at Cosmetic Group USA. The overall success of the show saw the in-cosmetics Group announce that the event will be moving to a larger venue in 2017, as Daniel Zanetti, Exhibition Director of in-cosmetics North America, explains: ""We were confident that this event would be a success and the numbers recorded have proven that it is a valuable addition to the personal care product manufacturers calendar. Not only are we able to bring in some of the most innovative suppliers from across the globe, we provide visitors with a unique setting to learn about trends and new formulation techniques. in-cosmetics North America is here to stay and we're proud to be growing the show next year at the Javits Center."" in-cosmetics North America will return from October 11–12 2017 at the Javits Center in New York."
Anti-pollution and halal among hot topics at in-cosmetics Asia 2016,"According to Euromonitor International, the Asia Pacific (APAC) beauty and personal care market is set to grow by almost 25% over the next four years, reaching a value of US$167bn [1]. This will be fuelled by increasing demand for products in China and India, which will contribute three-quarters of the absolute growth by 2020. While China and India will be the driving forces behind the region's growth, Japan remains a key player, with sales of beauty and personal care products accounting for a fifth of the marketplace. Indonesia, which has seen its market double in size since 2010, will continue to thrive, with growth of 7.5% expected per annum, as will South Korea - where the male grooming sector continues to play a major role. From a global perspective, APAC currently represents 31% of the market. Come 2020, that figure is expected to reach 34%. Asia is now seen as a leading source of innovation, which is helping create new demand for cosmetic products, not only in the region but across the world. Asia-led trends, like eye-raising snail cream, and functional cosmetics have taken the industry by storm and are becoming increasingly popular in the West. Taking place in Bangkok from 8-10 November [2], in-cosmetics Asia will feature more than 300 suppliers and over 50 hours of educational sessions, all of which are free-to-attend. ""Our ambition is that finished product manufactures and R&D professionals leave in-cosmetics Asia with a clear idea of how they will create the next generation of products. The 2016 event will present the latest ingredients, raw materials and formulations, from across the globe, alongside a programme of seminars that will deliver invaluable technical information, regulatory advice and marketing trends,"" commented Sarah Gibson, Exhibition Director of in-cosmetics Asia. New local suppliers as well as international businesses - around a third of the companies on the show floor will have travelled from outside of the Asia Pacific region and 89% from outside Thailand - already confirmed to exhibit at the event including Evonik Nutrition & Care, Innospec, Mibelle AG Biochemistry, Natura Tec, Silab and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. The popular Innovation Zone will showcase the latest ground-breaking ingredients and technologies that will have launched within eight months of the show, or are set to be revealed there. What's more, on 9 November, a panel of international experts will announce the winners of this year's Best New Active Ingredient and Best New Functional Ingredient awards. In parallel to the exhibition, the educational programme will present the latest trends, market analysis and research that will shape the future of the APAC cosmetic market. R&D professionals will also be able to attend practical sessions that provide hands-on formulation training, while a series of seminars will highlight unique ingredients, claims and formulation techniques. Asian consumer trends will be explored in detail during a presentation by Joanna Chan, Research Analyst at Euromonitor International. She will advise visitors that the Asian beauty market has yet to reach maturity and that there is significant room for growth, which could be realised by tapping into the region's diverse markets and evolving ingredients ranges. Chan will also discuss key trends, focusing on customisation, wellness and digital retailing. Tommy Kong, General Manager of the Cosmetic Division in the REACH24H Consulting Group, will provide the latest updates on Chinese cosmetic regulation and the potential impacts. Since last year, the Chinese cosmetic regulatory environment has seen much change following the revision of Cosmetic Safety and Technical Standards, the issuing of Cosmetic Safety Assessment Guidance and the adjustment on the new plant ingredient registration. This session will provide an overview of China's cosmetic regulatory system and the recent changes, providing attendees with essential information. In addition, Belinda Carli, Director of the Institute of Personal Care Science, will deliver a session designed to help manufacturers rapidly create new bases, as well as exploring how to test the stability of formulations and ensure good quality delivery and efficacy. ""With increasing consumer demands and the pressures of launching innovative new products, developing disruptive formulations quickly is paramount. The standard development time of 12-18 months is no longer acceptable to brands or conducive to consumer trends."" Also, given the global focus on anti-pollution products, Personal Care magazine will give visitors an overview of the concept of skin protection, as well as considering the reasons behind this sector's growth in popularity. Editor Richard Scott will take attendees through ingredients that can help protect against pollution, HEV light and the sun, as well as discussing the skin microbiome. Eventually, 2016 sees the launch of the new in-cosmetics Asia Spotlight On… product areas, which will focus on the key trends of Halal, anti-pollution and France. As well as showcasing products in each area, the three themes will be discussed in detail during the event's Marketing Trends programme. ""The event is all about inspiring businesses to create new products and we believe this year's programme will enable attendees to confidently plan for a successful future. We look forward to welcoming the industry to the event in November,"" concluded Sarah Gibson."
Univar continues repositioning its businesses with the opening of a new laboratory in France,"Located in Versailles, in the western part of Paris greater urban area, on the campus of ISIPCA (Institut Supérieur International du Parfum de la Cosmétique et de l'Aromatique), a leading institution for post-graduate studies in perfume, cosmetics, and food flavour formulation, Univar's new technical excellence centre is dedicated to servicing the personal care industry - mainly hair care, skin care, sun care, and personal hygiene products producers - across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). Furthermore, according to Univar, the new technical centre will enhance the company's ability to provide formulation expertise and innovative solutions to its customers. ""We are delighted to expand our presence and capabilities in the market with a new technical centre strategically located at the centre of personal care innovation on the ISIPCA campus,"" said Matthew Ottaway, Industry Director, Personal Care, Univar EMEA.

French perfumers smell success in crusade for UN recognition,"When Joseph Mul walks through his field of sweet-smelling Provence roses, the raw ingredients of Chanel N°5, he follows in the footsteps of his great grandfather who began growing flowers for perfume in 1840. Mul, 77, is continuing the tradition of one generation instructing the next in the secrets of floral cultivation by preparing to hand over his livelihood to son-in-law, Fabrice Bianchi. ""He was converted the day he married my daughter,"" said Mul. ""The apprenticeship is done 'in situ' in the fields, it's a permanent exchange between our two generations, a transfer of know-how that allows us to manage the plants,"" said Bianchi as he picked a Provence rose, also known as a May rose. ""This rose was designed to appeal to the nostrils. Its smell is very balanced and velvety."" It is this rich heritage that the flower growers in the southeast French town of Grasse, including Mul, a well-known figure in the industry, are now pushing to have recognised by the UN's cultural agency, UNESCO. They have been joined in their crusade by France's perfume makers as well as the companies responsible for processing their raw materials. Grasse, a town of around 50,000 people, has been associated with perfume since the 17th century under Louis XIV when the area's leather makers — there since the Middle Ages — began to create scented oil to fragrance their wares, particularly gloves. The sun king is rumoured to have used so much that the scent made him ill. As a result of the demand for floral oils, fields of flowers began to speckle the region. But a property boom in the 1970s coupled with strong competition from cheaper overseas producers threatened the viability of Grasse's perfume industry. Despite the headwinds, Grasse has since reasserted its position at the forefront of global perfume manufacturing, hosting famous names like Robertet and Fragonard and employing as many as 3,000 people. Today perfumes are heavily associated with fashion and celebrities, a trend started by Coco Chanel's N°5 in 1921. Since then perfumes have become a core part of a designer's franchise, with the world's leading luxury company LVMH opening a perfume testing laboratory in Grasse in September. The base will develop the next generation of scents for Dior and Louis Vuitton, helping to secure Grasse's position as a global hub for perfume. Several other renowned perfumes come directly from factories in and around Grasse using both natural and synthetic ingredients from across the world. ""Such a concentration of know-how doesn't exist anywhere else in the world. It's here that you have to come to perfect a natural product,"" said Jacques Cavallier-Belletrud, the son and grandson of Grasse perfume makers and now a designer and ""nose"" for Louis Vuitton. He has joined the chorus calling for Grasse's centuries of perfume expertise to be added to UNESCO's list of ""intangible cultural heritage"" following France's application in March 2015. While France officially recognised the region's valuable perfume heritage in 2014, it could take years for the United Nations to do the same. It is hoped that Grasse's bid will promote traditional oral teaching of perfume making techniques. ""A very colourful language, unique to perfumers, allows us to communicate emotion very quickly. With my father I understand instantly,"" said Cavallier-Belletrud. ""A perfume is an idea and a collection of emotions that can be shared."" Carole Biancalana, a fourth generation grower of flowers for perfume, said that it is vital that Grasse's heritage be recognised to celebrate its history and secure its future. ""It is important to help label our heritage, to attract young people into the profession, and to pay tribute to past generations,"" she said."
Cosmetic ingredients: Global demand for aloe vera continues growing,"According to a recent report by FMI, aloe vera extract is becoming an essential ingredient in food, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, with global volume in 2016 set to surpass 60,720.4 tonnes, representing revenues worth US$ 1.6 billion. And the trend is predicted to continue for some time, with global revenues tipped to surpass US$ 3.3 billion by 2026. [1] Cosmetics, the largest sector when it comes to aloe vera extracts, will account for over 45 percent of global demand in 2016, seeing a 6 percent increase from 2015, the report predicts. Why is aloe vera so popular? The trend reflects a wider adoption of natural and organic beauty products and techniques. The growth of the 'Slow Cosmetic' movement in Europe, which focuses on products made from 100 percent natural ingredients and formulas, and, more generally, the strong growth of the natural and organic cosmetic segment, and good illustration of the trend. Furthermore, most fashion and beauty brands are turning to more sustainable attitudes and eco-friendly methods. Demand is also driven by the geographical diversification of consumption. Today, Germany is the largest consumer of aloe vera extract (more than 3,139 tonnes in 2015). The country should further its lead as the largest market in 2016, witnessing a year-to-year volume increase of 5.3%. However, demand is growing at healthy rate in the Asia Pacific region where rising incomes of the middle class allow it to turn to natural and organic cosmetics. Aloe vera is one of the most studied plants worldwide. There is hardly any plant that can display such a great variety of scientifically-proven active ingredients. Actually, it is one of the highest-performing natural beauty ingredients. Its natural clear gel has long been used medicinally as a skin cure for wounds and infections, but it is increasingly being incorporated into cosmetic treatments for conditions such as eczema, dandruff and psoriasis. Its anti-inflammatory properties also make it a useful ingredient for fighting acne and other skin imbalances. The plant provides anti-oxidants, and vitamin C and E, said to firm and hydrate the skin, improving its elasticity with regular application. As a natural moisturizer, it brings oxygen to the skin, strengthening it from within. As if that wasn't enough, aloe vera is also thought to soothe arthritis, rheumatism and digestion - and we all know that beauty starts from within. As far as suppliers are concerned, the global aloe vera extracts market is highly fragmented, with the top eight players (including Lily of the Desert Organic Aloeceuticals, Aloe Farms Inc., Terry Laboratories Inc., Foodchem International Corporation, Natural Aloe Costa Rica S.A., Pharmachem Laboratories Inc., Aloecorp Inc., and Aloe Laboratories Inc.) accounting for around 6-7% revenue share of the global market in 2015. According to FMI, leading companies are looking to expand their production capacity and launch new product offerings in a bid to increase market share, expand customer base and achieve a competitive edge."
Gatuline Renew: A new botanical active to address skin texture problems,"While it is widely known that skin texture degradation is one of the key signs that betray age, it is also one of the most difficult to correct. ""Under the action of age and environment (pollution, UV) skin becomes thinner, with a drier and rougher surface and dead cells are more difficult to eliminate,"" explains Gattefossé. ""Contrary to wrinkles and sagging, skin texture cannot be corrected by injections or surgical procedures, nor fully hidden by make-up."" Gatuline Renew has been designed to address specifically the problem of skin texture. According to Gattefossé, the active relaunches the cell renewal mechanism, restoring the capacity of the skin to regenerate and defend itself, thus restoring a perfect, smooth skin, both to the eye and to touch. ""Used at only 1% in formulation, it rebuilds the epidermis and restores efficient skin barrier function. In a blind study versus placebo, panelists showed significantly higher appraisal levels for the half-face treated with the active cream - it is smoother, more radiant and look healthier. A use-test demonstrates suitability for sensitive skins,"" highlights the French company. The active's action throughout the epidermis was demonstrated in vitro and ex vivo on advanced skin models. ""Tested on 3D cellular models and skin biopsies, the biological mechanism is fully understood and documented,"" claims Gattefossé. The company thus demonstrated that Gatuline Renew increases keratinocyte energy and boosts all processes essential to proper epidermal reconstruction: proliferation, differentiation, cornification and desquamation. It increases the biosynthesis of key ceramides, improving corneocyte cohesion. As a result, the thickness of the healthy living epidermal layers is visibly increased. ""The skin fully recovers its barrier function ensuring optimal preservation of water content and improved auto-regulation."" Gatuline Renew is an extract of buds of Cryptomeria japonica, a Japanese cedar tree which grows in the clean air environment of the French Reunion Island. The buds, harvested by hand from the lower parts of the trees, are air dried and sent to Gattefossé's French production site near Lyon for extraction. These buds contain a high amount of skin-stimulating molecules including a specific diterpenoid named isopimaric acid which is a signature molecule of the plant species and the main contributor to the skin renewal efficacy. They also contain high levels of polyphenols, peptides, sugars and lipidic compounds. Obtained using vegetable-derived solvents, this ECOCERT/ COSMOS approved and NPA certified ingredient can be used in natural and organic cosmetic lines. Gattefossé also says that Gatuline Renew is fully traced from plant to pack. In order to illustrate the formulation possibilities offered by its active, Gattefossé has showcased several skin care formulations during in-cosmetics: a skin rejuvenation elixir, a daily revitalizer, a powdery blur reinvented, a night regenerator, a reviving body cocoon."
Are ingredients derived from food wastes the ultimate sustainability advance?,"About a third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted in the supply chain indicate Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates. With food companies and retailers under pressure to become more efficient and reduce losses, many are re-directing food waste from landfill. According to market research firm Organic Monitor, a transition is occurring whereby waste previously going to low-end applications - such as animal feed and biogas - is making its way into new ingredients. ""Novel ingredients are being created from food waste as new technologies improve extraction and processing methods,"" highlights Organic Monitor. For instance, the Swiss company FoodSolutionsTeam is using green chemistry to extract active materials from food side streams. Made from carrot pulp, its KaroPRO ingredient has water binding applications in processed foods. The Swiss company has similar food ingredients made from organic linseed, peas and rice. Phytonext is another company using new extraction techniques to produce ingredients from citrus peel and tomato waste. The European Union is also funding research to create new ingredients from food waste. The BIORICE project involves extracting starch from rice waste to make ingredients for functional foods, nutraceuticals and cosmetics. Another project, APROPOS, involves taking proteins from salmon and rapeseed waste for cosmetic applications. A Spanish cosmetics firm plans to use the novel extract as a foundation for a new cream product. Such ingredients have already made headway in natural personal care products. The Marks & Spencer department store is using resveratrol from grape waste in its Super Grape skin care products. The grape waste is coming from the production of the retailer's own label wines. The French company Caudalie has built its entire range of natural personal care products from grapevine-based and grapeseed ingredients, such as resveratrol and polyphenols. Organic Monitor research finds the brand leads the French natural cosmetics market; its products are now present in over 30 countries. With the global population projected to reach 9 billion by 2050 and agricultural land becoming increasingly scarce, more investment is expected in creating new ingredients from food waste. ""A recurring theme in the Sustainable Foods Summit and Sustainable Cosmetics Summit [two events organised by Organic Monitor] is 'closing loops' whereby waste materials find a new life in fresh applications. Organisations like TerraCycle have been successful in closing the packaging loop for consumer products; it remains to be seen how soon waste from food streams will find better lives,"" concludes Organic Monitor."
"Blue light, a new target for anti-aging products?","In most markets, the search for anti-aging formulas that can protect the skin against the harmful effects of the exposome remains one of the main focuses. While anti-pollution innovation was recently put under the spotlights, protections against the light spectrum rays (UV rays included) remain the market's main sellers, with over 800 new anti photo-ageing products launched over 12 last months. In addition to UVA, UVB and infrared, the blue light is now viewed as new inflammation factor from which the skin needs to be protected. ""Excessive blue light accelerates the oxidation process, it stimulates the keratinocytes and acts on melatonin causing the apparition of spots,"" explains Gérard Redziniak, PhD, scientific consultant and formulator of dermo-cosmetic products. During the latest edition of the in-cosmetics tradeshow, Greentech, a specialist in biotechnology, was addressing directly this new concern with the launch of Soliberine, a new daily global photoprotective active. According to Greentech, Soliberine is an antioxidant and free radical-scavenger, which stimulates cellular detoxification systems, protects from inflammation, and prevents photoaging. It is derived from Buddleja officinalis flowers, or butterflybush, coming from the Chinese province of Sichuan. Soliberine is reduces the production of free radicals induced by blue light rays (from LED, smartphones, screens ...) and therefore fights premature aging. It also acts on UV-induced lipid peroxidation and inhibits the synthesis of MMP-1 (which degrades the fibres of the dermal matrix) caused by infrared rays. A real booster of natural filters, Soliberine is a real antioxidant and anti-inflammatory solution for sensitive skins. An appropriate response to photo-ageing for ""enlightened"" consumers."
Univar accelerates the pace of innovation,"At the latest edition of the in-cosmetics tradeshow, which was held in Paris from April 12-14, 2016, Univar unveiled an edgy mix of personal care prototypes inspired from urban trends and from the energy of high-fashion looks. The Savage Glamour collection features 15 innovative skin care, sun care, hair care, body care, and make-up formulations designed using Univar's broad portfolio of specialty ingredients from leading global producers, including Dow Corning, Dow Personal Care, Kao, and Naturex. ""We refocused on a smaller number of key global suppliers. With their support we are accelerating the pace of innovation with the aim to provide our customers with innovative solutions every four months,"" explains Matthew Ottaway, Personal Care Industry Director EMEA chez Univar. In practice, all of the proposed formulas were designed using the ingredients provided by no more that 15 manufacturers and available at a global scale. Univar nevertheless succeeded in offering bold and non-traditional products. ""The Savage Glamour trend speaks to the high-energy, beauty-conscious, and glamorous city-dwelling shopper,"" said Arnita Wofford, Head of Marketing, EMEA, Univar Personal Care. The formulations were gathered into two sub-trends: – Savage - Urban Safari, defined by a distinctive, bold, and assertive look with formulas that are feminine and fierce, as well as fun (including: shimmering jelly-jiggle texture to liven up everyday eye shadow; revitalizing LOHAS shampoo; fast-dry air-drying hair conditioner; savagely hot protector spray; biomimetic antipollution skin cream; gel cream formula to nourish city-worn skin; hair-care gel to tame even the wildest curls). – Glamour - Embellished Sugar, with sensual formulations boasting fruity and colourful flavours (including: honey drizzle body oil; raspberry smooth-N-shine syrup leave-in hair serum; pastel marshmallow coloured eye shadow base; cherry bomb lip tint-in oil; butter cream shower frosting; passion fruit exfoliating marmalade; hard candy cuticle barrier; pink sun protection cream). To keep pace with these innovations and meet the needs of its customers worldwide, Univar invests heavily in creating new development and application labs. Two new centres of excellence will open in Brussels and Paris next June, and will be followed by openings in Dubai, Cairo and Milan, in the fourth quarter 2016."
SEPPIC combines eco-design and innovative textures,"SEPPIC's five Beauty Care laboratories throughout the world (USA, Brazil, France, China) have created eight new green formulas. This collaborative initiative has been built around three of the company's CSR [1] policy commitments: decreasing environmental impact, innovating sustainably, making the company socially responsible. ""Indeed, CSR performance is not only linked to naturally derived ingredients,"" explains Nathalie Chevrot, Beauty Care Market Manager at SEPPIC. In order to limit water use in the packaging process and to reduce the carbon footprint, SEPPIC has launched a series of water-free highly concentrated formulas. Water is added by consumers when using the products: – Featherweight. So Concentrated! So Nice! is a concentrated slimming cream that can easily be reconstituted by adding an equal amount of water. The formula contains the slimming active ingredient Rhodysterol S and the polymer SEPIPLUS S to thicken the water-free formula. – Concentrated Foaming Power, a reconstituted and easily biodegradable concentrated formula, rich in active matter (27%), which is a cost-effective solution with the foaming ingredients PROTEOL APL, ORAMIX CG 110 and ORAMIX GB 10 with ideal foaming qualities (very stable, dense, abundant foam). By adding water at the last minute, you can make different foaming products: cleanser, shampoo, and more. Developed by SEPPIC in Brazil, the Jugaad (an Indian term regarding the capacity to do more with less) concept features three minimalist detox body care products made from the same six ingredients (including two active ingredients) to which a new ingredient was added with a cold application process to obtain various sensory textures. Two formulas illustrating the company's commitment to community projects were showcased: – Responsibly Sourced Palm - AntiPollution Cream, formulated with MONTANOV 68 MB and active ingredients with Book&Claim RSPO certification. – Purifying and Hydrating Cream - Inspired in France. Formulated with a ""locavore"" approach with ingredients sourced as near as possible to the company's research laboratory in Castres, in southwest France. The cream is composed of AQUAXYL, a hydrating, sugar derived active ingredient developed by our green chemistry experts; FLUIDIPURE 8G, a biomimetic, purifying active ingredient; the biosourced emulsifier MONTANOV 202; and SEPIPLUS, an inverse latex polymer that provides high stability. SEPPIC also showcased Algae Spaghetti Make Up Remover, a biphasic gel with a green spaghetti shape, formulated with Royal Sugar Kelp (PHLOROGINETM BG PF) a brown alga sourced in Brittany, JUVENESSENCE AD, an extract from brown seaweed, and a SOLAGUM TARA - Agar association to obtain the solid, elastic and stable jellified spaghetti, among other ingredients. Last but not least, the Ecofriendly Deodorant, formulated as a sprayable white emulsion for a deo less polluting than an aerosol. With these illustrative formulas, SEPPIC evidenced the wide array of opportunities now available to formulators to combine ethics and innovation! Two new emollients ranges At in-cosmetics 2016, SEPPIC also unveiled EMOSMART and EMOGREEN, two emollient ranges for cosmetic applications, produced by Total Special Fluids using a patented distillation and purification process, and commercialized by SEPPIC. The two oil ranges (alkanes) are readily biodegradable. ""The inert chemical structure of EMOSMART, from synthetic origin, and EMOGREEN, from plant origin, make them suitable for versatile applications in skin and hair care, make-up, sun care, cleansing. They can be formulated in extreme conditions, for example in formulations with high or low pH, or which are rich in stressful molecules. Compatible with any kind of oils, easy-to-use, EMOSMART and EMOGREEN sweep a broad sensory palette in term of textures,"" says Sabrina Mizaël, Emollients & Emulsifiers Product Manager at SEPPIC. Beyond its full biodegradability, the EMOGREEN range is 100% bio-sourced. It is therefore an alternative to silicone oils for consumers looking for naturalness and environmental respect. For SEPPIC, the development of this new range of ingredients complies with a responsible approach on the long term and meets the requirements of its customers and consumers."
Berkem launches a new range of botanical extracts and floral waters,"At the in-cosmetics tradeshow, held in Paris from April 12th to 14th 2016, Berkem unveiled its new botanical extracts and floral waters range: Botanykem. For the French plant extraction expert, the aim was to places the power of the botanical world at the service of beauty through a wide range of exotic and traditional French plants carefully selected for their reputation or ancestral use, and compatible with any water-based cosmetic formulas. The botanical extracts are obtained from an eco-friendly low temperature extraction process with a short kinetic that extracts maximum molecules while maintaining efficiency. Preservative-free and based on a glycerin and water form, they are a natural source of active molecules (flavonoids, tannins, vitamins, AHA, saponins, carotenoids, and so on). As for floral waters, extracted by distillation and source of aromatic molecules, they will boost formulas by bringing 'active water'. On the occasion of the in-cosmetics tradeshow, these ingredients have been showcased through the French Beauty Routine formulation concept. ""The French woman embodies an inspiring ideal of femininity. She also represents elegance and beauty,"" explained the company. Four formulas were developed. Each one includes two botanical extracts and one floral water: – Waking-up! Toning shower gel. To stimulate the body and the senses thanks to an invigorating scent and a yellowish flashy colour. – Preparing! Soothing serum. To regenerate and calm the skin. – Nourishing! Moisturizing gel cream. To nourish the skin, even complexion and bring a fresh effect. – Protecting! Protective hand cream. Its butter-like texture moisturizes and protects the skin against environmental aggressions. ""The variety of these formulas demonstrates our new range is suitable for hygiene and care products both for the body and the face,"" highlighted Julie Droux, marketing manager, Berkem. Berkemyol potentilla awarded by BSB Berkem's anti-aging Berkemyol potentilla active ingredient scooped the third prize during the BSB Innovation Awards ceremony that took place during this year In-cosmetics in Paris. Since 2003, the consulting company BSB, created by Dr. Jan-H. Riedel, awards every year the best cosmetic product and raw material innovations alongside the In-cosmetics tradeshow. Berkemyol potentilla active ingredient, took third place in the category « Natural products - most innovative raw material ». Obtained by a patented technology, Berkemyol potentilla is a highly purified active ingredient extracted from potentilla rhizomes, rich in stabilized polyphenols. With anti-aging and antioxidant properties, it also has anti-glycation activity clinically proven. In 2015, Berkemyol potentilla already won the Advanced Ingredient Award."
in-cosmetics celebrates record-breaking 2016 edition as global cosmetic ingredients market surges,"The last edition of the in-cosmetics show was the largest edition in its 26-year history. Over three days, 9,726 unique visitors attended the event - a 14 per cent increase on the 2015 event. Visitors hailed from 131 countries, with 63 per cent travelling to France from other European countries, as well as Asia, North America and South America. Covering 16,236sqm (1508 m2), the 2016 show's footprint also increased by 11 per cent, while exhibitor numbers rose from 708 to 784. ""This year's in-cosmetics was busy from the first minute,"" said Valérie Lavallée, Product Manager at Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Hundreds of visitors joined this year's Marketing Trends presentations over the three days. Particularly well-attended were seminars presented by Jamie Mills of Canadean who discussed the opportunities in anti-ageing, and a session on US trends and their local and global impact given by David Tyrrell of Mintel. Delegates were also keen to hear the latest views on green, natural and organic products, dermocosmetology and the use of 3D printing in the cosmetic industry. During the event, the in-cosmetics Group announced a rebrand of its shows. Boasting a new logo, the Europe-based event will now be known as in-cosmetics Global, reflecting its international audience. The organiser also revealed that the 2017 event will take place in London for the first time in over 15 years. Strong market growth Fuelled by the strong demand for good quality and effective cosmetic products, the global cosmetic ingredients market is forecasted to grow at high rates between 2016 and 2026. Changing lifestyle in developing regions of Asia Pacific and Latin America, increase in per capita income, rising awareness about beautification and increasingly urbanized population, as well as ageing population in developed countries, will bring a sea of opportunities to cosmetic ingredients manufacturers and suppliers. According to Kline, performance-oriented multifunctional personal care ingredients have grown the fastest in 2015. ""As formulators are increasingly selecting specialty ingredients to improve the performance of their formulations, the share for such personal care ingredients has increased from 40% to 45% over the past several years,"" explains the market research firm in a recently published Personal Care Ingredients: Global Market Analysis. For example, consumption of preservative boosters, such as caprylyl glycol, glyceryl caprylate, and ethylhexylglycerin, is growing at the expense of traditional preservatives as they also deliver emolliency to formulations. Similarly, PEG derivatives that act as a rheology modifier and also have emulsifying properties have increased over the past few years and are expected to grow further in the future. According to Kline, synthetic ingredients are dominating the personal care ingredient industry, but natural ingredients are increasing their share as consumers are looking for products with such ingredients. The next edition of in-cosmetics Global will take place at London's ExCeL from 4-6 April 2017."
Naturex fights photo-ageing with cherry blossom,"Although sunshine is an essential source of wellbeing and health, especially for vitamin D and endorphin production, it's no secret that repeated sun exposure often results in premature skin aging. Eager to protect their skin against UV ray damages, consumers are increasingly looking for products that deliver performance for a long-lasting youthful look. The human body has developed a group of natural mechanisms to minimize damage to the skin caused by UV radiation. But as time goes by (and with repeated exposure), these repair mechanisms wear down. ""UV-induced inflammation and disorganization of collagen fibrils can occur along with dramatic effects on skin barrier function,"" explains Naturex. To protect the skin against the harmful effects of sunlight, Naturex has used its new generation a patented extraction process - the so called Eutectigenesis [1] - to extract precious botanical actives from cherry blossoms sourced in the heart of Provence, less than 50 miles from the company's French processing facility. The fresh flowers, a by-product of cherry fruit cultivation, are carefully handpicked within the usual cultivation process. These fragile and short-lived flowers can deliver powerful cosmetic benefits especially when they are carefully grown and harvested. Indeed, tests conducted by Naturex shows that Cherry Blossom Eutectys has anti-inflammatory effects, by inhibition of TNF-α release. ""Its anti-oxidant benefits also prevent oxidative stress and avoid any triggering of the DJ1-Nrf2 pathway,"" says the company. Cherry Blossom also has firming and regenerating effects as ""it increases collagen synthesis and inhibits MMP-1 release, which contributes to the repair of the Extra Cellular Matrix."" Last but not least, according to Naturex, the new botanical active helps to improve the skin barrier function by increasing cell-to-cell adhesion and cornification. To showcase the benefits of this new botanical active, Naturex has developed three new applications, which were presented at the in-cosmetic tradeshow: a face fluid, and hydrating face oil and a rejuvenating mask."
Skincare: What strategies against pollution?,"On the eve of the opening of the in-cosmetics tradeshow in Paris (12-14 April 2016), Premium Beauty News is offering its readers a special issue dedicated to cosmetic ingredients. This year again, ingredients suppliers will showcase a wide portfolio of anti-pollution actives among their innovations. According to Mintel, between 2011 and 2013, there was a 40% increase in the number of cosmetics marketed which displayed an anti-pollution claim, in particular in the Asian-Pacific region. Cosmetic ingredient suppliers have adopted different types of strategies, for instance, by isolating the skin from the external environment with a non-occlusive film, or, by banking on powerful antioxidants, anti-lipoperoxidants, anti-glycation agents, or anti-free radical ingredients. Certain companies go even farther by developing turnkey concepts. Furthermore, the development of these new actives requires developing in vivo, in vitro, and ex vivo biological tests adapted to this new anti-pollution trend.

Brazil promotes the Amazonian forest's bio-economy to the cosmetics industry,"The Amazonian forest covers about 4 million km2 throughout the Brazilian territory. As the lungs of the Earth, it shelters the greatest biodiversity, natural resources, and traditional knowledge in the world, and represents a unique potential for identifying new cosmetic actives. Today, Brazil intends to develop a real bio-economy with this heritage. ""We don't just aim to be a source of raw materials, but rather to develop partnerships and knowledge and become the leading supplier of authentic, quality products derived from biodiversity,"" explains Maria Beatriz Martins da Costa, CEO of Planeta Orgânico / Green Rio, a platform that promotes sustainable initiatives and a partner of the project. The SEBRAE project, named ""Cosméticos de base florestal da Amazonia"", gathers Brazilian state representatives of the Amazonian region: Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima, Maranhão, Mato Grosso, and Tocantins. Each of them coordinates the project for the promotion and competitiveness of local and independent ingredient producers, who are real guardians of Brazil's biodiversity. ""About sixty microbusinesses are involved right now, but we estimate they only represent 2% of the potential. So, there still remains 98% to be explored in order to develop,"" declares Aécio Flavio Ferreira da Silva, Director of SEBRAE – State of Amazonas. The project is based on a coordinated policy and the creation of partnerships with institutions and universities. It aims at activating performance levers like the access to knowledge in technologies and innovation, in particular with the validation of extraction techniques, the distribution and the study of production chains, profit distribution, regulatory issues, and the opening to cosmetics markets. During their visit in France, the SEBRAE representatives of the different Brazilian States concerned met their Cosmetic Valley counterparts to discuss a partnership."
Naturex is launching an open innovation program,"Naturex wants to give a boost to the pace of its innovations, with the aim to shape the future of the ingredient industry and to generate 10% sales through new product developments by 2020. The French headquartered supplier of speciality plant-based natural ingredients wants to go beyond traditional partnerships with academic and scientific authorities or simple licensing agreements. ""In a climate of constant change, collaboration and open-mindedness are essential,"" explains Naturex. As part of this open innovation initiative, Naturex intends to partner with new start-up companies whose promising business ideas and technologies may be valuable to the company's development. Partnerships will include extensive advice and mentoring on various levels, (regulatory, legal, logistics, marketing etc.) and Naturex will also make its facilities - for example the analytical or application labs- available to the chosen candidates. Naturex is also planning to establish a Technology Advisory Group (TAG), which will include highly respected technology business actors and/or key academic opinion leaders. Privileged research areas shall include biotechnologies, new extraction and cultivation processes, identification of new botanicals or digital marketing technologies. Doug Klaiber, CEO of Naturex-DBS division, has been asked to set up this Open Innovation Initiative. ""Doug's background as an entrepreneur in innovative ingredients at Decas Botanical Synergies (DBS), a company acquired by Naturex in 2012, make him the ideal candidate for this mission,"" explains the company. Naturex and Mazza Innovation partner for the production cranberry extracts Canadian company Mazza Innovation will use its patented pressurized low-polarity water (PLPW) extraction technology to produce cranberry extracts exclusively for Naturex. The PhytoClean Method is an earth-friendly way to extract bioactives from plants using only water and produces clean, non-solvent-derived ingredients. The green technology efficiently extracts bioactive compounds, including polyphenols, alkaloids, glycosides and specialty carbohydrates that can be used as ingredients for functional foods, dietary supplements and beauty products. ""This open innovation partnership with Mazza Ltd is a great opportunity to bring the global market new natural clean-label ingredients using environmental friendly technologies. As one of the foremost companies in the field of natural healthcare solutions, Naturex is fully aware of the importance of supporting innovative ideas and processes from various sources. The collaboration with Mazza Ltd is one of the first steps in our recently-launched global open innovation program,"" said Olivier Rigaud, CEO of Naturex."
"Exsymol, cosmetics innovation in the heart of Monaco","When it was founded in 1972, Exsymol, an independent family-run company specialized in the design and manufacturing of cosmetic actives, settled in an eight-storey industrial plant located in the heart of Monaco's Fontvieille quarter. It now spreads across a surface of 5,300 square metres divided into four levels, right by the Mediterranean sea, where it produces almost 400 tons of cosmetic actives every year. Enough to make several hundreds of millions of beauty product units! And the site has just been certified to the EFfCI GMP guidelines. This exceptional situation does have advantages, but also a few drawbacks, in particular as regards logistics. ""Settling right in the city centre meant we had to meet stringent anti-pollution standards,"" Christophe Paillet emphasizes. ""As a result, we almost immediately used non-polluting extraction and synthesis processes and green chemistry. And today, we are perfectly in line with the market demand."" Last November, the company actually won the Monaco Eco Club Sustainable Development Trophy, beating 800 other companies. Among others, Exsymol was rewarded for the development of a new active based on the natural by-products made by the neighbouring Grasse perfumery industry. ""Customer expectations have considerably changed,"" explains Christophe Paillet. ""Efficacy requirements have strengthened and are now reinforced by strong environmental requirements. In addition, marketing needs actives to tell a special story."" In order to meet these demands, almost a quarter of the company's employees have been working on research and development. As a result, Exsymol has registered hundreds of patents all around the world, covering over 40 molecules! ""Most of them are new molecules or active families, and not mere composition patents,"" Christophe Paillet specifies. Innovation and scientific requirements lie at the core of the company's DNA, as it started its business in the field of pharmaceutics. In the early 1980s, the discovery of a new family of organic silicon derivatives, silanols, helped Exsymol develop their expertise in glycation processes and intercellular communication. Then, the development of peptoids permanently confirmed their focus on the production of cosmetic actives, which managers had considered very early as a decisive factor in the development of the beauty industry. Today, the company still mainly produces two categories of actives: silicon derivatives, skin structuring elements that normalize its metabolism, and peptide derivatives obtained after conducting in-depth research on the oxidation processes within the cells, which play a role in particular in the fight against glycation, and pave the way for innovations like neurocosmetics. If its culture is definitely scientific-based, with a very strong focus on efficacy, the company knows how to take advantage of its environment by collaborating more and more with local players such as Grasse perfumers. Indeed, Exsymol has been developing an increasing number of natural actives for its core markets in skincare cosmetics: dermocosmetics and cosmeceutics."
Cosmetagora 2016: Natural ingredients make a clean sweep,"BASF stayed focused on anti-ageing products with Neurobiox, a 100 per cent natural-based active that stimulates cell renewal and increases epidermis thickness, while effectively blurring the imperfections of aging skin. Containing extracts of yarrow (achillea millefolium), Neurobiox reduces pores and wrinkles and makes the skin look and feel significantly softer. The ingredients supplier also showcased Speci'Men - the first active ingredient specifically developed for men's high collagen density skin. A 100 per cent natural-based and ECOCERT-approved Baobab leaf extract Speci'Men targets versican, a proteoglycan which is key to the skin's viscoelastic properties and specifically to the health of men's skin, but which accumulates with age, and loses its functionality in men's. Expanscience highlighted two new eco-designed actives from botanical origin: – Macaline, is the company's first active dedicated to body care and body fitting. Derived from maca (Lepidium Meyenii) extracts, the ingredient was designed as an alternative to caffeine in slimming and anti-cellulite body care products. – Pixalia, a ""smart sebum regulator"" derived from an African plant (Gynandropsis gynandra or Cleome gynandra, which is grown in Burkina Faso in compliance with organic farming rules. Monaco's Exsymol presented new clinical data confirming the effectiveness of MeiYanol, an anti-dark circles and anti-puffiness active. This eco-responsible elderflower extract fights against inflammation around the eye, an area which extremely sensitive to the effects of stress, UV, pollution, fatigue and aging. Gattefossé chose to put under the spotlights ingredients awarded in Asia, such as Gatuline Spot-Light, or based on Asian plants (Whu Zhu Yu, Sophora Flavescens, lotus, ginger or bamboo extracts), through a series of formulations inspired from Asian beauty routines. The list of showcased formulas includes: a revitalizing and oxygenating Cloud Mask with an ultra soft texture, for a hydrated and radiant skin, and a Detox oxygen mask with a trendy black appearance and anti-blemish and conditioners actives. For his part, ID bio has presented three illustrative formulations dedicated to detoxification: – D-tox my hair, a protective hair gel formulated with Cell'Intact, an anti-oxidant and anti-pollution active derived from buckwheat, macerated açaí oil (antioxidant and anti-aging effect) and a moringa extract (purifying and depolluting action), – Intense Night Detox, a regenerating sleeping pack formulated with Mag'inTense, a moisturizing active derived from mango, a blueberry extract (anti-aging, toning and revitalizing action) and a titrated extract of Rose Hip (regenerating and energizing action), – Bye bye makeup Detox, a cleansing oil presented as a D phase gel (oil to cream) which emulsifies with water to remove makeup and impurities (Marigold macerated oil, goji extract macerated in oil, orange blossom extract). Imerys Minerals, the world's leading supplier of mineral-based specialties, launched ImerCare Velluto, its latest development for superior coverage in pressed powder foundations. Sourced in the French Pyrenees, ImerCare Velluto derives from natural magnesium silicate. It has been engineered using patented technology to obtain an innovative structure which enhances cohesion and imparts multiple optical and sensory properties to make-up powders. Moreover, ""unlike many mineral powders on the market, ImerCare Velluto can easily be used in wet processes and prevents cracking,"" claims Imerys. Naturex also detailed its six new extracts derived from its innovative Eutectigenesis extraction process that we presented last week. With the concept ""Treasure oils"", Soliance illustrated the potentialities of the various oils and actives of its portfolio through a series of formulas building on the success of oil-like formulations. Among the four formulas presented during the show, the ""Gradual tanning miracle oil, BB oil FPS 20"" featured Soliance's brand new Vegetan Gold, the first 00% oil soluble self-tanner. Last but not least, Silab took an interest in anti-pollution and launched Mitokinyl an active - once again from natural origin - highly concentrated in glucomanates. It restores the synthesis of mitokines, that are negatively impacted by pollution, enhances the stratification and functionality of the skin's external layers and boosts the recovery capacity of the skin barrier."
Naturex extracts plants' most precious molecules,"The new Eutectys collection will be launched at the Cosmetagora tradeshow, which will be held on 12-13 January 2016 in Paris. This new generation of botanical extracts is based on a patented extraction process called Eutectigenesis. This new technology allows extracting active compounds synthesized at the very core of the plant cell. These metabolites, which are not always fully soluble in water or in lipid phases, are stored and transported by plants in a third type of liquid phase, the so-called natural deep eutectic solvents (NaDES). According to Naturex, ""this breakthrough eco-extraction technology offers a natural alternative to conventional solvents and makes it possible to capture the plant cell's most precious metabolites, in order to obtain biomimetic extracts with augmented phytoactive profiles and improved performance."" The Eutectys collection is composed of six high-definition extracts including, among others, olive leaf, saffron flower, and horsetail, all well-known for their restoring and anti-ageing properties, and available for skin and hair formulations. ""Nature-inspired products have been setting the trend over the last few years as cosmetic formulators are constantly looking to expand the category in a sustainable way. NaDES are an innovative way to answer market demand,"" explains Naturex. For this world premiere, Naturex has signed a partnership with Scionix, a company responsible for marketing the new solvent systems developed by Professor Andrew Abbott and his research group from the University of Leicester, United Kingdom, who pioneering research on deep eutectic solvents. In addition to this licensing agreement on the patents granted to Professor Abbott and his team, Naturex and Scionix will join forces on fundamental and applied research in the field. ""The use of deep eutectic solvents holds huge potential for the cosmetic category as well as numerous other industries. We are convinced that this technology is a game-changing innovation, and these joint research efforts in collaboration with the team that discovered NaDES technology will ensure rapid and successful results,"" says Antoine Bily, Naturex's Head of Research & Development."
Croda unveils new data on conditioning efficacy for a broad range of hair types,"Variations in hair morphology can cause performance differences in ingredients used in hair care products, making testing on different ethnic hair types to show efficacy very important. Croda's new data reveals its Crodazoquat MCC [1] conditioning active restores hydrophobicity to hair, improves hair aesthetics and delivers a consumer-perceivable feel improvement on both natural and relaxed African hair. Crodazoquat MCC had already been proven to be effective on Caucasian, Asian and Brazilian hair types. Croda's ingredient should therefore help the company's customers overcome the challenges formulating for different ethnic hair types that have unique hair characteristics. "" A need for multicultural solutions has arisen globally , including in developed markets, such as the US, that are becoming increasingly diverse. Crodazoquat MCC is designed to be effective across multiple ethnic hair types- a truly multicultural conditioner for a diverse world that is progressively connected,"" said Denise Costrini, Marketing Manager – Hair Care, Croda North America. In order to best assess performance on African hair, a conditioner containing Crodazoquat MCC was salon tested on consumers with natural African hair and relaxed African hair. Attributes that are particularly important to address African hair needs were added to the standard list of attributes used to evaluate other hair types: Breakage, Density, and Ease of Styling. The conditioner containing Crodazoquat MCC outperformed the commercial African hair conditioner benchmark on dry aesthetics for both the natural and relaxed hair, satisfying the consumer needs for anti-breakage, desired density, and ease of styling."
Chronobiology: Which actives to get the skin back into the right rhythm?,"The skin goes through different phases in 24 hours. During the day, it defends itself against external aggressions like the wind, the sun, the cold, or pollution. At night, it regenerates. It was evidenced that the highest number of cell divisions occurs between midnight and 1am, and the lowest between 12pm and 1pm. The skin's blood flow is at its maximum between 11pm and 4am, which makes it possible to provide nutrients and remove toxins. And it is between 7pm and 11pm that desquamation on the superficial stratum corneum is the most important. In addition, the skin has receptors for melatonin which, on top of their role as circadian synchronizers, are excellent at trapping free radicals. In the late 1990s, researchers highlighted the existence of the 'Clock' gene as a central regulator for monitoring the circadian clock. According to Neil Astles, Marketing Manager for biofunctional actives at Ashland Specialty Ingredients, ""more than 20% of the expression of a tissue's genes depends on circadian regulation"". Given these observations, cosmetic active suppliers have been developing various types of molecules. Some of them target circadian genes and help them resynchronize, like Chronocyclin®, by Exsymol, which can partially reproduce the effect of sun radiation in relation to the expression of circadian genes. The chrono-peptide studied on reconstructed epidermises kept in the dark shows an activation of the Clock and Period1 genes according to a circadian rhythm similar to the activation initiated by UV radiation. The Chronocyclin® product is an anti-aging active that stimulates defence and cell regeneration physiological activities. As for Nocturshape™, by Lipotec, it focuses on circadian genes Clock and Bmal1 and on the regulation of the production of nocturnin, a protein that acts at night and enhances both the accumulation of lipids in the cells and lipogenesis. Nocturshape™ has firming and slimming properties. Silab's Circagenyl® is rich in lindera oligo-alpha-glucans and helps fight against the desynchronization of the human fibroblasts circadian clock by acting on the expression of the Clock circadian gene. The effects measured are comparable to those obtained with a light therapy treatment and boosted if the two routes of administration are combined: application of a topical product with 3% of Circagenyl® associated with light therapy sessions. The results show increased skin hydration, tone and elasticity, smoother microrelief, and a more radiant complexion. Another way to tackle chronocosmetology is to act on the synthesis of melatonin. With Prodizia®, Sederma manages to rebalance the synthesis of this hormone by glycation-stressed fibroblasts. Prodizia® contributes to visibly reducing the signs of fatigue by repairing and protecting the skin from the damages caused by glycation, leaving the skin rested, just like after a good night's sleep. Lastly, another method consists in helping the cells keep their energy so they can better resist against daily aggressions. Active molecules mainly act on mitochondria. Seppic's Sepitonic M3 is a combination of minerals essential for the balance of cells and organic anions, for a chrono-energizing, anti-free radical, intercellular communication-boosting effect. The will to develop chronocosmetology is gaining more and more importance, especially with the emergence of Sleeping packs. These products from Korea offer the perfect solution to counter the effects of lack of sleep on the skin, and promise to reproduce the virtues of a good night's sleep, even if it only lasted a few hours. ""In Asia, it is said that the first three hours of sleep, called 'Golden Time', are the most important for the skin. In Korea, there is also an expression, meaning 'well-slept face', to refer to a beautiful face. It is conveyed by the face of a sleeping woman"", explains Florence Bernardin, expert in Asian cosmetics trends and founder of the Information & Inspiration marketing intelligence firm. Vichy and Garnier have developed sleeping packs, respectively with Idealia Skin Sleep and Miracle Sleeping Cream. But other sectors like the slimming segment are also targeting the sleeping body, more sensitive to fat storage, as can be seen in particular with Phytocéane's Chrono Night Express Contouring Bi-Gel. With these products, no one will ever worry about the consequences of the legal time change on the skin, and even less about short nights!"
Berkem wants to help skin to face its daily environment,"As a barrier between the environment and our body, skin is constantly exposed to many aggressions (UV, cold, pollution, etc.) that weaken it. All day long, the environment put a severe strain on skin, which has to permanently adapt itself. Thus the day skin faces and protects against various stresses and the night it recovers and regenerates. ""Constituting the first defence line of our body, skin requires special attention and appropriate care,"" explains Berkem. To help the skin in this mission, Berkem leverages its expertise in plant extraction and its wide portfolio of polyphenol-rich actives. ""These powerful antioxidants are important for protecting the skin, especially against external stress, as well as for enhancing its regeneration."" In order to exemplify how it is possible to help the skin to protect itself, Berkem has presented a new concept called Global 24h at the latest Beyond Beauty Paris tradeshow. The concept combines two skin cares: one for a day protection phase and one for a night repair phase. The two products have opposite textures but complementary functions for an uninterrupted defence: – Protect'day care: an airy and light day cream which contains the ""Berkemyol Potentille"" active ingredient. These stabilized potentilla polyphenols provide the skin with necessary elements to effectively fight against oxidative stress and defend itself. – Repair'night cream: a night cream with a rich and creamy texture. ""Ko'zen active ingredient is a quince leaf extract that soothes damaged skin, decreases inflammatory reactions and calms irritation. The skin is regenerated and revitalized,"" claims Berkem. The Advanced Ingredient Award honours Berkem Berkemyol Potentille, a highly purified active ingredient rich in stabilized polyphenols (> 95%) extracted from potentilla rhizomes, scooped the Advanced Ingredient Award, which was given to the most innovative skincare ingredient at Beyond Beauty Paris 2015 [1]. Polyphenol molecules are known as being unstable, especially OPCs when highly concentrated. Berkem has patented a method for stabilizing polyphenols which consists to protect phenolic functions thanks to ester functions. The active form of stabilized polyphenols is released at the heart of the epidermis due to the action of esterase enzyme naturally found in the skin. ""With this unique technology, active molecules are protected until application on the skin,"" highlights Berkem."
Symrise brings the freshness and benefits of plant juices to cosmetics,"Some years ago, fruit smoothies became a trend, with people appreciating the quick and convenient vitamin boost they offered. Now, the trend has evolved to green smoothies, which offer alternatives to the standard fruity options, chock-full of green leafy components and vegetables. This ""green smoothie"" trend originated in the US and the UK and is now spreading around the globe. Consumers associate green smoothies with fresh, natural and healthy benefits provided in an easy-to-consume format. Tapping into this trend, Symrise's Cosmetic Ingredient Division is launching a range of freshly pressed plant juice varieties that can be incorporated into cosmetic applications. Gentle manual pressing directly after harvesting ensures the preservation of the plant's valuable ingredients. Their properties have been tested in-vitro. For instance, state-of-the-art in-vitro screening has confirmed that fresh plant juices have especially strong antioxidant capacities as well as soothing and moisturizing properties. For ginger, additional skin-brightening properties were confirmed. ""Customers will benefit from a unique and natural product range, backed-up by substantiated data from efficacy studies and supported by market insight and formulation concepts. The plant juice varieties are suitable for a vast number of cosmetic applications and beyond, e.g. hair, face and body care,"" claims the company. An additional plus is the local and organic farming that meets the increasing consumer demand for natural sourcing. The plants are harvested near their production site to obtain the freshest, most unadulterated and most natural juice possible. Dandelion, horsetail, melissa, ribwort and stinging nettles are grown and harvested in Germany. A ginger juice from Sri Lanka rounds out the portfolio. Also most of the plants for Symrise plant juice varieties are grown organic and fully traceable back to the field; the Ecocert certification is underway."
Bulgaria relies on geographical indication to protect its rose oil,"The ""Bulgarian rose oil"" is an essential oil obtained by distillation of rose petals from Rosa Damascena. The specific distinctive qualities of the Bulgarian rose oil are its rich and lasting aroma, pale yellow-green colour, as well as a balanced composition of volatiles and hydrocarbons. Since October 2014, the protected geographical indication (PGI) acknowledges the fact that these characteristics are closely related to the geography of the area and differentiate it from rose oil produced in other parts of the world. Furthermore, the quality of the Bulgarian rose oil is guaranteed by specific requirements for processing of the rose petals within 10-12 hours after being picked. In addition, the flower picking has to be done very early in the morning and only open buds shall be picked. ""We go out very early as the roses must be picked while there's still dew on them. Then the yield is highest,"" says Totka Hristova, one of an army of workers on the foot of the Balkan Mountains in the damp cool of the early morning. ""We only pick the fully open roses that are most oil-giving, the others we leave for tomorrow,"" she adds. About 3,500 kg of rose flowers are required to produce 1 kg of rose oil. Bulgaria and neighbouring Turkey are the world's largest producers, before Iran, Morocco, India and China. The temperate climate and alluvial soils at the South of the Balkan mountain provide the ideal conditions for growing the best plant, the Damascus Rose, which is originally from Persia. The delicate extraction process is almost unchanged since the days of the Ottoman empire in the 17th century. The petals are taken immediately to distilleries, where they are mixed with water and boiled in vast metal vats. The vapours are then condensed and redistilled to separate the oil. But the process requires vast volumes of petals. Bulgaria's annual production of about 1,500 kilograms of rose oil requires 5.25 tonnes of petals, grown on 3,800 hectares (9,390 acres) of plantations, mostly in the valley around the central Bulgaria town of Kazanlak. The buyers — from Europe, the United States and, increasingly, Asia — are generally firms that make intermediary fragrance products which they then sell to fragrance brands. Surprisingly, the oil — which contains over 370 components and has no synthetic alternative. Because of its high price, rose oil has often been faked. But savvy Bulgarian producers have now found a way to guarantee its authenticity. Last October, after a nine-year application process, producers managed to get the name ""Bulgarian Rose Oil"" registered on the list of EU products of protected geographical indication and designation of origin. To be granted the certification, producers must prove their flowers come from a traditional rose-growing region in Bulgaria, that they observe strictly the distillation process and that their product has the essential chemical and physical characteristics specific only to Bulgarian rose oil. ""This is a huge success for the whole sector,"" Bulgarian distillery owner and one of the people behind the registration, Filip Lissicharov, told AFP. ""The quality of the rose petals is good and we expect that the quality of the rose oil this year will be equally high,"" Lissicharov said. Distillers expect a good year even if not a repeat of the bumper harvest from last year, which was the best in the past 20 years."
"Naturex launches Sapnov, a natural and soothing surfactant","A few months after having entirely rebuilt its plant in Chile (the former production of Chile Botanics, acquired in January 2014) and increased its production capabilities by 10, Naturex is launching Sapnov, a 100% water-extracted natural surfactant derived from quillaia (Quillaja saponaria), an evergreen tree native from Chile. ""This ingredient meets the demand for both sulphate-free, mild surfactants and biodegradable ingredients in finished products,"" explains Stéphanie Puel, Business Unit Director for Personal Care. A non-ionic and water-soluble surfactant, Sapnov performs well versus synthetic surfactants such as sodium laureth sulphate (SLS), claims Naturex. Sapnov is miscible with classical solvents, works in a wide range of pH and shows good stability even at high salt concentrations. Besides the fact that this foaming agent is 100% natural, the extract has other proven benefits that cannot be found in common surfactants. Indeed, various studies have shown that quillaia extracts have soothing and dermo-purifying properties. Tested in ex-vivo oral epithelium, Sapnov decreased the expression of interleukin 8 by 52% (interleukin 8 is a well-known marker of inflammation). To showcase the various possibilities of Sapnov, the company has developed several applications that were presented at Naturex's booth atin-cosmetics 2015: cleaning products for blemish-prone and sensitive skins, sulfate-free soothing shower gel and scalp soothing shampoo, baby wipes and natural toothpaste. Since the acquisition of Chile Botanics, Naturex has been working with the local team to upgrade the quillaia extraction and purification facilities, which are based close to quillaia harvesting areas in the south of Chile. This enables the group to offer consistently high quality, COSMOS approved extracts every time, produced sustainably from an abundant source. Indeed, the quillaia is sourced from a 8,000 km2 forest, which is sustainably managed. The resource is strictly controlled by the Chilean National Forest Corporation (Corporación Nacional Forestal, CONAF), which regulates the quillaia harvest. A key asset for the future if we consider that according to Euromonitor International, non-ionic surfactants are expected to enjoy one of the strongest CAGRs in shampoos between 2013 and 20181."
in-cosmetics celebrates 25th anniversary with record-breaking attendance in Barcelona,"The latest edition of the in-cosmetics trade show, which was held on 14-16 April 2015 at the Gran Fira exhibition centre in Barcelona, Spain, hosted 710 exhibitors from around the world with 105 companies exhibiting for the first time. ""This large number of first time exhibitors not only points to a thriving sector, but also the expanding influence of in-cosmetics, as the show cements its position as the place to be seen in the cosmetics ingredients industry,"" the organisers explain. The show also welcomed a record 8,578 unique visitors, the highest number for any event outside of Paris, in the exhibition's history. This also represented an increase of 18 per cent on last year's show in Hamburg. There were a large number of international visitors, but the show successfully tapped into the local market with domestic Spanish visitors accounting for 27 per cent of the total visitors. The show also saw the return of the popular Innovation Zone, which allows visitors to get up close and discover the latest product launches and formulations. Alongside the Innovation Zone were free-to-attend ""Live Demonstrations"" providing in-depth knowledge about innovations on offer from manufacturers exhibiting at the show. The in-cosmetics Awards Ceremony took on an even greater significance this year with the introduction of a special award as part of the shows 25th anniversary celebrations. The 25 Years of Innovation Award was presented to Sederma, recognising its Matrixyl ingredient as the ingredient which has had the greatest impact on the personal care ingredients industry over the past quarter century. For the first time, the show's Innovation Zone Best Ingredient Award was split in to two categories, with Induchem receiving gold in the Active category for its Brightenyl product, a first generation active ingredient designed to be activated, upon application, by the skin microbiote. Dow Corning was awarded gold in the Functional category for 3901 Liquid Satin Blend, a skincare fluid which creates a long-lasting feel of lubricity while delivering a stringy yet novel structure. The Green Ingredient award, in association with Organic Monitor, was given to Laboratoires Expanscience for Aqualicia, a natural '3-in-1' active ingredient which entraps, distributes and limits water loss of the skin. ""I'm very pleased that our 25th anniversary show has been such a success. We have had such great feedback from both exhibitors and visitors and I'm sure in-cosmetics Paris 2016 will prove to be the most successful show in the exhibition's history,"" said Cathy Laporte, in-cosmetics Exhibition Manager. The 2016 edition of in-cosmetics will take place in Paris from the 12-14 April 2016.

Production of ylang ylang flowers under threat in Comoros?,"It is a tropical yellow-flowered tree, which is highly sought after for essential oil used in prestige perfumery. ""It (the oil) is a complex chemical, violent and strong"" that ""enhances the high quality ingredients"", said Jean Kerléo a former perfumer at Jean Patou and creator of the world's largest scent archive - the Osmotheque at Versailles, France. ""It pairs well with jasmine and is complementary. It's used a lot in floral perfumes, where it is the base product in the bouquet. I myself used it in 'Sublime' for Patou which I created in 1992 and which still exists,"" he adds. The French introduced the tree on the island of Reunion in the 1700s and in the early 1900s its cultivation spread to the nearby islands of Comoros and Madagascar. ""If I had to describe the smell, it's jasmine, but more heightened, and stronger. It's almost fruity. You get a whiff of pear and coconut to start with, accompanied all the while by a floral scent. As the fragrance settles, there's a hint of carnation, a hint of clove,"" said Christopher Sheldrake, Chanel's director for perfume research and development. The ylang ylang oil, along with vanilla and cloves, brings precious foreign exchange to Comoros, boosting its frail economy. Each year, the archipelago of three islands produces between 30 and 40 tonnes of this essential oil - ahead of Madagascar - mainly on the island of Anjouan, home to 350 distilleries. Exports of ylan ylang essential oil amounted to about 1.5 million euros (US $1.6 million) in 2013 and 2014, which represents 11 per cent of Comoros' revenue. Ibrahim Ahamada, an economist at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said the flower remains ""a potential source of income and significant currency for the country"" provided there is ""serious reorganisation of the sector"". Actually, to increase production, farms need to improve the quality of the plants, investment is needed in infrastructure and measures to tackle deforestation must be put in place. A revamping of the sector begun last year with international funds. For several years, governmental authorities and agronomists are raising the alarm bell over threats on the ylang ylang flower. This tree is grown somewhat like a vine and requires constant maintenance. Without regular pruning, the trunk grows too high for farmers to access the flowers. However, Comorian plantations of this tree now have over a hundred years of age. ""Despite the economic importance of the ylang ylang essential oil, there is surprising no plant breeding program,"" said agronomist Céline Benini of the University of Liège, Belgium. Deforestation is also a major problem: forest cover has shrunk by 25 per cent in 20 years. Given the patchy electricity supply, even the distillation of the ylang ylang essential oil in old alembics requires a lot of wood. There are also few people willing to take on the backbreaking tasks of pruning the plants and picking between 25 to 40 kilogrammes of flowers a day in high season. A job paying about 50 euros a month. As a consequence, farmers sometimes encourage their children to try their luck in cities, where basic salaries ranges between 50 and 90 euros per month, but the lack of jobs available in the country often lead them to migrate overseas. Perfumers are well aware of the difficulties and threats on the production of this strategic plant, in particular because the case is also not isolated. ""Today, there are about a hundred critical raw materials in perfumery, for which a minimum of stability in terms of price and quality must be ensured. Many of these materials come from countries plagued by rural depopulation, where plantations are being abandoned for good as people flow towards large cities. In India, Laos, Uganda, Haiti… we have been investing in programmes to support rural populations and help them grow their cultures, while ensuring them stable incomes and prospects in the long term. We make sure these people get a stable income so they can plant, invest, and innovate. This is designed to be a long-lasting organization,"" said Olivier de Lisle, who is in charge of the Fine Fragrance Department at Firmenich, in a recent interview to Premium Beauty News. As far as Comorian ylang ylang is concerned, Chanel says it is trying to get its suppliers to plant their own trees for firewood in order to meet the needs of the essential oil extraction. The French perfumer also says it is committed to providing better conditions and fair wages for the workers on these plantations."
in-cosmetics 2015 opens its doors today in Barcelona,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, the in-cosmetics tradeshow is opening its doors today at the Gran Via Exhibition Centre in Barcelona, Spain - the fourth largest cosmetic and toiletries market in Europe. The show will host more than 680 manufacturers from over 40 countries and the organisers are expecting more than 8,000 visitors for the personal care industry. In a market driven by constant innovation and increasing demand for added-value products, suppliers of cosmetic ingredients simultaneously address consumers' search for more sustainable and more natural ingredients and highly efficient actives, in particular when it comes to counteracting the effects of ageing and pollution - two of the biggest global trends currently. ""For the past 25 years, scientific advances, whether they concern a better understanding of skin physiology, biological mechanisms, fundamental discoveries such as the ones on stem cells, genetics and epigenetics have drained most of the innovations among brands of finished products and ingredient suppliers,"" explained Karl Lintner founder of Kal'idées, a consulting firm to the cosmetic industry, and teacher of cosmetic chemistry at the ISIPCA school of Versailles. Following the success of last year's focus on Brazil, in-cosmetics 2015 will emphasises Turkey and the Middle East. A special pavilion will play host to ingredients manufacturers from Turkey and bordering regions with manufacturers such as Surya Kimya - one of the biggest makers and suppliers of cosmetic ingredients in Turkey. Euromonitor International will examine the region's key trends and statistics, while Mintel focuses on Middle Eastern Beauty Rituals and products from the region. Furthermore, a Turkey & Middle East Product Trail will highlight unique products and projects from or inspired by the region. The event will also put a special highlight on the global Halal cosmetics and personal care market, which is expected to grow by at a CAGR of 13.43% over the period 2013-2018, according to Research company TechNavio. This strong growth can be attributed to both the rise in the world's Muslim population and continued strong demand from Malaysia and Indonesia - the two largest Halal beauty markets in the world. In 2014, the three in-cosmetics events welcomed over 16,000 visitors in Germany (in-cosmetics 2014), Brazil (in-cosmetics Brasil) and Thailand (in-cosmetics Asia). This looks set to grow by up to 20% this year in part due to the launch of in-cosmetics Korea, being held in Seoul between 15-16 June 2015, and the growth of in-cosmetics Brasil (in Sao Paulo between 30 September - 1 October 2015), which held its founding show in 2014. ""Korea is an exciting development,"" said Lucy Gillam, Director, in-cosmetics Group. ""Alongside our Brazilian show, it is part of our vision to expand in-cosmetics into recognised but growing local markets. In Brazil and Korea, in-cosmetics is the only event to exclusively target the personal care industry, offering a focused and unrivalled opportunity for companies to connect with the global marketplace. We are confident that our 2015 exhibitions will break visitor and attendance records.""

Ashland takes advantage of circadian rhythms to beautify the skin,"In vivo tests have revealed that certain biophysical and physiological parameters of human skin change in accordance with circadian rhythms, the biological processes based on about 24-hour rhythms. Thus, skin temperature, sebum production, pH, electrical charge potential (capacitance) and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) appear to follow the circadian clock. [1] Recently, researchers from Beiersdorf also highlighted the importance of the skin cells' internal clock. Based on these findings, Ashland has developped Chronogen YST, a new extract derived from yeast protein that may help to maintain skin's cellular rhythm and guard against UV damage. ""Over the past 10 years, research has shown that skin cells are partly regulated by the 24-hour rhythm,"" said Neil Astles, marketing manager for biofunctionals, Ashland Specialty Ingredients. ""More than 20 percent of gene expression in a given tissue falls under circadian regulation. [2] This regulatory function within skin cells, however, may be disrupted by external factors. Chronogen YST promotes expression within clock gene proteins in vitro to resynchronize optimal skin function."" Actually Ashland explains that clock genes are now recognized as key regulators that play a vital role in the expression of many genes, including some that reside in skin cells. Modulating clock gene expression for beneficial effects on skin would therefore represent a major breakthrough in cosmetic science. A case in point can be seen in the area of UV exposure. At night, cells undergo DNA repair and replication procedures based partly on the expression of clock genes within a closed loop system. In contrast, at the beginning of the day, DNA needs to prepare for UV exposure with antioxidant enzymes. This 24-hour cycle can be disrupted by UV exposure and, accordingly, impede cell regeneration. [3] Ashland clinically tested Chronogen YST [4] at 1 percent. For instance, a small double blind study against a placebo cream with 10 volunteers ranging in age from 23 to 38 years indicated a measurable improvement in skin turnover in vivo after 21 days (two applications per day) with topical cream containing 1 percent active Chronogen YST. ""Using a small concentration of the Chronogen YST in skin creams and serums may help to resynchronize the skin's circadian clock,"" concluded Neil Astles. Ashland recommends using Chronogen YST in day-time formulations to help skin boost its natural defenses against UV-induced damage; night-time formulations to boost the skin's own processes in skin regeneration; anti-aging formulations with claims on circadian rythms and formulations to help maintain the skin's ""synchronized"" internal clock. Ashland demonstrated the technical merits of Chronogen YST, which is compliant with China's cosmetic rules, at the Personal Care and Homecare Ingredients (PCHi) exhibition held on 12-14 March in Guangzhou, China. Other suppliers such as Silab or Lipotec have also recently proposed new ingredients based on circadian cycles."
SEPPIC launches an antioxidant derived from macroalgal cell culture,"The first cosmetic active derived from the new technology developed by BiotechMarine, a SEPPIC subsidiary specialising in bioactive natural substances, extracted from seaweeds and marine plants, to cultivate macro-algal cells in the laboratory, Ephemer is a gametophyte extract from Undaria Pinnatifida, a brown seaweed known as wakame in Japan and harvested in Brittany by the company. The interest of gametophytes is that they accumulate anti-oxidant cells, but their availability in the ocean is very limited as they constitute an ephemeral stage in the life cycle of the seaweed. The in-vitro cultivation of macroalgae cells allows to stabilise the gametophytes and to multiply them in order to use their properties for cosmetic purposes. According to SEPPIC, the extract thus obtained showed its antioxidant efficacy in both the short- and long-term uses. ""Ephemer protects the skin, after 24 hours by acting on the mitochondria, causing momentaneous reduction of free radicals. After 8 days, Ephemer preserves mitochondrial DNA, which is essential for proper mitochondrial function,"" claims SEPPIC. This property has been confirmed through in-vivo testing. ""After 28 days, the skin shows a better ability to fight free radicals, versus placebo, a cause of skin aging. After 56 days, the skin's micro-relief has markedly improved compared to placebo,"" adds SEPPIC. SEPPIC's in vitro macro-algal cells culture technology is offering a new marine source of active ingredients. Indeed, ""Macroalgae cells have the amazing ability to transform light and minerals into organic molecules,"" explains Erwan Le Gélébart, R&D Project Manager at BiotechMarine. Actually, since the rich marine biodiversity contains thousands of macro-algae species - for instance, the sea surrounding France's Bréhat archipelago, in front of BiotechMarine's headquarters, contains hundreds of species - the new technology is now making it possible to create a bank of macro-algal cells from the many species whose compositions and effects on skin have yet to be explored."
Naturex: a new collection of natural extracts for a perfect complexion,"The collection is based on three converging formulation axes: treating exfoliation, skin colour disorders and inflammatory reactions. The first action is intended to renew the surface of the skin with a high concentration in AHAs, which Naturex draws from African hibiscus and cranberry extracts. The tests performed on these flower and fruit acids show better efficacy results than the usual glycolic and lactic acids. The hibiscus extract is available as a colourless powder or in a liquid version, with a concentration in actives reaching 55%. The inhibition action of tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for dark spots and other imperfections, results from the extracts of balm, rhodiola, and liquorice, which act directly on the melanin synthesis mechanisms. Ultimately, soothing liquorice and schizandra extracts are used against the chronic inflammation that causes redness. The brightening effect is also ensured by the escin molecule, which was showcased at the last Cosmetagora show. Escin is a new element in the NAT purity range, and 95% of this pure molecule is extracted from horse-chestnut. It acts on the skin's venous tonicity, and provides both radiance and an antioxidant action as a face treatment, and an anti-cellulite and anti-heavy legs action as a body care product. ""We have noticed consumers increasingly seek natural and pure, plant-derived molecules. This type of ingredients guarantees the cosmetic product's efficacy on the skin,"" comments Yohan Rolland, Personal Care Market Manager. Naturex has incorporated its ingredients into a standard formula to highlight their properties. The company has chosen to ride on the lightly-textured night products wave from Korea with Brightening Night Jelly, a gel-cream with a fluid texture to be applied at night which provides a high quantity of actives, while allowing the skin to breathe for a radiant complexion in the morning. This formulation should appeal to Asian markets and prepare for the arrival of this new trend on the European market."
BASF develops new customized anti-aging solutions,"Presented on the occasion of the latest edition of the Cosmetagora tradeshow, which was held on 13-14 January 2015 in Paris, BASF's new anti-ageing formulation concept targets the specific needs of French beauty products consumers, which were identified in a large sample of beauty products users. Actually, BASF has conceived a series of formulas adapted to six consumer archetypes derived from the results of a study carried out with TNS Infratest on 1,223 French women aged 25 to 75. All of them were regular users of anti-aging face care products, applying them at least once a week, and were also decision-makers or co-decision-makers when it came to brand purchases. The women were put into one of six groups based on their personality, emotional needs and purchase motivations, as opposed to external factors. Each group (""Energetic"", ""Perfect"", ""Professional"", ""Protected"", ""Authentic"", and ""Creative"") therefore reflects the predominant needs of women. The ""Authentic"" consumer, for example, places special emphasis on products that employ natural ingredients and are environmentally friendly. She strives for natural-based, effortless beauty. ""As a result, her anti-aging face care products need to be straightforward - with no need to fuss or spend a lot of time in front of the mirror,"" the ingredients supplier explains In order to illustrate the solutions that can be offered to these women who favour likable, trustworthy brands offering good value for money, BASF has tailored the ""Authentic Boost"" formulation a dry yet nourishing anti-aging oil containing natural-based ingredients and combining easy skin hydration with non-greasy, velvety smoothness. Another illustration of this typology, the ""Professional"" consumer is described as disciplined, conservative, down-to-earth. She sees beauty as a science. ""Accordingly, she is drawn to technically advanced products that live up to high scientific standards and to brands associated with innovation."" In response to this consumer's personality profile, BASF has developed the formulation ""Beauty Manager"", a repairing anti-aging night cream. According to the company, the soft gel cream helps accelerate the skin's natural regeneration by means of biological and enzymatic exfoliation during sleep. Two active ingredients boost its efficacy: Neurobiox™, an achillea millefolium (commonly known as yarrow) extract that resynchronizes cellular neuro-dialogue and X-Pressin™ C, an advanced exfoliating system. The contained combinations of emollients and emulsifiers give the gel cream a fluffy texture and provide a cooling and luxurious feeling."
